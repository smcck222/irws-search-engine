I'm feeling inclined to kid you people and say that for once I'm agreeing with 
you. 
</P>
<P>
That was an insightful section dealing with Prop. 140 (Perspectives on Term 
Limits, Commentary, Nov. 13). Do note that we're Republicans here. 
</P>
<P>
We voters must have just gotten a taste of how frustrating it is to be a 
legislator, in that the things you vote for have predictably both good and bad 
results. Things just can't be simple, no way.

Willie Brown's threat to punish the handful of Assembly members who supported 
Prop. 140 by making the first cuts in these legislators' staffs aptly 
demonstrates the vindictive and business-as-usual approach to government which 
has Californians so fed up with Sacramento. Term limits may not be the panacea 
for California's legislative ills, but it might do us all some good to 
ultimately be rid of Brown.

I read with a good deal of amusement Pete Schabarum's defense of Prop. 140 ("A 
Change That Opens State's Political Doors," Commentary, Nov. 13). No doubt 
Schabarum is well-qualified to describe the perils arising from the seniority 
of elected officeholders -- here's someone whose snout and hoofs have been in 
the public trough for several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in an ironic twist, Schabarum has anointed himself as the keeper of the 
public conscience, purse and morality -- with a good deal less justification 
than those in Sacramento he has chosen to attack. Schabarum has now served five 
terms as a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. I would like 
to know why Schabarum was an active participant in promoting the same type of 
empire-building, self-perpetuation and irresponsibility in the county that he 
decries in the Legislature.

BANKING REFORM IS NEEDED, BUT BE CAREFUL HOW YOU DO IT; 
</P>
<P>
DEREGULATION IS A FALSE GOD; RESTRUCTURING IS THE BETTER ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bank reform will be a major legislative concern next year. We support reform 
but recommend that Congress carefully weigh each proposal. Taxpayers are wary, 
and rightly so, given the savings and loan debacle. The foundation of banking 
-- and thus of the economic security of the nation -- is safety and soundness. 
Changes should be cautious, controlled and subject to strict regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, it is time for comprehensive reform. Federal regulations have 
for some time put the banking industry at a competitive disadvantage 
domestically and internationally. And Congress' failure to address these issues 
puts banks under even greater pressure today. They must compete with a variety 
of lenders, including nonbanks like, say, Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. Financial 
deregulation has come at the expense of banks, which have been largely 
prohibited from entering the securities, insurance and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The best reform, however, is not a question of deregulation of the industry but 
of restructuring. "We need fundamental structural reform," Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas Brady said earlier this week. He's right, but any reform must hold the 
banking industry to a high degree of accountability and responsibility. That 
was not the case with the S&amp;L industry. Hindsight shows what a tragic 
blunder that was. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are in far better shape than S&amp;Ls were when they encountered problems 
in the 1970s and 1980s. The great majority of banks are profitable, thanks to 
more stringent federal requirements. Nevertheless, pressure for reform is 
growing stronger because of increasing stress on the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp., which insures bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Banking is a riskier business than it was a decade ago. Between 1943 and 1981, 
the greatest number of banks that failed in any one year was 17 (in 1976). But 
in the 1980s, the number of failures each year has risen dramatically, reaching 
a peak of 206 in 1989. This has taken a toll on the FDIC insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing competition has reduced the industry's share of financial-sector 
assets to 27% in 1987, down from 33% in 1980. Bank portfolios have changed, 
too. The ratio of loans to assets has grown from 22% in the 1940s to 58% in the 
1980s. Meanwhile, real estate loans account for 38% of a bank's loan portfolio, 
while commercial and industrial loans -- once the sole domain of banks -- 
amount to only 31%. 
</P>
<P>
Tackling bank reform involves psychology as well as practicality. Current laws 
that tie bankers' hands stem from the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which was 
enacted to separate commercial banking from investment banking during the 
Depression. Banks were prohibited from entering the securities business because 
of questionable lending practices that helped fuel the stock market frenzy 
preceding the 1929 crash. The purpose of Glass-Steagall was to create fire 
walls, in effect, around banks. They were put under the supervision of the 
Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC was created to protect bank depositors, and 
maximum interest rates were set on all forms of savings and time deposits. A 
system with little competition evolved whereby banks concentrated on commercial 
lending, S&amp;Ls on home mortgages and brokerages on investment banking. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary 
Control Act, perhaps the single most important piece of banking legislation 
since 1933. It drastically affected every type of financial institution. FDIC 
coverage was expanded to $100,000 per account. Interest rate ceilings were 
phased out. This opened new opportunities to a variety of lenders -- except for 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fed began chipping away at the fire walls around banks in 1987 when it 
allowed three bank holding companies to underwrite municipal revenue bonds and 
mortgage-related securities. Then the Fed went further, allowing J.P. Morgan 
&amp; Co. to be the first bank holding company to underwrite stocks. The Fed 
was right to begin, however cautiously, the process of modernizing commercial 
banking.

PERSPECTIVE ON FREE TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
A HAND FOR MEXICO, A SLAP FOR US; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S NOT TRUE THAT U.S. WORKERS WILL REAP SECONDARY BENEFITS. MEXICAN WORKERS 
WON'T BE HELPED MUCH, EITHER.

A U.S.-Mexico free-trade agreement would confirm present trends -- opening 
Mexico's economy to U.S. investment and the relocation of U.S. manufacturing to 
Mexico. Already, half a million workers in Mexican maquiladora plants make 
products for export to the States. Mexican rules restricting foreign (i.e., 
U.S.) ownership of factories have been nearly abolished. U.S. automobile firms 
now operate more technologically sophisticated plants in Mexico than they do at 
home. Much of California's furniture industry has relocated to Tijuana. 
Japanese and Korean consumer electronic firms have gained easier access to U.S. 
markets by establishing low-wage (but high-quality) factories in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, and partly as a consequence, the U.S. manufacturing sector shrank 
from 23% of domestic employment in 1979 to 18% last year. This employment loss 
can only grow with free trade. So why does the Administration pursue an 
agreement? 
</P>
<P>
Advocates offer two rationales, neither of which stands much scrutiny. First, 
they claim that free trade would open Mexico's market to American sales, 
creating economic growth at home. They speak of "80 million consumers" in 
Mexico, warning that without free trade, Japanese or Europeans, not Americans, 
could capture this enormous market. But low-wage markets are no bonanza. 
Mexican wages average $1 an hour and have been declining. "Consumers" earning 
only $1 an hour don't consume very much beyond the basic necessities. 
</P>
<P>
Expanded free trade will probably further depress Mexicans' purchasing power 
because it will restrain traditional government industrial-protection policies 
and foster maquilarization of wages throughout the economy. It is no accident 
that wages in Mexico's maquila export sector (as low as 60 cents an hour) are 
substantially below wages in firms serving Mexico's domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
Free-trade proponents claim that 80% of every peso paid to maquila workers is 
spent either in U.S. border communities or on U.S. products. Thus, they argue, 
U.S. manufacturing in Mexico benefits us as well. This makes little sense. When 
a $10-an-hour job in Detroit is replaced by a 60-cents-an-hour job in Tijuana, 
it is ludicrous to suggest that U.S. workers benefit because 48 cents is then 
spent in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Free-trade supporters also argue that moving basic manufacturing to Mexico 
supports higher-paying jobs at home. "Every time you put a plant in Mexico, it 
creates new jobs in the United States because we are the suppliers, the 
transporters and the managers of the plants in Mexico," said Commerce Secretary 
Robert A. Mosbacher Sr. in Los Angeles last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Mattel Corp. recently announced that it would expand its toy assembly in 
Mexico, employing several thousand more Mexican workers. This, it claimed, 
would benefit California because the assembly operation would depend on skilled 
injection-molding jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
This argument is contradicted by two decades of experience. Almost invariably, 
manufacturers claim that only basic assembly will relocate. Yet just as 
invariably, once Mexican basic manufacturing is running smoothly, 
higher-skilled jobs follow. Why shouldn't they? Mexican workers are no less 
skilled than their American counterparts (and robotization is more advanced in 
some Mexican manufacturing). Mexican universities and technical schools 
graduate increasing numbers of managers, engineers and skilled workers. And 
there are substantial inventory, transportation and quality savings gained by 
locating supply and design operations close to assembly plants they support. 
</P>
<P>
The maquila sector now hosts high-tech firms as well as assembly plants. 
Westinghouse, for example, makes the F-16's guidance systems in Chihuahua. When 
Mexico's border industrialization zone was established 20 years ago, its main 
activity was sewing garments. Today, 39% of all maquila plants make 
electronics; apparel represents only 9%. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, we are pushing a free-trade agreement more for political than 
economic reasons. The Bush Administration is more responsive to manufacturers 
seeking Mexico's low wages than to their U.S. workers facing layoff. It is more 
open to financing ventures that seek Third World manufacturing profits than to 
competing claims of a starved infrastructure and technological advance at home. 
The Administration also is responsive to retailers who expect low-cost imports 
to generate higher profits. While that's true in the short run, declines in 
U.S. purchasing power resulting from the loss of high-wage manufacturing could 
spell doom for mass retailers. It is ominous that the average hourly wage in 
the United States has declined almost 10% since 1980, due in part to 
replacement of high-wage manufacturing by service and retail employment. 
Farsighted retailers can take no comfort from this statistic, whatever 
temporary benefit they gain from cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, characteristically more interested in foreign than 
domestic policy, sees an opportunity to bolster Mexico's President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, who has staked considerable prestige on the quest for free 
trade, hoping it will stimulate U.S. investment in Mexico and remove 
temptations that U.S. investors might feel to send excess capital to developing 
markets in Eastern Europe. However, both Bush and Salinas would be well advised 
to pay more attention to the benefits of higher wages in both nations, and less 
attention to short-term profits gained from competitive impoverishment.

IF IT'S SCARCE, WHY IS IT STILL CHEAP?; 
</P>
<P>
WATER: BY KEEPING THE PRICE ARTIFICIALLY LOW, WE REDUCE THE INCENTIVE TO 
CONSERVE WHILE ENCOURAGING EXCESSIVE USE.

<P>
After a four-year drought, our state's residents, primarily in metropolitan 
areas, are being urged to voluntarily cut back their water consumption to 
forestall mandatory rationing. To help achieve a 10% "voluntary" cutback in Los 
Angeles, policy-makers have imposed penalties for daytime watering, hosing down 
driveways, unrepaired leaks and serving unrequested water in restaurants. 
"Drought-busters" have been dispatched to find and cite violators. 
</P>
<P>
If water is so scarce, why is it priced so cheaply? Around the state, and 
particularly in agricultural areas, water is priced below its replacement cost. 
In the Imperial and San Joaquin valleys, for example, water is sold for 10% to 
20% of what it takes to replenish supplies. Pricing water below cost results in 
anomalies such as the profitable growing of hay in Death Valley and the recent 
planting of thousands of daffodil bulbs in Ridgecrest, a community in the 
Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Pricing water by its cost would offer several advantages over the current 
approach of hoping for conservation while encouraging overconsumption. First, 
rather than relying on a few central planners to concoct ways of promoting 
conservation, a higher price would give many consumers an incentive to come up 
with ways to cut consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Second, for detecting and punishing consumers who "waste" water, pricing has no 
equal. From aqua-addict Harold Simmons of Montecito, who used nearly 10 million 
gallons in 1989 to keep his lawn lush, to the farmer who sprays her crops with 
sprinklers (a process in which most of the water evaporates) and even to the 
politician who throws away the broccoli on his dinner plate, the price tool 
could successfully find and punish all water wasters in proportion to their 
offenses. Why rely on snitching neighbors and/or a roving team of 
drought-busters to find and fine all the owners of leaking toilets in Santa 
Barbara when the price mechanism is so effortless and thorough?. 
</P>
<P>
Third, setting a price for water that more accurately reflects its scarcity 
today will more quickly encourage the development of substitute sources, such 
as desalination, tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, in contrast to a rationing system that requires users to cut back a set 
amount, price does not discourage the development of new products and 
industries. A new industry cannot be created when water is allocated based on 
past consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a scheme requiring all users to cut back by the same 10% does little 
to encourage consumers who could make drastic reductions. Nor does such a 
scheme take into consideration consumers who cannot readily reduce their water 
use -- perhaps because of a new baby in the house, or increased demand for a 
company's product. 
</P>
<P>
We shake our heads smugly at the long lines for meat, bread and apartments in 
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. But what we have yet to realize is that 
when it comes to water, our policy is the same as theirs. We keep the price 
artificially low, thereby reducing the incentive to produce while encouraging 
excessive use.

THE ROMANCE IS OVER; THE ANGLO PARTNERSHIP PALES; 
</P>
<P>
THATCHER: SHE WAS A SYMBIOTIC ALLY TO REAGAN AND THEN BUSH; SHE SIMPLY LOST HER 
OWN PARTY'S ALLEGIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER STOTHARD, Peter Stothard is the U.S. editor, based in Washington, of 
the Times of London.

<P>
President Bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the Persian 
Gulf on Thanksgiving Day. He heard the news of Margaret Thatcher's resignation 
as he celebrated the holiday in the Saudi desert -- and it clearly came as a 
shock. In the State Department, too, it came as a shock. Americans who had come 
to take Thatcher for granted during her 11 years of power were not prepared for 
her passing. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her 
narrow failure to retain the premiership outright on Tuesday. The feeling 
everywhere was that Thatcher always stuck to her word. So no problem. Pass the 
turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's friends all over the world had reckoned without the British 
Conservative Party, which had looked at the opinion polls, the bad economic 
news and an unpopular new tax and smelled a loss at the next election. They had 
reckoned without the hatred for the flamboyant Michael Heseltine among the 
middle-ranking party figures who risked losing their jobs and future prospects 
if the unpredictable "Tarzan" came to power. 
</P>
<P>
It was an extraordinary scene in the palace of Westminster on Wednesday night 
as one by one her own Cabinet members trooped sheepishly into Thatcher's office 
and told her, in their chosen code, that they "couldn't support her over the 
weekend" in the second round of secret balloting on the party's leadership. 
Therefore, if Heseltine was to be beaten, it had to be by someone else. After 
"sleeping on it," as one of her closest advisers put it, Thatcher reluctantly 
concluded that she had to go. Thus did the toughest fighter for shared British 
and American values since Winston Churchill become the first prime minister to 
be forced out of office by the Conservative Party since the failed war leader 
Neville Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
When George Bush recovered from his Thanksgiving surprise, he was generous in 
his praise. Two years ago, his words would have rung hollow. The President 
began his term in office without much trust in her. He had seen the influence 
she exerted over Ronald Reagan and was keen to be seen as his own man. He had 
heard her doubts over the pace of German reunification and the integration of 
Europe, and had been persuaded by his advisers that she stood against the 
United States' best interests. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, however, that changed. At the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis, 
the President deliberately sought Thatcher's analysis. It was her assessment of 
the threat to international security posed by Iraqi aggression that, according 
to British and American sources, set the moral framework for Operation Desert 
Shield. The pivotal moment was when she fielded press questions about Iraq on 
Bush's behalf in the Colorado mountain garden of the U.S. ambassador to 
Britain, Henry Catto; that marked the public turning point. She was able to 
articulate what Bush sensed was right. And he was able to defer to her without 
embarrassment, seeming almost gentlemanly in allowing her to go first. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is unlikely to reach such a rapport with any of her three potential 
successors. Heseltine is an exceptionally powerful orator, but it hard to see 
that helping the tongue-tied American President. Douglas Hurd, the urbane 
foreign secretary, is an English James Baker; the President already has a James 
Baker. John Major, the chancellor of the Exchequer and Thatcher's own choice to 
succeed her, may have views very close to Bush's. But he is mild-mannered, 
slightly clumsy and, although widely liked and admired by his friends, is 
almost wholly without international experience. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is no longer the Anglo-American "special relationship." It is 
Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan who will go down in history as Washington 
and London's "last romantics." They were the ones who would each ditch their 
closest friends in order to support the other: Reagan when overruling Jeane 
Kirkpatrick's objections to the Falklands campaign, and Thatcher when blocking 
her own right wing's protests at the U.S. bombing of Libya from British bases. 
They shared the conviction that communism could be rolled back -- and she 
helped persuade him that Mikhail Gorbachev was a man who could be trusted. The 
powerful enunciation of that belief -- and its eventual vindication -- may be 
the last great achievement of the special postwar Anglo-American alliance. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush and Margaret Thatcher had something more simple in common, a 
pragmatic relationship of mutual respect and support that benefited both. 
</P>
<P>
British policy toward Iraq will not change suddenly under a new prime minister. 
The doubling of the size of the British gulf force on Thursday attempted 
emphatically to prove that. But as time goes by, Britain's allies will find 
that many certainties have passed along with Margaret Thatcher. If seductive 
deals emerge to save the face and the atomic-weapon factories of Saddam 
Hussein, her steadfastness will be sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
And if Europe becomes more inward-looking and protectionist, blame those who 
booted out the prime minister whose final words to her Cabinet were, "It's a 
funny old world." Her memoirs deserve a more dignified title.

'TEACHING AMERICA' LESSONS

<P>
Teach for America is a valuable program that should be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the many arguments against the program, the advantages outweigh the 
defaults. 
</P>

Some critics argue that the cost is too much. Like any business, one must 
invest in order to succeed. Others have disapproved because of the inexperience 
of the teachers. This may be true, but a with all new teachers, time will ease 
the tensions and facilitate the teaching process. 
</P>
<P>
As a student, I believe that the earlier people finish their educations and 
enter the professional fields, the more zeal and love they (will) have for 
their jobs.

TUTORS NEEDED FOR LITERACY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article, "Catching Up on Their Reading" (Nov. 15), outlining the problems 
of illiteracy in our community, did an outstanding job of profiling typical 
cases of people caught in this terrible trap. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is another side of the equation that is equally troubling but 
not as well publicized. 
</P>
<P>
This is the plight of many of our foreign-born neighbors, who not only can't 
read but face the additional difficulty of being in a strange country, unable 
to communicate at the most basic level (because) they can't speak English. 
</P>
<P>
Just as there is help for illiterate Americans, there is help for our 
non-English speaking friends. California Literacy serves these people through 
local nonprofit groups staffed by dedicated volunteers. The need for more 
tutors is constant -- the more tutors we have, the more adult students we can 
teach. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor training workshops are held regularly. No knowledge of the students' 
native languages is necessary: The entire course is taught in English. It 
should be kept in mind that helping people learn our language benefits us as 
well as them. Communication is indeed the answer to many of our problems.

LISTEN: CALVIN KLEIN MOVES IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COMPILED BY THE FASHION STAFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does Calvin Klein think of Orange County women? "They're young, 
attractive, American-looking and healthy," the designer told us Wednesday, just 
a few hours after his first West Coast store opened in Costa Mesa's South Coast 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Klein's memories go back about three years, when he introduced his Eternity 
fragrance to Nordstrom customers in the area. "I was so impressed with the 
clientele. The women who came to meet me were my customer. They wear the 
clothes." And now, nothing can come between them and their Calvins. 
</P>
<P>
The designer says "all the collection clothes, accessories, jeans and casual 
sportswear I make for women" will be in the 5,000-square-foot 
mahogany-and-cream store. There is also some casual wear for men. SINGING THE 
BLUES: Levi Strauss &amp; Co. has been very vocal on MTV recently, thanking the 
802,000 consumers who called the San Francisco-based blue jean company's 800 
number to sing the praises of 501 button jeans. Dan Chew, Levi's marketing 
manager, says 13 of those consumers, ranging from "ball-shaggers and 
gravediggers to surf heads" were culled from the phone lines to be featured 
players in a $20-million series of highly visual, Spike Lee-directed 
commercials, which encourage wearers to "button your fly." 
</P>
<P>
THE SHOW GOES ON: Despite the cancellation of its women's wear designer awards 
earlier this year, the California Mart's annual West Coast menswear 
designer-of-the-year award will be presented. Richard Tyler and Emil Rutenberg 
head the list of nominees for this year's "Marty" awards, to be presented at 
the Men's Fashion Assn.'s opening-night cocktail party Jan. 17 in Los Angeles. 
Other nods on the prestigious list include David Cline, last year's winner of 
the Rising Star designer award; Mossimo Giannulli of Mossimo Sport and Sandra 
Serebreni of ETC.

BALMAIN PLAYS HOLLYWOOD BALL: Deborah Raffin has $250,000 worth of couture 
gowns from the house of Pierre Balmain as part of her costume wardrobe for the 
miniseries, "Night of the Fox," scheduled to air on the Fox Network beginning 
Monday. Generally, that much money could buy a trunk full of clothes, but at 
couture prices, it might buy only as few as four or five dresses. According to 
Lisa Shawn, Balmain's New York spokesperson, the company agreed to do the show 
because it wants greater name recognition in the United States. "You know, in 
his heyday, Balmain was known as the couturier to queens." 
</P>
<P>
PROFIT SHARING: Two aspiring fragrance barons in Los Angeles, Fred Hayman and 
Herb Alpert, are redistributing the wealth this holiday season. With the 
purchase of any of Hayman's "273" fragrance products at Nordstrom, $2.73 will 
be donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, benefiting children with 
life-threatening illnesses. Alpert has teamed up with the American Forestry 
Assn. to create Listen/Global Relief. With any purchase of "Listen," Alpert's 
fragrance, a tree will be planted in the purchaser's name or any name the buyer 
requests.

COLLECTION KEYS ON SEPARATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
DISTANT FRIENDS BY GREG JOHNSON: ONTARIO REVIEW PRESS, $17.95, 169 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Virtually every one of Greg Johnson's haunting stories in "Distant Friends" 
explores and confronts a traumatic form of separation. The gulf opened between 
old friends Lex and Marty in the final story of the collection is only the most 
obvious of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Lex has no home, exactly, merely a home base in Boulder, Colo., which is not 
quite the same thing. He earns a modest income from a small apartment house and 
keeps his trust fund for luxuries. Marty has moved to a restored brownstone in 
New York, where he is overwhelmed by responsibility to his family and clients. 
Marty is a successful accountant, a devoted husband, and the father of a 
chronically ill child. 
</P>
<P>
Marty's little girl is in desperate straits when Marty phones his old buddy. 
Lex, as always, is available. You could actually call him a professional 
friend, since his only job seems to be providing support and good cheer. On 
this occasion, atypically, he drags his feet, driving cross-country instead of 
flying, stopping in Philadelphia for a one-night stand with a woman as 
fancy-free as he is. By the time he gets to the hospital, it's too late. The 
friendship between the two men, having survived time, distance and tremendous 
personality differences, is finally undone by death. The man who has grown up, 
married, and lost a child no longer has anything in common with Lex, whose main 
problem is how to spend his inheritance. Still, Lex doesn't quite get home 
free. "Later he would think that his sudden urge for flight, for distance, had 
shocked him as much as anything else that had happened." 
</P>
<P>
In "Passion Play," Randall Trenner is also an escapee, but while Lex has done 
neither harm nor good, Randall's case is more complex. He's just lost his job 
and the woman with whom he lives is pressing for marriage. When he opens a 
letter from the handicaped sister he left behind in Georgia, he impulsively 
decides on an overdue visit. He returns to Georgia to find Melissa no longer a 
sweet tractable child but a willful, unmanageable woman of 40, complaining of 
ill-treatment and general anguish, neither so disabled that she cannot assert 
herself nor competent enough to live on her own. The elderly aunt left in 
charge can no longer cope. Melissa imagines herself in love with a married man 
who apparently beats her, and finally, sadly, Randall agrees that an 
institution is the only answer. Before this unnerving story ends, however, he 
finds a more satisfactory solution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Metamorphosis" takes separation to its extremity. We encounter a terrified 
performer about to go on stage; we soon realize that he is a female 
impersonator suffering from a terror that has caused a previous mental 
breakdown. Here the theme of the outsider is carried to a Grand Guignol finale, 
a border only tentatively approached in the other stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Grieving" returns the reader to a more familiar world, in which a recent widow 
meets a strange, waif-like girl at her husband's grave. Curious, the widow 
befriends the mourner, only to discover that the girl was her husband's lover, 
and that the quiet, well-ordered life the couple had enjoyed was a sham. By the 
time this brief interlude is over, the widow's vision of herself is irrevocably 
altered and her superficially happy marriage revealed as a pathetic charade. 
</P>
<P>
"A Summer Romance," like "Crazy Ladies," deals with mental illness. Like the 
physical suffering in "Distant Friends" and "Wintering," psychosis serves the 
same purpose, providing the author with his most dramatic metaphors. Though the 
plot is classic, the resolution is contemporary, turning "A Summer Romance" 
into a tragicomedy of modern manners. Johnson's ironic, disturbing stories 
speak directly to the generation reaching middle age -- post-rebellion, 
post-selfishness, post-prosperity, post-everything.

<P>
LIGHT MEAT AND DARK MEAT AND DRUMSTICKS WITHOUT END; 
</P>
<P>
LEFTOVERS: WITH TURKEY, IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH WHAT'S LEFT OF THE BIG MEAL THAT 
COUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK RODGERS, Rodgers is the author of The Turkey Cookbook, published this 
month by Harper Perennial. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wherever a big, beautiful turkey is roasted for a family get-together, there is 
usually a worried cook wondering what to do with leftovers. On the other hand, 
I know one family in California that loves leftover turkey sandwiches so much 
that Mom doesn't bother cooking a traditional Thanksgiving meal anymore. 
Instead of toiling away over endless side dishes, she simply serves her turkey 
with sandwich fixings and relaxes in front of the television football game with 
her sports-minded gang. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite old-fashioned turkey and hot gravy sandwich includes a layer of 
leftover stuffing and a dab of cranberry sauce. This concoction will always 
hold a place in my heart . . . and around my waistline. 
</P>
<P>
But I also enjoy updated versions of the traditional turkey sandwich. Try a 
grilled Cheddar cheese sandwich on whole-wheat toast, but add slices of roast 
turkey and tart green apples. For a great brunch dish, make French toast 
"sandwiches" stuffed with white meat turkey slices and serve with Grand 
Marnier-spiked cranberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey salad, prepared either as a sandwich or with fresh vegetables or fruit 
on a cold platter, is another way to make leftovers disappear. To save 
calories, I recommend using half low-fat plain yogurt instead of all 
mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
As many people are turning to low-fat, low-calorie turkey to replace the red 
meat in their diets, I offer Turkey Muffaletta. The traditional dish is usually 
made with cholesterol-packed pork salami. My version of this New Orleans 
specialty can be quite a mouthful -- it's most often made on an entire round of 
French bread with a spicy layer of tangy olive salad. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the old leftover out: the casserole. Cheesy Tomato and Turkey 
Bake, for instance, is a tasty, homespun timesaver -- you don't even have to 
simmer up a tomato sauce. Some of the casserole recipes in your files (turkey 
divan, turkey croquettes or turkey a la king) may call for a classic white 
sauce. These can be lightened up by replacing half of the butter called for in 
the white sauce with oil. Or you could use all margarine, and substitute 
low-fat or skim milk for any cream in the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Aztecs domesticated the turkey hundreds of years ago, it makes sense 
to use your leftover turkey for Mexican dishes. Turkey in mole sauce is one of 
the glories of Mexican cuisine. And imagine how easily you could whip up turkey 
tacos, enchiladas, burritos or tostadas. 
</P>
<P>
Another solution is to go Asian: Stir-fry a batch of Chinese vegetables, then, 
just at the last minute and only to heat through, toss in leftover turkey that 
is cut into strips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHEESY TOMATO AND TURKEY BAKE 
</P>
<P>
1 pound tubular pasta (elbow macaroni or penne), cooked 
</P>
<P>
2 cups cooked turkey, cut into 1-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
1 (35-ounce) can peeled Italian tomatoes, drained and chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 pint low-fat cottage cheese 
</P>
<P>
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese 
</P>
<P>
4 green onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried marjoram 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into tiny pieces 
</P>
<P>
Toss together cooked pasta, turkey, tomatoes, cottage and Cheddar cheeses, 
green onions, marjoram, salt and red pepper flakes in lightly buttered 
13x9-inch baking dish. (Casserole can be prepared up to this point, covered and 
refrigerated, 4 hours ahead.) 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle bread crumbs over top and dot with butter. Bake at 350 degrees until 
casserole is bubbling and top is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Makes 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TURKEY MUFFALETTA 
</P>
<P>
1 cup pimiento-stuffed green olives, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 medium celery stalks, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 small sweet red pepper or 1 (7-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon capers, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
1 (10-inch) large round Italian bread or 4 large crusty rolls 
</P>
<P>
8 slices cooked turkey (about 1 pound) 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces provolone cheese slices 
</P>
<P>
Combine green olives, celery, sweet red pepper, garlic, capers, vinegar, 
parsley, olive oil, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes in medium bowl. Mix 
well. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour, preferably overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Cut bread in half lengthwise. Scoop out about half of soft center from both top 
and bottom. Brush bread with some of olive salad marinade. Place turkey slices 
on bottom of bread. Spoon olive marinade over turkey. Place cheese on top and 
press bread firmly over filling. Cut into wedges to serve. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Muffaletta can be made up to 4 hours ahead, wrapped tightly in plastic 
wrap and refrigerated. Bread will soak up dressing, giving new but wonderful 
texture to sandwich.

THE HOME COOK: IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT CRAB CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you love crab cakes, American history and miles of green-grass horse 
country, head for Baltimore. I did the other week. My mission: to check out the 
variety of crab cakes and come home with a recipe for the best. 
</P>
<P>
One of the interesting variations I tried had a base of mashed potatoes instead 
of mayonnaise (it was too thick and clumsy for the delicate crab; mayonnaise 
seems just right). Others were doctored up with dry Sherry, mustard, bits of 
sweet red and green pepper, chives or Worcestershire sauce. Most crab cakes had 
hot pepper sauce or a hint of hot, spicy pepper. The flavor of crab should not 
be suppressed with other assertive, mundane ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous crab restaurants in Baltimore is Obrychi's, which has 
been serving crab, clam and shrimp to a steady stream of customers since 1949. 
We arrived at Obrychi's at lunch time, and the dining room was already filled 
with diners unabashedly eating food with their fingers and wiping their chins 
constantly. The room was cheery, noisy and communal. 
</P>
<P>
We first ordered crab cakes. They came moist, sweet and golden, with French 
fries, coleslaw and catsup on the side. It was hard to fault the cakes, but the 
flavor was slightly flat. A few drops of lemon juice helped, but this was not 
the recipe that I came for. 
</P>
<P>
Our next order was for Obrychi's famous steamed hard-shell crabs. Before they 
arrived, the waitress covered our table with brown wrapping paper and brought 
us each a little wooden mallet and a paring knife, plus a stack of paper 
napkins. In a few minutes she arrived with a dozen smallish crabs and dumped 
them on our table. They were dark red, streaked with brown from the Old Bay 
spice mixture in which they are steamed. The crabs are layered in pots with a 
shallow amount of water and vinegar, sprinkled with salt and spices. The pot is 
tightly covered and the crabs are steamed about 20 minutes. They were the best 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
But I was looking for crab cakes, and I finally found the ones I was looking 
for at the Lexington Market. This is the oldest market in America, a gigantic 
two-story building that has myriad food stalls, ready-to-eat everything, and 
stands with fresh produce, poultry, pork and fish. We went to Lexington's on 
Saturday around noon, and it was teeming with the regulars who shop, eat, meet 
friends and have their weekly spree. 
</P>
<P>
Faidley's is a food stall with one continuous line of waiting customers. No 
wonder people wait: The crab cakes here were incredible -- moist, creamy, full 
of the taste of crab. 
</P>
<P>
A large sign on the wall said that Faidley's makes the crab cakes with backfin 
crab, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard and saltine crackers. I have tested and 
rearranged amounts of these four ingredients, and the following recipe is an 
example of the Faidley crab cake. Serve these cakes with coleslaw, bread and 
butter and ice-cold beer. Grapefruit Ice and a cookie will neatly finish the 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BALTIMORE CRAB CAKES 
</P>
<P>
1 cup mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
2 cups saltine cracker crumbs 
</P>
<P>
2 cups cooked crab meat 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
Lemon wedges 
</P>
<P>
Hot pepper sauce 
</P>
<P>
Combine mayonnaise and Dijon mustard in mixing bowl. Stir until well blended. 
Add 1 cup cracker crumbs and crab meat and mix well. 
</P>
<P>
Spread remaining 1 cup cracker crumbs on large piece wax paper. Divide crab 
mixture into 8 equal portions and pat each into ball. Gently flatten each ball 
into 3-inch round, about 3/4-inch thick. Lightly dredge each round cake with 
cracker crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Fry cakes over medium heat until 
golden on each side. Serve hot with lemon wedges and hot pepper sauce. Makes 
about 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GRAPEFRUIT ICE 
</P>
<P>
3/4 to 1 cup sugar (depending on tartness of grapefruit juice) 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup water 
</P>
<P>
3 cups freshly squeezed grapefruit juice 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar and water in saucepan and boil until sugar is dissolved, about 1 
minute. Cool. Stir in grapefruit juice. Pour into ice cube trays or bowl. Cover 
and freeze. Serve in little glasses or bowls. (If ice is frozen in bowl, let 
stand few minutes to soften slightly for easier scooping.) Makes about 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cracking Crab 
</P>
<P>
The method of cracking and extracting crab meat from the shell is simple. Place 
the blade of a paring knife across the middle of a crab leg and give the top of 
the blade a crack with a mallet. The blade cuts through, and then you can 
easily pry the meat out with the tip of the paring knife.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: MCFOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unless your television viewing is limited to "Nova" and "Face the Nation," 
you've seen a lot of those fast-food commercials where they sell new entrees 
the way other companies do cars. Chain land is a happy world, where clowns do 
handstands and Mr. Beef growls, carefree guys play piano on the back of flatbed 
trucks and confused young men wax Rod McKuen-style about the sandwich they had 
for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
People who eat junkfood on commercials are all slim and prosperous, and the 
food looks delicious. Even if you never eat chain hamburgers it's easy to feel 
less than hip when you know neither how a Chilito is folded nor how a McRib 
tastes. But there's no need. 
</P>
<P>
A McRib sandwich may not be the foulest thing I've ever put in my mouth, but it 
is certainly among the most dishonest, as if Japanese restaurants actually 
served you those plastic replicas of ramen and tonkatsu they display in their 
front windows. If the chain's former experiment with the stuff is any 
indication, the McRib will outsell all other ribs in the country put together 
by a factor of 10. 
</P>
<P>
The thing appears to be a rib sandwich all right, if a bit genteel, the kind 
that might be served with a schooner of beer in one of those downtown 
restaurants with sawdust on the floor. But what look like spareribs seem cast 
out of dry, gray pork, chopped and factory-pressed to resemble a miniature rack 
of spareribs: no bones, no taste. The skin of the "ribs" is toughened and 
brown, and it is impossible to tell whether the meat has been fried, griddled, 
baked or bombarded with radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Where you expect a crusty French roll, you are given a puff of gummy balloon 
bread shaped and colored to look just like a crusty French roll, right down to 
intimations of crisp texture and a "browned" crevice in the top where a real 
roll is slashed before baking. (Its only real purpose seems to be as a tool to 
keep your hands clean.) 
</P>
<P>
Where you might expect barbecue sauce, even on the order of that sweet stuff 
they serve with Chicken McNuggets, there is a syrupy, chemical-tasting mess 
whose sweet-sulfur top note stays with you half an hour after you have left the 
restaurant. If it weren't for a sprinkling of minced onion, there wouldn't be a 
natural flavor in the sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
And McRibs aren't any cheaper than real food -- for the $4.09 McDonald's 
charges for a McRib pack, you could have a tasty home-cooked biryani at a 
Pakistani cafe down the block from my local branch, or the fish-lunch special 
at a Japanese grill, or two cheese pupusas and a tamarindo drink at a 
Salvadoran place, or three courses of Filipino food at any one of three lunch 
counters within two minutes walk. 
</P>
<P>
Jack in the Box's Sirloin and Cheese Sandwich seems a little closer to its 
inspiration, if only because the original Philly cheesesteaks were pretty 
downscale fast-food themselves. There's another gummy simulated roll, this one 
would-be Italian, and a layer of semi-melted "Swiss" cheese. The heart of the 
sandwich is paper-thin sheets of beef, browned, tasting strongly of black 
pepper. The sandwich tastes a lot more like a Jack in the Box Chicken Supreme 
than it does like a genuine fiery-hot, melty Pat's Steak, but if you're not 
expecting too much, it's not completely horrible. 
</P>

Burger Buddies are more innocuous, cheerily packaged analogues to the tiny, 
steamed White Castle burgers the Beastie Boys used to rap about, two Buddies to 
the package. (I've always thought the best thing about White Castle was its 
slogan, "Buy 'em by the sack," but go figure.) They pretend to be nothing but 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, when Burger King introduced the burgerettes as "Burger Bundles" a 
few years ago -- three to a package! -- too many little patties fell through 
the grill and immolated themselves in the flames below, so the Buddies are 
joined at the waist, a single dumbbell-shaped patty on a pasty, dumbbell-shaped 
bun. It's a lot like a mushier version of the regular Burger King cheeseburger 
-- sort of buttery-tasting, dominated by the sharpness of catsup and pickle 
slices, overlaid with the faint, acrid flavor imparted by Burger King's 
"flame-broiling" -- but configured so you can split the burgers apart like a 
Popsicle, making the thing ideal for two not-too-hungry buddies in the mood for 
an average fast-food burger. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell has always been better at inventing neologisms than inventing food -- 
I have a friend who never quite got over the death of the Enchirito -- and the 
new items always seem to be recombinations of the same half-dozen ingredients. 
Taco Bell seems to be competing mainly on the basis of price these days (a huge 
percentage of their entrees cost less than a buck). The new Chilito turns out 
to be a burrito with very little stuff in it, so little that it falls in flat 
folds, unlike the puffy envelope of an actual burrito. This involves wrapping a 
very small amount of pasty fast-food chile in a very large flour tortilla, the 
sort of thing an impoverished family might do to stretch a tiny bit of meat. A 
Chilito may not kill you. But it also won't make you smarter, or better-looking 
. . . or happy.

WINE: BONNY DOON: THE WINES BEHIND THE MAN; 
</P>
<P>
TASTING NOTES: EVALUATING RANDALL GRAHM'S IDIOSYNCRATIC PRODUCT. HE'S TRYING TO 
REPRODUCE THE GREAT BUT LITTLE-KNOWN WINES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can't get a fix on Randall Grahm until you taste his wines, and even that 
won't help until you understand his goal: replicating the great but 
little-known -- and marginally understood -- wines of Southern Europe in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Grahm gives his products clever, outrageous names and package designs, which at 
first glance might seem sheer lunacy for a premium-wine producer trying to get 
double-digit prices for obscure wines. And while many wineries publish a 
newsletter for their customers, none is like his Bonny Doon Winery newsletter. 
An issue might consist of an arcane text with philosophical overtones, 
depth-charged with puns, or possibly a rambling parody of Proust or Pynchon or 
Poe. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked your latest newsletter, even though I wasn't very good in philosophy," 
I said recently when we met to look at his latest wines. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither was I," he said with a nod and a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is Grahm's philosophy of wine making that keeps him at the forefront of 
the new-wave wine makers. That philosophy emphasizes grape growing above 
wine-making skills. "Wine making is the trivial part of the equation," he says. 
"You need true fruit, great grapes. That's all." 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the only mainstream wine he makes, Chardonnay. We were 
tasting the 1988 Estate Bottled version, the penultimate vintage for this 
vineyard that is being converted to Rhone grape varieties. The wine is huge, 
with ripe tropical aromas of pineapple and grapefruit, combined with a 
butterscotch note and evidence of oak. It kind of reminded me of a banana 
split. 
</P>
<P>
Grahm acknowledged the power in the wine, but said: "It's a little awkward -- 
kind of like a 280-pound linebacker in a tutu. I don't know if it'll be great 
or not so great in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Grahm is abandoning Chardonnay, not because he doesn't like the challenge but 
because he truly likes the Rhone varieties better, and today he is the kingpin 
in the making of Rhone-type wines in the New World. It is Santa Cruz's Bonny 
Doon by which all other American Rhone-style producers must rate their wares. 
Here is a look at some of the wines Grahm makes (note the small production of 
most of them). 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988 Chardonnay Estate Bottled ($25, 500 cases): Described above, with one 
added note of high acid to carry it into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988 Chardonnay, La Reina Vineyard ($15, 2,000 cases): Slightly leaner and 
more delicate than the previous wine, with the backbone to age. A handsome 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988 Le Sophiste ($20, 250 cases): This blend of Rousanne (for citrus rind 
and quince-like aromas) and Marsanne (for honey and dried apricot) makes for a 
broadly structured wine with traces of vanilla and spice. Otherwise it's not 
fruity in the Chardonnay sense of the word. A sophisticate's wine, as the name 
implies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989 Vin Gris de Cigare ($7.50, 8,000 cases): A landmark pink wine made 
from Mourvedre and Grenache with a strawberry and orange-blossom aroma, dry on 
the palate and perfect for summer sipping with picnic food. One of the best of 
the New Pink wines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989 Clos du Gilroy ($7.50, 1,500 cases): The red wine counterpart for the 
Vin Gris, a Beaujolais-style wine with a profusion of cherries, cranberries and 
grapiness, soft and complete. A red wine to chill and try with steak tartare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1987 Le Cigare Volant ($15, 3,500 cases): A silly name for a serious wine, 
aimed at being like a Chateauneuf-du-Pape. It's 75% Grenache with Mourvedre and 
Syrah for complexity, and the aroma has elements of roses, cherries, faint 
violets and pepper. This vintage has good body without the coarseness of some 
earlier versions. A wine to age so you can watch it mellow. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988 Grahm Crew ($10, 1,500 cases): A bargain, since the wine is similar to 
Le Cigare Volant, though with a tad less concentration. Excellent flavors and a 
wine that will age for a few years and grow even more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988 Old Telegram ($20, 800 cases, released in September, 1990): This 
all-Mourvedre wine has wonderful power and richness, with a blackberry-leafy 
aroma and a note of chocolate in the finish. Potent wine that should enhance 
steaks and other hearty dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988 Syrah ($25, 50 cases, released in September, 1990, with a one-bottle 
per customer limit): Grahm's first crop from his own Syrah vineyard is truly 
sublime, and not as dark and potent as one might think. (The Old Telegram, for 
example, is bigger.) Here the fruit has more cherry and green leaf character 
with a hint of toastiness from oak aging. Because it's so limited, the price is 
high -- Grahm feels people will want to start a vertical collection beginning 
with the first. In time, he hopes to make 2,000 cases of the wine annually. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989 Vin de Glaciere, Riesling ($15 per half bottle, 400 cases): Apple- and 
apricot-like aroma with amazing sweetness (just 11% sugar but with a richness 
that makes it seem sweeter), and a complex, aftertaste reminiscent of a German 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989 Vin de Glaciere, Gewurztraminer ($15 per half bottle, 1,000 cases): 
Made from Oregon grapes frozen in a locker, this amazingly concentrated dessert 
wine is spicy, but with a piney, Alsatian tone to the fruit. It has 13% 
residual sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989 Vin de Glaciere, Muscat ($15 per half bottle, 3,000 cases): The 18% 
residual sugar in this wine makes it the sweetest of the three "icebox wines" 
Grahm makes, but the spice component is more exotic than in the previous wine, 
more like litchi nuts. It is remarkably well balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1987 Brandy Pot Distilled ($15, 1,500 cases): Not a Bonny Doon production 
but a true bargain for Cognac lovers. This product was discovered sitting in a 
brandy producer's bulk inventory after nine years of barrel-aging in American 
oak. Grahm bought and bottled it. It has a vanilla aroma and excellent 
"American whiskey" kind of aroma. 
</P>
<P>
Grahm also makes two infusions, produced by adding alcohol to slightly 
fermented fruits. The Framboise has a raspberry aroma and concentrated sweet 
taste; the Marion is an amazingly syrup-like blackberry sipping liqueur that 
may also be used to cook with. (Grahm's recipe: Mix equal amounts of the Marion 
and bittersweet chocolate in a sauce pan, heat and stir until mixed; pour over 
vanilla ice cream.) The infusions are $8 a half bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Bonny Doon also markets three grappas that Grahm makes in the manner of aqua 
vitae, in which both pomace and wine are distilled to make the clear, dry 
liquid. The grappa from Muscat grapes (designated Moscato) reflects the spicy 
heritage of the grapes, and the one from Isabella (a native American grape 
variety) is even more pungent and complex.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THOSE DARN EXPERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Oat bran, coffee, margarine -- every time I turn around, they're changing 
their minds. First they tell us one thing, then they tell us something else. I 
wish they'd make up their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Who this they is isn't always clear. But what consumers lament are 
discrepancies in nutritional advice that make it hard to tell, at any given 
time, if you're doing the right thing and eating the right foods. 
</P>
<P>
Some point a finger directly at "you nutritionists." The source of this 
frustration, which we hear all too often, is not professional nutritionists, 
who usually provide a consistent dietary message. It more likely stems from the 
difficulty of interpreting the latest results in light of years of previous 
research. Putting the two together is a tall order for scientists, let alone 
the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Public interest in the links between diet and health has never been greater. 
Responding to -- and fueling -- this interest, the media provide a steady 
stream of "latest findings," which often make front-page news. The bold 
headlines look definitive, but conclusions often are drawn from single studies 
-- some excellent, some quite good, others seriously flawed. Sometimes two or 
more reports will follow in rapid succession, providing conflicting results. 
</P>
<P>
Take coffee and cardiovascular disease. As a frustrated friend said: "If you 
don't like the advice, wait a minute." On the surface, answering the question 
of whether coffee raises the risk of cardiovascular disease sounds 
straightforward. Yet it has been addressed in at least two-dozen studies dating 
back more than 25 years, with inconsistent results. 
</P>
<P>
The latest of these, incidentally, found that neither coffee nor caffeine 
increases risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. It's probably reasonable to 
assume, given the weight of the evidence, that drinking moderate amounts of 
coffee as prepared in this country won't boost risk. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it so difficult to reach firm conclusions about diet and disease links? 
Sometimes, sample sizes are too small. In other cases, studies don't go on long 
enough to demonstrate whether the measures on trial are truly effective. 
</P>
<P>
Another classic problem -- a phenomenon researchers refer to as "confounding" 
-- is failure to weigh all factors that might be associated with the disease in 
question. For example, since people who smoke are more likely to drink as well, 
exploring a link between alcohol and a particular disease is meaningless unless 
smoking is taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to do so could lead to claiming links between alcohol and disease when, 
in fact, the more powerful link is with cigarettes. While that may seem 
obvious, it's possible that other, more subtle, "confounders" are not known at 
the time a study is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
The real pitfall is the natural tendency to over-respond to news of the latest 
study with respect to a single factor in our diet. Thus, the recent study 
claiming oat bran had "no effect" on serum cholesterol led consumers who had 
jumped on the bran wagon and upped consumption of bran products to throw up 
their hands in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is, the bulk of the evidence indicates that oat bran can 
help in lowering serum cholesterol, but fat in the diet, especially saturated 
fat and cholesterol, should be reduced at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
A similar crisis in confidence in the nutrition message occurred several weeks 
ago following a report that so-called "trans"-fatty acids found in margarine 
may affect serum-cholesterol levels, raising levels of the "bad" type and 
lowering levels of the "good." While trans-fatty acids occur in foods 
naturally, they are also formed during the hydrogenation of margarine. 
</P>
<P>
Again, early reports of that study failed to emphasize several important 
points: The authors themselves noted that their results were preliminary and 
don't provide a basis for changing current dietary recommendations. For one 
thing, earlier studies had produced conflicting results. Also, the level of 
trans-fatty acids consumed by study subjects was four times that normally 
available in the U.S. diet. And finally, only 10% to 30% of the fatty acids in 
margarine are the problematical trans-fatty type. (By contrast, about 60% of 
the fat in butter is the highly saturated kind that drives up serum 
cholesterol.) 
</P>
<P>
However, because of the press hoopla, the net effect of this highly interesting 
research was to leave many people anxiously wondering whether switching from 
butter to margarine in the interest of controlling cholesterol had, in fact, 
been the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, people should take an interest in the progress of medical research 
that strives to refine dietary guidelines and reduces risk of chronic disease. 
But history shows that the findings of the latest diet studies reported on the 
evening news shouldn't necessarily cause you to shift your dietary habits 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Altering your morning breakfast on the basis of one study rarely makes sense or 
stands the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I'm trying to control my fat intake, and I know that chicken skin 
contains a lot of fat. Is it necessary to remove the skin before baking, or can 
I cook the chicken with the skin on, as long as I don't eat it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Available data indicate that fat doesn't migrate into the meat during 
cooking. An average half breast of broiler chicken with the skin contains more 
than 7 grams (about a teaspoon and a half) of fat and 195 calories. The same 
amount of chicken without the skin, regardless of whether you've cooked it with 
or without the skin, contains about 140 calories and just 3 grams of fat. And 
leaving the skin on during cooking produces a juicier dish. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why are emulsifiers put into processed foods? A: Like an actor who slips 
easily into different characters, emulsifiers perform a host of functions in 
numerous foods from bread to sausages. By altering the surface properties of 
ingredients, they allow them to combine more easily. For example, in making 
mayonnaise, egg yolk acts as an emulsifier. 
</P>
<P>
Emulsifiers are widely used to help mix oil and water. In bakery products, they 
improve volume, moisture retention, uniformity and fineness of grain. They also 
retard staling and help condition dough. They improve the texture of pasta and 
inhibit clumping, of particular use when pasta is to be used in canned and 
frozen foods.

THE GLUTEN MENACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am extremely concerned that The Times has repeatedly run inaccurate 
statements about gluten that not only misinform but, more importantly, give 
potentially life-threatening information. 
</P>
<P>
For the thousands of people who have Celiac Disease (a chronic, hereditary 
intestinal malabsorption disorder), all gluten is bad. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of a Celiac eating foods with gluten (or derivatives of) 
basically boils down to death by starvation, even if they were eating a 
"normal," well-balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
The body fails to absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, and K) and eventually 
stops absorbing even the simplest proteins and carbohydrates. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of awareness among the general public (and unfortunately, the medical 
community as well) perpetuate the many problems facing Celiacs. 
</P>
<P>
While Celiac Disease affects one out of every 1,500 to 2,000 Americans (the 
same ratio as Muscular Sclerosis), patients cannot get the medical information 
or FDA labeling laws they need to stay alive and healthy. Celiac is treatable 
if diagnosed in time and only when strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is 
maintained.

BAN THIS RECIPE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like you to know that I was really offended by a recipe for "Better 
Than Sex Cake" (Culinary SOS, Oct. 11). 
</P>
<P>
The cake sounded good, but I won't try it because each time I did I'd have to 
confront my feeling of distaste. To my mind, giving a cake this name showed a 
lack of fitness and was out of place. Can't sex be kept out of the kitchen? 
It's everywhere else.

FRENCH CHINTZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even after an expensive cross-Atlantic visit, reporter Edward Dolnick couldn't 
come up with the answer as to why the French are more fit than Americans (Oct. 
25). I have a theory. 
</P>
<P>
It is the chintziness of the French. Those sauces cover up for the niggardly 
amount of food they typically serve. The more generous Americans take in a lot 
more food, i.e. calories. 
</P>
<P>
I read somewhere that the French learned about chopping and sauteing anything 
handy and covering the invention with camouflaging sauces from an Italian, 
Marco Polo, who in turn learned the trick of preparing "cheap cuisine made to 
look elegant" from the economy-minded Chinese. I've dined on French food during 
two visits to that country, and in this country when I'm forced to. I'm never 
sure whether there's a piece of shoe leather under the distracting sauce or an 
eighth of an ounce of real beef. 
</P>
<P>
So the answer as to why the French are more fit may be that we hearty Americans 
simply eat more, whether it's fried chicken or celery sticks. But at least we 
know what we're eating and don't feel the need to bury our food under deceptive 
sauces.

TREE RUSTLERS CATCH WRATH OF FOREST RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For forest rangers at Mt. Pinos, north of Ojai, poachers who steal fir trees 
from the wooded federal lands are about as welcome as coal in a Christmas 
stocking. 
</P>
<P>
But every holiday season thieves put a damper on the rangers' Christmas by 
taking young white firs from the forest for use as Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
The tree rustlers might be trying to save money. Or they might think that the 
trees won't be missed. Whatever the reason, forest rangers are seeing red. 
</P>
<P>
"What they are taking is not so much a commodity but something that is high in 
value in the recreational sense," said Forest Service Officer John Kelly at the 
Mt. Pinos ranger station. 
</P>
<P>
One Forest Service officer said thieves steal 20 to 30 fir and pine trees every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But with only six federal employees to keep watch over the 500,000-acre Mt. 
Pinos reserve in the Los Padres National Forest, at the northern end of Ventura 
County, it is difficult to catch the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
"They go to the side of the roads and you can tell where they cut the trees," 
Kelly said. "But from a law enforcement standpoint, it is really hit-and-miss." 
</P>
<P>
Don Trammell, a recreation and operations officer at Mt. Pinos, said Forest 
Service officers catch about two tree rustlers a year. The penalty for taking 
one tree is usually a $50 fine, but it can be as much as $5,000 and can include 
one year in custody, depending on the circumstances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Forest Service officials caught a thief who was trying to make 
off with 15 to 20 white firs in the back of a van, Trammell said. He said the 
suspect faced a fine and incarceration and was brought before a federal 
magistrate, but left the country soon after the arraignment hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The tree-stealing incidents are not confined to Mt. Pinos. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service officials have reported a problem with tree poachers at Angeles 
and San Bernardino national forests. Forests in Northern California have also 
had their share of tree thieves through the years. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, tree smuggling is considered a particularly serious 
offense because of the relative scarcity of evergreen trees and the stressful 
conditions -- such as diseases, insects and smog -- they face. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 2 million acres that make up Los Padres National Forest are within 
Ventura County. The white fir and the Jeffrey and pinon pine trees, however, 
are most abundant in the high altitudes of Mt. Pinos, Forest Service officers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their fullness and shape, Kelly said the white firs are the most 
desirable trees around Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"White fir is a really highly sought-after Christmas tree," Joe Krueger, a Mt. 
Pinos forester, said. The federal reserve on the Kern County border is 
populated mostly with pine trees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
White firs make up a smaller portion of the forest, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
There are several residential neighborhoods and a lake resort scattered 
throughout the wooded federal lands, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Pinos firefighter Jamie Moore said thieves have been known to climb tall 
firs and saw the top halves of the trees. Usually, these trees die because 
they're vulnerable to a species of wood-munching beetle, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to cut down on thefts, Forest Service officials five years ago 
began to set aside wooded areas where families from nearby communities can cut 
pine trees for a $2 permit. 
</P>
<P>
The sites designated for the Christmas tree harvests are usually in areas where 
densely populated pine trees must be thinned to improve the future health and 
vigor of the forest, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The forest, however, can only spare 300 to 400 pine trees each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We try not to publicize it too much because we don't want the demand to far 
outstrip the supply," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Forest Service officials began a program of allowing families to 
return Christmas trees after the holidays so they can be used as habitat for 
forest wildlife. The trees are put in areas where shelter for squirrels, birds, 
chipmunks and mice is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the annual harvest, people continue to steal fir trees from other areas 
of the forest, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are taking something away from the forest that is really aesthetically 
pleasing," he said.

HOLIDAY: 'WHAT WE GET OUT OF IT IS TO SEE THAT PEOPLE GET FED AND THAT THEY GO 
OUT OF HERE WITH A GOOD FEELING.'

John Thompson, one of Oxnard's homeless, stared at his plate piled high with 
turkey and dressing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember the last time I had a good meal," Thompson said. "It's been 
so long." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 47, was among the many people served free Thanksgiving meals by 
members of the Zoe Christian Center, one of a number of community organizations 
that provided meals for the needy throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very nice," Thompson said. "A man living on the streets needs a more 
humane feeling -- to be around people -- on the holidays." He said it was the 
second time he had spent Thanksgiving at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Paul Whitaker of Oxnard, 65, said it was his fourth holiday at the 
center. He said he lives off his Social Security income, which doesn't leave 
much for fancy meals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best thing Zoe could ever do" for the needy, he said. "It helps 
people on the street. I'm taking home a plate for dinner later." 
</P>
<P>
Annie Burney, who is in charge of preparing the meals, said she and a crew of 
about two dozen people started cooking early Wednesday. She said most of the 
food -- which included turkey, hams, vegetables, pies and cakes -- was donated 
by community groups and local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Burney, 50, said she has been in charge of preparing meals on Thanksgiving, 
Christmas and Easter for the last 10 years. She said there is always an 
"overabundance of volunteers" to assist in the cooking chores. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," she said, adding that she and her crew expected to serve about 
1,300 meals before they shut down at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Taitai, 42, said it was the second Thanksgiving that he and his 8-year-old 
son, Kavika, had worked at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Taitai's eyes welled up with tears as he watched Kavika carry bread from a 
storage room to the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of him," Taitai said. "What I'm trying to teach him is that 
whatever he has, he's blessed. We want to let him know that what God gave you, 
you should give back whatever you can when you can." 
</P>
<P>
Across the county in Simi Valley, Ed Calvert and six other volunteers at the 
Grace Brethren Church were busy passing out free meals to the needy, as they 
have been doing every Monday and Thursday for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"What we get out of it is to see that people get fed and that they go out of 
here with a good feeling," Calvert, 70, said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Viles, a 35-year-old unemployed machinist, said he eats at the church every 
week, and if it weren't for the church, he wouldn't have had a Thanksgiving 
meal. "It's great," said Viles, who has been living out of his car for a year. 
"I'm alive." 
</P>
<P>
Calvert, of Simi Valley, estimated that the church would serve 50 to 60 meals 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, Ronald Dwayne Maxwell, who lives on the streets, joined in singing 
"God Bless America" between bites of turkey and pie at a similar luncheon 
sponsored by the Knights of Columbus lodge. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything, not even a decent pair of shoes, but I've got a lot of 
friends," Maxwell, 46, said. "This is great." 
</P>
<P>
Knights of Columbus members Charlie S. Paeh, 53, and Albert V. Montiel, 63, in 
charge of preparing the meals, said they began cooking Monday. They estimated 
that they would serve about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
Montiel credited Paeh, a former restaurateur, with starting the free meal 
program 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I always think about the seniors," Paeh said. "This is one day we can make 
them happy and bring them joy." 
</P>
<P>
Knights of Columbus officials said Thursday's meals were funded by the 
organization's twice-a-week bingo games. They said the group, whose main 
purpose is to raise money for various charities throughout the year, also 
delivers free meals to the needy around the Christmas holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"The only pay Charlie and I get is when people leave here with a smile," 
Montiel said. "To me, this is life."

STICK 'EM UP SEASON;

<P>
CRIME: COLORFULLY NAMED BANK ROBBERS ALREADY HAVE SET THE COUNTY HOLDUP RECORD 
AND DECEMBER IS USUALLY THE BUSIEST MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They're out there, you can bank on that. 
</P>
<P>
The Beer Belly Bandit. The Gentleman Robber. The Masked Man. The Grandma 
Robber. The Nike Bandit. The Fanny Pack Bandit. The Mute. And the Rockin' 
Robber. 
</P>
<P>
They pass demand notes and sometimes wear funny-looking masks. They often have 
drug problems. And high-living lifestyles that keep them coming back to the 
till for your hard-earned and, supposedly, safely secured savings. 
</P>
<P>
They rob banks. And they've made 1990 the worst year for bank holdups in San 
Diego County history. 
</P>
<P>
To date, they've struck 287 times, everywhere from Oceanside to San Ysidro. 
Already, that's 37 more times than in all of 1988, the next-highest year for 
bank robberies countywide, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers don't sit well with Jack Kelly, special agent in charge of bank 
robbery investigations for the San Diego office of the FBI. He's the guy who's 
nicknamed the four dozen serial bank robbers responsible for most of the 
holdups in the area. 
</P>
<P>
These days, there are so many of these characters at work in San Diego County 
-- pulling anywhere from a handful to two-dozen robberies apiece -- that 
investigators need a way to keep them all straight, he says. 
</P>
<P>
December, the Big Daddy of them all when it comes to bank-robbery months, is 
just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"The season is upon us," Kelly said. "Decembers are one of the biggest months. 
In 1988, we had 40 bank robberies in December alone. That's more than one 
holdup a day." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Southern California accounted for 30% of the 7,000 bank robberies 
that occurred nationwide. In recent years, the Los Angeles area has earned the 
dubious distinction as the world's bank robbery capital, according to bank and 
law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Just down the road, however, San Diego County has been having its own headaches 
with the sometimes colorful heists. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities attribute the rising number of robberies to several factors, 
including the growing number of bank branch offices and a freeway culture that 
allows for swift, anonymous getaways. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth of the San Diego area has much to do with it," Kelly said. "There's 
just more people out there. And more ex-holdup artists are getting out of 
prison. Many go back to robbing banks." 
</P>
<P>
The last few months have seen a rash of bank robberies across suburban North 
County, a fact investigators are hard-pressed to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a trickle-down factor from the Los Angeles area -- Orange and 
Riverside counties," said Kelly, 47, who has investigated bank holdups for 
seven years. "Some of these guys rob banks right in their own neighborhoods. 
Others get on the freeway to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials aren't the only ones entering December with a sense 
of foreboding. So are bankers. 
</P>
<P>
"The holiday season is just a tough time for us," said Peter Davis, chief 
executive officer of Commerce Bank in San Diego. "Last year, it got so bad in 
the downtown area that we had to bring in an armed guard just for a show of 
support for the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three robberies in 45 days. And they were just getting scared, jumpy. 
That's no way to work." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has a few theories about the rise of area bank holdups. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a lot of small branch offices, opened by banks who are trying to 
appeal to people by opening offices in their neighborhoods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In trying to appear friendly, these bank offices also appear less secure," 
Davis said. "There's no double bolt at the door. The tellers aren't encased in 
plexiglass. Subsequently, the robbers feel like they can just get in and out." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Shilkret, a spokesman for Wells Fargo Bank in Los Angeles, said that, 
while the priorities of many banks have remained the same -- protecting their 
employees and customers -- their approach to security has changed. 
</P>
<P>
These days, most banks -- especially those in the suburbs -- forgo the imposing 
presence of armed guards in favor of bulletproof plexiglass booths known as 
bandit barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"In most banks, robberies are not an everyday occurrence," she said. "With 
armed guards, there's always the potential of gunplay inside the bank, which 
most of us would like to avoid." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, banks have opted for sophisticated camera equipment and devices such 
as dye packs -- bundles of money designed to explode after the robber leaves 
the bank, coating him and the cash with a telltale layer of ink. 
</P>
<P>
The newest technique involves an electronic transmitter -- concealed in the 
loot handed over to a robber -- which, once activated, leads investigators to 
the device, the cash and the robber. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, authorities say, an estimated 85% of bank robbers are eventually 
caught. So far this year, agents have arrested 44 suspects who are thought to 
be responsible for 191 county holdups. 
</P>
<P>
This week, authorities collared a suspect they believe is the Stay Calm Bandit, 
who robbed nine banks in North County. In each case, the bandit passed a 
robbery note to tellers as he told them to remain calm. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steven Briley, 41, was arrested Sunday at the El Cajon home of a 
friend. He has been charged with one count of robbery, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
That may leave 96 of the county's 287 robberies unsolved and a suspected 15 or 
so holdup artists still at large, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of holdups continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the topic of robberies became the subject at a regular meeting of 
the California Bankers Assn. In April, the organization purchased a full-page 
ad in The Times, running mug shots of bank robbers still at large. 
</P>
<P>
The group is considering a similar campaign for after the holidays, said Larry 
Kurmel, executive director of the San Francisco-based group. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that, by getting their faces out in public, we'll start getting 
some tips as to their whereabouts," he said. "Last time we ran 16 pictures, 
resulting in seven arrests and information about two others." 
</P>
<P>
Both Kurmel and investigators like Jack Kelly have spent a lot of time 
pondering the question: Why do people rob banks? 
</P>
<P>
After all, there would seem to be easier, less risky criminal endeavors than 
such a visible crime that carries stiff federal penalties. The average take of 
a holdup is about $1,200, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who would attempt a crime like this isn't exactly in the Einstein 
category," Kurmel said. "Let's face it, they're dumb. The smarter crooks are 
into more sophisticated crimes, like securities fraud." 
</P>
<P>
FBI Agent Kelly said recent films have portrayed bank robbers as likable 
characters who are too-often successful. One movie, "Quick Change," stars Bill 
Murray as a clown-attired robber who strikes a New York bank with two 
accomplices and then tries to flee Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbing the bank," the film's advertising proclaimed, "was the easy part." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly prefers the 1975 film "Dog Day Afternoon," which relates the true story 
of an inept pair of crooks caught in the middle of a bank heist and forced to 
deal with authorities who have surrounded them. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, the most famous line about bank robbery came from a bank robber," 
Kelly said. "When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton replied, 'Because 
that's where the money is.' 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the rationale that many bank robbers use today. The drug trade is 
one big reason this crime continues to be a problem. It's an act of 
desperation. Addicts need money for drugs. And, unfortunately for the banks, 
they know where the money is." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, more than 85% of bank holdups are committed by serial 
robbers -- men and women who strike again and again. And 90% of the crimes are 
drug related, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Bank robbery folklore includes numerous high-profile cases in which armed 
thieves forced employees and customers to lie on the floor or kidnaped a bank 
president, forcing him to let them inside the vault before bank hours. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, authorities say, most of the crimes are committed by single 
operators, some of whom wait patiently in line before they slip a demand note 
to the teller. Often, the teller and the robber are the only ones who know the 
holdup is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
While techniques are often similar, authorities say, the style and character of 
most local bank robbers past and present couldn't be more different. 
</P>
<P>
The Beer Belly Bandit, for example, is a man in his 40s, known for his receding 
hairline and his estimated 230- to 270-pound frame. He's responsible for four 
robberies in Poway, Vista and Lawrence Welk Village. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big slug," Kelly said. "People remember him for his belly." 
</P>
<P>
There's also the small matter of the black semiautomatic handgun he wields that 
gets their attention. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the Masked Man, who wore a clear Halloween-style mask to conceal 
his identity during four robberies in San Diego, Pacific Beach and Rancho 
Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
He's the Jason of bank robbers, a white male in his mid-30s who has developed 
the brazen habit of pushing other customers aside on his way to the teller 
cages -- where he points a gun at bank employees and demands cash. 
</P>
<P>
There are also note-passers like the Nike Bandit. He's a black male in his 
mid-20s, usually dressed in a baseball cap and denim pants and jacket, who 
authorities say has been responsible for half a dozen robberies countywide, the 
most recent in Imperial Beach. In each case, the Nike bandit handed the teller 
a demand note, along with a line made famous by the Nike sports apparel 
manufacturer: "Just do it." 
</P>
<P>
There's also the Fanny Pack Bandit, suspected of five downtown area robberies, 
who is known for the waist pack in which he stores his loot as he walks from 
the bank; the Grandma Robber, a woman in her 70s who has knocked off one 
downtown bank, and the Mute, the suspected culprit in three East San Diego 
holdups, who never says a word as he slips the teller a note. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the Rockin' Robber. Suspected of two robberies in the 
Clairemont and University Towne Centre areas, he wears a scraggly 
heavy-metal-type wig and usually shoots a few bullets into the ceiling to get 
his point across. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to call him the Tina Turner Bandit, but we thought we might get 
complaints from the real Tina Turner," Kelly said. "We try not to use names of 
famous people who are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's got to be a way to keep track of 300 robberies committed by 50 
different people, many of whom look alike." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, FBI agents in San Diego County have grappled with the likes of 
Grizzly Adams, a bank robber who resembled the burly television character; the 
Ben Hogan Bandit, who wore a snap-on cap of the kind made famous by the golfer; 
the Kangaroo Bandit, who stored his loot in a strange-looking stomach pouch, 
and the Ninja Brothers, a duo who dressed in black hoods and other garb. 
</P>
<P>
The Tellers' School Bandit always warned tellers not to include any dye packs 
with his loot. "I know the game," he would often say. "I've been to tellers' 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Agents are still on the lookout for at least two bandits who have escaped from 
custody after their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
One is the Gentleman Bandit, a handsome man in a neatly pressed sport coat, 
known for his polite manner and the way he said, "Excuse me, ma'am, but this is 
a robbery." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Hal Brame was arrested in San Diego in 1988 and later transported to 
Florida to face bank robbery charges there when he escaped federal custody, 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The other is a member of the Stop Watch Gang, known in San Diego County and 
throughout several Western states for their use of a watch to gauge the time 
they spent inside each bank. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Mitchell was recently placed on the FBI's national "10 Most Wanted" 
list. He and his gang are the suspects in three robberies in San Diego in the 
early 1980s, including a Pacific Beach heist in which they took more than 
$300,000 from a Bank of America branch, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was arrested in Arizona several years ago and also escaped federal 
custody in Florida while facing additional charges there. 
</P>
<P>
But bank robbers aren't always so cagey. At times, investigators say, they 
provide antics rivaling the Keystone Cops. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly recalled an incident earlier this year in which a group of teens became 
suspicious of a man inside a Kearny Mesa bank and hid his bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
"When the robber came out, he was surprised that his getaway car, so to speak, 
was gone," Kelly said. "He ran away but was cornered at a warehouse a short 
distance away. The kids got a reward for their actions." 
</P>
<P>
Bank Manager Michael Becker remembers another unlucky robber. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who manages the Wells Fargo branch at 33rd Street and El Cajon 
Boulevard, recalls the day last March when he felt as though he had had it up 
to here with bank robberies. 
</P>
<P>
When he saw a secret security light flash, Becker immediately knew what was 
taking place: the branch's third robbery in as many weeks, and the second in 
two days. 
</P>
<P>
His staff was already on edge. And a few employees had recently quit in fear of 
the robberies. So when Becker saw a suspicious character making his way for the 
door, the 32-year-old manager and a security guard grabbed the guy. 
</P>
<P>
They struggled. Becker wedged his foot onto the robber's ankle to hold his leg 
down. That's when the robber's leg came off. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," he said. "I looked down and saw all the money on the 
floor, lying next to the guy's prosthesis."

<P>
PUBLIC FORUM IS PLANNED BY BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim developer who lost a 10-year battle to build a shopping center in 
Ojai is hosting a public forum Monday to pitch his latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Howard M. Palmer of Ojai Investments Ltd. says he will donate 11.6 acres west 
of Nordhoff High School to the city of Ojai if it will approve a 26-lot 
subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The front portion of the 30-acre parcel along Maricopa Highway could be kept 
natural or used for a community park, auditorium, recreation center with 
swimming pool or large day-care center, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will even help capitalize any construction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits of a park on the west side of town could help offset the 
subdivision's traffic impacts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city leaders seem enthused about the idea," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ventura YMCA has expressed interest in operating a center there and about 
30% of their users come from Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Andy Belknap described himself as more interested than 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any other project, it will have to go through a screening process to see 
if it will work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's earlier attempts to develop the site, including a 1986 plan to donate 
three acres to a church and build 114 houses with prices of under $100,000, met 
with strong community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
His shopping center saga began in 1980 and ended in April after a seven-year 
court battle, a 10-day trial and two appellate court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
He had sued the city for $6 million in damages, claiming it delayed his 
application. The city eventually was told it did not have to approve the 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Palmer said he doesn't want to build any houses or supermarkets. The 
mostly half-acre home sites would sell to future builders for about $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer has advertised Monday's forum, sent letters to 50 nearby property owners 
and invited about 30 community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be at 7 p.m. in the Nordhoff High School cafeteria, 1401 
Maricopa Highway. THIA BELL

COUNCIL SEAT TO BE FILLED BY ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CARLOS V. LOZANO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark City Council has decided to wait until a special election in March 
to fill a seat on the governing panel left open when Councilman Paul Lawrason 
was elected mayor earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea to let the public decide who is going to sit in that 
seat," Lawrason said after being sworn in as mayor Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any value of appointing a short-term council member between now 
and March and risking unbalancing the election process." 
</P>

PROGRAM HELPS EDUCATE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ON TRIALS OF TEACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hoang Bui learned something about teaching last week: First you have to get 
your students' attention. 
</P>
<P>
Bui, a sophomore at Gardena High School, faced 10 fidgety grade-school pupils 
in a classroom at Cal State Dominguez Hills Saturday morning. His assignment 
was to quiz the students about their knowledge of the solar system, but the 
youngsters were more interested in talking to each other. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, you guys," Bui finally said. "Pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
The students settled down and Bui got them to answer questions such as how many 
planets are in the solar system and how far is the Earth from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Bui is one of 34 high school students who are getting a firsthand look at 
teaching careers through a program at Cal State Dominguez Hills that aims to 
attract minority students to the field. 
</P>
<P>
The students, from five high schools, take their turns behind a teacher's 
lectern every Saturday and instruct area elementary schoolchildren in math and 
science. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Aguerrebere, university coordinator of the program, dubbed the Future 
Teacher Institute, said the students' interest in teaching careers is 
stimulated by "whetting their appetite" with hands-on experience. 
</P>
<P>
The students learn to plan lessons and are critiqued by three professional 
staff members. A central component of the 10-week program, Aguerrebere said, is 
the cooperative teaching approach. Teams of five future teachers are formed and 
each member is assigned a specific classroom role -- such as observer, teacher 
or assistant -- which is rotated. Each class is composed of 10 selected pupils, 
grades four through six. 
</P>
<P>
The high school students receive a $20 stipend for each Saturday's work. 
</P>
<P>
The institute is one of three programs the university runs as part of the Pool 
of Recruitable Teachers project. The project, which initially included five 
programs, was first funded in 1987 through a three-year, $270,000 grant from 
the Carnegie Corp. of New York, said Judson Taylor, dean of the Dominguez Hills 
School of Education and one of the founders of the program. Earlier this year, 
Carnegie awarded the project $100,000 for each of the next two years to be 
divided among the institute and the two other programs still in existence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very successful," Aguerrebere said of the institute, now in its 
fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said follow-up questionnaires of the program's participants now 
attending college showed that 50% still plan to become teachers. In its first 
three years, about 177 high school students completed the program. 
</P>
<P>
Because California's ethnic student population has grown dramatically, 
Aguerrebere said, there is an urgent need to recruit minority group members 
into teaching careers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a teaching population that has not changed very much," Aguerrebere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aida Barrera, president of Telemar Communications Inc., a Texas-based 
educational media company, called the Dominguez Hills program "fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Barrera observed the program in April, 1989, as part of a project with the 
National Education Assn. and Texas State Teachers Assn. to gather information 
to develop a similar program in San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other programs of cross-age tutoring in other subjects, but they 
(Dominguez Hills) are among the leaders in doing this in regard to actual 
teaching," Barrera said. "It gives the kids the hands-on experience to see what 
it is like to teach a subject. . . . I think it works very well." 
</P>
<P>
The institute's participating high schools -- Banning, Carson, Gardena, 
Dominguez in Compton and Jordan in Watts -- recruit for the Cal State program 
by encouraging members of their future teacher clubs and college preparatory 
classes to apply. The students are chosen based on grade-point average in a 
particular area of teaching interest, an essay and the recommendation of a high 
school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Participation is not restricted to minority students. About 71% of the high 
school students in the program are Latino, 15% are Asian, 12% are 
African-American and 2% are Anglo, according to Aguerrebere. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Caburian, a coordinator of the program who teaches at Banning High 
School, says she sees in the students "interest and enthusiasm that I sometimes 
don't see from my colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Dudley, who founded the institute along with Taylor and 
then-Dominguez Hills English teacher Jenny Bailey, said the program is 
extremely popular with the grade-school students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The little ones, I'll ask them how they are doing and they'll say 'I'm fine. 
I'm going to college today,' " Dudley said, adding that the program is a source 
of pride for the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The high school students, she said, are extremely motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think about it, these are high school kids giving up a Saturday to 
come here," said Dudley, who is a teacher at Gardena High School. "For high 
school kids, it's a real sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
Principals in participating elementary schools neighboring the campus -- 
Annalee, Leapwood, Ambler, Amestoy and Broadacres -- assist in the selection of 
the grade-school pupils. Typically, there are more than 400 applications for 
the 60 to 75 positions available to elementary school students each semester, 
according to Taylor. Selection is based on the students' academic need. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of the children enrolled in the program are offered a class in 
parenting through the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Genet Clemmons, whose daughter Nesanet is one of the elementary school 
students, said she signed up for the parenting course because of the valuable 
information provided. 
</P>
<P>
A recent session on helping a child choose a college, she said, was a great 
benefit. The session will help her deal with her other daughter who is in the 
ninth grade "who will be choosing a college soon," Clemmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Her younger daughter likes the enrichment classes because of the extra 
attention she gets, Clemmons said. 
</P>
<P>
"It encourages her to ask questions because she's not embarrassed," Clemmons 
said. "She gets one-to-one attention, just like I would do with her at home." 
</P>
<P>
David Marquez, a junior at Banning High School, said the high school students 
can relate more to their grade-school pupils than can the children's regular 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just like them -- pretty much kids at heart," he said. "We know where 
they're coming from, they know where we're coming from. We know what's going on 
in their environment and the community."

POST OFFICE BENDS A BIT, CHANGES ITS ZIP CODE SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
ADDRESSES: HOLLY PARK FINALLY HAS A NUMBER ALL ITS OWN, INSTEAD OF BEING SPLIT. 
THE POSTAL SERVICE CHANGED ITS POLICY AFTER CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY REVEALED 
THAT MIXUPS HAD LED TO DEATHS AND MISSED MAIL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Katy Carlson lived in Los Angeles, but her mailing address was Torrance. Eight 
years ago, that simple anomaly was partly responsible for the death of two 
little girls she had hoped to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
When Carlson saw Jennifer Dibble, 5, and her sister Joann, 3, at the bottom of 
her fenced back-yard pool, she frantically called the operator and was 
connected with Torrance police. 
</P>
<P>
Precious minutes were wasted while the officer established that Torrance police 
could not respond because her house was in the Los Angeles community of Harbor 
Gateway. Both sisters drowned, just a few days before Carlson was to sign their 
adoption papers. 
</P>
<P>
The 911 emergency system has virtually eliminated the likelihood of such 
mix-ups today. But Los Angeles officials found the Dibbles' story so compelling 
that they told it during congressional hearings this summer that focused 
attention for the first time on problems caused by the Postal Service's ZIP 
code system. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in more than 200 communities nationwide have mailing addresses and 
ZIP codes that do not conform to the boundaries of the communities in which 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
Although some neighborhoods benefit by being able to use mailing addresses of 
nearby cities, residents in many others told Congress that they must accept 
lower resale values on their homes because of their postal zone. Others said 
they pay more for auto and home insurance, a fact the industry disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, people locally and nationally complain about problems in getting 
voter material, dog licenses and library cards. Mortgage payments and other 
bills inadvertently wrongly addressed are routinely stamped "Return to Sender," 
costing them thousands of dollars in late penalties every year. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge homeowners who must use Sepulveda mailing addresses are so fed up 
with being associated with that community and its crime and drug problems that 
they have threatened to file a class-action suit against the post office to get 
a different ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole quality of life issue," said National League of Cities spokesman 
Randy Arndt. "There are all kinds of things that ZIP codes get involved with 
which can adversely affect a city." 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service has defended its method of handing out ZIP codes -- there 
are 43,000 nationwide -- saying the system is designed for efficiency and that 
it shouldn't have to deal with problems caused by businesses and others who use 
it for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
But pressured by bills in Congress and a General Accounting Office audit that 
revealed major differences in how requests for ZIP code changes are handled 
around the country, postal officials finally agreed this summer to begin 
drawing up guidelines to process requests for changes. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Park, a community of about 750 homeowners on Hawthorne's east side, is 
the first neighborhood that will receive a new ZIP code under the new policy. 
Postal officials will be watching how easily the Hawthorne Post Office copes 
with the change before approving similar requests from other communities. 
</P>
<P>
For years, residents of Holly Park have shared ZIP codes and mailing addresses 
with either Los Angeles or Inglewood. Residents west of Van Ness Avenue use 
Inglewood 90303 on their mail; those to the east write Los Angeles 90047. To 
change all of their mailing addresses to Hawthorne 90250, computers will be 
reprogrammed, three mail carriers will be moved to the Hawthorne Post Office 
and sorters will have to learn new codes. 
</P>
<P>
Under the yet-to-be-completed guidelines, postal authorities will have to 
answer requests for ZIP code changes within 60 days, said Tony Conway of the 
Postal Service. Postal officials will no longer be able to routinely deny 
requests, but instead will have to complete a detailed analysis of the costs 
and benefits of a change, he said. The new guidelines will also have provisions 
for appeal, he said, although it has yet to be determined how many residents 
need to favor a change for the Postal Service to begin the process. 
</P>
<P>
Although many municipal leaders hailed the proposal, Arndt said the change 
"really does not go to some of the fundamental concerns we have . . . (because) 
it still leaves it with the Postal Service to decide whether they want to deal 
with this." 
</P>
<P>
Although many communities have complained about ZIP code problems since 1986, 
when a National League of Cities conference first focused attention on the 
problem, Holly Park got to the head of the line largely because of the efforts 
of Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), whose district includes Hawthorne, 
postal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kept our feet to the fire on this issue," Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally, a member of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, 
co-authored several ZIP code bills last year -- one that would have forced the 
Postal Service to realign ZIP codes and mailing addresses to conform with 
municipal boundaries and another that would have allowed communities to use 
their own names on mailing addresses. 
</P>
<P>
The bills, supported by the National League of Cities, would have cost the 
Postal Service millions of dollars had they not died in committee, postal 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative remedy appears to be a trade-off between postal and 
congressional authorities, although whether Dymally reintroduces one of his 
bills next year depends on how effective the guidelines are in dealing with 
community complaints, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To gear up for the June hearings on one of the bills, Hawthorne City 
Councilwoman Ginny Lambert sent letters to every Holly Park resident, asking 
them to write to her about problems caused by their addresses. She brought 
letters or messages from about 300 residents when she testified before the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
In one letter, aerospace worker Paul Lowe, a 24-year resident of the 
neighborhood, estimated that his Los Angeles mailing address costs him about 
$1,500 in auto insurance premiums every year. 
</P>
<P>
Although he and his wife have clean driving records, they have been quoted as 
much as $4,000 a year for auto coverage for their two cars, while friends 
across town in similar circumstances pay substantially less, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous what happens to people in this area because of ZIP codes," 
Lowe, 54, said in an interview this week. "If you have a Hawthorne ZIP code, 
you pay 50% less." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Doss, a gas company investigator and 20-year resident of the area, said 
an insurance agent gave her an $800 quote to insure her car, but when he found 
out she lived in Holly Park "he became very, very angry with me, like I was 
trying to put something over him, and it came out to $1,500." 
</P>
<P>
She said her Los Angeles mailing address has been a constant source of 
embarrassment, particularly when she has told someone she lives in Hawthorne. 
"You're constantly in a position where people doubt your veracity," Doss, 57, 
said. "It makes you look tacky." 
</P>
<P>
Holly Park resident Minnie Hadley wrote in her letter that many local voters 
were turned away from polling booths in the presidential election because of 
confusion over their address. 
</P>
<P>
Lynda Roark, 48, complained that she had to pay $50 to retake the X-ray 
technician exam because she never received her license renewal form and 
inadvertently let it expire. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much the application fee as it was the inconvenience of having to 
retake the exam," said her husband, Donald Roark, 49. "It took up half a day to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Communities nationwide have similar problems, according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearings, Thornton, Colo., officials complained that last year 
$90,000 in sales tax revenue was "either completely lost or had to be 
recollected because retailers (mistakenly) paid according to their mailing 
addresses rather than their city," Thornton Mayor Margaret Carpenter said in an 
interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Shannon Hills, Ark., complained about having to use a Mabelvale 
address, even though there is no town with that name. "One of our biggest 
problems is that maps do not show Mabelvale because Mabelvale does not exist, 
therefore if you are looking for us by our (post office) and have a state map, 
you cannot find us," town officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Independence, Mo., officials testified that ZIP code idiosyncrasies have led to 
inaccurate census counts, which adversely affects the amount of federal and 
state funding they receive for various programs. 
</P>
<P>
And others repeated problems associated with higher insurance premiums or lower 
home values. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mary Crystal, a spokeswoman for the Western Insurance Information 
Service, a consumer information group sponsored by insurance companies, said 
residents are misled into believing that ZIP codes determine their rates, 
though she acknowledges that adjacent ZIP codes can have different rates. 
</P>
<P>
A person's insurance rate "has nothing to do strictly with ZIP codes. It has to 
do with the territory in which someone lives and the claim costs for that 
area," Crystal said. 
</P>
<P>
The new ZIP code in Holly Park is "not, all of a sudden, going to magically 
change their rates," she said. "It is not likely to have an effect." 
</P>
<P>
However, Klaas Bos, governor of the Society of Real Estate Appraisers' Southern 
California district, said he has seen ZIP codes make a difference of as much as 
10% of a house's value simply because of the "snob appeal" of a better address. 
</P>
<P>
"So help me, it shows up that people are willing to pay X dollars more or less 
depending on the mailing address and ZIP code," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
Postal authorities remain largely unconvinced that ZIP codes need a nationwide 
overhaul. ZIP codes generally conformed to city boundaries when the system was 
created in 1963, but often it was more efficient to assign residents the ZIP 
code of a neighboring city's post office, which was closer, said Postal Service 
spokesman Al Sarro. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread changes to make zones match community boundaries are unlikely 
because they would be too costly and ultimately would boost stamp prices to 
intolerable levels, said officials. 
</P>
<P>
"What is a ZIP code about? It's all about sorting mail and getting it 
delivered," Conway said. "I don't believe the majority of the American public 
would want postal officials to be spending money to adjust ZIP code boundaries 
in order to enable individuals to sell their homes for more money."

STROKE VICTIMS' GATE TO ACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Thursday for the past three years, 10 members of the Niko-Niko Club in 
Gardena have gathered at a local park to play gate ball -- a Japanese 
adaptation of croquet. 
</P>
<P>
The players, whose ages range from 59 to 90, have either suffered strokes or 
are spouses of stroke victims. 
</P>
<P>
Gate ball is their escape from household routine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for our heart," said Tsugie Minove, 76. 
</P>
<P>
Minove, who had a stroke in 1981, said the game is a good form of exercise and 
helps the seniors stay energetic. "Otherwise, we just sit around," she said. 
"This way, we are active and (don't) just stay home and watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
The game, although not strenuous, is competitive. Players, divided into two 
teams, take 30-minute turns trying to score as many points as possible by 
hitting their balls through the gates while simultaneously knocking their 
opponents' balls off the course.

RTD BUS DRIVER IS CLEARED IN DEATH OF MOTORCYCLIST; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: POLICE SAY TERESA LABARBA 'HAD NO IDEA' THAT SHE HAD RUN OVER A 
FALLEN MAN, BUT THE AGENCY DISPUTES THAT THE VEHICLE RAN OVER ANYBODY. 
</P>

<P>
An RTD bus driver arrested earlier this month for allegedly running over and 
killing a fallen motorcycle rider in Canoga Park has been cleared of 
wrongdoing, prosecutors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The police investigation into the Nov. 14 accident was hampered because four of 
the five passengers on the bus at the time gave false names, addresses or phone 
numbers to bus driver Teresa LaBarba, making it impossible for officers to 
interview them, Deputy Dist. Atty. James A. Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The one passenger police were able to reach, however, confirmed LaBarba's 
version of the story, saying the bus ride was so rough and its interior so 
noisy that no one on board realized the bus had run over the fallen 
motorcyclist, Eric Edwards, 20, of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said it was concluded that Edwards was responsible for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards was exceeding the speed limit as he drove between lanes on Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard near Canoga Park High School when he hit a brown van on his 
left and fell to the right under the wheels of the bus, Baker said. Riding 
between lanes on a motorcycle is legal under state law. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with RTD regulations, LaBarba, an RTD driver for seven years, 
stopped at the scene of the accident after seeing Edwards fall and took 
statements from the five passengers, Baker said. LaBarba radioed a dispatcher, 
who gave the bus driver permission to leave, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers later arrested LaBarba on suspicion of manslaughter for leaving before 
police had arrived. Police said at the time that she could face additional 
hit-and-run charges, but Baker said the district attorney's office has decided 
not to charge her. 
</P>
<P>
"She has been completely cleared -- she had no idea she ran over the 
motorcyclist," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
But RTD officials dispute that the bus ran over Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a liability matter here," RTD spokesman Jim Smart said. "We are not 
admitting that the bus ran over that gentleman."

CLUB MEETING TO FOCUS ON SOVIET UFOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAJA RADEVICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after the all-American celebration of Thanksgiving, Dan Campbell of 
Camarillo will turn his attention to more distant lands. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, a founding member of the Ventura Chapter of the Mutual Unidentified 
Flying Object Network, will show a video about UFO activity in the Soviet Union 
at the club's meeting at 7:30 tonight at the Camarillo Library. 
</P>
<P>
"In the network, we're not interested in the tabloid-type sensationalism 
surrounding UFOs," Campbell said. "What we want is to assimilate and provide 
information and to keep a scientific outlook on UFOs. I'd say about 98% of 
sightings can be explained by ordinary events. But I keep an open mind to the 
other 2%." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's meeting, which is free and open to the public, will feature a speech 
about UFO activity. Headquartered in Texas, the UFO network has chapters 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said that organizers hope to hold meetings once a month after the 
holidays. In the future, he said, the club will provide training sessions for 
people who want to become UFO investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell say his interest in UFOs stems from an incident that occurred about 13 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I stepped out my front door and there was this big red light just hanging over 
Thousand Oaks," he said. "At first I thought it was a plane, but it didn't 
move. And then I saw helicopters and other activity coming from Point Mugu. The 
red light moved north and then made an abrupt turn west and flew right over my 
house. All I could see was a red streak, it was going so fast. I don't know if 
it was an alien ship. I don't know if it wasn't. All I know is that I'm curious 
and that I'd like more information." 
</P>

JAZZ FANS DOWNBEAT AS AIRWAVES CLASH AT 2 CAMPUS STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ever since radio station KKGO switched to a classical music format, the greater 
Los Angeles area has been left with only one jazz station -- KLON, which is 
broadcast from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, KLON broadcasts a wide range of jazz, from the syncopated rhythms of 
ragtime to the big-band swing of Duke Ellington and the excitement of be-bop, 
from the mournful melancholy of the blues to the high-tech sounds of fusion. 
</P>
<P>
But some jazz fans living near Cal State Northridge were unpleasantly surprised 
recently when they tuned in to the station, at 88.1 FM, and found they could no 
longer hear the music loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: KLON's signal is being blocked in the area by a low-power 
translator recently installed by the Northridge campus radio station, KCSN, 
which transmits at 88.5 FM. 
</P>
<P>
Now, instead of hearing jazz, those who tune in to KLON pick up static and 
echoes from KCSN, whose format includes country-Western and other popular types 
of music. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have is one Cal State University school jamming another," said Guy 
Coleman, 48, a jazz-loving Northridge resident who used to listen to KLON 
regularly. "It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Mills, KCSN's general manager, said the station began using the low-power 
translator last month to solve a reception problem that the campus area has had 
since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That problem arose, ironically, when the station moved its transmitter from the 
campus to the San Gabriel Mountains in an attempt to broadcast to a wider area. 
The result was that receivers farther away picked up the station loud and clear 
but those nearer the campus could not. 
</P>
<P>
Mills said the low-power trans lator boosts reception near the campus by 
rebroadcasting the signal from the San Gabriel transmitter at 88.3 FM. But he 
acknowledged that it also interferes with the reception of KLON's signal -- at 
88.1 FM -- in the Northridge area. 
</P>
<P>
Several people, he said, have called the station to find out why they can't 
receive KLON any more. "People are curious about it," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
But Coleman is more than curious. Coleman is downright angry. He wants his jazz 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only one jazz station left. It's a regional resource," he said. "I 
listened to it all the time but now what you hear is interference -- static or 
buckshot." 
</P>
<P>
KCSN has offered to install a filter on Coleman's antenna that Mills said would 
allow Coleman to hear jazz on KLON. 
</P>
<P>
But Coleman said he has doubts about the filter's effectiveness. And even if it 
works, he said, his portable radios and car radio still won't pick up the KLON 
signal in the Northridge area. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who says he is sure that there are other jazz fans in his neighborhood 
who are infuriated by the problem, wants the station to dismantle the low-power 
translator altogether. He is writing letters fast and furiously to try to make 
that happen. 
</P>
<P>
He has written to KLON, KCSN and the Federal Communications Commission, and 
might also write to the president and the governing board of the Cal State 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, a Hughes Aircraft engineer, said there are many ways -- such as 
increasing the power level of the San Gabriel transmitter -- for the station to 
solve its transmission problem without blocking his music. 
</P>
<P>
What doesn't make sense, he said, is for one Cal State station to jam another, 
particularly when the jammed station offers programs that are unavailable on 
other stations. 
</P>
<P>
"Northridge broadcasts country and Western and you can get that on a number of 
stations around here, but KLON is the only jazz in town."

SPEEDY HEARING PLANNED FOR SIMI EXPANSION; 
</P>
<P>
ANNEXATION: CITY OFFICIALS HESITATE TO CALL LAFCO'S DECISION A VICTORY FOR THE 
JORDAN RANCH PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County planners have agreed to grant Simi Valley's request for a speedy 
hearing on a proposal to expand the city's planning boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
City officials were reluctant to call the Local Agency Formation Commission's 
decision Wednesday a victory in its pursuit of annexing Bob Hope's Jordan 
Ranch, where a development of 750 residences is planned. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Gregory Stratton said that if LAFCO decides in the next few months to 
reject the proposal for the city to expand its area of interest, "it will save 
everybody a lot of time and effort and money. We just want to know if we're 
barking up the wrong tree." 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO unanimously agreed to allow the city to apply for an expansion of its 
long-term planning boundaries -- its "area of interest" -- without first 
completing a full General Plan amendment, which officials estimate would take 
up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the commission denied the city's request to change its procedures 
regarding "sphere of influence" changes, which do require a completed General 
Plan amendment and an environmental impact report before being considered. 
</P>
<P>
A sphere of influence is the actual physical boundary and service area of a 
city, while the area of interest represents a larger zone around a city that 
could be developed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Freed, Simi Valley's senior planner, said he did not know when a LAFCO 
hearing would be scheduled regarding the city's area-of-interest expansion. 
</P>
<P>
He said he needed to talk to county officials to determine what information 
they would require to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the County Board of Supervisors would reject his Jordan Ranch 
development, Hope and Potomac Investment Associates turned to Simi Valley in 
July with the annexation proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to 2,308 acres of his Jordan Ranch property, Hope has asked the 
city to annex 3,600 acres of his Runkle Ranch. The properties are part of the 
Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains. 
</P>
<P>
If annexation goes through and his development is approved, Hope has promised 
to sell and donate 5,700 acres of wilderness to park agencies for a 
below-market price of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hope has also said he would not sell Blind Canyon, part of the Runkle Ranch 
site, to the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts to be used as a landfill. 
Runkle Ranch straddles both Ventura and Los Angeles counties and has been 
deemed an appropriate site for a trash dump.

JEWS FROM LOS ANGELES FIND FULFILLMENT, FRUSTRATION IN THEIR NEW LIVES IN 
ISRAEL; 
</P>
<P>
EMIGRES: THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THEIR NEW COUNTRY APPEALS TO MANY, BUT THE 
PROSPECT OF ARMY SERVICE CAN BE TROUBLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They leave Los Angeles in response to an ancient imperative of Jewish life, a 
powerful dream that promises them personal fulfillment as part of their 
people's redemption. For that dream they leave behind friends, family and the 
ease of life in America and "make aliyah," which in Hebrew literally translates 
to ascent, but has come to mean immigration to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
And then they must begin to grapple with the difficulties of Israeli life. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain how many Angelenos now live in Israel. The Los Angeles Jewish 
Federation Council, whose Jerusalem office tries to keep in touch with them, 
lists more than 1,000 households, but the actual number is surely higher; many 
immigrants do not register with the federation or they drop out of contact with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of current immigrants are Orthodox Jews impelled by their belief 
that it is a mitzvah, a spiritual obligation, to live in the Land of Israel. 
"For a Jew, there is no other place to live," insisted Yehuda Richter, a Los 
Angeles native who now makes his home in Elon Moreh on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Some immigrants are driven by a Zionist commitment to build the Jewish state. 
Others are retirees who want to spend their last years in the Jewish homeland 
or are simply Jews who want to make a significant change in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact is, it's not easy. Los Angeles federation officials say that half 
of all American immigrants will return to the United States within three years, 
driven back by the difficulties of earning a living and of integrating 
comfortably into Israeli society. 
</P>
<P>
There is no typical Los Angeles-to-Israel emigre; they are a diverse lot. Here 
are snapshots of a few, drawn from interviews conducted during a recent visit 
to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
David Kurz 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Kurz, a native of the San Fernando Valley, left graduate school in San 
Diego, where he had been spending as much time working against the Vietnam War 
as studying. Out of curiosity, he took a trip to Israel where, as a New Left 
activist, he expected to find "horrible Israeli imperialists doing horrible 
things to the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
The truth, he said wryly, was "considerably more mixed," and to his surprise he 
felt a sense of having come home. "I experienced this as the place I had the 
most connection to, of any place on Earth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the United States to complete his graduate degree in social 
work, got some experience in his field, then emigrated. Since then, says Kurz 
-- a bearded, bearish man now fluent in Hebrew, married, and the father of two 
young children -- he has never thought of coming back. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's an opportunity to create," he said, "to build a society. 
</P>
<P>
"Life in L.A. is a lot easier materially," he acknowledged. "But the quality of 
life here in Israel is better. I can let my kids go out without fear of 
violence. We have no pictures on milk cartons here in Israel asking us, 'Have 
you seen this child?' We have no freeway shootings or drive-by shootings or 
drug wars with automatic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
As a parent, he worries about his children going into the army -- Israeli men 
serve three years, women two. "We're not happy about it, of course," he said, 
"but that's a part of life here, too. Part of the choice of helping to build 
the society is also defending it." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing he really misses, he said, is his extended family, all of whom 
remain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Galia Kaspi 
</P>
<P>
Kaspi -- her name was Gay as she was growing up on the Westside -- made aliyah 
20 years ago, during the halcyon days following Israel's victory in the Six-Day 
War. "I always felt the importance of Israel as a home where Jews could go," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Just out of college then, she transformed herself into an Israeli moshavnik, a 
farm girl, through tough physical labor, and she married an Israeli. Now a 
single parent with two teen-age daughters in Tel Aviv, she must work two 
teaching jobs to make ends meet. Her daughters also hold down jobs in order to 
buy some of the things they need. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a single parent is hard anywhere," Kaspi said. She, too, does not 
consider returning to America. 
</P>
<P>
Does she worry about the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf? "I worry about 
it the way people in L.A. worry about the earthquake," she said. "What I really 
worry about is my 17-year-old daughter going driving with a friend who just got 
his driver's license two weeks ago -- that I worry about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mark Feldman 
</P>
<P>
Feldman grew up in Northridge, went to UCLA and emigrated to Israel in 1981. 
There he started a travel agency, a business he knew nothing about, by hiring 
two experts and learning from them. Although the agency is now 
well-established, his income after taxes is $13,000 -- respectable in Israel 
but far less than what a successful small businessman would make in the United 
States. Even so, he said, he is not tempted to return. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, I could earn much more money," he said, "but it wouldn't 
matter to the society or to me." He credits his agency's emphasis on 
American-style customer service with having changed the travel business in 
Jerusalem. "Israel is a place where you can still make a difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Feldman's business provides frequent reminders that, for many Americans, 
the adjustment is a tough one. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell a lot of one-way tickets back to the States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joel and Cindy 
</P>
<P>
Joel and Cindy -- they asked that their real names not be used -- are a young 
Orthodox couple whose story is typical of those for whom aliyah fails. Both 
lawyers, as immigrants they are now reaching the end of their third year, when 
their special immigrant rights lapse and men become eligible for army duty. 
</P>
<P>
A central problem is finances. With the money from the sale of their home in 
Los Angeles, Joel and Cindy, who have three small children, bought a beautiful, 
high-ceilinged apartment in Jerusalem for $280,000. But that choice was based 
on their annual income in Los Angeles of $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, where they are completing their apprenticeship, they both work full 
time for a combined income of less than $1,000 a month. Admission to the bar 
would improve the financial picture, but not a lot, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"My baby-sitter makes more than I do," Cindy said. She and Joel rely on help 
from their parents to make it through each month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, their fulfillment as Jews, their core reason for making aliyah, 
has not materialized. Joel says he is distressed by the relentless secularism 
of Israeli society on one hand, and by what he calls the "unpleasantness" of 
the religious Establishment on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy confesses that she often simply doesn't like Israelis. "In California, 
you have the sense of people being nice," she said. She recalled a recent 
incident in which shoppers in a Jerusalem store in which smoking was prohibited 
rudely refused her request that they extinguish their cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Some people who know them suggest that Joel and Cindy were betrayed by their 
own expectations of the spiritual riches and professional opportunities that 
life in Israel would offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We came with a romantic notion," Cindy acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
They are considering returning to America, but they hesitate because, they say, 
Israel is good for their children -- physically safe and emotionally warm, with 
Judaism and Hebrew a natural part of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we're doing it for the children," Joel said wryly. "So they can be 
Israelis -- and then they'll grow up and move to Los Angeles." (At least 50,000 
Israelis have emigrated to Los Angeles in the last two decades.)The Wities 
</P>
<P>
Another young Orthodox couple from Los Angeles, Dan and Penny Wities, are 
taking a more cautious path by only "trying out life in Israel," they said. 
They moved directly to a kibbutz with a population of about 500, not far from 
the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Complete adjustment to kibbutz life will take time. Even after a year, Dan and 
Penny still sometimes feel outside the tight social network there. Moreover, 
their ambition to work in their professions away from the kibbutz -- Dan is a 
computer programmer, Penny an educator -- presents a dilemma to the kibbutz 
leadership, which fears this choice will further hinder the couple's 
integration and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Witieses say they have made a basically good adjustment. 
"There may be problems," said Dan, a lifelong Zionist, "but there is no more 
worthwhile goal than building the Jewish state." 
</P>
<P>
But they retain some mixed feelings about making Israelis of their son, 8, and 
daughter, 5. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, they worry about army service. "Very scary," Penny said. "I 
might never forgive myself for moving here if my son got killed." 
</P>
<P>
Dan, like David Kurz, is more philosophical, for himself as well as his son. 
"You pay your dues. If you want a Jewish state, you have to serve in the army." 
</P>
<P>
But right now, army service is far off, and the children are thriving -- fluent 
in Hebrew, with a large peer group and an easy sense of being at home on on a 
kibbutz that has fields, barns, factories and a wide variety of people and 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Dan and Penny have separated themselves and their children from all the 
familiar aspects of life in Los Angeles, 10,000 miles away, to create a strong 
future for the Jewish people. Yet, as they watch their children become 
seamlessly at home in Israel, pride is mixed with a sense of losing their 
children to this new country. 
</P>
<P>
If they remain, their children will become different from them -- Israelis, not 
Americans. Dan and Penny, for example, speak an American-accented Hebrew that 
will always mark them as immigrants. Five-year-old Adina, on the other hand, is 
not only more comfortable in Hebrew but has now begun to speak English with a 
noticeable Israeli accent. 
</P>

Margolis, a free-lance journalist, is Los Angeles correspondent for the 
Jerusalem Report, a new English-language weekly news magazine published in 
Israel. He recently returned from a trip to Israel.

WEEKENDER: AFTER 40 YEARS, A 'PURE COMMUNITY THEATER' IS STILL PLAYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It started with a handful of PTA members at a Westchester elementary school who 
wanted to put on a show. 
</P>
<P>
One play whetted their appetites for another, and a little local publicity soon 
swelled the group's ranks to 30 or 40 people. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1950, and the Kentwood Players -- a community theater group built 
on the love of being on stage and hearing the applause -- is still going 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pure community theater. No one is paid. Most never ask how many hours we 
put in because it would scare us," said Hal Fisher, a photographer who has been 
a Kentwood member for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The company often fills its 109-seat Westchester Playhouse, especially for 
popular musicals such as the current attraction, with its story of Wild West 
cowboys, Indians and townsfolk -- "Annie Get Your Gun." About 1,200 people, 
largely from the South Bay and Westside, are regular subscribers to Kentwood's 
six-show season. 
</P>
<P>
The theater group itself has a dues-paying membership of 200 who do everything 
from acting and singing in the productions to building sets, making costumes, 
ushering or helping with the business side of theater production. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 people have been Kentwood members for more than 25 years, and players 
who move away from the South Bay don't necessarily leave the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm now in Tarzana, which doesn't mean a thing," said Irv Rosen, a retired CPA 
who, with his wife, Michelle, joined Kentwood 33 years ago when they lived in 
Culver City. "I just did a show with half the cast from the (San Fernando) 
Valley. The trip down there is worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Jon Abramson, a North Hollywood medical administrator and president of the 
Kentwood board of directors, said the group has survived and grown because it 
identified a purpose at the very beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to have fun doing productions, but we also wanted to serve the 
community and give it what it wants, not just do plays or productions that make 
us happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kentwood's three-member play selection committee strives for a balance between 
meaty plays that please actors and popular fare that delights audiences, 
according to Fisher. One musical is done each season. 
</P>
<P>
After "Annie Get Your Gun," Kentwood will round out its season with "Isn't It 
Romantic?," "The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940" and "Steel Magnolias." 
</P>
<P>
Comedies and musicals are audience favorites, but Fisher said "it was decided 
by the original founders that we would not operate on pap or pop. It's like 
eating sugar all the time." 
</P>
<P>
So to balance out the Neil Simon comedies, the popular chestnuts like "Arsenic 
and Old Lace," and the musicals like "Sweet Charity," Kentwood also has done 
things like "Equus" and "Pippin." When it tackled "Death of a Salesman," the 
box-office results were a little like the title -- 50 or 60 people a night. 
</P>
<P>
A theatergoer in every seat, obviously, is preferable. That's because Kentwood 
runs entirely on memberships and box office receipts. "There are no grants, no 
parks and recreation backing, no angels or corporate support," Fisher said. 
"It's strictly self-supported." 
</P>
<P>
While courting audiences, Kentwood tries to give its members enough variety to 
keep them coming back year after year. Abramson said many people don't want to 
act, so they have the opportunity to produce plays, work backstage or take part 
in managing the theater. 
</P>
<P>
There also are membership meetings, cast get-togethers, opening and closing 
night parties, annual awards, and group jaunts to other community theaters 
where Kentwood members are performing. Recently, the destination was Las Vegas, 
where a Kentwood couple had moved. The theater there was dubbed "Kentwood East" 
for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Said Abramson: "We're a close-knit group, almost like a family." 
</P>
<P>
Housewives, real estate agents, businessmen, aerospace engineers and a 
smattering of professional actors make up the Kentwood ranks. "They'll star in 
one show, and in the next one, will be playing a bit part, or maybe building 
sets or swabbing out the back area. It's pretty democratic," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
When a small warehouse near the Westchester-Inglewood boundary was converted 
into the Westchester Playhouse nearly 30 years ago, it was a group effort. "All 
the members got together and put in a lot of Sundays and weeknights," Fisher 
recalled. "They brought hammers and saws, crowbars and sledgehammers and gutted 
the inside out to the walls." 
</P>
<P>
But it is the love of theater and the thrill of the stage that keeps them 
going. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rosen: "After a tense moment, when something goes wrong on stage, we say, 
'This is something we do for fun?' But it's the exhilaration and excitement of 
being part of a show. When it's a successful show, we're very proud. . . . You 
can't get the same thrill out of collecting stamps." 
</P>
<P>
What: "Annie Get Your Gun." 
</P>
<P>
When: Friday, Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 p.m.; also Thursday through Sunday 
until Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Westchester Playhouse, 8301 Hindry Ave., Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
Admission: $8; $9, Saturday; $1 discount Sunday for seniors, students and 
servicemen in uniform.

MAN FOUND DEAD IN DESERT AFTER ABANDONING CAR; 
</P>
<P>
SEARCH: ALVIN NOEL, 75, HAD BEEN HEADING TOWARD LANCASTER AFTER DROPPING OFF 
HIS SON NEAR PASADENA WHEN HE WAS REPORTED MISSING.

A 75-year-old Lancaster man, who reportedly suffered from the beginning stages 
of Alzheimer's disease, was found dead in the San Bernardino County desert 
Thursday, ending a six-day search that began when he disappeared after driving 
his son to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Alvin Noel was discovered about 10:30 a.m. in El Mirage Dry Lake, 
about 12 miles northwest of Victorville and a mile east of the Los Angeles 
County line, San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Noel apparently died of exposure after wandering about seven miles from his 
abandoned car, authorities said. They concluded that no foul play was involved. 
</P>
<P>
"He appeared to have been dead three to four days," said Sgt. John Hall of the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Station in Lancaster. It is believed that he died 
before Monday's heavy rainstorms, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Noel had been missing since last Friday, when he dropped off his son at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory near Pasadena and started toward his Lancaster house, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Noel headed north on the Angeles Crest Highway, the most direct route through 
the mountains to Lancaster, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
But Noel, who deputies said suffered from the early stages of Alzheimer's 
disease, never arrived. Alerted by family members, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
investigators began looking for him over the weekend, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that Noel became disoriented in the Antelope Valley and 
ended up driving eastward into San Bernardino County, where he abandoned his 
1987 Oldsmobile on the dry lake bed in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
The car was found Tuesday by federal Bureau of Land Management employees. A 
50-square- mile area of desert around the discovery site was combed by at least 
50 searchers from the San Bernardino and Los Angeles County sheriff's 
departments, the California Highway Patrol, the Bureau of Land Management and 
numerous volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The car had been partially stripped. But the stripping apparently took place 
after it was abandoned, authorities said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 KILLED, 6 INJURED IN HEAD-ON COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people -- including a 9-year-old girl -- were killed and six others were 
injured Thursday in a head-on collision on a remote strip of road in the 
Antelope Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Details about the 5:45 p.m. crash on California 138, about six miles east of 
California 18, were sketchy, but authorities said two cars were involved. 
</P>
<P>
One was carrying five passengers; the other three. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Ronald Hamilton said a girl who appeared to be in 
her teens died instantly. He said the girl was a front-seat passenger in a car 
driven by a woman. Three children, ranging in age from about 4 to 9, were in 
the back seat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A girl of about 9 died after she was taken by helicopter to Antelope Valley 
Hospital Medical Center. A boy who appeared to be about 6 was in critical 
condition at the same hospital. The 4-year-old, a boy, was taken by ambulance 
to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, as was the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Occupants of the second car -- a woman and her two sons, aged 16 and 18 -- 
suffered moderate injuries and were also taken to Palmdale Hospital Medical 
Center, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the victims' names were released Thursday night and neither were their 
conditions available.

CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOLS' MERGER A MIXED BLESSING; 
</P>
<P>
MONTEBELLO: LAGGING ENROLLMENT AND HIGH COSTS FORCE AN ALL-GIRL INSTITUTION TO 
UNITE WITH A NEARBY MALE ACADEMY. FOR MANY, IT'S THE END OF AN ERA. 
</P>

<P>
In 1960, when David Escarcega was a sophomore at Cantwell High School, the 
girls of Sacred Heart of Mary High School, just across Hay Street, were 
tantalizingly near. 
</P>
<P>
Under the watchful eyes of the Sacred Heart of Mary sisters, the Catholic boys 
of Cantwell High came no closer to the girls during school hours than a 
lingering glance through the chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The sisters were very restrictive," recalled Escarcega, whose wife, Christine, 
attended Sacred Heart of Mary while he was at Cantwell. "Though we used to look 
at the girls from afar, the best we could do was cruise by." 
</P>
<P>
Escarcega's memory of how it was between young men and women in Catholic 
schools in the Montebello area is all that is left of a 40-year tradition that 
will come to an end next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has announced that dwindling 
enrollment and the soaring cost of a private education have forced it to merge 
the two schools into a coeducational school to be called Cantwell-Sacred Heart 
of Mary High School. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar move in the San Gabriel Valley, the all-boys La Salle High School 
in Pasadena will admit girls for the first time next September. The La Salle 
move does not, however, involve a merger. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle is a Catholic school run by the Christian Brothers, and officials have 
cited a desire to offer an alternative to mostly single-sex Catholic high 
schools, as well as broadening their enrollment base, as reasons for going 
co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, formerly 
for boys only, went coeducational in 1982, causing a student shift that helped 
drive Our Lady of Corvallis, a girls school in Studio City, out of existence in 
1987. That left Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino the sole remaining 
Catholic all-boys school and Louisville High School in Woodland Hills the 
remaining Catholic girls school in the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
Sacred Heart of Mary, which has been owned by the order of the Religious of the 
Sacred Heart of Mary since 1942, will be closed, said Sister Joan Treacy, the 
provincial superior of the order. It is the same order of nuns that ran 
Corvallis in Studio City until 1981, and Marymount in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Treacy said that the order's decision to keep tuition costs low to allow more 
students to attend Sacred Heart of Mary has created such a financial burden 
that the order can no longer afford to operate the school. 
</P>
<P>
For many, especially the alumni of both schools, the consolidation means the 
end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
But students, parents and alumni said that there is little option, given the 
bleak enrollment figures and studies that reveal a shrinking pool of students 
will enter Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see it go," said Escarcega, whose son, Marc, is now a senior at 
Cantwell. "At one time I thought that if I wanted my son to have a co-ed 
education I would have sent him to a public school" or to Bishop Amat, a co-ed 
Catholic school, "but I'm more open-minded now. . . . I look at it as one 
chapter closing and another opening." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that Cantwell would become a coeducational school had been 
rumored for years, but it became a matter of serious discussion about three 
years ago when the archdiocese commissioned a study of the problem of dwindling 
enrollment in its schools. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell has a capacity for 600 students, but is now serving only 250 students, 
a 50% drop in the number of students enrolled five years ago. Most of the 
students come from the East Los Angeles, Montebello and San Gabriel Valley 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rivera, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said the study by the archdiocese 
recommended several options to buoy enrollment, including an aggressive 
recruiting campaign and the consolidation with Sacred Heart of Mary. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the leadership of the Sacred Heart of Mary announced that it could 
not afford to continue operating the high school. The archdiocese then made its 
decision to consolidate, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Laura Siebert, the principal of Sacred Heart of Mary, said that as long 
as five years ago the order realized it could not continue operating the school 
as it had, and shortly thereafter began talks with the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, students have been told that the school might become 
co-ed, and students who wanted to attend an all-girls school were encouraged to 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't made any secret about it," Siebert said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Sacred Heart of Mary teachers are expected to continue working at 
Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Several committees have been formed to oversee such details as the writing of 
Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary's new school philosophy statement and its 
modification of curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Siebert said that her students, for the most part, are looking forward to the 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a lot of change . . . but out of the combination we will come 
up with things that will make both schools better," she said. "We could have 
programs that neither school could afford on its own, such as fine arts or 
drama." 
</P>
<P>
Some Cantwell students initially resisted the idea of sharing their classrooms 
with girls. Many said they didn't want the school's name, its colors and mascot 
to change, or to endure having its creed of "Act Manfully" neutered. Others 
said they feared that camaraderie among the boys would disappear as soon they 
began competing for the attentions of their new classmates. 
</P>
<P>
The name change is still a sore spot with Cantwell alumni and some students, 
but most are looking at the consolidation of the schools as a practical matter, 
a necessity that must be faced to keep a good Catholic school in Montebello. 
And, students said, a coeducational classroom could be a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not mad about it," said sophomore Gabriel Arenas. "A lot of guys are 
happy that girls are going to be at the school."

8 TEEN-AGE MOTHERS JOIN BATTLE AGAINST ILLITERACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the teen-age graduates crowded into their classroom Tuesday, the girls 
whispered and giggled at the sight of the achievement certificates awaiting 
them. And as soon as they had dropped off their babies in the day-care room, 
the ceremony began. 
</P>
<P>
With a rose, a photocopied certificate and a hug from their teacher, eight 
teen-age mothers celebrated their first major academic achievement Tuesday: 
They completed a nine-month special education program in Pacoima that improved 
their reading skills and taught them to prepare a healthy meal and calm a 
cranky baby. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started this I didn't know how to read. I had to ask someone for help 
in everything," said Lisa Stanley, 18, mother of a 2 1/2-year-old boy and 
10-month-old girl. "Now I can read some books to my son. I just feel better 
about myself." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacoima branch of El Nido Services -- a nonprofit child-, youth- and 
parent-counseling organization -- was awarded a onetime, $25,000 grant by the 
Kaiser Permanente foundation about a year ago to create a nine-month literacy 
program for eight teen-age mothers. 
</P>
<P>
But what began as a structured reading class turned into a "life skills" 
course, said teacher Cindy Friedman, who devised reading lessons on topics such 
as health, nutrition and raising children. 
</P>
<P>
These eight girls can be found classified among many disturbing California 
statistics -- the 20% high school dropout rate, an estimated 71,700 pregnant 
teen-agers and teen-age mothers under 18. 
</P>
<P>
And like half of the 16- to 19-year-old mothers and three out of four of the 
14- to 15-year-old mothers in the nation -- according to a report by state 
education authorities -- they lacked basic academic skills. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, these eight vowed to become statistic-busters. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that if I want to get ahead in my life I need to learn how to 
comprehend what I read," said Carrie Williams, 17, who intends to enroll in an 
adult vocational school. "I guess I realize now I have options for my 
education." 
</P>
<P>
Two girls left midway through the program to return to high school. The other 
six say they are returning to high school or adult vocational programs offered 
by the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie, 17, said it was a struggle to pack up her son for the twice-a-week 
classes and take two buses to school. She said, however, it was worth it 
because in nine months she improved her reading skills from third- to 
fifth-grade level.

THANKSGIVING SERVED UP ON A VARIETY OF PLATES; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: FROM FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS TO TABLES FOR THE HOMELESS, DINERS FOUND 
PLACES TO EAT AND EXPRESS GRATITUDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As he stood outside the fast-food restaurant in Hollywood, Paul Jeans was 
busily scraping together the money he needed for a Thanksgiving dinner. He did 
it the only way he knew -- panhandling customers as they left Kentucky Fried 
Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the standard fare of roast turkey, dressing, sweet potatoes and pumpkin 
pie on this holiday of bountiful feasts, Jeans was only pitching for the few 
dollars needed to buy some fried chicken, french fries and a cup of cold water. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who are stuffing themselves on Thanksgiving are the ones who can 
afford to stuff themselves," said the 44-year-old Jeans as he accepted a couple 
of quarters from a passerby. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the holiday is a pretty good thing," added the goateed man who 
described himself as jobless and homeless. "People are getting together and 
everything, and if I had a home and family, I'd probably be doing that too." 
</P>
<P>
While many families spent Thanksgiving at home or restaurants gathered around 
tables laden with the traditional turkey spread, others spent Thursday's 
holiday -- like Jeans -- at fast food restaurants dining on chicken, 
hamburgers, cheeseburgers, tacos and other less expensive fare. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Akop, the manager of a Pioneer Chicken franchise in Hollywood, said 
customers often arrived after deciding not to cook a large meal at home. But at 
least half of his diners on Thanksgiving were probably doing so for economic 
reasons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both convenience and cost -- as well as a place for a birthday celebration -- 
played a role in the selection of a McDonald's restaurant near downtown Los 
Angeles for Celina Martinez and her three children. With her 6-month-old at her 
side, Martinez and her two older children were eating Big Macs, french fries 
and chocolate sundaes to celebrate not only Thanksgiving but her 28th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to God that He gives us food," she said in her native Spanish. "We're 
grateful for this food or any food we can get." 
</P>
<P>
That gratitude was echoed throughout the Southland on a day when the focus was 
on food and giving thanks -- especially by some diners who enjoyed the 
traditional turkey dinner because of special programs aimed at helping the 
homeless, the poor and the needy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest food giveaways occurred in downtown Los Angeles where the 
Fred Jordan Mission and its army of volunteers distributed meals to 8,000 
people who sat at open-air tables that stretched over a city block. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a blessing indeed," said Kenneth Dixon, 34, as he sat waiting for his 
meal of turkey, candied yams, mashed potatoes, cornbread and ice tea. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize it was going to be Thanksgiving until last night," added 
Dixon, who said he has been homeless for six months. "That's how much I have 
become used to just living on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
At a nearby table, Urbano Ramirez and his wife, Maria Gonzalez, sat with their 
six children quietly savoring their dinner and ignoring the musical 
entertainment and the parade of preachers and others who spoke above the din. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't afford this food on my own. I make too little money," said the 
Spanish-speaking Ramirez who works as a sewing-machine operator. Then, excusing 
himself, the T-shirted Ramirez gathered his family and packed their leftover 
food to take home. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Southland, the scene was repeated. 
</P>
<P>
The cooks at the Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles estimated that they 
served 1,500 meals. Workers at the United States Mission in Hollywood served 
2,700 holiday meals, using 125 turkeys, 90 pounds of dressing, 400 pounds of 
ham, and 150 pounds of potatoes, according to director Pat Lenhoff. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the programs involved participants showing up for a free meal. The 
Meals-on-Wheels program, sponsored by Los Angeles City's Department of Aging, 
delivered meals to a number of homebound elderly residents on Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
And 22,476 inmates in the Los Angles County Jail system celebrated the holidays 
with longer visiting hours for their families and friends -- and the 
traditional holiday meal. 
</P>
<P>
In all, inmates consumed 5,175 pounds of candied sweet potatoes, 3,000 pounds 
of cranberry sauce, 3,680 pounds of cornbread dressing and 6,900 pounds of 
roast turkey, plus pumpkin pie and coffee, according to sheriff's officials. 
</P>
<P>
The feast, a spokesman said, was directed as much at the hearts and minds as 
the stomachs of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of meal we believe lifts the spirits of the inmates," said Sheriff's 
Deputy Bill Wehner, "and hopefully they will reflect on this day and attempt to 
improve their conditions for the holidays yet to come." 
</P>

LONG BEACH MAN SHOT BY DEPUTY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHOOTING IS THE FIRST IN THE COMMUNITY INVOLVING THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputy shot and seriously wounded an 
unarmed Long Beach man who, authorities said, did not follow orders to keep his 
hands in his pockets when the deputy stopped to question him about a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting Wednesday night was the first involving a deputy since the 
Sheriff's Department began patrolling northern Long Beach three weeks ago. City 
officials have contracted with the department in an effort to help their 
understaffed Police Department combat a rising tide of crime. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, Palema Matangi, 27, suffered three bullet wounds and was 
listed in serious condition Thursday in the intensive care unit at Long Beach 
Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The department's four-year, $19.9-million contract with Long Beach makes that 
city the first in the state to have two law enforcement agencies within its 
boundaries. According to the state Department of Justice, Long Beach had the 
worst record of any major California city in 1989 for solving serious and 
violent crimes. Police failed to solve 74% of the rapes, 87% of the robberies 
and 93% of the burglaries reported in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Among those unsolved crimes was a residential armed robbery that occurred last 
year. On Thursday, while Matangi was under 24-hour guard at the hospital, 
deputies booked him for investigation of robbery in connection with the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Bob Olmsted said that Matangi fit the 
description of the robbery suspect, but that there is not yet sufficient 
evidence to charge him. 
</P>
<P>
Olmsted said the department also is investigating the shooting of Matangi to 
determine whether it was justified. 
</P>
<P>
Matangi suffered wounds to the right arm, right leg and abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy -- a 15-year veteran whose identity was not released -- was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
According to Olmsted and other department spokesmen, the deputy stopped Matangi 
at the intersection of 67th Way and Orcutt Avenue after Matangi crossed the 
street in front of the deputy's patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy, recalling a recent department bulletin about the 1989 robbery, 
believed that Matangi matched the description of the suspect, Olmsted said. 
Olmstead would not provide details of the robbery, except to say that it 
occurred in the "immediate vicinity" of the intersection where Matangi was 
stopped, and that the suspect was considered "armed and dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
When the deputy got out of his car to question Matangi, he ordered him to stop 
walking and keep his hands in his pockets, according to the department. But a 
spokesman said the man crouched, drew his right hand from his pocket, then 
removed his left hand from his pocket, leading the deputy to believe that he 
had a gun.

CHRISTMAS: TRAINED FOR THE SEASON, ONE- AND TWO-PILLOW WOULD-BE ST. NICKS WILL

I'm a one-pillow Santa. 
</P>
<P>
It's embarrassing to admit, since most of the others who enrolled with me in 
Santa School last weekend seemed slim and healthy-looking. Distinctly 
two-pillow types. 
</P>
<P>
The 30 of us will climb into red-velvet, size-54 Santa suits today and travel 
to shopping malls across Los Angeles County to take up battle stations as 
surrogate Clauses. During the next month, we'll lift thousands of starry-eyed, 
angel-faced children to our knees and listen to this generation's Christmas 
wishes. But first, we had to be trained, and that took place last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
We were fed doughnuts and bagels as we met in a back room at the Del Amo 
Fashion Center for class. We learned the Santa Walk (a slow, smooth gait -- 
like someone who's spent many lifetimes squeezing down chimneys) and memorized 
a list of Santa Do's and Don'ts (Do use an industrial-strength deodorant and 
breath mints. Don't flirt.). 
</P>
<P>
"Be natural," said Santa instructor John McGill III. "Use your own voice. Lower 
your volume -- not your tone -- when you're talking with the children. Kids can 
detect a phony voice. Santa is a real person. I've been doing this for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"And I believe." 
</P>
<P>
McGill is a jolly, bearded truck driver from Long Beach. Each year, he takes a 
leave from his cross-country driving job so he can spend Christmas working as 
St. Nick. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he has helped recruit 55 potential Santas like me to work in and 
around Los Angeles malls for Western Temporary Services. Nationwide, the agency 
will supply more than 3,000 of them to department stores and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
McGill told us to greet each child individually, take plenty of time for our 
visit and end each conversation with an admonition such as "be sure to brush 
your teeth" or "get to bed on time." Go light on the Ho! Ho! Hos!, we were 
told, as they have reduced many a timid child to tears. We were warned never to 
promise anything when youngsters reel off their Christmas wish lists. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch the folks to see if they're nodding at what the child is saying. Take 
your cue from them when a child mentions a toy," he said. Santas never endorse 
toys, McGill explained, but Santas should study newspaper toy ads to know what 
children are talking about when they ask for the latest hot item. 
</P>
<P>
There were frequent breaks during the four-hour training session -- more rest 
periods, we were warned, than we'll get once we settle in at the malls' center 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Help yourself to the doughnuts, gentlemen," said Anthony Scovotto, a San Pedro 
shopping center promotions specialist who helped out at the class. "We want to 
put some weight on our Santas." 
</P>
<P>
My classmates, whose regular jobs range from welder to business consultant, 
were quick to adopt the holiday spirit. Most made it clear they are as 
interested in the Santa experience as in the Santa pay -- as much as $7.50 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
(My Santa salary is to be donated to charity by Western Temporary Services.) 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Troutt, 19, a 6-foot, 165-pound college student from Hermosa Beach, took 
one look at the suit he would be wearing and saw an immediate need. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a four-pillow Santa," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rogal, 45, a handyman from El Monte, wore a red Christmas sweater and a 
Santa-length blond beard to class. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll spray my beard white," Rogal said. "It will be fun watching the kids' 
reaction when they pull on it and find out it's real." 
</P>
<P>
After viewing a videotape that showed such tips as how to deal with children 
who have wet their pants (Stand up, announce it's time to feed the reindeer, 
then go change) we watched demonstrations of how to color our eyebrows white 
and correctly wear the Santa suit, beard, wig, gloves and glasses. Then came 
the role-playing part of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Student Santas Keith Rogers of Long Beach and Jim Branca of Playa del Rey sat 
on chairs while the rest of us took turns sitting on their knees. Most of us 
tried to stump the Santa by asking such questions as, "Who was that other Santa 
I saw a few minutes ago at the other mall?" (The correct answer: "That is one 
of my helpers.") 
</P>
<P>
Branca asked me if I've been a nice boy this year. I said yes, and told him I 
wanted a Milli Vanilli record album for Christmas. "They've been the naughty 
boys!" Branca responded, a professional twinkle in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
The class ended with a homework assignment. Each of us, McGill said, would be 
required to learn the names of Santa's reindeer by today. 
</P>
<P>
From around the room there arose a clatter: "Let's see, there's Dasher, Dancer 
. . .," one student started. 
</P>
<P>
"Rudolf and Vixen," another chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
"Secretariat," came a voice from the back. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Don'ts 
</P>
<P>
No smoking, flirting, or drinking 
</P>
<P>
Never promise anything 
</P>
<P>
Never show a bad mood 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Bob Pool has found work this season as a shopping mall 
Santa. He promises to deliver occasional reports.

TODAY THEY WILL STORM THE CITADEL; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: WITH NAMES LIKE PERRY ELLIS, EDDIE BAUER, LEON MAX, BENETTON AND 
OTHERS, THE CITADEL COLLECTION IN COMMERCE MAY CHANGE THE IMAGE OF OUTLET 
SHOPPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Outlet stores, those no-frills operations where prices can be slashed to less 
than half of retail but decor can be tackier than a garage sale, are in for an 
image-enhancer. 
</P>
<P>
Today the Citadel Outlet Collection in Commerce officially opens. This is 
outlet shopping in a castle-like structure with fairy-tale turrets. And the 
setting is a beautifully landscaped courtyard, flanked by palm trees and plenty 
of free parking. You'd never know by looking at the colorful, imposing facade 
that this is a converted Uniroyal tire plant. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive as the outside of the center is, the main attraction is inside, 
where the deals abound. Of the stores currently open (half of the total planned 
42), the best include the Gap Outlet, Perry Ellis Shoes, L. Bates Contemporary 
Clothing for women's sportswear by Los Angeles designer LaVonne Bates, Harve 
Benard for classic women's sportswear with some large sizes, the Eddie Bauer 
Outlet Store for outdoors people, and a Leon Max outlet that carries the L.A 
women's wear designer's Max Studio separates. 
</P>
<P>
There is also Prestige Fragrance for cosmetics and scents. The store carries 
Orlane and Revlon, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Future months will see the opening of such stores as Benetton, Gitano for denim 
and casual sportswear, and Politix, a moderate price Euro-style menswear store. 
The center is scheduled to be complete some time in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
In most stores, merchandise is priced 30% to 70% below retail. Some carry goods 
available right now at full price in department stores. Others include a mix of 
current and past seasons' goods. 
</P>
<P>
At a pre-grand opening perusal of the stores, deals abounded at the huge 
13,000-square-foot Gap Outlet, the largest shop currently open in the center. 
Printed pinwale corduroy Gilligan-style hats were marked down to $1.99. 
Single-pocket short-sleeve T-shirts in a variety of colors were selling for 
$10.50. Canvas backpacks went for $14.99, down from $32. And racks of 
irregular, or imperfectly made pants, were priced at $3.99 
</P>
<P>
The Eddie Bauer outlet was overflowing with values. Heavyweight cotton flannel 
hunting shirts for men were marked down to $12.99. Women's crew-neck wool 
sweaters featuring a Christmas-tree motif were priced at $39.99 each. Mens' 
long-sleeve cotton T-shirts were marked at $12.99. 
</P>
<P>
At the Leon Max outlet, one of the most beautifully designed interiors in the 
shopping center, a scarf-tied rayon blouse by Max Studio, one of several of the 
designer's labels, sold for $51. An ice-blue rayon jumpsuit with a tie-front 
bolero was marked at $75. 
</P>
<P>
At the Perry Ellis Shoes store, women with size 7 and 7 1/2 have the best 
selection because the line features that sample size, but a wide range of sizes 
is available. Flats dominate and prices aren't cheap, although shoes are marked 
30% to 50% off the full price. A mock crocodile, two-toned flat was $99 and a 
brown leather Grace Kelly-style handbag was $94.99, down from $135. 
</P>
<P>
Plan on lunching elsewhere (the Citadel's food court isn't open yet) unless a 
hot dog or Dove Bar will do. Most of the shops take credit cards, and return 
policies on merchandise are posted inside the stores. Many offer store credit 
only, so consider purchases carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel Outlet Collection, 5675 E. Telegraph Road, City of Commerce. Hours: 9 
a.m. to 9 p.m., Monday through Saturday. 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday.

HOW TO GEAR UP FOR AN ASSAULT ON GARMENT DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: THERE'S SO MUCH GROUND TO COVER THAT IT MAY TAKE MORE THAN ONE TRIP 
TO FIND THE REAL DEALS. DISCOUNTS RANGE FROM 20% BELOW RETAIL TO BELOW 
WHOLESALE.

Makeup artist Rose Librizzihad only minutes to spare. A limousine was waiting 
outside the Cooper Building, in the heart of the Los Angeles Garment District, 
to whisk her back to a movie set. She swooped up a $20 silk camisole to wear 
with a $50 silk blazer she had purchased earlier in the day and raced for an 
elevator -- her black leather bag (a $19 trophy from a previous visit) flapping 
against her floral baby-doll dress, which, like her leggings, her lace bodysuit 
and her black cowboy boots, was a discount treasure. 
</P>
<P>
For Librizzi and others born to shop, the Garment District is a paradise 
crammed with bargains. To the uninitiated, it is part jungle, part mystery. But 
solve the mystery,and there is every chance of becoming a district devotee -- 
someone who returns again and again for the fun of the chase and the thrill of 
a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
Doing your homework before your first trip is essential. There are at least two 
books on the subject, Barbara Moe's "Guide to the Los Angeles Garment District" 
(C. Taylor Publishing Co.) and "Garment District Los Angeles" (P.B.G. 
Publications). Both are available in major bookstores, and Moe's latest 
edition, the 15th, will be out in December. 
</P>
<P>
To cover the area, wear comfortable, accident-proof shoes and clothing. Chances 
of someone treadding on your toes or smearing your blouse with ice cream are 
excellent, especially on a crowded Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A fanny pack is the ideal way to transport a tape measure, pocket calculator 
and acceptable credit cards (Discover is a no-no in most establishments, but 
virtually everyone accepts Visa and Mastercard; carrying cash is not always 
safe, and not every store accepts checks). It also frees your hands to feel the 
merchandise. A woman wearing a bodysuit and leggings will be able to try on 
clothing without the benefit of a dressing room, which not all stores have. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, what you will find are overruns of current merchandise. But some 
stores carry apparel produced just for them. To recognize a true bargain, shop 
your favorite retail stores before heading downtown. And unless you are the 
no-regrets type, limit yourself on the first few trips. 
</P>
<P>
Trip 1, you might want to look but not buy. Trip 2, you might want to buy only 
shoes, for example, or slacks. Select carefully because exchanges are usually 
the best you can expect. 
</P>
<P>
And never buy the first thing you see, unless you are confident or in a hurry. 
Librizzi advises looking around for the best deals. Many stores carry the same 
labels but not always at the same price. Some stores discount only 20% or 40% 
below retail while others actually discount below wholesale. And many merchants 
are prepared to bargain. 
</P>
<P>
As for the lay of the land: The Alley is where the whole scene began in 1979 
when a few manufacturers opened their back doors to the public. Now, it has a 
flea market feel to it, and you have to sift through a lot of merchandise to 
find the goodies and the good stores. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, especially in stores along Los Angeles Street between 7th and 9th, 
you can find known labels -- such as Nolan Miller, Nino Cerruti, Esprit, Liz 
Claiborne, Albert Nipon, Jones New York, Donna Karan, Anne Klein, Gianni 
Versace and Giorgio Armani -- in a retail atmosphere that includes helpful 
salespeople and fitting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
With so many stores in the area, it is truly a buyer's market, and merchants 
are looking for repeat customers. If you don't like the conditions in one 
store, find another. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true for men, because the Garment District is a male 
shopper's dream. There are many, many stores offering top-notch apparel. Some 
even have amenities virtually unheard of for women, such as in-house tailoring 
and free delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The closer you park to the heart of the district, the higher the price. The 
California Mart and the Cooper Building have underground garages that are very 
expensive. For bargain parking, look for outdoor lots around 9th and Wall 
streets or 9th Street and Maple Avenue. Don't park on the street even if you 
find a metered space. Chances are you will shop longer than planned, and one 
ticket could turn your bargains to dust. 
</P>
<P>
Stores are generally open Monday through Saturday, 9:30 a.m to 5 p.m. and 
Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>

<P>
A FEW ESSENTIALS 
</P>
<P>
Wear comfortable, accident-proof clothing and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Take a fanny pack instead of a purse to keep your valuables as close as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Pack a tape measure to measure clothes you might not be allowed to try on. 
</P>
<P>
Take a calculator, to figure out discount percentages. 
</P>
<P>
Use credit cards; it's safer to leave cash and checks at home. 
</P>
<P>
Plan to spend a minimum of $4 a day on parking. The farther from the center of 
activity, the cheaper the fee. 
</P>
<P>
The Cooper Building has clean restrooms on every floor. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid the Saturday crowds; if you can't, arrive by 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

MALL ACCIDENTALLY CORNERS THE TOY SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children ricochet from store to store like steel balls in a pinball machine. 
Ping! Disney. Ping! FAO Schwartz. Ping! Sesame Street. 
</P>
<P>
One child in the Sesame Street store at South Coast Plaza starts wailing when 
his mother grabs a toy from his hands and puts it back on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
But when she says, "We're going to go to the Disney store now, let's go to the 
Disney store," he quiets down. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, a woman comes out of the Disney store with her two kids. 
"How much was the dog, Mommy?" one asks. "Expensive," the mother says sweetly. 
</P>
<P>
This is a mall that boasts of being at the cutting edge of retailing. This is a 
collection of stores whose managers beg to be compared not to some mall out in 
the middle of East Nowhere but to a fashionable downtown shopping district in a 
sophisticated city. And now, this is a mall where people shopping for children 
are in for a new experience. 
</P>
<P>
No longer do you schlep a mile to one kids' store, another mile to a second one 
and, for those with the endurance, yet another mile to the third store. Here, 
one can find a bunch of children's stores together, right by the ever-popular 
carousel. 
</P>
<P>
According to mall management, the grouping of the stores happened by accident, 
but that doesn't stop it from being a hit with shoppers, who don't have to 
traverse the entire mall with children in tow to search out the toy stores. 
</P>
<P>
And this isn't just any group of stores. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Disney store, from the folks who turned Mickey Mouse into one of 
history's great merchandising tools. This is FAO Schwartz, whose New York store 
for decades has been a stop on the city's annual Christmas tour, right up there 
with the huge Yuletide tree in Rockefeller Center. And this is Sesame Street, 
which opened its first store here two months ago and which has been on 
television for so many years that its viewers include children whose parents 
grew up on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the kid's area is about to get its biggest test yet with the onset of 
the traditional start of the Christmas shopping season. There are other stores 
that sell children's items near this corner of the mall, but from a child's 
viewpoint, they dilute the experience with yucky stuff like clothes. This trio 
offers toys: stuffed animals, dolls, cartoon books, the sort of stuff kids love 
-- and the sort of stuff that sells. 
</P>
<P>
Where years ago there was a toy store or two and a hobby shop in town, today 
there are super-stores crammed to the rafters with toys and smaller specialty 
stores catering to youngsters and those who buy for them. 
</P>
<P>
"People are . . . willing to spend more money for children because any kind of 
excess you're involved with (in buying for children), there isn't much guilt," 
said Alladi Venkatesh, a UC Irvine marketing professor who specializes in the 
consumer culture. "I can buy 10 gifts for my daughter and . . . feel it's for a 
better part of my life. Investing in children is investing in the future."

Agreeing with him that parents are willing to spend big bucks on their kids was 
Gene Platin, president of the Sesame Street retail stores (a second one opened 
a month ago in the Glendale Galleria). In some cases, Platin said, "Parents 
want to give their children what they never had." In other cases, "Parents want 
to give the kids what they had -- and better." 
</P>
<P>
Venkatesh said that grouping children's stores could signal a new willingness 
to exploit the children's market "in a more systematic way." 
</P>
<P>
Grouping the stores tells shoppers that "yes, we have a particular location 
where you can shop for children" and emphasizes the importance of children's 
goods as a separate consumer niche, the professor said. 
</P>
<P>
While some malls "want the parent to browse through the whole million square 
feet, South Coast has said you don't have to go to areas you don't want to," 
said Platin, adding that South Coast Plaza effectively says: "Come to the area 
where you'll find something for your child." He noted that "parents with 
strollers don't want to browse the whole mall." 
</P>
<P>
Platin said he was happy to have his Sesame Street store near Disney and FAO 
Schwartz. "I think the parents love it," he said. "I know the kids do. They run 
from store to store to store." 
</P>
<P>
It may have been a great idea, but it's all an accident, swears the mall's 
general manager, Jim Henwood. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could tell you we were that brilliant" to group the stores, Henwood 
said, "but I've got to confess, we were not." 
</P>
<P>
When Disney approached South Coast Plaza four years ago about opening a store, 
Henwood said, it wound up with the only spot open at the time. When FAO 
Schwartz needed more space earlier this year, there happened to be a spot open 
right next to Disney. And when Sesame Street came in, "again, not by planning, 
a space happened to come available at the corner that just happened to be 
opposite Disney and FAO Schwartz and near the carousel." 
</P>
<P>
Henwood said he's seeing more families with more children than in years gone 
by, and the latest group of parents "not only have the capacity" to buy lots of 
stuff for the kids, "they have a further refined taste level" that they indulge 
when they buy clothes and toys. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers Gerald and Joan Moch were less interested in the philosophy of 
shopping than the availability of goods on a recent foray through the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting from their home in the New York City suburb of Larchmont on a trip 
combining business and fun, the Mochs were hunting for gifts for their 
grandchildren. "We will probably go into Sesame Street," Gerald Moch said, as 
his wife noticed items in the window display for their grandson. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Moch said she thought the prices in Disney were high, and her husband 
thought FAO Schwartz was crowded. Still, though, "It was a great idea to have 
all the children's things together," Joan Moch said. 
</P>
<P>
Henwood said he has no idea if grouping the high-profile children's stores will 
spark a trend, but he noted that other shopping centers across the country keep 
close tabs on what's going on with South Coast Plaza and try to mimic its 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's Venkatesh said if the idea of clustering stores aimed at one segment of 
the shopping population proves popular, the concept could spread. "I wouldn't 
be surprised if four or five years from now there's a segment for the elderly," 
he said.

A PRO'S CALL TO ORDER; 
</P>
<P>
ORGANIZATION: THE GOAL, SAYS AUTHOR STEPHANIE WINSTON, IS BEING ABLE TO FIND 
WHAT YOU WANT TO FIND WHEN YOU WANT TO FIND IT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The comforting news is that being well organized, as Stephanie Winston defines 
it, does not necessarily mean being neat. Nor does it require doing things in a 
regimented way. "It's a very flexible system -- you apply the basic rules of 
logic and common sense to your own personal situation." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Winston says she does not regard people who are less than well 
organized and tidy as having major character flaws. "You can be Mother Teresa 
or Attila the Hun and be organized or disorganized -- it's not a moral issue." 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: Winston, author of "Getting Organized" (Warner Books), a 
bestseller that has sold more than 500,000 copies since its 1978 publication, 
clearly thinks that being organized is the way to go. It is, as she defines it, 
the ability to find what you want to find when you want to find it, and to do 
what you want to do in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think organization is an extremely important tool for just living your life 
in a more effective way," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Winston is the founder and president of the Organizing Principle, a Manhattan 
consulting company. She wrote "The Organized Executive" (also published by 
Warner Books) in 1983, and is now sifting through interviews with 38 corporate 
executives for a new book due this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Her business clients tend to be senior executives who pay up to $1,500 a day 
for her advice. At Johnson &amp; Johnson, the health-care products company, 
Winston helped Nancy Lane, head of the human-resources division, and her 
secretary to develop more efficient systems for handling everything from travel 
arrangements for Lane's frequent business trips to daily mail. 
</P>
<P>
At Winston's suggestion, the secretary screened the mail, handled as much of it 
herself as she could, and briefed her boss on what she had done. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, the only paper that actually came into my hands was that which 
required me to act on it," Lane says. 
</P>
<P>
Organizing a business is not so different from organizing a household, says 
Winston, who began her career by helping people at home. Almost everyone is 
constitutionally capable of being well-organized, she points out in a recent 
interview. Some come by it instinctively, and others have to learn it, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
For those overwhelmed by the magnitude of certain chores, Winston suggests 
breaking them down into smaller jobs. Many people are so awed by the thought of 
trying to clean their closets and do the job to perfection, she says, that they 
procrastinate. Winston suggests starting with one closet, spending 10 minutes 
to half an hour on it two or three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It may take you a month to get it done," she says, "but so what?" She also 
does not rule out the extra incentive of a reward. The promise of a movie after 
a particularly toilsome task, she says, can help. 
</P>
<P>
Delegating and bartering some time-consuming or less-pleasant chores are also 
possibilities. "The goal should be not necessarily to do the job, but to get it 
done. I don't believe in being a martyr," Winston insists. Hiring a high school 
or college student to do shopping and other errands can be a help, she says. 
Groups of parents may take turns driving one another's children to various 
activities. Spouses can swap home chores to accommodate likes and dislikes. 
</P>
<P>
Friends can profitably barter, Winston says. She cites the example of two women 
who are cousins and close friends. One, an accountant, keeps track of the 
other's finances and pays her bills. The other, who dislikes dealing with 
money, does regular grocery shopping for her friend in return. 
</P>
<P>
To save time at home, Winston suggests, consolidate tasks. That includes 
reserving a chunk of time in which to answer letters, pay bills and return 
phone calls. Winston says she has "in" days for writing and phone calls and 
"out" days to keep appointments and run errands. On "in" days, she often relies 
on an answering machine to avoid interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Winston came by her expertise indirectly. As a political science graduate of 
Barnard College, she took a book-publishing job editing and translating books 
from French to English. After moving to free-lance editing, she decided to go 
on for a Ph.D. in clinical psychology but needed a more reliable income. 
</P>
<P>
She heard about another graduate student financing her studies by helping 
people organize household moves. Since her editing experience also involved 
organizing, making sure that books were logically and coherently put together, 
she decided to work toward becoming a professional organizer. 
</P>
<P>
Winston says she practices what she preaches. Sometimes she purposely lets 
filing work accumulate, she says, so she can attack it for an hour or so when 
she is bored or restless. "Organizing is really a lot of fun, once you get the 
hang of it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding she is not the neatest person in the world, she admits to having a 
"junk chair," as she recommends in her book, on which to put clothes after a 
day's wearing. She says she never lets the clothes accumulate, however, for 
more than three or four days at a time. She also recommends a temporary "junk 
drawer" in the kitchen for odds and ends. 
</P>
<P>
As a recent housewarming gift for her good friends Charles and Norma Fox 
Moxley, Winston reorganized their extensive book collection. The couple was 
moving to a larger apartment partly because the books had taken over many of 
the closets and kitchen cabinets. Winston organized the books, first 
alphabetically by subject -- from history to psychology -- then by author. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the idea of going over to a bookshelf that's well-organized makes you 
much more likely to use it," says Mrs. Moxley. Winston, she notes, also helped 
her reorganize her kitchen in an earlier apartment move. Rarely used utensils 
and pans were stored in boxes under a numbering system that put the least-used 
materials on the highest shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Winston says the rewards of her job are many, although it usually takes a while 
for clients to grasp what's required and be willing to make tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The first few hours together can be quite stressful because I'm suggesting a 
whole different approach to doing things," she says. "But then, all of a sudden 
-- like one of those comic books where the light bulb goes on over someone's 
head -- the situation begins to change and they take over. That shift is very 
exciting. I've had to tell people, 'Hey, I don't think you should throw that 
away!' " 
</P>
<P>
Winston insists that no one can be organized who does not want to be. "Desire 
is key," she says, "and it has to be strong and genuine enough to overcome some 
often very deeply ingrained patterns. You can never organize anyone against 
their will -- never!" 
</P>
<P>
Do clients once taught to mend their ways ever fall back into old habits? 
</P>
<P>
Winston surveyed 40 previous clients a few years ago: Ten said it "didn't 
take." Twenty said there had been improvement and a permanent level of change. 
And 10 said "their lives have been changed; they are now organized people 
forever."

GRANDMOTHER IS MODEL FOR CHINESE; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: BEIJING'S DEBUT INTO WORLD FASHION AS A MAJOR TEXTILE EXPORTER IS 
BRINGING WITH IT A GROWING SENSE OF STYLE FOR CHINESE WOMEN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Xu Xuejing looks much like other plump Chinese grandmothers in gray cotton 
slacks and button-up sleeveless blouse, her steel-gray hair pulled severely 
back in a knot at the nape of her neck. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just the idea for China's oldest fashion model. 
</P>
<P>
Due to convention and lack of choice, older Chinese women tend to favor almost 
identical outfits -- white tunics or blouses, black or gray baggy pants, 
earrings and severe haircuts or buns. They are often elegant in their 
simplicity but rarely fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
But Beijing's debut into world fashion as a major textile exporter, however, 
has brought a growing sense of style for Chinese women. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Lu Shiying established the Beijing Fashion Model Team for Middle-aged 
and Elderly People in 1987 after noticing during a visit to Japan that older 
Japanese women continued to care about fashion long past 40. 
</P>
<P>
"Older people here tend to wear black, white, gray and blue. We look like old 
feudal grandmothers," said Xu, 73. "It's not that we don't love beauty, but we 
just don't dare to make ourselves beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Xu, the daughter of a wealthy Shanghai industrialist, has survived world war, 
civil war and revolution. During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, she and her 
husband, who comes from a similar family background, were branded enemies of 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, she retained the refinement of her upbringing -- an asset that 
helped make her a fashion model at 70, which she decided to try after a 
daughter saw an ad in a newspaper, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After she retired from teaching music at 55, Xu said, "I would just lay on the 
bed day after day. And I suffered so many illnesses that my husband prepared my 
grave and was just waiting for me to die." 
</P>
<P>
Getting out and making new friends has given her a new lease on life, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"These experiences have given me an emotional backbone," Xu said. "I haven't 
been really sick for three years." 
</P>
<P>
A pioneer for her age group, Xu said her modeling skills are self-taught. "I 
can't move like a young person, so I had to figure out for myself how to walk 
to suit my image and appearance." 
</P>
<P>
And her husband, for the first time, has learned to cook for her. 
</P>
<P>
She models at least once a week, often for high-level groups, including the 
National People's Congress, China's legislature. Styles are designed for her 
age group. Below-knee, A-line coats and dresses with high collars feature 
heavily in Lu Shiying's designs. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the catwalk with young models less than half her age can be a real 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"But, what do you know, we older models get the most applause," she said. 
"People tell us that our beauty is different. We represent China's elderly." 
</P>
<P>
"My legs and eyes are bad," she said. "I'm old and ugly. But my heart is 
young."

CHILDREN, LIKE ADULTS, ARE SUFFERING BURNOUT; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: EXPECTATIONS, IMAGES OF PERFECTION, FEARS AND GUILT CAN BRING CHILDREN 
TO THE EDGE OF OVERLOAD.

<P>
The terrible toos afflict children of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Too many expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Too many media images of perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Too many fears. 
</P>
<P>
Too much guilt brought on by too many "shoulds." 
</P>
<P>
These "toos" douse the energy and enthusiasm of too many fired-up kids. 
</P>
<P>
And they ignite another terrible too: too much burnout, a malady that has 
affected parents for some time and has now spread to their children, some as 
young as 7 or 8. 
</P>
<P>
According to Joseph Procaccini, associate professor of education at Loyola 
College in Baltimore and the author of two parenting books, "20 to 30% of kids 
experience some kind of burnout." Procaccini, who has for at least a decade 
focused on parent burnout -- the subject of one of his books -- is expanding 
his interest to the other side of the family. 
</P>
<P>
Child burnout may be relatively minor and fleeting, marked by a temporary lack 
of interest in school or occasional temper tantrums. Or it may persist until a 
child feels trapped and begins dropping out -- socially, mentally, even 
physically -- from school or home. 
</P>
<P>
Burnout happens when the demands on a child outweigh his energy, Procaccini 
says. There is, however, a delicate balance to work with. Imposing demands on 
children is not wrong; it is, in fact, a good way to motivate them, he says. 
When energy and demand are equal, a person is performing at his peak; when 
those demands get out of hand, burnout threatens. 
</P>
<P>
"Unrealistic expectations are the real culprit" in burnout, he says. These 
expectations can come from within a person, from parents and teachers, from 
peers and from the media. 
</P>
<P>
Procaccini lays a good part of the blame on parents. "I think most parents 
overestimate their kids' abilities. Many parents will not accept anything but 
an A," he observes. "There's a whole group of parents out there . . . just 
waiting to get kids into programs" -- soccer teams, computer camps, language 
clubs or tot gym classes. 
</P>
<P>
Children bombarded with unrealistic demands and expectations begin to believe 
that their parents' love is based on their achievements, that it depends on how 
well they do some thing or many things, Procaccini says. 
</P>
<P>
"A burned-out kid is an angry kid," says Procaccini. "To burn out you have to 
be on fire." That fire is fueled by frustration over the conflict between what 
a youngster assumes "should be" and what he knows "is." 
</P>
<P>
Here Procaccini sees television as a big contributor. It is not the programs 
that affect youngsters as much as the advertising that prompts them to "try to 
become something that's impossible to become," he says. Anyone 20 and younger 
has grown up with "constant images of perfection" that lead to "an awful lot of 
anger." 
</P>
<P>
A burned-out child will also feel guilt, which Procaccini describes as anger 
turned inward, over the disparity between "should" and "is." 
</P>
<P>
This anger eats away at a child's energy, he says, imbalancing even further the 
energy-demand scale. 
</P>
<P>
A child's unrealized expectations combine with the stresses that are inherent 
in both childhood and family life. "Stress is caused by change. Change is 
constant. Bodies change, lives change, people change," says Procaccini. "Every 
day in our lives, families are changing." 
</P>
<P>
With 40% of all American families breaking apart, many children have more than 
their normal share of change, he adds. Even children from intact families have 
"a sense of impending loss," because they know so many children from broken 
families. 
</P>
<P>
These natural, and human-derived, stresses add to the possibility of burnout 
among children. 
</P>
<P>
The signs of it are several, says Procaccini: 
</P>
<P>
* Fatigue. A child may become "abnormally sluggish" physically and mentally 
lethargic. 
</P>
<P>
* Irritability. Temper tantrums may become frequent or more intense than usual. 
</P>
<P>
* Mental exhaustion. This is often characterized by forgetfulness, especially 
of well-known facts. 
</P>
<P>
* Paranoia and disassociation. These mark the "serious stage" of burnout, when 
a child is feeling trapped and may be questioning his values, talking about 
dropping out of school or society, and even threatening suicide. 
</P>
<P>
He cautions parents to "factor out normal types of behavior" for their child 
before determining burnout. But, if a parent detects a trapped feeling or 
paranoia, "your child probably needs counseling," he says. 
</P>
<P>
What can a parent do to prevent burnout? 
</P>
<P>
Parents need to show, Procaccini suggests, that their love is unconditional, 
that nothing a child does or fails to do will diminish that love and that 
children do not have the power to make or break their parents emotionally by 
their actions or achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can also foster a tolerance for ambiguity, so children learn that life 
does not work like a math formula: That just because they play -- and play hard 
-- they don't necessarily win. "We're not letting them know that in some areas 
you can be fourth or fifth," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even the best hitters in baseball "fail twice for each hit. The game of life is 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to survive in the '90s, as adults, is to trade off," he says. For 
example, if a woman gets an A-plus this week as a mother, she may get only a C 
in her workplace. She can't get an A-plus in all facets of her life 
simultaneously, he explains. Nor can her children. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can give their children responsibility for their own happiness by 
teaching them they can control their feelings rather than being tossed about by 
others' actions and opinions. "Teach children to establish their own criteria 
by which to judge themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Parents must also listen, he says. "Kids have reached the conclusion that their 
parents don't really know them," Procaccini says. And rather than telling their 
parents who they are, such youngsters suffer silently because they are not the 
children of their parents' imaginations. Hence, "a lot of kids are very lonely 
today," says Procaccini.

MOORPARK FAMILIES BUILD THEIR DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrating Thanksgiving in their own home was a dream come true for Moorpark 
residents Teresa and Samuel Cortes and their 11-year-old son, Samuel Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday marked one year since the Corteses and 20 other families moved into 
the residences they helped build in the Villa Campesina tract under a federal 
housing assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years I dreamed to have a house, my own place, and I have it now," said 
Teresa Cortes, 34. "It's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Cortes, who is credited with initiating the do-it-yourself housing project, 
said her dream began in 1980 when she and her husband were forced to move from 
the house they were renting in Camarillo after their son was born. 
</P>
<P>
"They allowed pets but no children," Cortes said. 
</P>
<P>
For the next nine years, the Cortes family lived in a 26-by-12-foot trailer 
parked behind her grandmother's house in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Cortes, inspired by the need for affordable housing for local 
farm workers and low-income families, formed a housing-rights group called 
Villa Campesina. Cortes had previously worked as a volunteer for the United 
Farm Workers union. 
</P>
<P>
Cortes suggested that the members of Villa Campesina build their own houses. 
</P>
<P>
"They laughed at me," Cortes said. "They thought I was crazy. Then, after we 
started, I thought I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Cortes said the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit agency in 
Ventura that aids in developing low-cost housing throughout the county, 
arranged to get financing for the self-help project through the federal Farmers 
Home Administration. Cabrillo also located a site for the development. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-acre property south of Los Angeles Avenue and east of Liberty Bell Road 
was purchased from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles with $500,000 in Federal 
Community Block Grant Funds, which were appropriated for the project by the 
city of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than 200 families applied for the program, only 62 were selected. 
Each family was required to contribute 40 hours a week on the building of their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Construction supervision was provided by the People's Self Help Housing Corp. 
of San Luis Obispo. Except for the plumbing and electrical work, families were 
required to do everything, from pouring foundations to framing and roofing. 
</P>
<P>
Since last Thanksgiving, 30 additional families have moved into their new 
residences in the tract. The 11 remaining families hope to complete their 
houses by March. 
</P>
<P>
The completed houses have two to five bedrooms and range from 900 to 1,388 
square feet. All the houses were built for less than $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a struggle," Cortes said of the experience of building her own home. 
"To have no construction experience you have to work hard to muster your 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
But Cortes is obviously proud of the three-bedroom home she and her husband 
built at a cost of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it looks like a palace," she said. "It's beautiful. I can say it. I 
made it." 
</P>
<P>
Cortes, who now works as a teaching assistant for Moorpark Unified School 
District, said that without the commitment of the residents of Moorpark and the 
City Council, the project would not have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
"We had support all the way," Cortes said. "This project gives honor to our 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bernardo Perez, who also serves as board president of the Cabrillo 
agency, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Teresa Cortes says that she has benefited from us, but I as an individual have 
benefited from her example and her efforts," Perez said. "Villa Campesina has 
been a blessing to all the families involved and a jewel for the city of 
Moorpark. It's something that all members of the community can look to with 
pride." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cortes and Villa Campesina, which now has 400 members, are 
continuing their efforts to push for more affordable housing throughout Ventura 
County. The group recently persuaded the city of Oxnard to include more 
low-income housing in its new General Plan. It is also rallying support for a 
proposed 100-unit affordable apartment complex in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"The major goal for any human is to have a home, a decent place to live and to 
raise their kids in peace," Cortes said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Your decision to run the article "Black Colleges Enjoy Renaissance" was greatly 
appreciated by us. The article meant so much to the continuance and growth of 
our program, the purpose of which is to expose Black youth to a very positive 
and motivational experience. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the article in The Times, new doors have opened to us, doors we 
didn't even know existed. 
</P>
<P>
We received a call from Mr. Randy St. Martin of the L.A. Theatre Center, who 
would like to perform his one-man show "Color Me Black" at the Theatre Center 
during Black History Month and donate the proceeds to the Black College Tours. 
With the money raised, we intend to offer scholarships at high schools 
throughout the Los Angeles and Compton unified school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The United Negro College Fund called to say that any individual or corporation 
wishing to make a donation to help sponsor a student's tour could do so. Thus, 
they are setting up a restricted fund with all monies collected to be earmarked 
for Black College Tours. 
</P>
<P>
We would like to thank Ms. Jocelyn Stewart for the outstanding job that she did 
on the article. With this type of help, we are certain that we will be able to 
continue to have a positive impact on the lives of the youth of our community.

Auction Fit for a King: Bruce McNall, owner of the Los Angeles Kings, has long 
been a collector and dealer of coins and antiquities, but now he's dipping into 
the antiquities auction business. His company, Hesperia Arts Auction Ltd., is 
staging its first sale on Tuesday night at the Park Lane Hotel in New York. The 
most expensive of the 316 items to be offered are an ancient Greek mirror, 
valued at up to $1 million, and "The Pasquino Group," a marble fragment from a 
Roman copy of a Hellenistic sculpture, which is expected to sell for at least 
$400,000. BETH KLEID

Legal Eagles: So what's the deal with "L.A. Law's" Arnie Becker and Roxanne? 
Will the sleazy-but-lovable divorce attorney and his long-suffering secretary 
on the NBC series ever get together? Susan Ruttan, who plays Roxanne, says she 
and co-star Corbin Bernsen wonder, too. "We fantasize that in the very last 
episode, in the very last year, he'll look at Roxanne and say, 'Oh my gawd, 
it's been you all along!' " Ruttan said this week on her own honeymoon in 
Honolulu. "And she'll go, 'Bleah!' " Ruttan is in Hawaii with her husband of 
three weeks, sound technician and artist Randy McDonald. BETH KLEID

Oh Say Can You See: President Bush told American troops in the Persian Gulf 
Thursday that he has a secret weapon -- Roseanne Barr. 
</P>
<P>
Standing before the camouflage-clad troops with his wife, Barbara, Bush said, 
"You'll be glad to know that if it goes on too long, we have a secret weapon in 
reserve. If push comes to shove, we're going to get Roseanne Barr to go to Iraq 
and sing the national anthem. Baghdad Betty, eat your heart out." Television 
personality Barr received much bad press for an off-putting rendition of the 
national anthem before a major-league baseball game in San Diego last summer.

Disney Deal: The creators of ABC's "The Wonder Years," husband-and-wife team 
Neal Marlens and Carol Black, signed an exclusive deal to create movies and 
television shows for Walt Disney Studios. The agreement, rumored earlier this 
fall but officially announced this week by Disney, calls for the couple to be 
involved in projects for four years. The financial terms of the deal weren't 
released, but early reports estimate the couple will be paid at least $15 
million. BETH KLEID

MULTIFACETED NINJA TURTLES PROVE PERFECT ARENA ROCKSTERSRINCON RECORDS AND 
MATTEL INC. JOINTLY ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE NEWLY FORMED RECORD LABEL HAS 
SIGNED BARBIE, ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR AND RECOGNIZABLE DOLLS FOR OVER 
30 YEARS, TO AN EXCLUSIVE RECORDING AGREEMENT. -- PRESS RELEASE, NOV. 12, 1990

To borrow a phrase: I have seen the future of rock 'n' roll, and its names are 
Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael. 
</P>
<P>
Having conquered Saturday-morning TV, the toy stores and the movies, the 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have moved on to the next inevitable avenue -- 
music -- and, in its current one-dimensional state, it's the perfect vehicle 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
At the Universal Amphitheatre on Wednesday night, in the first of nine shows 
there, the Ninja Turtles did a dead-on parody of flat, pumped-up arena rock, 
and made it seem more genuine in all their reptilian pseudo-naivete than a 
similar show by such experienced human hands as, say, Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The up-from-under-the-streets imagery in the already double-platinum album 
"Coming Out of Our Shells" ("We just kept practicing / We stayed underground / 
'Cause singin' in the sewer / Is a wonderful sound") is nearly as funny as the 
up-from-the-streets self-mythologizing of a Bon Jovi. 
</P>
<P>
Purists will object, of course. But how far back do you have to go to remember 
a time in which rock 'n' roll cartoonishness wasn't a redundancy? Hasn't it 
always been easier to think of Milli Vanilli as life-size representations of 
animated figures, like Charlie Brown at the Ice Capades, than as real people? 
Isn't even Luther Campbell basically Fritz the Cat personified? 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Milli boys, though, there is one potential chink in the 
Turtles' shells, for, at the opening-night show, not everything was as it might 
have seemed. 
</P>
<P>
Lead guitarist Michaelangelo's three-fingered picking technique sounded 
suspiciously like a normal five-fingered technique, and more often than not 
instruments were abandoned altogether while the music played on. 
</P>
<P>
Is the show completely live? If not, can the youth of America stand any more 
disillusionment? Dare we ask if the Ninja Turtles -- we'll say it in pig-Latin 
so the kids can't hear -- iplay ynchsay? For that matter, do turtles have lips? 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with New York's Newsday, Michaelangelo addressed the 
question by comparing the Ninjas' approach to that of several popular dance-pop 
artists. "When we don't have a lot of things to do on stage, we are singing," 
he said. "But when we have some dancing to do . . . we have tracks going so we 
can give the best performance." 
</P>
<P>
If impenetrable green masks left the issue a mystery, there was no question 
that Sherie Scott, playing ace reporter April O'Neil in the show, was singing 
live, and very well, for her lone ballad. Also very much live and apparently 
ad-libbing was the villainous Shredder, who interrupted the show mid-way in his 
ongoing plot to destroy the Ninjas and their mystical rat master Splinter. 
</P>
<P>
Shredder drew boos from the small fry but, as far as the parents present were 
concerned, had all the best lines. ("Turtles, fasten your kneepads -- it's 
going to be a bumpy night! April, I'm going to get you, and your little rat 
too!") He even "shredded" a Flo and Eddie album, claiming he hates those other 
Turtles too. 
</P>
<P>
Mom and Dad may feel the urge early on to drown their turtlemania in a good, 
stiff drink. Don't count on it: Even the Amphitheatre's bars have been taken 
over for use as merchandise counters. Sticking around, though, the folks may be 
pleased to learn that an occasional bit of dialogue has been thrown in 
expressly for them and that, as these experiences go, this well-paced, 
well-produced show is a relatively painless one. 
</P>
<P>
A lot less painful than it'll be taking the kids to see Poison when they get a 
few years older, anyway. Count your blessings, and have another slice of 
pepperoni.

'BLUE PLANET' AT IMAX . . . UP CLOSE AND DISTANT; 
</P>
<P>
FILMED FROM A SPACE SHUTTLE, THE STARTLING VIEWS OF EARTH CONVEY IDEAS AS 
POWERFUL AS THEIR IMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Movies are not only art and entertainment; they're also technology. And the 
technology behind the latest IMAX film, "Blue Planet" (at the Mitsubishi IMAX 
Theater in Exposition Park) is so extraordinary, its impact so overwhelming, 
that it may knock most audiences breathless. Fortunately, "Planet" has ideas as 
potent as its images. 
</P>
<P>
The technical breakthroughs of Cinerama and CinemaScope pale before the 
showpiece shot of "Blue Planet." Taken 330 miles above the Caribbean, through 
the huge pillars of a space shuttle, it reveals the vast blue ball of Earth, 
flecked with pearly, swirling clouds, in dizzying sharp focus far, far below 
us. This is a deep-focus shot that might have made Orson Welles drool, one that 
irresistibly recalls the visionary force of Stanley Kubrick's "2001." On the 
vast IMAX screen -- 8 stories high and 70 feet wide -- it becomes overpowering. 
</P>
<P>
No more so, though, than many other shots in the movie: some from the Serengeti 
plains and Namib deserts of Africa, the volcanic mountains of Hawaii, the 
streets of Paris, San Francisco and Tokyo. The whole plan of "Planet" is to 
show us the Earth in macrocosm and microcosm, to give us the staggering 
totality and then zero in on both the particular and the effects: earthquakes, 
glacial and climatic shifts, the fairyland topography of the clouds, lightning 
leaping between them. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the theme that binds it all together, thanks to writer-editor 
Toni Myers, is ecological. And the implicit call for greater environmental 
conservation and planning doesn't feel forced on the material. Given what we 
see about what is happening to the planet, it's inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
From above, it sometimes seems as if war or awful pestilence were gnawing away 
at us. Whole sections of the Earth in decay or erosion -- in ravenously 
deforested Madagascar, where the hills, barren, red and muddy, slide into the 
sea; in Brazil, where the rain forest is vanishing at the rate of acres a day. 
Most disturbingly, we see the effects of this rampaging erosion and pollution. 
Astronaut James Buchli comments somberly over a side view of the ozone layer -- 
all that protects the world's plethora of life from the airlessness and death 
of outer space: "Not very big, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
The distant eye gives us a sobering picture. Our stewardship of Earth and its 
resources begins to seem reckless, chaotic and wildly self-destructive. 
</P>
<P>
This melancholy theme ties together the spectacular views. Beyond the 
travelogues which have often been the forte of IMAX, "Blue Planet" becomes a 
plea for a rational stewardship of our world -- and a deep-focus hymn to its 
beauty and variety. It doesn't go too far -- less perhaps because, ironically 
enough, one of its principal sponsors was the Lockheed Corp., than because of 
the sheer magnitude of the logistics involved. But the images eloquently speak 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Planet," will alternate with two other excellent IMAX movies, "Chronos" 
and "Grand Canyon." Many of its makers -- Myers, producer Graeme Ferguson, 
principal director Ben Burtt, principal cinematographer David Douglas (assisted 
by, among others, space shuttle astronauts) -- are old IMAX hands. It's clear 
that in this film they're trying to outdo themselves. And have. 
</P>
<P>
If you've never seen an IMAX film -- and parents should be advised that "Blue 
Planet" (Times rated: family) is not only eminently suitable for children, but 
one that youngsters probably should see -- this is almost certainly the one 
with which to begin. Information: (213) 744-2014.

JAZZ NOTES: SNITZER'S 'MOVEMENT' A PHOTOMUSICAL SALUTE TO FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Photographs of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Lester Young, 
Freddie Hubbard and many more, as well as written commentary by James Baldwin, 
Amiri Baraka and others combine to make up "Jazz &amp; the Movement," an 
exhibit by photographer Herb Snitzer at Verve Contemporary Arts that continues 
Mondays-Saturdays through Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"The show is not only about jazz, but about jazz as a metaphor for freedom," 
said Snitzer, a Cambridge, Mass., resident who was a photojournalist for Life 
magazine and an editor at Metronome. "These photographs are images that stand 
for the dignity of black culture and the contributions that black Americans 
have made to the development of American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, Duke Ellington is most often thought of as a bandleader and a 
jazz musician and while that's true, he's also, in my opinion, the greatest 
American composer ever," Snitzer said. "Not a black composer or a black jazz 
composer, but the greatest composer. I think white America has a problem 
thinking that a black person could be the best at anything except basketball." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Snitzer's photographs, the show contains several of his 
collages. "I'm appropriating images, using other people's photographs and 
making new pieces of them, like one where I juxtapose photos of Martin Luther 
King and Jesse Helms, and Robert Mapplethorpe and Helms," he said. "These 
images on the idea of freedom become logical extensions of what jazzmen do with 
their music, express freedom and individuality."

Back in Town: Bill Holman, whose orchestra made one of its far-too-rare 
performances Wednesday at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, recently 
returned from another monthlong stint as composer-arranger with the West German 
Radio Network in Cologne, where he's been appearing once a year for many 
annums. As usual, Holman -- who has gained renown for his work for Stan Kenton, 
Buddy Rich, Woody Herman and Doc Severinsen -- wrote an hour of original music, 
which was played by the network's jazz band live on the air. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to past performances, this year there was no guest soloist. "That 
was kind of fun," said Holman. "I've always depended on the guest and this way 
I got to stretch out a little bit with the program. When you have a guest doing 
more than half of the music, you pin it on them; without them, you go whatever 
direction you want." 
</P>
<P>
Holman dubbed his new piece, "City of Angles." "That's what the Germans call 
L.A., and then there's the hit play in New York ("City of Angels") that Billy 
Byers wrote the charts for. I tried to explain all this to the German audience, 
starting with what an angle is, then what that means in the (entertainment) 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
On the way back, Holman took part in a couple of clinics, including one taught 
by Bob Brookmeyer under the aegis of Broadcast Music Inc. "Brookmeyer got a 
grant from BMI to do a class in beginning and advanced composing. There are a 
lot of pros from around New York town in the latter. Whenever I'm in town, I 
always go up there and put in an appearance." 
</P>
<P>
Brookmeyer, who was first known as valve trombonist with Gerry Mulligan, was a 
member of Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All-Stars in Hermosa Beach in 1956 and '57 
when Holman met him. "I knew he was there and knew of him, met him and when we 
both discovered we liked strong drink to excess, our friendship was formed," 
Holman laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Just Out: Long awaited by cognoscenti, "The Complete Dean Benedetti Recordings 
of Charlie Parker," a 10-LP/7-CD set, has finally been released on Mosaic. The 
package contains 278 previously unheard tracks by the alto marvel, captured in 
1947 and '48 on portable recorders by Benedetti at the Hi-De-Ho club in Los 
Angeles and the Onyx and Three Deuces clubs in New York. Caveat: Sound quality 
is not high end. Available by mail only from Mosaic, 35 Melrose Place, 
Stamford, Conn. 06902.

L-7 SERVES UP A MOIST, INTENSE SET AT THE ROXY

The longer Hollywood grunge masters L-7 stay together, the sloppier they get -- 
but in a good way. At the Roxy on Wednesday night, the guitars howled, the 
riffs were idiot-simple, the vocals approached the wolverine intensity of 
Stooges-era Iggy, and young woman after young woman climbed up on the stage and 
dove into the moiling crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The newest thrash-group star on the Sub Pop Records roster, L-7 is not only the 
wildest live all-female band anybody can think of, but one of the 
hardest-rocking groups, period. This was the quartet's biggest Los Angeles show 
in months, and the packed club reigned sweat. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the headlining Lemonheads -- best-known for their punky version 
of Suzanne Vega's "Luka" -- play precise, Husker Du-flavored power pop, spare, 
unpretentious and just a little too jangly for their own good. The Boston trio 
seems to have bad luck with opening acts: last year it headlined over Mudhoney, 
another Sub Pop band that blew them off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Lemonheads, dominated by school-boy cute singer-guitarist-songwriter Evan 
Dando, isn't bad exactly, even if the new countrified material isn't quite up 
to the chunky college radio stuff the band is best known for. It's just a tad 
too earnest and dull. JONATHAN GOLD

LEFTOVER SWEET SHOW LEAVES SOUR TASTE AT STRAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Are you ready Steve?" No, Sweet's original bassist Steve Priest wasn't there 
Wednesday at the Strand when the group played its first Southern California 
show since 1982. He and original singer Brian Connolly had the good sense to 
leave the group years ago after its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
But don't put it past the remaining original members, guitarist Andy Scott and 
drummer Mick Tucker, to have hired a keyboardist named Steve just so they could 
re-create that classic "Are you ready" intro to Sweet's best-known song, 1975's 
"Ballroom Blitz." The pair certainly showed no other evidence of class 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and Tucker sported poofy hair and leather duds that would look silly on 
Sunset Strip kids 20 years their juniors. And with singer Paul Day, bassist Mal 
McNulty and keyboardist Steve Mann on Wednesday, they played songs that sounded 
silly 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, 15 years ago, that was part of the group's charm. Looking back, 
Sweet's hard-rock-bubblegum style (one critic termed it "Bazooka-rock") was the 
missing link between the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Twisted Sister, a prototype 
for the '80s pop-metal of Motley Crue, Quiet Riot and Poison. 
</P>
<P>
And truth be told, the group's best songs -- "Ballroom Blitz," "Action," the 
teasingly bisexual (though sexist) "A.C.D.C." -- have weathered better than the 
band. Any one of them would make a nice hard-rock diversion on Rhino Records' 
"Have a Nice Day" '70s pop anthologies. But that's hardly enough to justify 
Wednesday's hapless display. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet plays tonight at Spice in Hollywood, Saturday at the Bacchanal in San 
Diego, Sunday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and Monday at the Hop 
in Riverside. STEVE HOCHMAN

STAGE BEAT: 'PEASANT' A SCATHING POLITICAL FOLK TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political theater can be deadly if it's didactic or so satiric that the 
characters become cartoons. But "A Peasant of El Salvador," at the Gene 
Dynarski Theatre, unfolds like a Central American folk tale. There's a 
simplicity about the production that exposes in stark relief the shattering 
odyssey of a village farmer who loses his family and finally his life to 
oppressive U.".-supported government forces. 
</P>
<P>
The play is about campesinos, Central American culture, innocence, betrayal and 
rebellion. In the beginning, when we meet the beguiling entitled character (a 
touching, understated performance by Andres Carranza), the show's heart is 
light, even entertaining, before events close 90 intermissionless minutes later 
with the 1980 killing of Archbishop Oscar Romero and the massacre of peasants 
on the cathedral steps. 
</P>
<P>
Written in 1981 and originally performed by two mime actors in Vermont, the 
play by norte- americanos Peter Gould and Stephen Stearns has been expanded by 
director Del Zamora, with a cast of three men and two women performing multiple 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
Although a wooden narrative device introduces scenes, the production is not 
preachy nor as unsophisticated as it appears. Brechtian devices are at work, 
and its cumulative horror is carefully integrated into the texture. The impact 
of this deceptive drama is in its quiet anger. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5600 Sunset Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m., 
through Dec. 23. $8-$10. (213) 281-8299 or 465-6500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Losing' a Mix of Good Play, Bad Production 
</P>
<P>
We suspect that "Losing It In Cross Plains," at Theatre 40, is a bad production 
of a good play. But some in the audience who occasionally sniggered and 
uncertainly applauded may argue that the show is a good production of a bad 
play. It's interesting theater to fight about. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, our opinion is that Janice Van Horne has written an ambitious, 
demanding play about a troubled family with incestuous poisons that is 
misdirected by Jill Andre at a noisy theatrical pitch. The director's fetish 
for overlapping dialogue, which reaches its shrieking crescendo midway through 
the second act, is enough to drive you from your seat. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, people talk over each other in real life. But it's not wise to make that 
an aural motif on stage. There's one rich performance, a ripely realized 
characterization by Rhonda Lord as the grasping wife of a callow brother (a 
tiresome figure played by James Bartz). Lord's performance is the production's 
single redeeming element. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a dour little girl (Cara Conway, alternating with Danielle Price) 
who wordlessly mopes throughout the play and who has a knife fetish. The father 
and ill-tempered patriarch of this warped clan (Russel Lunday) is senile and 
vulgar. His daughter (Jenifer Parker) is wearisome. The old reprobate's sister 
(Gloria Lord) and a sane drifter (Andre Barron) complete the homestead. 
</P>
<P>
In all this bad blood, with momentary full-lipped kisses between brothers and 
sisters, you should still feel empathy for these forlorn people. But all you 
feel is a ringing in your ears. 
</P>
<P>
 At 241 Moreno Drive, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m. and 
7 p.m., through Dec. 16. $12-$15. (213) 466-1767. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
'Party' a Spontaneous, Cagey Brew at the Cast 
</P>
<P>
Remember "Animal House"? L.A. theater has found its answer to that movie. It's 
called "Party Mix." Hey, Dude, where's the beer? 
</P>
<P>
There's overlapping dialogue here, too, but playwright Justin Tanner stages 
this madhouse of a spontaneous party at the Cast Theatre with cagey 
craftsmanship. The seemingly endless collection of characters (thanks to 
multiple role-playing) appear to have materialized off a dank Hollywood street 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone will have a favorite character, but ours is Thea Constantine's brassy 
street girl, her black hair scrunched up in a garish knot like a bird's nest. 
Whiney Laurel Green and screechy Shawna Casey are probably your neighbors if 
not your kids. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen dump of a set, with the suggestion of a cozy makeout parlor in the 
back, was designed by hulking Andy Daley, who also is part of the grungy 
ensemble (and co-wrote the now cult-status Cast hit "Zombie Attack" with 
Tanner). 
</P>
<P>
 "Party Mix" is affable in its messiness, lifelike and endearing as some dumb 
parties are. 
</P>
<P>
At 804 N. El Centro Ave., Wednesdays through Fridays, 8 p.m., though Dec. 31. 
$10; (213) 462-0265. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hughes' 'Horniness' a Touch of Dyke Noir 
</P>
<P>
Rape, lust, boiler room female cops, women who drive each other crazy. This 
show isn't a mere play -- as the host of this hard-boiled radio drama says on 
stage, "It's the Welllllll! . . . of Horniness." 
</P>
<P>
Seen any dyke noir theater lately? The Celebration Theatre brings you Holly 
Hughes' pulp rendition of sordid frightfulness, a slapstick brew which plays 
like a lesbian's fantasy of "The Heidi Chronicles." Unable to resist her lust, 
the lascivious, goldilocked Lacy Gardner slips under a table in a fancy public 
restaurant to make love to her dinner companion, her derriere bobbing in the 
air. Who said lesbians can't make fun of themselves? 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Hughes, of course, "the Sapphic Supervixen" as the program touts 
her, is one of the "NEA Four" who were rebuffed by the National Endowment for 
the Arts. She's not in the show, which is too bad because, while outrageous, it 
could use her danger. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Claudia Lake, the production is burlesque, like a dumb, baggy pants 
vaudeville skit extended over two acts. No matter what your persuasion, there 
are riffs and whiffs of erotic images -- hemlines and legs entangled up, double 
entendres, that sort of thing -- all in the spirit of "The Welllllll! of 
Horniness." 
</P>
<P>
 At 426 N. Hoover Ave., Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; through 
Dec. 16. $12-$15. (213) 666-8669.

Solid Acting, Direction in IgLoo Double Bill 
</P>
<P>
Karma Theatre, at a venue aptly called the IgLoo, is staging a pair of 
two-character one-acts, notable for solid acting and direction on a squalid set 
and dank stage. Budget imperatives aside, the work deserves more imaginative 
production values. 
</P>
<P>
What redeems the evening is "Spittin' Image," another post-Vietnam drama from 
Stephen Metcalfe, author of "Strange Snow." It features a gripping performance 
by Michael Newland as a boisterous but lonely truck driver visiting the younger 
brother of a buddy killed in the war. Newland's pain disguised as bluster is 
delicately shaded by director Bruce McIntosh. The comparatively passive Shane 
Patrick McCullough does well in an essentially reactive role. 
</P>
<P>
The second and shorter show, "Final Placement" by Ara Watson and Mary 
Gallagher, dramatizes a meeting between a harried social worker (Victoria Haas) 
and a disturbed, dim child abuser (Amy Lloyd). Director Max Mutchnick 
calibrates the growing tension. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6543 Santa Monica Blvd., Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m., indefinitely. $10; 
(213) 960-8870. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sliding Dog' a Movie Biz Joke Sans Laugh 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Redfield, a charter member of the trailblazing Company Theatre of the 
'60s, would appear particularly suited to direct the bizarre comedy "Sliding 
Dog" by the Actors Conservatory Ensemble at the Lex. But this Hollywood 
industry comedy by Richard Evans would defeat any director. 
</P>
<P>
The play is maddening, by turns self-conscious, arty, talky, silly, 
incomprehensible. It's a maze of dead-end verbosity, non sequiturs, L.A. 
imagery, cars, dementia. In movie terms, it's a fractured mixture of "Sunset 
Boulevard," "Day of the Locust" and "Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
The actors survive. Burr DeBenning is amusingly florid and arch and Mark 
Haining's scurrying, wheel chair-bound landlord is fun. John Westmoreland's 
inventive set design, full of eye-popping welding effects from Evans and Robert 
Moore, is the star of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6760 Lexington Ave., Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m., through Dec. 9. $10; 
(213) 463-6244.

1 NEAR HIT, 1 CLEAR MISS IN 'RARE BIRDS' AT THEATRE OF NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marvel Mohat's "Confessions of a Temporary Secretary," the opener in Theatre of 
NOTE's evening of two one-acts under the umbrella title of "Rare Birds," is a 
totally dismissible hourlong skit with a large cast that is also dismissible, 
at least under the overblown, frantic direction of Ed de' Leal. The same 
material is covered in about 60 seconds by Mass Hysteria (see following 
review). 
</P>
<P>
Paul Selig's "Moon City" is of much more interest, though its style and 
statement are firmly rooted in the early '70s. There's not a man nor boy in 
Moon City who's safe from the erotic clutches of Nancy Huckaby. Her current 
trick is 15-year-old Georgie, a friend of her brother Cubby, a pyromaniac who 
gets his sexual kicks at a nearby military base. Nancy's retarded friend Lila 
gets in on the libidinous action, and even Mama, after two strokes, has a shot 
at Georgie. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the play is treated with compassion and a lot of fun by director 
Roxanne Rogers, who sure knows how to make the genre work. She gets good 
performances out of the whole cast, but particularly Karen Hott as Nancy, 
Brooks Ann Hayes as the nutty mental deficient, and James Jonathan Green as 
Georgie, a kid with a landing strip between his ears. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1705 N. Kenmore Ave., Hollywood; Fridays &amp; Saturdays,8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 
p.m.; endsDec. 9. $10; (213) 666-5550.

An Amicable 'Life' at Tamarind Theatre 
</P>
<P>
A member of the comedy troupe Mass Hysteria announces at the start that the 
group's split (with director Robin Menken) from Second City was "amicable." 
Their late-night show, "Life on the Sidewalk" at the Tamarind Theatre, is 
amicable too, but that's about all. 
</P>
<P>
The audience didn't find one belly laugh in the hour, and few hearty chuckles. 
It's not that the group isn't talented -- it's not that the material is dull. 
There just isn't much to laugh at. 
</P>
<P>
They cover a gamut of subjects from a doctor who jokes about death to the 
jungle of temporary office help, but the only two pieces that get a rise out of 
the audience are an intellectually bright vocal chorale on procrastination and 
a bitter, funny blackout about a nerd trying to communicate with more popular 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood; Fridays &amp; Saturdays, 11 p.m.; added 9 
p.m. shows today and Saturday; ends Dec. 15. $10; (213) 466-1767.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: WHEN YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought it was over. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No, not leftovers, it's the Turkey Basket, a new downtown restaurant devoted to 
the great wattled bird: all turkey, all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh," said the man in the Brooks Brothers suit, "I hope you like turkey." 
</P>
<P>
"Well," said his Anne Klein II girlfriend, scanning the menu -- turkey dogs, 
turkey burgers, turkey tacos (both hard-shell and soft), teriyaki turkey bowl, 
etc. -- "we could go to Carl's Jr." Maybe she didn't notice the turkey pasta 
primavera or the turkey Parmesan or the Gobb salad (like a Cobb, but with . . . 
turkey). 
</P>
<P>
At the Turkey Basket, every day is Thanksgiving day and there's always enough 
turkey to go around. Ever eat a salad with grilled turkey, goat cheese and 
sun-dried tomatoes? 
</P>
<P>
Cheery floral tablecloths, a fireplace (fake) topped with 
forever-autumn-colored dried flowers, and one of the most spectacular views of 
the downtown skyline might be the Turkey Basket's way of making you forget that 
you've ordered your bird at a fast-food counter. 
</P>
<P>
Set a number on your table, Sizzler-style, and in a few minutes a waiter 
appears with, say, a carved turkey platter (it comes with stuffing, cranberry 
compote, corn bread, baked yams, coleslaw), Cajun turkey rice, a turkey piccata 
plate. . . . "And here's your cholesterol-free garlic bread," he says. The 
waiters at the Turkey Basket care about your health. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turkey Basket, third level, 444 S. Flower St., Los Angeles; (213) 
892-9500. Entrees $1.99-$6.99.

A YEN FOR EXOTIC TASTES OF EAST AND WEST AT O'TOTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
O'toto is semi-distinctive. The front of the dining room, up by the windows, is 
decently whitewashed while the rest is full of the standard exposed ducts and 
unpainted struts and beams. Vertical neon lights hang from the ceiling like 
"Star Wars" swords; peeler logs swing overhead in the glass alley through which 
you enter. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, it's a pleasant place, blending Japanese austerity and American 
funk. You could imagine hanging out here, but being on slightly better behavior 
than at home. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is semi-distinctive too -- a California melange with Italian and 
Southwestern elements, but heavier on the Asian side than usual (chef Jeanette 
Holley grew up in Japan and Korea) and occasionally quite American. It has a 
terrific tuna tempura salad, for instance: a chunk of rare tuna in very thin 
batter, served with daikon and greens in peanut oil vinaigrette. But the best 
of the entrees is ravioli filled with fontina cheese and butternut squash, the 
startlingly sweet, rich flavor shrewdly cut with faintly bitter olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, there is a very beefy meatloaf flavored with bits of 
onion and sweet pepper in a gravy-like wine sauce. The spicy scallops with 
fried shredded leek taste -- leek topping aside -- like something that could 
have come from Paul Prudhomme. Pork loin comes with an exotic sweet-and-sour 
accompaniment that is at bottom good old American bread dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly we're talking about California Cuisine here. Appetizers such as new 
potatoes in olive sauce (tapenade); a soft, luscious goat cheese flan with 
heavily grilled (practically charcoalized) Japanese eggplant; shredded green 
papaya with shrimp. The soup of the day might be a puree of carrot with a 
clever note of ginger. 
</P>
<P>
The most exotic of the appetizers by far is the sticky rice tamale in bamboo. 
It's not much like a tamale, really -- it's something in the Vietnamese or Thai 
line, a small triangular loaf steamed in a bamboo leaf packet. The rice, which 
is very sticky indeed, has a salty soy flavor; the filling is like corned beef. 
It grows on you, but it's still a pretty monochromatic dish. 
</P>
<P>
Some things here don't work very well at all, though. I once had an appetizer 
of fried sea bass served on a salad overpoweringly flavored with tarragon. It 
was something between a salad and a sour licorice dish. 
</P>
<P>
Tongue with epazote is not an insane combination (the sauce is like an 
understated mole) but the texture of the thin-sliced tongue is a lot like wet 
flannel. Garlic chicken with aglioli sauce is like any roast garlic chicken, 
but O'toto's other chicken dish -- stuffed with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes 
and olives in orange sauce with about a bale of rosemary -- is like being 
mugged. At least one of those ingredients, and a lot of that rosemary, has got 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the desserts are two diametrically opposed cheesecakes. One is 
warmly flavored with a Japanese pumpkin called kabocha and served in syrup, the 
other quite tart -- like the usual cheesecake's sour cream frosting all the way 
through -- with little bursts of ginger flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a cardamom-spiced pear crisp with rose-flavored cream is a little 
over the edge, but it works pretty well, and the name certainly tells you what 
to expect. On special there has been a walnut orange torte that tasted good 
too, accompanied by stewed apricots and some whipped cream sprinkled with 
walnuts. However, it had the sort of angel food texture that calls for a bread 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
I'd stay away from the ices. The horchata ice tastes of little but cinnamon and 
clove, and the "cookies of the world" that accompany it are pretty ordinary. 
The Japanese plum mousse has dry, granular texture, like something that has 
been refrozen before serving. 
</P>
<P>
Stick to the ravioli, the meatloaf and the cheesecake and you'll be fine (well, 
don't forget about the tuna salad -- tuna tempura salad, that is). If you do, 
O'toto is OK. 
</P>

THATCHER STEPS DOWN; THREE VIE FOR HER POST; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: THE PRIME MINISTER HAD NEVER LOST AN ELECTION. TORIES WILL CHOOSE A 
NEW LEADER AS EARLY AS NEXT TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Margaret Thatcher, beset by a challenge from within her own ruling party, 
stunned Britain on Thursday by resigning as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's decision to step down under fire came during a fractious fight for 
the Conservative Party leadership -- and only a day after she had vowed in the 
House of Commons: "I fight on. I fight to win." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, her own closest aides convinced her that the challenge mounted by 
former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had left her seriously wounded, and 
they warned her that Heseltine could defeat her in the next test for the party 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The feisty, right-wing Thatcher has been prime minister longer than any other 
British leader in this century and has never lost an election. 
</P>
<P>
Her decision threw wide open the contest for the leadership of Britain's ruling 
party -- and, automatically, the prime minister's post. By the noon Thursday 
deadline for entering the race, three prominent Tories -- Heseltine, former 
Deputy Prime Minister Douglas Hurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major 
-- had declared their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Thatcher will remain prime minister and party chief until the 
Tories elect a new leader, who will then become prime minister. That could come 
as early as next Tuesday, when the party gathers to vote on its leadership. 
</P>
<P>
When news of her resignation swept through the houses of Parliament Thursday 
morning, some of her supporters were seen to be in tears. 
</P>
<P>
One of those, Home Secretary David Waddington, said: "I have never been sadder 
in all my life. She was a great leader, and the last thing I wanted was to see 
her step down in this way." 
</P>
<P>
But in the afternoon, Thatcher -- whom some have dubbed "the Iron Lady" -- 
demonstrated that she was still the head of government, giving a bravura 
performance in the House of Commons as she argued against a no-confidence 
motion introduced by Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his motion, Kinnock said, "There isn't much of a government to have 
no confidence in." 
</P>
<P>
But buoyed by her tough, effective speech defending her government's record, 
the Tories roundly defeated the no-confidence measure, 367 to 247. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher then summarily rejected a call by Kinnock that new national elections 
be called immediately. The next general election must be held before mid-1992, 
but the precise timing is up to the prime minister. Thus, considering their 
comfortable majority in Parliament, the Conservatives will remain in power for 
another 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
In the raucous Commons session, Thatcher seemed relaxed, winning both laughter 
and applause, even from some of her longtime critics. Wearing her trademark 
bright blue suit, she castigated the opposition with a vintage performance and 
at one point declared, "I'm enjoying this." 
</P>
<P>
"You can wipe the floor with these people," interjected one of her supporters, 
and Thatcher responded with an elaborate bow. 
</P>
<P>
She was relentless in defending her policies. "We are no longer the sick man of 
Europe," she declared to the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, after she commented on the notion of a central European bank, 
which she has long opposed, Laborite Dennis Skinner jokingly called out that 
she herself could become the bank's governor. 
</P>
<P>
She did a double take, then exclaimed, "What a good idea!" 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's agonizing decision was prompted by the challenge of former Defense 
Secretary Heseltine, who ran against her in the first ballot for party leader 
last Tuesday and succeeded in forcing her into a runoff. The second round now 
will be held without her. 
</P>
<P>
After Thatcher's resignation, two of her Cabinet colleagues announced their 
candidacy for the party leadership: Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, 60, and 
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, 47, both viewed as "stop-Heseltine" 
men. 
</P>
<P>
If none of the three candidates gains a simple majority of the 372 Conservative 
members of the House of Commons on Tuesday, a final election will be held two 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's dramatic announcement came a day after she had participated in the 
34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which she was 
the senior major national leader in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the news, her fellow world leaders expressed their sorrow at the 
prospect of her leaving the world stage, one on which she played a powerful 
role during her three consecutive terms and 11 1/2 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
In all, she spent a total of 4,220 days at 10 Downing St., a time in which 
Britain's first woman prime minister led the country in the 1982 Falkland 
Islands War and survived an assassination attempt in 1984 when the Irish 
Republican Army bombed the site of a party conference in Brighton. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who counted Thatcher as one of his staunchest allies, said in 
Saudi Arabia, where he was visiting U.". troops: 
</P>
<P>
"Margaret Thatcher was an outstanding prime minister and an outstanding ally 
for the United States. You always knew where she was and what she believed. 
I'll miss her." 
</P>
<P>
A U." Marine was overheard telling the President: "I thought she'd duke it 
out," and Bush replied, "So did I." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, former President Ronald Reagan, who was always grateful for 
Thatcher's support of his conservative stance in foreign affairs, praised her 
"bold and visionary policies," which he said restored Britain to greatness. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Iraqi government spokesman Naji Hadithi declared: "This is most 
welcome news. Anyone who replaces her would be better than she was." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher was notable in her support for Bush's military commitment against Iraq 
in the Persian Gulf. And, holding true to form, she had Defense Secretary Tom 
King announce Thursday that Britain was sending an additional 14,000 troops to 
the multinational force in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher was the first among Western leaders to welcome the advent of Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to prominence. It was the Russians who 
christened her "the Iron Lady." 
</P>
<P>
She was first elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, deposing 
defeated Prime Minister Edward Heath. In 1979, she led the Tories to victory 
over Labor, then beat the opposition again in 1983 and 1987. She was Britain's 
first prime minister since the 19th Century to win three national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls showed that the party was generally more popular than she -- due, 
political commentators said, to her often abrasive and authoritive manner, 
which she carried into relations with her Cabinet members. 
</P>
<P>
Her decision to push for the so-called poll or head tax as the basic community 
fund-raising device was widely unpopular. And inflation and mortgages were 
recently at a near high for her government. 
</P>
<P>
But the immediate events leading to her downfall began with the summit meeting 
of the 12-member European Community in Rome late last month, when she found 
herself, as usual, as the odd leader out -- the lone objector to proposals for 
a common currency. 
</P>
<P>
On her return to London, she gave a reasoned defense of her policy to the House 
of Commons but then, in the give-and-take of questioning, sounded particularly 
shrill in her comments against the Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
This upset Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe, whom she had removed from the 
foreign secretary's post. On Nov. 1, Howe resigned over Thatcher's lack of 
commitment to a strong British role in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 13, Howe, who had been regarded as a dedicated Thatcher loyalist, 
electrified the House of Commons with a scathing speech giving his reasons for 
his resignation. He openly criticized Thatcher and, in the view of many 
observers, inflicted irreparable damage to her. 
</P>
<P>
That opened the door for Heseltine, 57, who has long been regarded as the 
strongest potential challenger to her leadership and who had resigned from the 
Cabinet as defense secretary in 1986 over his differences with Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine announced his candidacy for the leadership, and last Tuesday, while 
Thatcher was at the Paris summit, ran well against her, holding her lead to 
only 55%. 
</P>
<P>
Under the party's complicated rules, Thatcher needed a majority plus 15% of the 
votes of the 372 Tory members, which she narrowly failed to get, in part 
because of the poor performance attributed to her campaign leaders in the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the prime minister reacted in typical fashion: In Paris on Tuesday 
and back in London on Wednesday afternoon, she vowed to fight Heseltine to the 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
But late Wednesday, a steady stream of ministers and aides -- dubbed the "men 
in gray suits" -- called at 10 Downing St., most of them warning her that she 
might lose next Tuesday's second ballot against Heseltine. Her husband, Denis, 
also reportedly urged her to step down. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than face the humiliation of defeat against a "backbench" member of 
Parliament -- one who is not a party leader -- the prime minister reflected 
long and hard and then, on Thursday morning, decided to step down, political 
sources said. She was driven to Buckingham Palace to inform -ueen Elizabeth II, 
who ultimately appoints prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Her official announcement said: "Having consulted widely among colleagues, I 
have concluded that the unity of the party and prospects of victory in a 
general election would be better served if I stood down to enable Cabinet 
colleagues to enter the ballot for the leadership." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Thatcher was forced from office -- a development that has surprised 
and confused many observers abroad, since she still has not lost any election. 
</P>
<P>
The question raised in political circles Thursday was whether Heseltine's 
action would help or hurt the party in the run-up to the next election. 
Heseltine has run well ahead of Thatcher in nationwide opinion polls, but his 
opposition to the prime minister will be held against him by many colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's daughter, Carol, spoke for many loyalists when she said of the 
actions that forced her mother's resignation: "I think it is the most gutless 
act of treachery -- after all she has done." 
</P>
<P>
Member of Parliament Alan Clark declared of the Tories' leadership vote last 
Tuesday: "It was a cowardly act to save their seats. They hid behind a cloak of 
anonymity and voted against a leader who had run three elections. 
</P>
<P>
"She was elected by 30 million people and tossed out by 150." 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit, a Thatcher loyalist, said, "I think this was 
a dreadful mistake, dumping the prime minister." 
</P>
<P>
Novelist Jeffrey Archer, a former deputy Tory chairman, said, "For all the 
wrong reasons, we have lost the greatest peacetime leader of this century." 
</P>
<P>
Party Chairman Kenneth Baker, who urged her to stay in the race, said: "I am 
very sad. It was a typically brave and selfless decision. She was an 
outstanding leader of our country and the world. I do not believe we will see 
her like again." 
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Prime Minister Howe, who began the erosion of her position, said, 
"She will always be remembered as one of the greatest political leaders in our 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Of the three candidates for the Conservative leadership, there is still no 
clear favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, who ran so strongly against Thatcher last week, would seem to be the 
front-runner, but some Tory lawmakers are thought to have voted for him mainly 
as a way of casting a ballot against Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Heseltine said of the resignation, "She has made a remarkable 
contribution to Britain's history and has led the country with great 
distinction in the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Hurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer Major, who are friends, said they both 
decided to join Heseltine in the race so that their colleagues could choose the 
candidate most likely to unify the party and take it into the next general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
As Hurd put it, "We could have done this in a smoke-filled room, but this is 
the more open way for the party to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Both he and Major have wide appeal among their colleagues in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd is the most experienced in tough jobs. He was a secretary for Northern 
Ireland and the Home Office before becoming foreign secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Major, 47, is the bright young man of the party, who seems to have few enemies. 
However, some of his colleagues suggest that because of his youth, he may 
comfortably be passed over for now. 
</P>
<P>
Edwina Currie, a controversial member of Parliament who was forced out of the 
Thatcher government and is a Heseltine supporter, argued Thursday that the 
three-man race is an "undignified scramble." 
</P>
<P>
"At a time like this, the Cabinet should be sticking together and putting 
forward one name," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For Thatcher's supporters, her bold handling of the Laborites' no-confidence 
motion Thursday made her departure from government even more difficult to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
But, as one said, "there are no happy endings in politics." 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide reaction to Thatcher's announcement reflects admiration for her 
achievements. A22

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Charles Thurman Sinclair died of a heart attack in an Anchorage, Alaska, 
jail cell last month, he was mourned by his family and by dozens of detectives 
in police departments from Missouri to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
His relatives saw the loss of a sportsman and loving family man. Detectives, 
however, lost the chance to question the man they are convinced left a trail of 
bodies across the West. Police and the FBI have linked Sinclair, 44, a former 
coin-shop owner, to 11 homicides, one attempted murder and two rapes. He may be 
responsible for 15 murders, authorities believe. 
</P>
<P>
The murders began 10 years ago. Many victims were coin dealers who were also 
robbed. But it wasn't until this summer that investigators in several states, 
who had been trying to solve separate crimes, suddenly realized they were all 
looking for the same man. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the unique joinings of police departments" in a widespread 
investigation, said Pete Piccini, a deputy sheriff in Jefferson County, Wash. 
Piccini became involved while investigating the disappearance and presumed 
murder of a vacationing California couple. 
</P>
<P>
"We all felt (Sinclair) was a serial killer of the same stature of oTed Bundy," 
he said, referring to the now executed Florida sex murderer who was convicted 
of three murders but suspected of dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still working on known and unknown crimes," FBI special agent Ken 
Marischen said in Anchorage. "There's a lot of unanswered questions. The only 
one we know knew the whole story took it to the grave with him." 
</P>
<P>
The break came when police in Billings, Mont., began investigating the July 31 
murders of Charles Sparboe, a 60-year-old coin shop owner, and his assistant 
Catharine Newstrom, 47. Both had been shot in the head. Some $54,000 in coins 
and gold was taken from Sparboe's shop. 
</P>
<P>
A composite drawing of the suspect provided by Sparboe's son and a description 
of the crime sent out by Billings police triggered recognition in several squad 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The common link between most of the murders was coins. A killer, a beguiling 
character who talked a lot, would go to a coin shop, often many times, 
pretending to be a customer, but in fact stalking his victims. The victims 
would get used to seeing him. Then one day he would return, usually near 
closing time, rob and shoot to kill with a small-caliber weapon -- always in 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
According to police accounts the unsolved crimes linked to Sinclair include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Everett, Wash., murder of David Sutton on Jan. 27, 1980. He was found 
in his antique shop, dead from a gunshot wound to the head from a .38-caliber 
gun. Some $80,000 worth of silver dollars was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A similar robbery and killing of Mishawaka, Ind., coin shop manager Thomas 
Rohr on Aug. 28, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vacaville, Calif., killing of coin-shop owner Ruben Lucky Williams on 
Nov. 1, 1986, also shot in the head and robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Spokane, Wash., robbery-homicide of coin-shop owner Leo Cashatt, shot 
in the head July 14, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Kansas City, Mo., killing of LeRoy Hoffman on March 12, 1988. Coins 
worth several thousand dollars were missing. A stranger who said he was a local 
farmer had been in the store several times before this murder. The farmer 
wanted to sell his coins, and on the day Hoffman died, the shop owner told his 
wife he was going to buy a "large collection." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Murray, Utah, on May 4 of this year Legacy Coin shop co-owner Kelly 
Finnegan was shot in the head with a small-caliber gun, but survived. Finnegan 
said the shooter had recently been in the store several times before, saying he 
was from Texas. Finnegan described his attacker as a polite, friendly man who 
had said he wanted to buy coins. Instead, after the shooting he stole about 
$60,000 worth of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"I had gotten used to him," the 29-year-old Finnegan recently recalled, so he 
didn't worry that "Jim Stockton" was hanging about as he put his valuables in 
his safe at closing time that day. "He mumbled something that sounded to me 
like 'you dumb bastard.' He said it very lightly, and I turned around to say: 
'What?' In that split second he shot me." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Finnegan turned his head saved his life, he believes. The bullet 
pierced his forehead, but he was not seriously wounded and stayed conscious. He 
fell to the floor, pretending to be dead. The man he later identified as 
Sinclair walked back and forth across his body for several minutes, removing 
gold and rare coins. 
</P>
<P>
Finnegan interpreted Sinclair's final remark to him, he said, as "that I was 
dumb to trust him, I let my guard down, so he won the game." 
</P>
<P>
Officials were also looking into Sinclair's relationship to other crimes in 
northwest Washington not related to coin shops: namely, the disappearance of 
the vacationing California couple in August, 1986, the rape of a real estate 
agent that same month and the November, 1987, kidnaping and killings of a 
vacationing Canadian couple, including the rape of the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Until the the Billings murders of Sparboe and Newstrom on that hot July 
afternoon, neither the various state authorities nor the FBI had been aware of 
a possible serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
The connection between Sinclair to this and other crimes emerged not long after 
detectives arrived at the Treasure State Silver &amp; Gold coin shop on 
Billings' Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
A flamboyant self-made millionaire, Sparboe had real estate and other 
interests, but spent most of his time at his 10-year-old coin shop, an 
expression of his lifelong hobby. Newstrom was his likable assistant, the 
mother of two who had worked for Sparboe for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the execution-style murders left some locals wondering if the 
tough-minded and occasionally outspoken shop owner had stepped on someone's 
toes once too often, and paid for it with his life. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Sparboe died only because he owned a coin store. But unlike 
most of the other victims, he had provided a clue to his killer. 
</P>
<P>
Sparboe voiced concern about an odd new customer who was hanging around. 
Because he did, Sparboe's son Jim and others remembered the man well, and their 
composite drawing led to the identification of Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Sparboe recalled that the customer said he was a "farmer from Laurel, 15 
miles up the road." The customer told a story police later found remarkably 
similar to one told by the customer in the Kansas City murder. The man said he 
was "selling his farm, for $130,000, and wanted to invest the money" in gold, 
Jim Sparboe said. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Sparboe wondered why the man, with a gap between his front teeth and 
a scar on his right hand, had parked a silver Pontiac some distance away, and 
then walked up. Jim Sparboe noticed the man had "banker-smooth hands," not 
those of a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
The third time the man appeared, the younger Sparboe left the store, leaving 
the "farmer" alone with his father and Newstrom. When he returned, he found his 
father and Newstrom dead. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, Billings Det. Sgt. Jerry Archer, who led his department's 
investigation, had sent a description of the crime and the suspect out on the 
police teletype. Within a day, Spokane police responded that they "had a 
similar crime" -- the July, 1987, killing of coin shop owner Leo Cashatt. 
</P>
<P>
Murray police also responded, because of the Finnegan case. 
</P>
<P>
Billings police sent out their composite drawing. Spokane detectives again 
called back to say another shop owner recognized it as a customer from last 
April named J.C. Weir. In time, police would find that name to be an alias for 
Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
Washington state listed a silver Pontiac registered to a J.C. Weir, and 
"Spokane let me know this man's driver's license in Washington had been 
surrendered in Wyoming," Archer said. So Billings detectives contacted Wyoming 
officials in Jackson Hole, the Wyoming address listed on the new license. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies there said the address was phony. But they found a silver 
Pontiac at the local airport. Inside was a .22-caliber handgun, a silencer and 
coin wrappings from Sparboe's shop. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Jefferson County, Wash., Deputy Piccini was still working the 
unsolved 1986 disappearance of Robert and Dagmar Linton of Stockton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the couple disappeared while camping on the Olympic Peninsula, a 
large, bearded white male with a bandaged right hand had been seen using the 
Lintons' credit cards to buy several items, including an expensive clarinet. 
The Lintons' truck was later found at the Seattle-Tacoma airport. 
</P>
<P>
Piccini saw the original Billings teletype but at first discounted a link, he 
said, because the man using the Lintons' cards was bearded. But then he learned 
through Billings police that the suspect they were tracking had lived in 
Deming, Wash., not far from where a Linton credit card was first used. 
</P>
<P>
Pursuing his own investigation in Deming, Piccini discovered that the suspect's 
teen-age daughter played the clarinet, and that her school records had been 
transferred from Washington to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Airline personnel at Jackson Hole told Billings detectives that a J.C. Weir had 
flown to Anchorage two days after the Sparboe-Newstrom murders. Additional 
inquiries revealed that he was picked up by his wife, Debbie, who then sold 
about $15,000 worth of gold there. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair had moved with his wife and two children to Kenny Lake, an isolated 
enclave about 85 miles north of Valdez. Alaska state troopers, with Archer and 
another Billings detective along, arrested the burly outdoorsman there on Aug. 
13. Archer noticed a gap between the suspect's front teeth and a scar on his 
right hand. He also had one of Kelly Finnegan's watches in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Piccini obtained a search warrant to go through the family's belongings kept in 
storage units in Washington. Officers found unspecified items linking Sinclair 
to the Spokane and Vacaville murders. "And we came up with the clarinet" 
purchased with the Linton credit card, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair was the youngest of four children from a working class family in Jal, 
a small oil and gas town in the southeastern corner of New Mexico. The real 
J.C. Weir was a former classmate at Jal High School. 
</P>
<P>
His father died when Sinclair was young, townspeople remember, and his mother 
supported the family by running a coin laundry and taking in ironing. "He was 
an average student, not particularly different from anyone else," John Cooper, 
one of his former teachers recalled. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime coin buff, Sinclair started a coin shop during the 1970s in Hobbs, 
40 miles north of Jal, using his own collection as a base. 
</P>
<P>
He did well, locals recalled, and then branched out to selling guns. He renamed 
his shop the Shooter's Supply and catered to people who could afford $800 to 
$1,000 hunting rifles, collectible guns and even automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair was apparently well-liked, widely remembered as a friendly, outgoing 
man who " could talk to anybody." He and his wife, daughter Pam and son Michael 
enjoyed competitive shooting, one friend said, "as a family thing." Sinclair 
often hunted with several law enforcement officers who were among his 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
But one day in 1985, Sinclair's shop burned. He was investigated for arson, 
according to Hobbs police, but was not charged. Soon after, he defaulted on a 
bank loan, officials said, and when the lender moved to reclaim guns put up as 
collateral, Sinclair left town with his family. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico then accused his wife, in absentia, of embezzlement for failing to 
turn over more than $30,000 in hunting and fishing license fees sold through 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
The way Sinclair left Hobbs surprised local residents, but not the fact that he 
did. One close friend who did not want to be identified said "he told me he 
wanted to set back on his heels for a few years, that he had enough of six-day 
work weeks. He said he had enough money saved to buy a place with some acreage, 
get some mules and some horses. That maybe he'd get into real estate." 
</P>
<P>
By the time police caught up to Sinclair in Kenny Lake, "he had no visible 
means of support," said Alaska State Trooper Sgt. Charles Grutzmacher. 
</P>
<P>
The family had been living on the second floor of a rented wood-frame house 
with no bathroom, and an outside privy. 
</P>
<P>
After Sinclair's arrest, his wife Debbie was extradited back to New Mexico, 
where she pleaded not guilty to the embezzlement charges and was released on 
bail. She told authorities she never questioned her husband about his 
activities or source of income, and authorities say she and Sinclair's children 
are not suspects in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
The family, especially the children, have been "devastated," one friend 
reported. When they talk about their father, he said, they wistfully recall a 
different man who "made a real effort to teach them about animals, taught them 
a lot about themselves, about being independent and self-sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
Many in Hobbs who remember Sinclair say they are shocked to learn that Sinclair 
could have been a killer. "It's like a puzzle but you can't see the picture 
because half the pieces are missing," one friend said. 
</P>
<P>
When he died, Sinclair left behind more questions than answers. Police hoped he 
would talk to them, but he did not. Then he suddenly died, alone in his cell, 
of "heart failure," according to a preliminary autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," said Finnegan, who hoped to see Sinclair prosecuted for 
shooting and robbing him. "I feel cheated." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not convinced we know everything this guy did," Billings Sgt. Archer said. 
"We may never find out." 
</P>
<P>
"For me this all but closes my case," Piccini said. "Have you ever been on a 
train, rolling down a track, feeling everything was great, when you go across a 
trestle and the track just stops? That's the only way to describe how I feel. 
What's left to do but go back the way you came?"

EX-EMPLOYER, ARMY NURSE SETTLE LAWSUIT

<P>
A settlement has been reached in the lawsuit filed by Army National Guard nurse 
who claimed she was fired from her civilian job after being called to active 
duty in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Steven D. Stern, a spokesman for the public relations firm of Sitrick and 
Company Inc., announced in a terse statement that "an amicable agreement" had 
been reached between Capt. Debra M. Simpson and her former employer, Care 
Visions Corp. He declined further comment Thursday and details of the settlment 
were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Simpson, of Santa Ana, nor her attorneys could be reached for comment 
Thursday. Care Visions Corp. would not comment beyond the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's lawyers filed a civil suit on Nov. 15 in Orange County Superior Court 
charging that Simpson had been fired illegally by Care Visions, which operates 
a Santa Ana care center for chronically ill or disabled children called the 
Kangaroo Kids Center for Fragile Children. Simpson was the health care 
administrator at the facility when she was called to active duty in the Army 
National Guard last August. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said she informed her superiors that she would be back from active duty 
on Oct. 3. She said she went to work that day but was fired a few hours after 
she arrived. Simpson said she was told by Julia Bell, Care Visions Corp.'s 
chief executive officer, that she had "abandoned" her job and therefore was 
being discharged. 
</P>
<P>
Bell has declined to comment on the case, but a spokesman for Care Visions 
Corp. last week charged that Simpson was two days late in reporting back to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson disputed that allegation, saying she gave Care Visions written notice 
that she would return Oct. 3. Care Visions also accused Simpson of volunteering 
for the call to active duty; Simpson maintained that it was a mandatory 
call-up. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Bruce Roy, a spokesman for the California National Guard in Sacramento, 
said last week that federal law prohibits companies from firing or demoting 
persons called to duty, whether or not they volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
One of Simpson's lawyer, Thomas L. Brown, had said he believed the Simpson case 
was the first of its kind in the nation since President Bush's massive call-up 
of reserves last August. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit had sought an unspecified amount of money in actual and punitive 
damages. She said she had been unable to find a job similar to the one from 
which she had been fired.

CRIME: SANTA BARBARA DETECTIVES ENLIST THE AID OF ISRAELI POLICE TO BUILD CASE.

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The couple was shot to death in their sleep at their estate in Montecito. The 
two leading suspects and a key witness had moved to Israel. The investigators 
and all the files in the case were in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's detectives had spent almost two years trying to determine who killed 
Jack and Carmen Hively, and now the biggest stumbling block in the case was 
geography. 
</P>
<P>
While lawyers and diplomats from the two countries wrangled about the legality 
of conducting interviews in Israel, local sheriff's investigators and 
detectives from the Israeli National Police began discussing the case by phone. 
The Israeli police eventually became so intrigued by the killings that they 
bypassed bureaucratic channels and obtained permission for Santa Barbara 
investigators to come to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
And in a highly unusual arrangement, detectives from both countries worked 
together in Israel during the next few months to build a case against the two 
suspects. Their joint investigation was so successful that the suspects were 
arrested and are now on trial in Tel Aviv for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
The case marks the first time Israeli citizens have stood trial in Israel for 
crimes committed in the United States. Israeli law forbids extradition of 
Israeli citizens for trial elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd left this to the bureaucrats, these two guys wouldn't be on trial 
right now," said Santa Barbara Sheriff's Detective Edward Skehan, lead 
investigator on the case. "We basically had our cops talking with their cops . 
. . and we got things done." 
</P>
<P>
Skehan recently left for Israel, for the fourth time, to aid Israeli 
prosecutors. And Santa Barbara Dist. Atty. Thomas Sneddon, who helped the 
Israelis build the case against the two suspects, also is in Israel, as a trial 
consultant to the Tel Aviv district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The Israelis, Tel Aviv prosecutors claim, were hired to kill the Montecito 
couple by Carmen Hively's son-in-law so that he and his wife, Hively's 
daughter, would inherit a large portion of the multimillion-dollar estate. The 
couple fled to Canada after the Israelis were arrested, but Santa Barbara 
prosecutors hope that the current trial will reveal enough information to 
connect them to the killings so they can eventually be tried in the United 
States. No charges have been filed against them. 
</P>
<P>
Because Israel does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, it 
is critical that it tries citizens when it is proved that they have committed 
crimes in other countries, said Santa Barbara Assistant Dist. Atty. Patrick 
McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel doesn't want the reputation of a country that's a haven for criminals," 
McKinley said. "If a country doesn't allow extradition, then they're going to 
have to be willing put their citizens on trial." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara investigators initially were concerned that Israeli police would 
not cooperate because they might feel protective of their own citizens. But a 
double murder will pique the interest of any police officer, whether he is from 
Tel Aviv or Santa Barbara. So Israeli police enthusiastically pursued the case, 
Skehan said. They authorized wire taps early on; they committed a number of 
detectives to the investigation; they spent countless hours learning about the 
case from Santa Barbara investigators. 
</P>
<P>
But the legal wrangling continued as judicial authorities from both countries 
debated whether there was enough evidence to arrest the suspects and then 
whether there was enough evidence to try them. During this time the police from 
the two countries ignored the bureaucratic dispute. They simply worked together 
night and day -- sharing investigative techniques, interviewing suspects 
together, analyzing wiretaps -- until the case they had built was so compelling 
that authorities had to arrest the two suspects and bring them to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jack and Carmen Hively lived on a $1.2-million estate in the foothills of 
Montecito with a sweeping view of the mountains and the ocean. Carmen, 67, 
provided the money for their lavish lifestyle -- she was the wealthy widow of a 
businessman who once owned Yankee Stadium and the Kansas City baseball 
franchise, now the Oakland Athletics. Jack, 11 years her junior, a handsome 
pharmaceutical salesman who retired a few years after their marriage, was her 
fourth husband. 
</P>
<P>
When they were shot to death with a .22-caliber pistol in October, 1987, 
sheriff's detectives immediately discounted robbery as a motive because neither 
Carmen's jewelry nor large amounts of cash were taken. Detectives soon began 
investigating a number of potential suspects. But as the investigation dragged 
on, and one person after another was cleared, detectives continued to suspect 
one man -- Charles LeGros, Carmen Hively's son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
For years he and his wife, Wendy, had "lived beyond their financial means . . . 
and had declared bankruptcy," according to an investigator's report included in 
search warrant affidavits. "Charles LeGros lacked the financial backing to 
promote his many projects and proposals and constantly complained of this 
frustration in the light of his in-laws' substantial financial resources." 
</P>
<P>
But after the LeGroses, who lived in Monterey, inherited more than $1 million 
from Carmen Hively, they immediately bought a large home in Carmel, a boat and 
toured Europe for several months, flying first class and staying in luxury 
hotels, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
A business deal between LeGros and Jack Hively, right before the killings, also 
interested detectives. Court records indicate that LeGros and a friend, Yair 
Orr, a former captain in the Israeli Army, asked Jack Hively to invest $500,000 
in several schemes including a plan to sell arms from Israel to China. But 
Carmen, who controlled the finances, was opposed to the investment. 
</P>
<P>
When it became clear to LeGros and Orr that they would not be able to get any 
money from the Hivelys, investigators theorized, the two men and an Israeli 
friend of Orr's conspired to kill the couple. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators could not tie the LeGroses to the case at first because it was 
confirmed that they they were in Chicago on the night of the killings. Orr, 30, 
and the other suspect, Nadav Nakan, 33, both combat veterans of the Israeli 
army, claimed that they were in Maryland at the time with a former army buddy 
of theirs and his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The couple confirmed the alibi but failed lie detector tests, a source close to 
the case said. Detectives felt the girlfriend was the "weak link," and most 
likely to eventually tell the truth, the source said, because she was not 
friends with Orr and seemed "very uneasy" with her testimony. But she moved 
back to Israel and investigators were prohibited by international law from 
simply flying over and interviewing her. 
</P>
<P>
While they were waiting for permission from judicial authorities, they received 
a break in the case. Orr's jilted girlfriend, Joyce Scampa, stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
When Orr left California about a year after the killings, he "led Scampa to 
believe that he would be returning at some time in the future and left numerous 
articles of his clothing behind," according to court records. But when she 
discovered that Orr had moved back to Israel and married another woman, Scampa, 
who had previously refused to be interviewed, told investigators her story. On 
the night of the killings, she admitted, Orr was not in Maryland. She had met 
him at the Monterey Airport with the $4,000 in $100 bills he had asked for, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara investigators had just begun talking with detectives from the 
Israeli National Police about the case when Scampa broke Orr's alibi. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyce gave us what we really needed," said Sheriff's Sgt. William Baker, who 
has investigated the case for two years. "Her testimony convinced Israeli 
police to let us come to Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara detectives, along with Israeli police, interviewed the Israeli 
woman who originally told authorities that the two suspects were in Maryland on 
the night of the killings. She admitted that she had lied to investigators 
because the suspects had told her they were working with the Mossad -- Israel's 
highly secret intelligence organization -- on a covert mission and needed her 
help for their cover story. 
</P>
<P>
The August, 1989, interview with the woman was critical because it gave 
investigators more insight into the case, and it convinced the Israelis to join 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although wiretaps are not permitted for murder investigations in the United 
States, they are legal in Israel. So Israeli police immediately tapped the 
phones of the two suspects. Santa Barbara investigators returned home and began 
following leads they had accumulated in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The two agencies frequently talked by telephone to exchange information and 
discuss details picked up on the phone taps. And as the case progressed, Baker 
and Skehan made a number of trips to Israel. At the end of the investigation, 
they were in Israel for weeks at a time, working out of a crowded, noisy office 
in a police substation near Tel Aviv. Although the investigators had different 
interviewing styles and different investigative techniques, they worked very 
well together, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
After a few months, the joint investigation uncovered important information. 
The phone taps revealed incriminating conversations between LeGros and Orr. And 
the former army buddy of the suspects, who had also provided an alibi for them 
on the night of the killings, told Santa Barbara investigators that Orr 
confided in him that he organized the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors from the Santa Barbara district attorney's office had to then 
persuade Israeli judicial authorities that the suspects should be arrested and 
tried. Santa Barbara Dist. Atty. Sneddon wrote a 47-page trial brief for the 
attorney general in Israel, outlining the case. But the attorney general was 
not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
Sneddon eventually went to Israel and argued the case himself before the 
attorney general. Finally, as more information was uncovered by the joint 
investigation, and evidence against the suspects mounted, the attorney general 
agreed the case should be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Now another joint effort -- this time between prosecutors of the two countries 
-- was required. Sneddon had to familiarize himself with Israeli law, including 
how to try a murder case before three judges instead of a jury. He had more 
than 5,000 pages of investigative reports translated into Hebrew. He contacted 
dozens of witnesses and made sure they would be available to testify in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The examination of a witness during this trial can drive you crazy," Sneddon 
said. "The D.A. asks the question in Hebrew. The translator translates the 
question into English. The witness answers in English. Then the translator 
translates the answer into Hebrew. To ask and answer a single question can take 
10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
In September, Gov. George Deukmejian signed a bill appropriating $74,000 to 
help defray the costs for Santa Barbara County. But this is only a "drop in the 
bucket," said Assistant Dist. Atty. McKinley. Santa Barbara County must pay for 
the air fare and housing in Israel for the estimated 25 witnesses and the 
county personnel involved in the investigation and trial, which could last 
until spring. Although this will cost the county "hundreds of thousands of 
dollars," McKinley said, "it has to be done. . . . If we don't push for 
prosecution, nobody will." 
</P>
<P>
When the trial is complete, Santa Barbara prosecutors hope the Israelis will 
turn state's evidence and testify against LeGros. The Santa Barbara County 
Grand Jury is investigating the case and trying to uncover evidence that will 
show a financial link between LeGros and the two Israelis.

THEIR FORTE IS REBUILDING ANCESTORS' FORT;

HISTORY: DESCENDANTS OF THE SOLDIERS WHO FOUNDED SANTA BARBARA ARE AMONG THOSE 
RECONSTRUCTING THE ORIGINAL BUILDINGS IN THE CITY'S DOWNTOWN AREA.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leroy Villa, 79, and Mike Acosta, 71, are doing the same job at the same place 
their ancestors eight generations ago did in the 1780s. 
</P>
<P>
They're building a fort. 
</P>
<P>
Villa is a descendant of Vincente Villa, and Acosta, of Ildefonso Dominguez, 
two of the 55 soldiers who came here with their wives and children from Mexico 
in April, 1782. Their arrival marked the beginning of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers constructed a large fortress behind two 11-foot-high defense 
walls. With the help of Chumash Indians, they fashioned their quarters, 
barracks, offices, shops and storage areas out of adobe bricks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 208 years later, the old fort, nearly all of it destroyed by earthquakes 
or replaced by other structures over the years, is being rebuilt to reflect its 
original design. With the help of hundreds of community volunteers and the 
California Conservation Corps, El Presidio de Santa Barbara is rising again, 
slowly and methodically on its original site. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project has been ongoing for 27 years in the heart of downtown 
Santa Barbara, the fort is only about one-fourth finished. It is estimated that 
it will take at least 10 more years before it is completed. 
</P>
<P>
For the young men and women in the California Conservation Corps, the Presidio 
has been a unique undertaking. "Over 2,000 members of the CCC have worked on 
the fort over the years making adobe bricks, building the chapel, doing 
archeological work. The Presidio is their legacy, too," CCC District Director 
Nacho Pina said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the community volunteers, such as Villa and Acosta, belong to Los 
Descendientes, a 250-member organization of descendants of those 55 soldiers 
who founded Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making adobe bricks to help build the fort just as our ancestors did 
way back in the 1780s," Los Descendientes member Villa said. "It is something I 
really feel good about, something that gives me a direct link to the person 
responsible for my being here today, a soldier named Vicente Villa." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, a retired truck driver who serves as a guide at El Presidio de Santa 
Barbara, said whenever he tells visitors he is a descendant of one of Santa 
Barbara's founders "it really comes as a shock most of the time. People don't 
realize that many of the original families are still around. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several thousand descendants of Spanish soldiers living in the Santa 
Barbara area. You go back far enough and you will find we're all related, all 
intermarried, all cousins." 
</P>
<P>
El Presidio de Santa Barbara is where Spanish and Mexican commandants once 
governed the pueblos of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara, as well as the 
largest concentration of Indians in California. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is a state historic park, the State Department of Parks and 
Recreation does not operate the old Spanish fort. There are no state park 
rangers assigned here, just volunteers such as Acosta and the staff of the 
Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation, a group begun in 1963 to see the 
fort rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, only two small adobe buildings of the original fort existed, a 
guard house, built in 1788, and a soldier's home. Since then, one row of 
buildings in the most prominent part of the fort and Santa Barbara's first 
church, the Presidio Chapel, have been reconstructed. 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for the reconstruction and interpretation of this unique historic 
site for the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Santa Barbara trust is 
supported by members' dues and gifts from individuals and companies. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the trust has maintained close ties with UC Santa Barbara. 
UCSB students have participated in archeological work, research and translating 
Spanish records into English -- records that are scattered all over Mexico and 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The interior design of the Presidio Chapel by art historian Norman Neuerburg, 
for instance, is based on exhaustive documentary research. The chapel is now a 
favorite community gathering place for weddings, lectures, conferences, 
concerts, recitals and plays, including the annual re-creation of the 
century-old "Una Pastorela" ("A Shepherd's Play") each Christmas season. 
Historical displays are also featured at the Presidio. Schoolchildren from 
throughout the area take tours of the completed portions of the fort as well as 
the parts under construction. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows about the Santa Barbara mission -- started four years after 
and a mile north of the Presidio -- but it's surprising, most Californians are 
unaware that the only old Spanish fort being reconstructed and restored in the 
state is located in downtown Santa Barbara," said Jarrell C. Jackman, 46, 
director of the trust for 10 years.

Dozens of Central American refugees line up each day at the Oscar Romero Clinic 
on Olympic Boulevard in a tedious quest for medical care. In a city where the 
public health system is strained beyond capacity, the clinic's free services 
represent the only chance many of these patients have for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the 49 health professionals who volunteer at the facility can attend but 
half the people who fill the waiting rooms, and many must be turned away. "We 
don't advertise, but the sick keep coming," volunteer coordinator Oscar Lopez 
says. "Somehow they find us." To guide the steady stream of patients, a nurse 
practitioner -- the lone staff professional -- and the corps of volunteers set 
up a form of triage, deciding who will be cared for immediately, who will be 
given an appointment to come back another day and who will be referred to 
another health facility. The Oscar Romero Clinic, a licensed free clinic 
founded in 1983, is named for the outspoken Roman Catholic archbishop of San 
Salvador who was slain 10 years ago as he presided over a Mass.

<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it looked as though Lech Walesa was almost a shoo-in to win Poland's 
presidency in Sunday's first round of voting, along has come Stanislaw 
Tyminski, a Pole lately living in Toronto and Iquitos, Peru, to throw the 
outcome into doubt. 
</P>
<P>
To the consternation of Walesa and his leading opponent, Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki -- as well as of the whole Polish political Establishment -- the 
41-year-old businessman in the last week has burst virtually from nowhere to 
second place, behind Walesa, in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
The latest government poll, conducted last weekend, showed Walesa favored by 
28% of the sample, with Tyminski the choice of 21% and Mazowiecki of 17%. The 
rest of the preferences were divided among minor candidates and about 12% who 
said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski, an utter unknown in Polish politics and an obscure figure even among 
the Polish emigre community in his home base of Toronto, has sold himself as a 
millionaire businessman whose initiative and commercial acumen are needed to 
lead Poland to economic success in the post-Communist era. 
</P>
<P>
His program, however, is vague, and his facts are not always correct. An 
example is a charge he made this week that Mazowiecki had offered to sell off 
state-owned factories too cheaply, an assertion that the government quickly and 
effectively dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
But at least part of Tyminski's appeal is the fact that he's an outsider, free 
from the baggage of Solidarity's history and, in recent months, from its bitter 
internal fights. 
</P>
<P>
These battles within Solidarity have split the liberal sector around Mazowiecki 
from the conservatives backing Walesa, who has charged Mazowiecki's 
administration with moving too slowly to remove the old Communist bureaucrats 
out of posts in industry and government. 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski seems unlikely to achieve final victory, most political analysts say, 
but his strong showing could scatter the vote sufficiently to deny Walesa the 
over-50% margin needed to win the presidency in the first round. If no one wins 
more than 50% Sunday, a runoff, pitting the two first-round leaders, will be 
held Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats estimate that as many as 40,000 Polish expatriates living in the 
United States may cast ballots for president Saturday at polls set up in 
Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, Los Angeles and other cities with significant 
Polish populations. These votes will be tallied with Sunday's first-round 
ballots cast in Poland, but no expatriate voting will be allowed in any runoff. 
</P>

Tyminski left Poland for Canada 21 years ago and spent nine years in Peru, 
where he owns a restaurant and a satellite television company. In Canada, he 
owns Transduction Ltd., a company based in Mississauga, a Toronto suburb, that 
produces "custom-design computer systems for industry." Aides say his business 
assets are valued at about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
He has run an effective campaign, hiring workers to paper Warsaw with flyers 
announcing his campaign appearances. He has taken full-page advertisements in 
newspapers. In Kielce on Monday, he drew a crowd of 2,500, matching the turnout 
for Walesa in the same city two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The political Establishment is appalled at the idea of a rank outsider drawing 
so well against such Solidarity heroes as Walesa and Mazowiecki. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa has said it would be embarrassing to have to face Tyminski in a runoff. 
And the Solidarity newspaper, Gazeta Wyborca, solidly backing Mazowiecki, has 
said Poland would become "the laughingstock of Europe" if Tyminski should win. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa and Tyminski have campaigned far more actively than Mazowiecki, who 
clearly does not enjoy pressing the flesh and asking for votes. Mazowiecki, 
although highly respected by Poles, may be damaged by the perception of many 
that his government has become stalled, however admirable its start may be 
along the road to economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
For millions of Poles, reform is a rocky road and is likely to mean more 
uncertainty in the future as unemployment rises and incomes shrink. 
</P>
<P>
In this atmosphere, Walesa's campaign has added an element of divisiveness, 
typified by his references to the government as a "bunch of dimwits." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting voter disaffection, many believe, may be the primary explanation 
for Tyminski's sudden rise in the polls.

AT THE OUTPOSTS, THERE IS LITTLE THANKSGIVING; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: AWAY FROM THE HOOPLA OF A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT, A SOMBER HOLIDAY SEEMED 
TO BRING LUMPS TO THROATS OF MANY YOUNG AMERICAN SOLDIERS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alone in a sandbagged bunker on a barren desert hill, Army Pfc. Roland Cole 
spent his Thanksgiving on watch. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, the 20-year-old would have been back in his native Maine, 
deer-hunting in the snow before a family feast. This autumn, he was to have 
been newly married, still honeymooning in the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
But with his world turned upside down by near-war in the Persian Gulf, the 
young private sat Thursday afternoon peering over a rocky precipice from behind 
an M-60 machine gun, beginning a two-hours-on, two-off cycle that would fill 
the holiday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It can get real lonely," said Cole, whose only taste of Thanksgiving came in a 
wolfed-down holiday dinner in the subdued mess tent of his artillery unit in 
the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. 
</P>
<P>
Away from the hoopla of a presidential visit, a somber holiday in the desert 
seemed to bring lumps to the throats of many young American soldiers, with any 
respite from military chores more than consumed by restless thoughts aimed 
homeward. 
</P>
<P>
A field kitchen in this dusty Army compound was gaily decorated with brightly 
colored turkey cut-outs, and cooks dished up only the second fresh-cooked meal 
soldiers in the unit had received since arriving in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But after two months on the lines, most gobbled their dinners in near-silence 
before wandering back to a tented isolation, with no hope of getting access to 
a telephone on which they had been offered free three-minute calls home. The 
phones were miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if you've got 1,000 pounds of turkey on the table," said 
Pfc. Timothy Summerville, a cook who shook his head as soldiers filed past 
without a word of thanks. "The only thing that makes a difference is spending 
Thanksgiving with your loved ones, your children and your wife." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Mike Starry, the unit's executive officer, said soldiers' moods 
traversed "peaks and valleys" as they fluctuated over time. On this day, in 
wistful, homesick talk of missed families and missed celebrations, spirits 
seemed decidedly low. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I never thought I'd be sitting in a remote van in Saudi Arabia on 
Thanksgiving Day," said Pfc. Quincy Lockett, a Chicago-born radioman working a 
10-hour shift in a fan-cooled shelter the size of a walk-in closet. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he found anything to be thankful for in his deployment to the 
desert, Lockett, a 19-year-old who plans to attend college when his two-year 
hitch expires in June, shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a chance to save money for school, he said emphatically: "Nothing. 
Nothing. Definitely, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
From others, there was an uncertain chorus: There had been no war, many said, 
and for that they were thankful. 
</P>
<P>
But in the two weeks since it became clear that the United States was moving 
toward offensive options, many said they had come increasingly to worry that 
the long and boring stalemate would end in a bloody fight. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people want war to happen just to get it over with," said Specialist 
Eric Nielsen, who, like the young private from Maine, spent much of the day on 
watch. "But if that happens, a lot of guys won't come home. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was in the Korean War, and he pretty much explained to me what war 
was all about," the 23-year-old continued. "I'd rather not see it." 
</P>
<P>
With his wife and baby daughter moved back home to Oklahoma from the unit's 
base in Ft. Hood, Tex., Nielsen said one thing his father had stressed was that 
"in war, families get ended." 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get home and finish raising my daughter," Nielsen said. "I 
didn't have very much time before I left." 
</P>
<P>
On the next hill over, Cole, who was to have been married Oct. 20, was 
experiencing his first Thanksgiving away from Winslow, Me., where, he said, "us 
men would be out hunting deer and the women would be home, cooking." 
</P>
<P>
He too was thankful that war had not broken out "before the holidays came." But 
however his time here is to end now, he said, perched on a stack of sandbags: 
"The sooner the better." 
</P>
<P>
In honor of the day, some soldiers broke into packages from home, sharing 
canned ham and candy with friends. 
</P>
<P>
Later, there was to be gospel singing and a prayer service -- deliberately 
scheduled to begin after reporters left the camp to minimize coverage of what 
the public affairs officer, Capt. Jeff Phillips, called "the religion thing" 
out of concern for their host country's strict Muslim sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretend it's not happening," the captain requested initially in an indication 
of military concern as Christmas and Hanukkah approach in a country that 
officially recognizes no religion other than Islam. 
</P>
<P>
So removed is this camp from everyday news that several soldiers expressed 
surprise when told that President Bush, television cameras and satellite dishes 
in tow, was visiting other units only several score miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Others read and saved a special Thanksgiving message from the President printed 
inside the menus that accompanied the holiday dinner. But in this desert-weary 
group there were signs of some uneasiness at its continued talk of war. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a war because a lot of people will die," said Summerville, the 
Army cook here. "But whatever President Bush decides I have to back, because he 
is my boss."

<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush meets today with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo, and 
with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva. Both Mideast nations have 
contributed troops to the multinational force in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Bush visited U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and warned that Iraq's progress in 
developing nuclear weapons gives their mission a sense of urgency and that they 
may soon face combat -- "some pain now to avoid even worse pain later." 
</P>
<P>
Britain announced that it will send 14,000 more troops to the gulf, bringing 
its total to more than 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hostage Front: 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 hostages, mainly British and Swiss, left Baghdad on two chartered 
planes. Iraq freed them in response to appeals by French and Swiss delegations. 
</P>
<P>

BUSH'S THANKSGIVING TRIP IS ASSAILED IN BAGHDAD 
</P>

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's Thanksgiving visit to the Middle East was denounced in Baghdad 
on Thursday as an attempt to shore up what the Iraqi media termed sagging 
support for Washington's Persian Gulf policies. 
</P>
<P>
The English-language Baghdad Observer, published by the government's Department 
of Information, said the stops by Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III in the gulf region "take place at a time both seem to have been embarrassed 
at the home-front level." 
</P>
<P>
"Anti-war sentiment is spiraling. . . " said the Observer editorial. "(Bush's) 
popularity has receded at a menacing pace." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspaper went on: "Scores of world veteran politicians have 
visited Iraq to express their rejection of the U.S. and British policy of 
brinkmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Information Minister Latif Jasim branded the President's 
planned visit with American troops in Saudi Arabia "a provocation" and said the 
Iraqi government would be watching it. No other Iraqi official, however, has 
publicly commented on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
The front page of Thursday's Observer ran a report of Bush's impending visit 
under two top-of-the-page stories. One was on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
trip to Thi-qar province, where he visited various projects and spoke against 
the American threat, and the other was on the arrival in Baghdad of former 
heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, a major celebrity in the Muslim 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush story, datelined Baghdad, was a fairly straightforward report of 
Bush's planned activities, but it also included a number of quotes from GIs -- 
presumably gleaned from reports by international news agencies -- complaining 
about having to serve in the Saudi desert. 
</P>
<P>
The article ran under the headline, "Bush Hopes Visit to Saudi Arabia Will 
Boost Morale," and its second paragraph said: 
</P>
<P>
"Only a few minutes' flying time away from superior Iraq forces, U.S. troops 
are increasingly frustrated with enforced idleness in the harsh Saudi desert." 
</P>
<P>
The account quoted an unidentified Marine as saying he would rather have a 
visit from comedian Steve Martin than from the President. 
</P>
<P>
All Iraqi newspapers are government-controlled, and in recent weeks they have 
highlighted Bush's problems with Congress on his Persian Gulf policies. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Observer editorial Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress, which enjoys a crucial say in the President's gulf policy, has 
echoed a tide of American worry about the fate of hundreds of thousands of U.S. 
troops in Saudi Arabia."

RIGHTIST LE PEN RETURNS WITH 55 HOSTAGES

<P>
Extreme right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen returned home Thursday from Iraq 
with 55 freed hostages and accused unnamed Western governments of "wanting to 
keep hostages in Iraq in order to start a war." 
</P>
<P>
Le Pen, accompanied by several European Parliament members belonging to 
right-wing parties who accompanied him to Baghdad, landed in the eastern French 
city of Mulhouse aboard a special Boeing 727 Iraqi Airways jet. 
</P>
<P>
The rightist leader refused to elaborate on his charge that some Western 
governments want the hostages to remain in Baghdad as an excuse to start a war. 
</P>
<P>
But he again urged France to withdraw its troops from Saudi Arabia as soon as 
possible because "American interests, and not French or European interests, are 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
The 55 hostages who returned with Le Pen are citizens of 10 European countries, 
among them 21 British nationals, 14 Italians, seven Germans, three Irish and 
two Belgians. 
</P>
<P>
Two Dutch citizens, three Danish nationals, two Greeks and a Swiss were also 
freed and returned with Le Pen.

BRITAIN TO NEARLY DOUBLE ITS TROOP STRENGTH IN GULF

Britain will send 14,000 more troops and additional tanks, aircraft and ships 
to the Persian Gulf, nearly doubling the number of British troops there to 
30,000 by year's end, Defense Minister Tom King said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking after King's 
announcement and just a few hours after she announced her resignation, told 
Parliament that time is running out for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to 
remove his troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is fast approaching when the world community will have to take more 
decisive action to uphold international law and compel Saddam Hussein to leave 
Kuwait," she said. 
</P>
<P>
King told Parliament that the additional brigade will include an armored 
regiment of Challenger tanks, two armored infantry battalions with Warrior 
fighting vehicles, an armored reconnaissance squadron, a Royal Artillery field 
regiment, engineers and other supporting services. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has today decided to deploy an extra brigade, a divisional 
headquarters and supporting arms. They will join the 7th Armored Brigade in 
Saudi Arabia to form the 1st Armored Division," King said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Lynx anti-tank helicopters, support helicopters and two 
minesweeping vessels will be sent along with the additional brigade. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the deployment, King said that it is the "clearest possible 
message" to Hussein that the allies are committed to push his forces from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now over 3 1/2 months since Iraq invaded Kuwait and has continued to 
defy the United Nations demand to withdraw," King told the House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions have left Iraq increasingly isolated . . . but Saddam Hussein shows 
no sign yet of complying with the U.N. resolutions and ending his barbaric 
treatment of the Kuwaiti people and the hostages he has detained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's foolish, crazy enough to stay in spite of the very substantial 
military forces (against him), the conflict will be short, it will be extremely 
painful for Iraqis, and . . . the extra resources give us the best chance of 
minimizing the casualties on our side," King said at a later news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"This will represent a potent increase in the fighting capability of British 
forces in region," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said that a peaceful solution to the crisis sparked by Iraq's Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait is still possible. But that solution is for Hussein to 
accept U.N. sanctions and leave, she declared.

SHEVARDNADZE TO FLY TO CHINA FOR GULF TALKS

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will fly to China today for 
talks on the Persian Gulf crisis that are expected to focus on whether the two 
Communist powers will back the use of force against Iraq, diplomats said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze will meet his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, in the western 
Chinese city of Urumqi. 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman had no immediate comment on the visit but 
said Beijing will continue to strive for a peaceful settlement of the gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
China and the Soviet Union are permanent members of the five-member U.N. 
Security Council and have the power to veto resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who wants U.N. authority to oust Iraq from Kuwait by force, 
said in Paris this week that the United States and the Soviet Union are "on the 
same wavelength." 
</P>
<P>
But diplomats said there is still a question about China's position if a U.N. 
resolution is proposed. 
</P>
<P>
China has repeatedly denounced Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and called for an 
unconditional withdrawal. But it also has criticized superpower intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear-cut," China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing 
told reporters Thursday at a weekly news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is a gleam of hope for a peaceful settlement, unremitting 
efforts should be continued towards this."

JUDGE RULES AGAINST BIKERS' DESERT RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorcyclist group was unable to persuade a judge to stop the U.S. Bureau of 
Land Management from closing a portion of the Mojave Desert that the cyclists 
want to use Saturday for a protest ride. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian, ruling after an emergency hearing late 
Wednesday, rejected a petition for a temporary restraining order against the 
BLM that had been sought by the Sahara Club, an off-road biker group. 
</P>
<P>
The court dispute marks the latest chapter in a flap over the cancellation of 
this weekend's Barstow-to-Las-Vegas motorcycle race. Angry about the event's 
cancellation, Sahara Club members had threatened to stage a protest ride 
Saturday along the traditional race route. 
</P>
<P>
The BLM -- worried that such an event, involving thousands of motorcyclists, 
could harm desert resources -- responded by temporarily closing the race route 
and staging areas to motor vehicles. The affected area stretches from Barstow 
to the Nevada state line. 
</P>
<P>
Sahara Club lawyer Alan Ghaleb said Tevrizian was swayed by BLM arguments that 
closing the land was necessary to prevent an unorganized and possibly 
destructive event involving as many as 25,000 riders. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also said disgruntled motorcyclists could protest the race's 
cancellation in other ways, Ghaleb said. 
</P>
<P>
A separate lawsuit filed by the club, challenging the constitutionality of the 
BLM closure order, is pending. No hearing date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sieman, president of the Sahara Club, said that despite the ruling he 
would attempt to ride across the closed land Saturday. BLM officials said 
rangers will be on hand to cite and arrest violators.

HOLIDAY GETS OFF TO DEADLY START -- 13 DIE IN STATE TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At least 13 people died in traffic accidents on California streets and highways 
during the first 12 hours of the Thanksgiving Day weekend, compared to three 
fatalities during the same period last year, the California Highway Patrol said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Drunk-driving arrests also were up in the period, beginning at 6 p.m. Wednesday 
and ending at 6 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 420 arrests in the 12-hour period, compared to 503 this 
year, said CHP spokesman Robert Strong. 
</P>
<P>
Six of this holiday's deaths occurred on roads and freeways in CHP 
jurisdiction. "All the people who died were not wearing seat belts," said 
Strong. 
</P>
<P>
The other deaths occurred in local jurisdictions not patrolled by the CHP. One 
woman was killed when her compact car collided with a tanker-truck on the 
Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach and burst into flames, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the unidentified woman's car ran a red light at Santa Fe Avenue 
early Thursday morning and hit a truck filled with gasoline that was headed 
east on the coast road. The woman was trapped in her car and burned to death, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two more highway deaths were reported later Thursday in a head-on collision 
east of the Antelope Valley community of Llano. A 9-year-old girl and a 
teen-age girl in one car were killed and six other people were hurt in the 
collision on Highway 138 near the San Bernardino County line. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen said it was too early to know whether the upward trend in deaths 
indicates that the totals for the four-day holiday will surpass 1989 when 68 
traffic deaths were recorded.

TALKS GO THROUGH HOLIDAY IN JAPANESE EFFORT TO BUY MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and MCA Inc. reversed an 
earlier plan to take a holiday break, and bargained through Thanksgiving in New 
York without reaching an agreement under which the Japanese company would buy 
MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals close to the bargaining have said that Matsushita has offered in 
the area of $70 a share, but that MCA is holding out for at least $75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, a top Matsushita 
representative, did not attend Thursday's negotiations. A spokesman said he was 
in Los Angeles with his family and would return to New York when needed. 
</P>
<P>
MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman apparently remained in New York through the 
holiday. Further meetings are expected today, and may go through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both sides declined to comment on the talks, but people familiar 
with the discussions said the two sides almost reached an impasse Wednesday 
night before some changes in position allowed the discussions to continue.

HOPES RAISED IN FIGHT AGAINST AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new virus that appears to have similarities to the AIDS virus has been 
isolated from a patient with Sjogren's syndrome, an uncommon ailment that 
causes dryness of the mouth and eyes, according to researchers at Tulane 
University School of Medicine in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery, reported in today's issue of the journal Science, is likely to 
spark renewed interest in the possibility that viruses play a role in causing a 
variety of uncommon autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's, lupus 
erythematosus, and scleroderma. 
</P>
<P>
"We are excited by the fact that we have a new human (virus)," said Robert F. 
Garry, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane and the 
leader of the research team. 
</P>
<P>
But Garry cautioned in a telephone interview that "we have by no means 
established a cause-and-effect relationship between this virus and any 
autoimmune disease, including Sjogren's disease. . . . We have a lot more work 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
In an autoimmune disease, the immune system, which controls the body's defenses 
against germs, attacks the body itself. This attack can cause a variety of 
problems, such as arthritis and lung and kidney damage. Some researchers 
believe that viral infections may help to trigger the initial attack by the 
immune system, which then becomes self-sustaining. 
</P>
<P>
Sjogren's is more likely to occur in older individuals. In addition to dryness 
of the mouth and eyes, patients may also develop dryness of other organs, such 
as the lungs, joint inflammation, and heart, nerve and kidney problems. In 
advanced cases, death may occur from lung infections. 
</P>
<P>
According to Garry, Sjogren's patients have some common features with some 
patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, 
such as mouth and eye dryness. In both diseases, the dryness is related to the 
invasion of the saliva and tear glands by white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, patients with Sjogren's and other autoimmune diseases, such as 
lupus, may have false-positive blood tests for infection with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The new virus, named human intracisternal A-type retroviral particle, was 
isolated from the salivary gland tissue of a Sjogren's patient, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Further tests in the laboratory established that the virus appears to be 
genetically related to the AIDS virus, Garry said. 
</P>
<P>
Garry said his team is now trying to determine the genetic sequence of the 
virus and to develop diagnostic tests. Tests in monkeys are also planned to see 
if injections of the virus cause a Sjogren's-like illness.

MARTIN FORCED TO PLAY CATCH-UP IN FIRST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Martin did not get the head coaching job at Colorado State she coveted. 
</P>
<P>
But just a few months later, she was hired for what she considers to be a 
bigger challenge -- building the Cal State Northridge women's program into a 
Division I contender. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been watching the Northridge program, but I thought they had a year to 
go to get to Division I," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out they were going Division I this season, I thought, 'What a 
great deal.' I'm very happy with the prospect of what we can do here." 
</P>
<P>
Martin was hired in whirlwind fashion. 
</P>
<P>
While in Seattle in July for the Goodwill Games, she saw an advertisement for 
the position in the NCAA News. She immediately sent CSUN officials a resume and 
upon returning to her home in Fort Collins, Colo., there was a message from 
them inviting her for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
She flew to Northridge the next day and was hired two days later. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Corvallis, Ore., Martin scored 1,145 points for Oregon State from 
1979-83. After two years of professional ball in Belgium and Switzerland, she 
launched her coaching career as an assistant at Southwestern Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
After two years in a similar capacity at San Diego State, Martin was hired as 
an assistant by Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through last season, her first at Colorado State, head Coach Brian 
Berger resigned. Martin took over on an interim basis and the Rams won three of 
their remaining 13 games. Although she did not get the top job, Martin planned 
to stay on as an assistant to the new coach, Greg Williams, until CSUN made its 
offer in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
The late start cost her and assistant coaches Shannon Boyd and Eliseo Nino the 
opportunity to scout national all-star games such as the Basketball Congress 
International tournament, so they did not sign a player in the early period 
that ended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are spending a lot of time catching up on recruiting," Martin said. 
"Northridge is a good school to recruit to. Kids like the area and with (the 
program) going to Division I, there are a lot of firsts. The first winning 
season. The first 20-point game. The first 20 rebounds. It is a strong selling 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Although CSUN lacks the budget to fully fund the program, the number of partial 
scholarships will increase from nine to 13 after this season. 
</P>
<P>
Martin is eager for the day when she can offer room, board and tuition. "Living 
in the dorm is such a big part of going to school," Martin said. "The kids need 
that campus life." 
</P>
<P>
Only two players have full scholarships and live in the dorms. Five members of 
the team have to work to make ends meet and several players travel long 
distances to class and practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it," Martin said. "When I have a team meeting, I have to call 
three area codes."

EL CAMINO MEN'S TEAM IS YOUNG, BUT TALENTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron McClurkin said this will be his most challenging season as coach of the El 
Camino men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
In his two previous seasons, McClurkin has led the Warriors to the semifinals 
of the state tournament. He has a 48-20 record. 
</P>
<P>
McClurkin believes he has the talent to repeat the feat, but not the 
experience. The Warriors lost their top eight players, including every starter 
from last season's 24-11 club. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are forwards Steve Leary (St. Mary's), Jamal Ross (Cal State L.A.), 
Charles Evans (Sacramento State) and David Keeter (Cal State Northridge). The 
backcourt will be without guards Larry Lockley (University of Colorado), Frank 
Beatty (Ft. Hays State), Allen Caveness (St. Mary's) and Keith Brown (Hampton 
Institute). 
</P>
<P>
But McClurkin says that this year's recruiting class matches the 1987 class in 
talent. In 1987, McClurkin recruited Charles White, David Lee and Kirkland 
Howling, the nucleus of the 1988 state championship team. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought in guys at almost every spot," McClurkin said. "These 11 freshmen 
will have a good team this year, but next year they're going to be great." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike recent seasons, El Camino has a balanced offense that can score 
consistently from the inside and outside. 
</P>
<P>
Steve King, a 6-foot-5, 195-pound freshman from Inglewood High, will add 
strength inside. Jeff Crowe, a 6-foot-6, 225-pound freshman from Morningside 
High, will back up King at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
Former Redondo High standout Mike Houck will start at small forward. Houck, a 
sophomore, is the team's most versatile player and best three-point shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"He can play anywhere," McClurkin said. "We can't seem to get by without a guy 
like him. We really count on him to do a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Kyle and Mike Reynolds will probably split time at center. Kyle is a 
6-7 sophomore who played for El Camino in 1989, but was academically ineligible 
last season. Reynolds is a 6-7, 180-pound freshman from Narbonne High. Neither 
player is a big scorer, but both are great rebounders. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' point guard will be freshman Major Whitlock, a redshirt transfer 
from the University of Montana. Whitlock was an All-San Gabriel Valley player 
from Nogales High. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best athletes on the team," McClurkin said. "He's built, he's 
a man and he can play. We needed someone like that." 
</P>
<P>
McClurkin said the off-guard spot is the most competitive on the team. El 
Camino has three talented players fighting for that position. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Robison, the Warriors' prize recruit, is a two-time All-CIF selection from 
Torrance High. He is expected to see plenty of playing time whether he starts 
or not. Darius Dubose and Keishaun Darthard, two players off last season's 
team, are also expected to see action. Dubose, who will rotate with Whitlock at 
the point, is one of the team's better shooters. Darthard is known as a solid 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' key backups are Malik Clinscales and Major Goulsby. Clinscales is 
a 6-6 sophomore who saw limited action last season and Goulsby is a 6-3 
freshman forward from Narbonne.

<P>
Bob Oyama of Long Beach has donated another fish to the Cabrillo Marine Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Oyama, who was fishing for yellowtail Monday aboard the Matt Walsh at the 
rockpile, sent his bait toward the bottom and hooked the largest sheephead of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
The fish was netted and placed in a bait tank. After the boat docked, the 
museum truck picked up the fish and transported it to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Oyama has donated fish to the museum on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The male sheephead weighs 23 1/2 pounds and is on display at the museum in San 
Pedro. Its brilliant orange and black coloring lights up the display tank. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Wright of Redondo Beach was trolling in his skiff three miles out from 
Redondo Pier when he got a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Wright stopped his outboard motor as the fish was moving his small skiff toward 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 minutes, he was able to reel the fish to the surface and described it 
as the largest bonito he had landed while trolling. It weighed 8 pounds, 2 
ounces. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: The whopper of the week was hooked by Ted Thaser of West Los 
Angeles. He was fishing aboard the Blackjack off Santa Barbara Island and 
caught and released a black sea bass that was estimated to weigh more than 300 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Sonodra of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Outerlimits, caught a 45-pound 
bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Zimmer of Long Beach, fishing at horseshoe kelp aboard the Sportking, 
caught a 28-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hollaway of Gardena, fishing aboard the Freedom off San Clemente 
Island, caught a 26-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Sonny Bennett of Marina del Rey, fishing from his skiff at the deep hole, 
caught a 26-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Gary DuBoise of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Southern Cal, caught an 18-pound 
white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hagmaier of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Victory, caught an 18-pound 
white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Local fishing for exotics has made a drastic change. A 
late-season run of barracuda started over the weekend with some decent-size 
fish up to 10 pounds being caught. 
</P>
<P>
The local yellowtail bite seems to have leveled off. Tanner Bank trips continue 
to produce yellowtail and some bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Halibut fishing in Santa Monica Bay is showing improvement and anglers are 
catching a mixed bag of bass and yellowtail at the outer islands. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Happyman, on a half-day trip, returned with 
12 halibut, 40 sculpin and 20 bonito. 
</P>
<P>
The Spitfire fished the bay and anglers caught 13 halibut, 65 sculpin, 35 sand 
bass and five calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod trip resulted in a catch of 250 rock cod, three cow cod 
and a lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Sumo worked the deep rocks and returned with 120 rock cod and 11 sheephead. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished rocky point and anglers sacked 
142 sculpin, 27 bonito and 15 sheephead. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Redondo, on a half-day trip, returned with 55 calico bass and 22 
sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack fished Santa Barbara Island for 35 calico bass, 19 yellowtail and 
17 sheephead. 
</P>
<P>
The Isle of Redondo had a weekend total of 190 mackerel, 36 rockfish and six 
bonito. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd Street Landing: The First String worked Catalina Island and had a 
variety catch of 141 blue perch, 97 calico bass, 91 bonito, 10 sheephead and a 
halibut.

PLAYERS WILL BE MEASURED BY NEW, HIGHER STANDARDS;

<P>
OPENER: MATADORS TO MEET CAL STATE FULLERTON IN TOURNAMENT ACTION AS THEY 
EMBARK ON DIVISION I VOYAGE.

<P>
Their coach has never known anything but Division I women's basketball. Only 
the Cal State Northridge players will learn the differences between Division II 
and Division I this season. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to new Coach Janet Martin, however, to ease the transition beginning 
at 8 tonight when CSUN makes its Division I debut against Cal State Fullerton 
in the Fullerton tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old coach was hired at Northridge in mid-August to replace Leslie 
Milke, who resigned after going 100-94 in seven seasons, including an 11-18 
mark in the Matadors' final season of Division II play. 
</P>
<P>
Eight players return from the 1989-90 squad, including scoring leader Julie 
Arlotto (12.6 points-a-game average), and starters Sandi Olson, Joan Weinerth 
and Dawn Broline. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers include Valley College transfers Christine Rumfola (nine points and 
five rebounds per game) and Shagarro Lattin (nine points, 6 1/2 rebounds); 
Teresa McCauley (10 points, six rebounds), a transfer from Glendale College who 
was redshirted last season; volleyball player Nancy Nicholls; and Jennifer 
Williams, a freshman from Cleveland High. 
</P>
<P>
Valley College transfer Ruth Aguilar (16 points and 10 rebounds per game), 
Ventura College transfer Nikki Brooks (eight points, 15 rebounds) and freshman 
Michelle Macias signed letters of intent earlier this year under Milke but quit 
the program shortly after drills started last month. 
</P>
<P>
Martin has not announced a starting lineup and is viewing each player with an 
open mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told some of them are highly touted and others can't do much," she 
said. "But I told the players they all have a chance to prove themselves to me. 
The kids who weren't playing before have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Arlotto sees it as a positive sign for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of players, once they know who made the starting five, they say 'OK, I'm 
not a starter,' and they step back and stop pushing themselves as hard," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's pressing zone defense should keep a host of players happy -- it 
requires frequent substitutions. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be crazy, a full-court press falling back into a man to man," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The offense is a high-low post attack, utilizing the 5-foot-11 Arlotto, 6-2 
sophomore Olson, 5-11 sophomore Haily Griffith and 5-9 junior Lattin. 
</P>
<P>
Broline, who hit 15 of 57 attempts from three-point range last season, and 
Rumfola will be relied upon for outside scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgette Ealy, who was redshirted last season, is among the top defensive 
players. 
</P>
<P>
They will have their hands full with Fullerton's 6-6 center Gina Miller, an 
All-American candidate who helped the Titans to a 14-14 record last season. 
Oregon State (5-26 last season) and Southwest Texas State (16-11) round out the 
four-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"This week I can honestly say they understand what Division I means," Martin 
said. "Before, it was a fun thing, but now we open with Fullerton. They know 
they have to focus. They are here to win games and we have to get to that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a former assistant at Southwestern Louisiana, San Diego State and 
Colorado State, has shown the way with a rigorous conditioning program and a 
back-to-basics approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We break down the fundamentals," Arlotto said. "Sometimes it is assumed in a 
college program that everyone has the fundamentals, but that is not always the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Matadors are not stocked with Division I-caliber players, Arlotto 
believes they can reach that level. 
</P>
<P>
"You can start out Division II and if you really work at it you can take your 
skill level to Division I," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Arlotto is nervous for the opener. "I'll admit it," she said. "We played 
four or five Division I teams last year, but that's different. When it's 
Division II playing Division I, you are the underdog. Division I against 
Division I is different."

nicknamed Doc as a freshman after former Army standout Doc Blanchard. 
</P>
<P>
"They said I run a lot like him," Blanchard said of his freshman coaches. "The 
whole team and everybody calls me that." 
</P>
<P>
The name fits the senior well. 
</P>
<P>
Twice this season, Blanchard has been injured severely enough to be taken by 
ambulance to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard is questionable for the Indians' second-round Division III playoff 
game against El Modena today because of a sprained neck sustained in Hart's 
13-10 overtime win over Los Alamitos in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit on the top of the helmet and thrown backward," said Blanchard, who 
is wearing a neck brace. "It was a pretty good shot. They really got me. It's 
really sore, but I hope to play." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the season against Quartz Hill, Blanchard was sidelined because of a 
deep knee bruise after being speared by a Quartz Hill defender. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure: Kicker Brady Vilensky has emerged the hero in each of the games 
in which Blanchard has gone down. 
</P>
<P>
Vilensky, who kicked a 46-yard field goal to defeat Quartz Hill, booted a field 
goal of 27 yards to beat Los Alamitos in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Vilensky, who has converted 46 consecutive point-after attempts this season and 
made 48 of 51 as a junior, gave the Indians a 10-7 lead with 10 minutes 
remaining in the game on a 23-yard kick, but Los Alamitos kicker Eric Wallace 
tied the score with 1:50 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Hart won the coin flip and elected to give Los Alamitos possession first in 
overtime. After failing to score in three attempts, Hart lineman Brandon Best 
blocked Wallace's field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give them the ball first and see what they would do," Hart Coach 
Mike Herrington said. "We didn't want to take any chances. We just decided to 
go for the field goal." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos called three consecutive timeouts and Hart had to line up four 
times before Vilensky got a chance for the game-winning kick. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the field goal in the fourth quarter would finish them off," 
Vilensky said. "When they called the timeouts, I thought it was kind of funny. 
I pretty much knew it was good when I kicked it." 
</P>
<P>
Weaknesses prevail: Ventura and Westlake entered the season with few 
weaknesses, and each was able to overcome them for the better part of the 
season. But in first-round losses in the Southern Section Division II playoffs 
Friday, weaknesses prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura had its biggest offensive line in school history but lacked enough 
talented skill-position players. Capistrano Valley, with an abundance of 
talented skill-position players, handed the Cougars a 59-30 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"You really can only do so much with your line," Ventura Coach Harvey Kochel 
said. "After a while, your skill guys have to rise up. Going into the season, 
we were limited with skill players and that became very obvious Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, conversely, had some of the most talented skill-position players in 
Ventura County. But the Warriors fretted about their defense, which struggled 
throughout the season and finally collapsed over the final three games. 
</P>
<P>
After an 8-0 start, Westlake allowed 43.3 points in its last three games, 
losing two and tying one. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we'd have to play defense, but we didn't," Coach Jim Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Collapse: Marmonte League coaches were dumbfounded by losses by the 
league's top three finishers last Friday, which led to speculation that the 
league's final three weeks might have led to an emotional letdown. 
</P>
<P>
Royal, Westlake and Thousand Oaks each played one another during the final 
three weeks in games that helped determine the league title. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have knocked each other out," Royal Coach Gene Uebelhardt said. "Those 
games probably took their toll on us in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Recharged Chargers: A cross-country coach can expect only so much from a team. 
A couple of illnesses during the year combined with two league losses can slow 
almost any team's momentum. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the Agoura boys' team. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers gave new meaning to the phrase, "Never say die" in the Southern 
Section Division II championships Saturday after settling for third in the 
competitive Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura claimed its second divisional title in a row, 77-83, over top-ranked 
Camarillo last Saturday. The Chargers, ranked second behind Camarillo all 
season, now lead the 1990 Agoura-Camarillo series, 3-2, and will face the 
Scorpions again Saturday in the state meet in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
"This team stayed focused through a lot of adversity," Agoura Coach Bill Duley 
said. "I think we've had all our guys sick at one point throughout the season." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of league dual meets, Agoura's closest invitational race was an 84-94 
loss to Channel Islands in the Ventura County championships. 
</P>
<P>
In its first year in the Marmonte League, Agoura was in contention for the 
league championship, but its title hopes were deflated when sophomore Ryan 
Wilson collapsed in the final stretch while tied for the lead with Channel 
Islands' Stewart Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was Agoura's No. 2 runner (16:06) in the Division II final at Mt. San 
Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
1, 2, 3 . . . kick: Like many top-notch cross-country runners, J. J. Castner of 
Oak Park runs the three-mile course at Mt. SAC three times a year -- in the 
invitational, the Southern Section prelims and finals. 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. SAC circuit, with its three major hills, dutifully drains a runner's 
legs before the finish. But Castner seems to be just fine near the finish. In 
fact, he gets faster. "The three times I ran here this year I've had just an 
unreal kick," Castner said. 
</P>
<P>
The junior's final sprint in the Southern Section Division IV final Saturday 
helped carry him to the individual title in a personal-best 15 minutes 48 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Castner had to come from behind to catch former Tri-Valley League rival Jorge 
Barajas of Fillmore with about 100 yards remaining. Barajas finished second in 
15:52. 
</P>
<P>
Peek-a-boo: The Hart basketball team made 154 three-point shots last season, 
but Coach Greg Herrick said that with the addition of Ali Peek, the Indians 
probably won't even attempt 54. 
</P>
<P>
Peek, a 6-foot-4, 230 pound junior center, averaged 22 points and 12 rebounds 
for the junior varsity last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually average one dunk a year and only if the atmospheric conditions are 
right," Herrick said. "We should be averaging one a quarter this year. Once he 
gets the ball inside, it's over. That's Mr. Peek's neighborhood. Can you say 
slam?" 
</P>
<P>
Noble effort: St Francis rebounded from a 1-9 season to 7-4 this season and a 
second-place finish in the San Fernando Valley League under second-year Coach 
Bill Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
"The second year was a lot easier and a much more enjoyable season," Garrison 
said. "Last year it was a difficult situation on both sides and I was just 
trying to learn names. The kids bought the program and we reaped the benefits."

USIU'S ZARECKY TRYING TO STAY AHEAD OF GAME;

<P>
MEN'S BASKETBALL: COACH RUNNING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF GULLS NOT-SO-SOARING PAST.

<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Gary Zarecky doesn't need to make a list of things to remind himself how 
concerned he is about his U.S. International men's basketball team. He's 
worried about every facet of the Soaring Gulls' game -- offense, defense, 
transition -- and nearly every position on the court -- point guard, forward, 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky, who left a nice little job as coach at Sweetwater High in 1985 to try 
and pump life into a program on the Division I critical list, can lose his 
breath just talking about it. The morning after USIU's 104-101 exhibition loss 
to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Zarecky sounded like he had just 
stepped off a treadmill -- puffing hard but going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
The source of his anxiety, however, is the prospect that he could spend the 
next 3 1/2 months running in place with a team that has finished 11-17, 10-18, 
11-17 and 12-16 the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since he has taken the reins, this is Zarecky's team. He has 
recruited all the players, all of whom, he said, were touted as Division I 
caliber in high school. And the Oklahomas, Arkansases, Georgetowns, Nevada Las 
Vegases, Kansases and Syracuses have been dropped from the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Zarecky, 52-88 in five years, is no less concerned about the Gulls' 
chances of putting together a winning season for the first time since 
1980-1981. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, USIU must win a few road games. The Gulls were 0-11 on the road 
last year, 2-13 the year before. Seventeen of USIU's 29 games this season are 
on the road, starting with the Coors Light Classic at Fresno State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many different arenas around the country are called pits," 
Zarecky said. "But it's true. They're pits." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's getting stung by questionable officiating or shocked by fan abuse, 
Zarecky said this is the year the Gulls, who averaged 97.8 points a game last 
year but allowed 102, have to block out all the negatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major adjustment factor, playing on the road," Zarecky said. "These 
players in the Southern California area don't see rabid, loyal, purist fans 
like you see in some parts of the country. All of a sudden you walk into an 
environment where they attack you, really attack you, verbally. It's kind of a 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock to me (the first time). They're brutal on opposing coaches. But 
it's part of the game to them. They think we, as men, can take it. Fresno has 
got those type of fans. Fresno fans are rabid." 
</P>
<P>
USIU will face the Bulldogs, 10-19 last year and 1-1 in exhibitions thus far 
under new Coach Gary Colson, in Selland Arena Friday at 8 p.m. Depending on the 
outcome, the Gulls will draw either Pepperdine or Montana State Saturday. The 
Coors Light Classic is the first of three out-of-town tournaments USIU has 
entered. Zarecky hopes to come away with at least three victories among then. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in four years, we're probably going to go into most gyms 
and arenas equal in talent, which is great progress for us," Zarecky said. "But 
that still puts you in a hole on the road. The environments are against you. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got more depth. We've got some big people, some quick people. But at 
Division I, all teams are like that. Is it going to be enough?" 
</P>
<P>
The only sure thing for USIU appears to be 6-foot-6 senior guard Kevin 
Bradshaw, who led all scorers with 36 points Tuesday and was second in the 
nation in scoring last season with a 31.3 average. Bradshaw, who transfered 
after two seasons at Bethune-Cookman, seemed to relish the Gulls' run-and-gun 
style. He set school records for most points in a game (54 against Loyola 
Marymount) and season (875). 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 Gulls have picked up five new players -- three freshman guards who 
have shown they can score, and two power forwards. But Zarecky remains 
concerned about the consistency of his big men and whether someone will step up 
and produce at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Willie Davis (Morse High) and Al Banks, a strong penetrator, now 
alternate at the point. But Zarecky said any one of five players could win the 
spot, including the three freshmen he calls his "young guns": three-point 
specialist Steve Whitehead (6-5, 200), Arizona product Marc Tuite (6-5) and 
Monte Vista alum Jeff Polinsky (6-3). 
</P>
<P>
Even 6-7 Mitch Brown, a junior who missed the 1989-90 season with a knee 
injury, could take the position with his unusual quickness and mobility. Brown 
sparked USIU with 19 points off the bench Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The forwards are junior college transfers O.J. Bonner (6-7, 215) and Uzoma 
Obiekea (6-7, 245 sophomore from Oguta, Nigeria). After missing three weeks of 
practice because of injuries to his leg and hip, Bonner had seven points and 
five rebounds in 12 minutes as a reserve Tuesday. Obiekea managed six rebounds 
and just two points in 19 minutes as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most important figure in the starting lineup is senior center 
Mike Sterner. Zarecky said the 6-11 Sterner has yet reach the potential he saw 
when he was recruited from of Mitchell, S.D. Sterner is coming off a season in 
which he averaged only 4.8 points and 6.6 rebounds. Against the Fellowship of 
Christian Athletes, Sterner had 13 points, 17 rebounds and four blocked shots 
in 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen his attitude like it is now," Zarecky said. "He wants to go 
out a winner."

Some Thanksgiving thank yous . . . and no thank yous: 
</P>
<P>
Thanks . . . to the Padres' new administration. 
</P>
<P>
This, in truth, is on behalf of erstwhile season ticket-holders. From 
everything I have come to understand, the 1991 baseball season is being kissed 
farewell. I know this because of what the front office is saying. 
</P>
<P>
This organization is talking about a Jerald Clark at first base, the best of 
Shawn Abner, Thomas Howard and Darrin Jackson in center field and the survivor 
among Derek Lilliquist, Atlee Hammaker, Calvin Schiraldi and Dennis Rasmussen 
as the No. 5 starter. 
</P>
<P>
Gasp. 
</P>
<P>
This is because this organization apparently has no interest in investing money 
in any sort of decent free agents. 
</P>
<P>
What's it going to do? Build through a barren (at least at the top) farm 
system? Or make trades when it has no superfluous marketable players to trade? 
</P>
<P>
To put this in perspective, the Padres are doing things like changing trainers 
and public relations directors and scouts and minor-league managers and uniform 
colors and coaches and coming back with the same sad cast of players . . . 
minus Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
All this, and one more change. 
</P>
<P>
Increased ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, thanks again to the Padres for making it perfectly clear this is will be a 
solid last place club before the folks went out and wasted money buying 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Fill those Christmas stockings a little fuller instead. 
</P>
<P>
No thanks . . . to the community for its "support" of San Diego State football. 
</P>
<P>
Conceded, it was a long shot that the Aztecs would get a bid to the 
Independence Bowl, but this team could be 9-2 and going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
In bowl parlance, San Diego State wouldn't figure to travel well. In English, 
this means that a chartered Cessna might hold the San Diegans who would follow 
the team to Shreveport, La., for the Dec. 15 game. 
</P>
<P>
The team itself is attractive, because the offense is one of the best in the 
nation and easily the best in the history of the university. (Yes, better than 
the Coryell "glory days" offenses. Look at the schedule.) 
</P>
<P>
But this exciting team has played four home games and drawn three crowds under 
20,000 and figures to make it four-for-five on the apathy index Saturday night. 
Even the season finale against nationally ranked Miami is expected to attract a 
modest gathering of 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bowl officials -- and this sentiment would not be restricted to the 
Independence Bowl -- would theorize that people who will not get into their 
cars to go to a game never will get onto a plane to see the same team. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks . . . to the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the local heroes suffered a little relapse in Kansas City, but not before 
they managed to make Sundays interesting again hereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
No one would have moaned and groaned about a loss like last Sunday's a year ago 
at this time, because no one cared by then. Another loss was just another yawn. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, this team had not awakened from its 1-4 start as the 49ers South. 
After playing for a few weeks exactly the way they had to play to succeed, the 
Chargers lost to the Chiefs because the stumbling and bumbling in the opening 
minutes made them veer from their strengths. Games like this will happen. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 1991 season is no less interesting. Playing for a wild-card 
playoff position is not as big as playing for a division championship, but it's 
much better than playing for nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be high voltage, but the electricity will be there Sunday evening 
against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
No thanks . . . to Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
So he feels badly about about the controversy of the 1990 season and how he 
couldn't get along with Tony Gwynn and how things will be different in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
They will be. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark won't be here. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres are going to spend the kind of bucks he is asking, like probably 
$3 million a year for three years, maybe they could find a younger free agent 
-- excusing the word -- who might come in with a better attitude and might even 
play 140 games. 
</P>
<P>
No thanks . . . to the Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
The International Hockey League has exposed a World Wrestling Federation 
mentality in San Diego. Let me know the first time a goal by the Gulls causes a 
bigger roar than the latest in an ongoing succession of skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
Forgive me, but these people are not sports fans if they do not appreciate the 
sport they are watching as much as they relish cheap behavior. Their collective 
mentalities might not be able to pass an Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
As one young man in a group (pack?) of four yelled to his chums as they 
departed one night after the second period: "Let's get a beer guys. We've seen 
four fights." 
</P>
<P>
What more could they ask?

NEW TICKET PRICES GIVING SOCKERS FANS CASE OF COLD FEET; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: SEASON TICKET SALES AND ATTENDANCE ARE DOWN THROUGH FIRST FOUR HOME 
GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the summer, the Sockers hit their patrons with higher prices. Now the 
patrons are punching back. 
</P>
<P>
Season ticket sales are down and, after four home games, so is attendance. The 
four-game turnstile count of 33,420 at the Sports Arena is down 3,723 from last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
If the drop-off continues, the Sockers' average attendance would fall for the 
sixth time in the past seven years and would tumble below 8,000 for the first 
time since 1981-82, when the average draw was 7,047. 
</P>
<P>
Unless last year's trend -- in which crowds dwindled as the season wore on -- 
reverses, the Sockers will finish with an average of 7,201. 
</P>
<P>
After 26 home games last year, the average stood at 8,131. But attendance 
trailed off as the season neared the playoffs. Two of the first four games 
attracted more than 11,000. But after that, the Sockers drew only one crowd in 
excess of 10,000, none beyond 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
And that was before fears of recession rocked the economy and before the price 
of lower-level tickets increased. 
</P>
<P>
Of those two factors, the economy and ticket costs, Sockers President Ron Cady 
said the recession gets most of the blame for his team's attendance woes. 
</P>
<P>
"Season tickets are down," Cady said, "but that's an effect of the economy. We 
didn't get any negative feedback on the price increase." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was negative feedback in the bottom line. Last year 3,180 season 
tickets were sold. This year the number stands at 2,250. 
</P>
<P>
"A significant drop," Cady said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sockers' survey of 800 former season ticket-holders might not 
broach the subject, trends during the past seven years suggest price changes 
affect ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices have been hiked in six of the past seven years, and in each of 
the six years of hikes, average attendance slipped. 
</P>
<P>
The kicker here is that the only gain in average attendance came in 1986-87, 
the one season in which ticket prices were lowered from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
It was a modest gain, 166 per game, but the drop in price was also modest. The 
lower-level seats remained unchanged while some seats in the top level sold for 
$7 and others for $5, a difference of $1 to $3 from the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88, the $5 seat was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Another example that lower costs attract more customers unfolded last week when 
the team drew only 4,490 for a Thursday night game, then packed in 11,316 two 
days later. The difference was that the Sockers sold out the upper deck for the 
second game by offering $5 tickets to youth soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sockers should have never stopped offering $5 seats," a former marketing 
employee of the team said. "They should have reserved fewer and fewer seats for 
$5 each year, but still kept them so they could advertise tickets starting at 
$5. That way even if they sell out of $5 tickets, they've drawn parents with 
their kids to the ticket windows. What are parents going to tell their kids? 
That they have to go home? No, they'll buy the higher-priced tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Cady said the club has thought about lowering ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We have looked at that in the past," he said. "But when we had $5 seats, 
everyone bought those tickets and then moved down into the lower section. . . . 
You dilute the quality of the product if you offer too low of a price on 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Cady said instead of lowering ticket prices, the club has decided to discount 
them, offering cheaper rates to juniors (age 19 and under), seniors (55 and 
over), military personnel, families and to large groups. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of tickets and the shaky economy aside, there appear to be at least 
five other factors in the continuing decline in attendance: 
</P>
<P>
* Poor perception of the league. For the third consecutive summer, the MSL 
teetered on collapse, which not only further tarnished its image but played a 
direct role in the Sockers' smaller crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Cady said the Sockers "lost 60 days of selling" when Milan Mandaric, owner of 
the St. Louis Storm, insisted he was going to fold his club. Other owners, 
including the Sockers' Ron Fowler, said if Mandaric closed shop, they would 
follow. Thus, the Sockers' sales and marketing efforts were abandoned for a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, no team went under, but the summer's uncertainty seems to have 
affected all eight clubs and has spawned one of the many paradoxes for which 
the league is often chided: 
</P>
<P>
Despite their crumbling crowds, the Sockers actually lead the league in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
* Too little offense. Whether defenses have improved or the game is losing its 
scoring heroes -- or both -- there have been fewer goals. 
</P>
<P>
Teams combined for an average of 12 goals per game in the inaugural season, 
1978-79. Last year an average of eight goals were scored in each game. 
</P>
<P>
League owners, however, remedied the decrease by enlarging the goal two feet in 
width and one foot in height and by requiring defenders to back off 15 feet on 
all free kicks, rather than 10 as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
At last count, scoring was up 34% from last year to 10.64 goals per game. 
</P>
<P>
Now owners must sit back and hope others take notice. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind the new rules," Cady said, "was to attract new fans. We 
thought if we could increase scoring, someone new to the game might say to 
himself, 'Gosh, maybe indoor soccer is something I'd like to go see.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Poor TV exposure. If a new fan is going to discover indoor soccer, the league 
needs TV. 
</P>
<P>
But the MSL has never had a legitimate national television contract. It has 
been on ESPN, but games were delayed by more than a week in some instances. 
This year, an arrangement has been worked out with SportsChannel America, a 
small cable outlet that currently is beamed to only one MSL market, Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Sockers games have been on Prime Ticket, a cable-only station, since 
1985-86 and therefore TV games have not been available to all San Diego 
households. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that definitely had an impact," the former Sockers marketing employee 
said. "I think they lost the casual fans when they went to Prime Ticket." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' association with Prime Ticket, however, ended last season and the 
team recently announced a six-game package with KUSI Ch. 51 that will begin 
with a Dec. 22 game at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they'll have the casual fan back again," the ex-employee said. "If they 
run a promo for a Sockers-Sidekicks game during, say, 'Cosby,' a lot more 
people will see that than will ever see Prime Ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Cady said he is eager for the televised games to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to get through the first eight home games (without the benefit of 
TV)," Cady said. "Then through the next 18, I feel very confident things will 
really start to pick up (because of TV)." 
</P>
<P>
* Competition. For the first time since the National Basketball Assn. Clippers 
left in 1984, there's another winter team vying for the sports fan's dollar -- 
the Gulls of the International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Cady said the Sockers lost 15 accounts (each account averages 2.2 season 
tickets) to the Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
"Which is a negligible loss due to the Gulls," Cady said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Cady and Don Waddell, general manager for the Gulls, said the 
presence of two teams eventually will help each at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
"With two teams, you get people in the habit of coming to the arena," Waddell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Cady, "It's like the old restaurant theory. You have a lot of restaurants 
in one area and people going to one look up and say, 'Hey, look at that new 
restaurant over there. Next time let's try that one.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Too many games. The one flaw in the old restaurant theory is that most people 
have a limited entertainment budget. Just how many games can a fan afford to 
attend? 
</P>
<P>
Let's see: 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers all-time high in attendance came in 1983-84 when the club was 
forced to forgo the Major Indoor Soccer League season in favor of the North 
American Soccer League's 32-game indoor schedule. The Sockers had only 16 home 
games to sell that year and drew an average of 11,415. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, the Sockers realigned with the MISL and played 24 home games. 
Average attendance dropped by 1,820, the largest single-season fall. 
</P>
<P>
The second biggest fall came in 1987-88 when the MISL decided on its most 
ambitious schedule and gave each team 28 home dates. The Sockers' average crowd 
that year was 8,996, a drop of 751 from the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers currently play 26 home games. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things to do in San Diego," Cady said. "And very possibly 
going to a soccer game two days a week really isn't a viable choice." 
</P>
<P>
Cady also said there is a downside to paring the season. 
</P>
<P>
"You're giving up receipts by cutting down the season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
SOCKERS' ATTENDANCE

ECONOMIC LEGEND TO ADVISE MEXICO ON FREE TRADE TALKS; 
</P>

COMMERCE: JUAN GALLARDO MADE IT BIG DURING HARD TIMES. HE WANTS TO ENSURE THAT 
A COMPACT WITH THE UNITED STATES HELPS -- INSTEAD OF HINDERS -- BUSINESS 
PEOPLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Juan Gallardo could teach Howard Ruff a few lessons about prospering in hard 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Even the perennial pessimist of U.S. economic forecasting could not imagine a 
worse scenario than the one that has confronted Mexican entrepreneurs such as 
Gallardo the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a severe economic slump, they have endured a policy switch from 
protectionism and government paternalism to open markets and privatization -- 
and the loss of subsidies that accompanied the old system. 
</P>
<P>
At 42, Gallardo has survived the 1982 expropriation that eliminated his banking 
job, participated in one of the most controversial sales in the Mexican 
government's privatization drive and bought into troubled companies during the 
country's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, graying entrepreneur came out ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he earned such respect from Mexico's other business leaders 
that they named him their representative in the pending free-trade talks 
between the United States and Mexico. Preliminary discussions about a trade 
pact are expected to top the agenda at next week's meeting in Monterrey between 
the U.S. and Mexican presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Gallardo made it clear during a recent interview that he believes that 
negotiation of an agreement to remove trade barriers between the two countries 
is a government-to-government matter. 
</P>
<P>
However, he was equally adamant that the negotiators need advice from private 
enterprise. "A free-trade agreement is a tool for business to do business," he 
said. "That's its whole purpose." 
</P>
<P>
His presence on the negotiating team may reassure Mexican private enterprise 
that the two governments will keep that in mind as they set about eliminating 
tariffs and other obstacles to trade. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's importers and exporters chose Gallardo for the role because "he is the 
ideal person," said Juan Morales Doria, president of the Mexican Business 
Committee for International Affairs and vice president of Grupo Alfa, the 
country's largest conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
"Juan Gallardo is a well-known entrepreneur and has good relations with his 
counterparts in the United States," explained Morales Doria. "He speaks 
excellent English and has contact with people in the top levels of the Mexican 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Gallardo is part of a new generation of well-educated, cosmopolitan Mexican 
entrepreneurs who are building careers in a rapidly changing economy. They are 
the private-sector counterparts of the government's young technocrats. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a diplomat, he studied at French schools in Mexico, Washington, and 
Belgium. After graduating from one of Mexico's most prestigious law schools, he 
went to work for a large mining company, Grupo Industrial Minera Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, he moved to the international division of a major bank, 
Comermex. About the same time, he joined some friends in forming an investor 
group that buys controlling interests in promising companies, particularly 
turnaround possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
When the government nationalized banks in 1982, Gallardo returned to Industrial 
Minera, this time as president. After his growing investing activities prompted 
him to assume a lesser role of board member, the mining company won two 
auctions that returned major government-owned copper mines to private hands. 
The wins gave Industrial Minera a near-monopoly on Mexican copper. 
</P>
<P>
The investor group's portfolio also kept growing. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no planning process," Gallardo said. "We took the opportunities as 
they arose. In this state of flux that Mexico has gone through, obviously these 
opportunities have been there -- and as a group of investors, we have become 
involved. That's why it's such a varied combination." 
</P>
<P>
The combination has given Gallardo the opportunity to participate directly in 
business deals at the heart of Mexico's economic restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
He sits on the board of the company supplying digital equipment to modernize 
the country's antiquated telephone system. Another of the companies is a 
capital goods manufacturer, part of the sector hardest hit by the government's 
decision to slash tariffs and open the economy to imports in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
He also invested in a venture capital fund to buy and modernize sugar 
refineries -- a once-profitable export industry nearly devasted by regulation, 
contentious unions and government ownership. The sugar refineries complement 
the group's Pepsi-Cola bottler in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
The group's auto parts company -- a joint venture with Clevite Industries, a 
subsidiary of Pullman Co. -- had to overhaul its business in response to the 
policy shifts of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
It used to serve a captive market, supplying bearings to car assembly plants 
that were under government pressure to buy locally made components. But when 
the government started to put a premium on exports, rather than local sourcing, 
it shifted to manufacturing replacement parts for the U.S. and Mexican markets. 
</P>
<P>
Clevite's experience is being repeated over and over again throughout Mexican 
industry, Gallardo said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico has undergone a massive transformation," he said. "The fact that it 
entered into the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, a 77-nation 
trade organization) made it have to be competitive with the rest of the world. 
That has meant for all of us in industry enormous changes of all sorts. Many 
areas that we thought were going to be productive are no longer there, and 
others that we hadn't even thought about are surfacing that are very 
interesting. " 
</P>
<P>
Gallardo -- a workaholic whose schedule leaves little time for outside 
interests beyond his family -- believes that opening the U.S.-Mexico border to 
trade through a free-trade agreement will complete the transformation. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been so much said (about), 'Why this urgency? Are we rushing into 
something?' Well, no, the world is changing at a dramatic speed. It's in both 
of our interests to make sure that we get ourselves organized in sync with the 
rest of the world."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: DEPARTMENT STORE AS ENDANGERED SPECIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As Christmas nears, many needy institutions seek the public's charity dollars. 
Please consider the local department stores. 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't be hard to feel charitable. In many cases, it's the time of year 
they're most attractive -- bustling with life, offering such rare services as 
salespeople and free gift wrap. In some cases, the need is particularly 
poignant: They may not be around next year. 
</P>
<P>
Their desperation shows. Some kicked off their Christmas season by Halloween 
this year. Some, fearing mere goods won't draw customers, are running 
sweepstakes and offering premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Their current November, Thanksgiving and pre-Christmas sales top off a year of 
almost back-to-back two- and three-day sales. And still one could have shopped 
almost alone some days and most evenings. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the retail landscape is "excessively over-stored" for today's 
consumer, according to Price Waterhouse's Management Horizons division in 
Columbus, Ohio. The consulting firm's recent report on retailing in the year 
2000 predicts that half of today's retailers will be gone in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional department stores are considered most vulnerable, having faded for 
years. In prime downtown locations, they used to offer one-stop shopping for 
everything from sewing goods to refrigerators, and they commanded the loyalty 
of customers holding their individual charge cards. 
</P>
<P>
Then came competition of all kinds. In the '50s, it came from new suburban 
stores, drawing people out of downtown, and from the advent of discount stores, 
particularly those selling hard goods. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, it came from the regional mall, itself "a one-stop shop," says 
Leonard Berry, director of the center for retailing studies at Texas A&amp;M. 
Such malls were (and are) "anchored" by department stores but featured smaller 
specialty stores as well, selling goods department stores also sold -- 
stationery, linens, separate categories of fashion (casual clothes, kid's 
clothes, shoes). 
</P>
<P>
Mass merchandise specialists took over in the '70s, selling more of the same 
merchandise department stores offered, but in great volume and at deep discount 
-- Toys R Us, Home Depot, fabric stores. In the '80s, it was fashion specialty 
chains such as the Gap, the Limited, Ann Taylor, offering particular customers 
savings in time and energy if not discounts. Such stores offer particular, 
distinctive styles -- young, trendy, career-oriented. "With everyone working, 
who has time to hunt and peck through a department store?" says Sarah Stack, 
retail analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 30 years, all these new formats have arisen, each in its own way 
taking market share from department stores," says Thomas M. Murnane, Management 
Horizons' executive vice president in Los Angeles. "Discounters offer 
convenience and price, specialists offer fashion and service, mass 
merchandisers offer assortment and price." And bank cards and national charge 
cards dissipated store loyalties further. 
</P>
<P>
Department stores were still attractive enough to become buyout prey in the 
'80s, when some buyers were attracted to anything standing. Whatever their 
market problems before the mergers, acquisitions and debt-heavy takeovers, the 
stores involved had problems thereafter. They were left cash-poor, saddled by 
debt, and depleted, long on financial management and short on merchandising 
talent, help, ideas and even goods from some top manufacturers who "are afraid 
to ship for fear of not getting paid," says Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at 
Management Horizons in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
The most common response is price cutting -- "the crudest form of competition 
if they don't have a good combination of other store attributes, like quality, 
selection, fashion," says Murnane. It's also a competition department stores 
must lose, given their overhead. 
</P>
<P>
The most secure stores, in fact, compete on bases other than price. Nordstrom, 
Saks Fifth Avenue, and others often cited as healthy, offer fashion, quality, 
service, even relatively high prices, because they're "catering to a customer 
not as affected by price," says James Slayden, a retired retail executive now 
teaching retail management at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts seem to suggest that such fashion and service would save all 
department stores. But the kind of fashion admired, and the service usually 
touted -- helping customers accessorize outfits, calling them with merchandise 
bulletins -- is more appealing to big spenders and marketing analysts than to 
middle-class shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
There are still people who believe that, somehow, department stores will 
survive. As Slayden points out, "For 40 years, we've been burying the 
department store," and they're not dead yet. Department stores have "unique 
locational advantages, heritage and image," says Murnane. They should even have 
more customers "as the consumer population ages," says Berry. "People in their 
50s grew up with department stores, and they're used to them." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But for some stores, even the merriest Christmas may not be enough.

2-FOR-1 DEAL GIVES OFF-SEASON LIFT TO AIRLINE PASSENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Passengers apparently love them. Travel agents seem to hate them. And the 
airlines say they are a stimulant during the annual slow season, worsened this 
year because of the slump in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
They are the new "companion" fares, which started out as a discount promotion 
by American Airlines for its frequent-flier program participants and have now 
spread like a forest fire throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
After American sent coupons to its frequent fliers offering a companion ticket 
for $50, United Airlines followed with a missive to its regular customers 
offering the same for $25. Northwest Airlines then said it would honor the 
American and United coupons. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Airlines and Midway Airlines subsequently joined in offering $25 
companion tickets. Then on Sunday, Northwest dropped the price of a companion 
ticket to nothing, and all the others followed. 
</P>
<P>
It's the old two-for-one gimmick -- with plenty of restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers have until Nov. 30 to buy coach tickets. The promotions, designed to 
attract leisure travelers, not business people, apply only to the lowest 
supersaver fares. Trips must be taken by Feb. 28. The tickets are 
nonrefundable, must be purchased seven to 14 days in advance and require a 
Saturday night stay. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, travel must occur between noon Monday and noon Thursday. There are 
blackout periods on the busy Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's travel 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at these fares, there are only so many seats sold on each flight -- 
and many of them have already been gobbled up. 
</P>
<P>
USAir says it has done so well with the sale of tickets that many flights are 
already sold out of special fare seats through the end of the promotion. "If a 
traveler is flexible, he or she might still find a seat," says David Shipley, a 
spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, those who purchased seats prior to the promotion can turn in 
their tickets and substitute the lower fares. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the travel agents' disaffection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's double the work for half the commission," complained Annemarie Lindskog, 
an agent with Worldtek Travel in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Lindskog said she has been swamped with requests for free tickets. For 
instance, a couple who had bought two round-trip tickets to Florida from 
Connecticut had paid $253, she said, and will now be able to fly for half that. 
</P>
<P>
Other carriers say they are also filling a lot of seats with the promotional 
fares. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines said that last Sunday, after the promotion had been 
advertised in major New York and California newspapers, calls to its 
reservation center jumped 15% over the week before, climbing to 25% above 
week-before levels the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a tremendous amount of business," added a spokeswoman for American 
Airlines. She noted that a round-trip fare between Los Angeles previously had 
cost $495, a figure cut in half by the companion offer. 
</P>
<P>
Airline analysts don't believe that the fares will help much to stimulate 
traffic or staunch the industry's mounting losses. While some people might be 
prompted to make travel plans, they say, there won't be enough extra revenue 
after the free tickets have been dispensed to make the undertaking worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
But the program does have its merits, they admit. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of keeps the consumer psychologically interested in flying," says Paul 
Karos, airline analyst with First Boston Corp., a New York investment firm. 
"Before the new fares, they said to themselves, 'I won't even call for the 
fare. It is too expensive.' " 
</P>
<P>
Karos noted that since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, airline fares have risen 
15% to keep up with skyrocketing fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Starkman, airline analyst with Paine Webber, a New York broker, says 
that there may be still deeper promotions soon. Domestic boardings were flat in 
October, he noted.

Andrew Gibson of Saugus has the good news for Saturn, the new small car from 
General Motors. Gerald Cohen of Laguna Beach has the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, an aircraft mechanic for USAir, says his four-door Saturn is perfect 
after 2,000 miles. He gets a better-than-expected 42 miles per gallon, and has 
generated two more Saturn sales by word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"Not meaning to sound like a Saturn commercial, but we're just thrilled," says 
Gibson, 28. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, a businessman, would have bought a Saturn for his wife but none was 
available. And he would have bought one for his son, but the young man objected 
to the way the engine sounds. Cohen bought two Honda Accords instead. 
</P>
<P>
"The Honda's a proven car," says Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
There is room for debate over the sound of the engine, which Car &amp; Driver 
magazine described as "sour" but others find unremarkable. And the early 
verdicts have been favorable on the cars Saturn has managed to build. 
</P>
<P>
But a month after the vehicle went on sale and nearly four months after 
production began, shortages are costing Saturn customers such as the Cohens and 
are now causing problems in the dealer network, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing snags, late design changes and quality problems with supplier 
parts continue to halt the assembly line in Spring Hill, Tenn., leaving Saturn 
with fewer than half the cars it expected to have by now, sources say. Saturn 
won't discuss the size of the shortfall or the reasons for it, but admits to a 
"very low" production rate. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days we don't build any, some days we build 125 or 150," a source says, 
estimating the average at 70 to 80. "It's a whole range of picayune (problems). 
We're doing root-cause analysis, not putting a Band-Aid on it." 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing problems are normal on new products, but skeptics say the risks 
are greatly magnified in the case of Saturn because everything -- from the car 
and its components to the vast manufacturing complex building the engines, 
transmissions and the vehicle itself -- is new. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Saturn Corp., the subsidiary set up by GM to create what its ads 
call a "new kind of car company," have refused all along to divulge interim 
goals and timetables on the way to its full production target of 240,000 cars a 
year. The first sales and production results will be disclosed early next 
month, with the rest of the auto industry's figures. 
</P>
<P>
But a Saturn spokesman confirmed that the slow start-up has forced Saturn to 
delay a number of dealership openings. As of this week, 51 dealerships had 
opened, up from 30 on Oct. 25, the day the cars went on sale. But some have 
just a few cars and are holding them for test drives. 
</P>
<P>
Several dealers said Saturn has proposed to GM the rare step of establishing an 
"assurance program" to shore up dealers financially while they wait for cars. 
Saturn declined comment on this. 
</P>
<P>
Typical is the Saturn franchise in Ft. Worth, Tex., which was supposed to have 
90 cars on Oct. 12 but had only a dozen and has since taken delivery of 25 
more. Saturn of the Valley, in Sepulveda, expected 150 cars by now, and has 
received 43. 
</P>
<P>
Selling them isn't the problem, says owner Bert Boeckmann of the Valley 
dealership. All but nine are gone and those are needed for test drives. The 
problem is hanging onto the 97 customers who have placed refundable deposits 
and are waiting for their cars to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials are worried about irritating would-be customers and losing 
momentum if the production rate doesn't pick up sharply by early next year, 
when another wave of new dealerships is to open to capitalize on the spring 
selling season. 
</P>
<P>
Dealer patience "isn't going to last long," said a Saturn official. "We've 
created some expectations. By the end of January, we need to have our act 
together or we could be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Saturn workers, dealers and company officials say the agonizingly slow 
production rate is all in the name of quality, a claim that seems supported by 
spot checks with a few early owners of the cars. And so far, those who invested 
up to $5 million apiece to become Saturn "retailers" are publicly applauding 
the tortoise-like pace. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars they send us are absolutely flawless," says Dan Wade, general manager 
at Saturn of El Cajon. "If they were to speed up production to get rid of the 
few critics, I think they would be doing the United States a great disservice." 
</P>
<P>
Wade was referring to some latent America-firsters whom he and other dealers 
say Saturn has tapped among early shoppers in California. The vehicle, almost 
entirely a North American product, is aimed directly at traditional import 
buyers, particularly Californians. Saturn's goal is for 80% of its cars to be 
bought by non-GM customers. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, GM retirees and others with ties to the U.S. auto industry are well 
represented in the early wave of customers, some dealers say. But several said 
that half to three-fourths of their buyers owned imports. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Francisco Bay Area, an imported-car hotbed, megadealer Donald Lucas 
said public interest in the car is "absolutely extraordinary." He estimates 
that 70% of the cars he has taken as trade-ins are imports, a far larger 
proportion than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that it's a domestic is a very powerful positive," said Lucas, whose 
three Saturn dealerships add to his Honda, Cadillac, Acura, BMW and Oldsmobile 
outlets in the Bay Area and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"We repeatedly hear people saying: 'Boy, it's about time. We've finally built a 
car that can compete with the Japanese,' " Lucas said. "It kind of gives you 
goose bumps." 
</P>
<P>
But with the production rate so cautious and so few cars on the road, it is far 
too early to judge how the Saturn will hold up. Says Lucas: "I sure hope it 
stays together." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Saturn with the most mileage is owned by the Detroit Free Press 
newspaper, which bought one from a Santa Ana dealership in late October and 
turned it over to a reporter and photographer for an ongoing test drive. 
</P>
<P>
After 5,000 miles, the car has experienced a small leak of transmission fluid 
from an axle joint, a seat-adjustment problem and a "slight vibration" in the 
front passenger door when loud music is played. The source of the vibration 
hasn't been found, the seat has been fixed, and changes were made in the 
assembly process to prevent the condition that caused the leak. 
</P>
<P>
Sepulveda dealer Boeckmann, whose Galpin Motors Inc. also includes Ford and 
Hyundai franchises, says he has delivered 31 Saturns, none of which has been 
brought back in for adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"That's never happened before," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, that's not quite right. Aircraft mechanic Gibson said he drove his 
Saturn back to Boeckmann's dealership, but only to get some of salesman Hank 
Collier's business cards to hand out to the people who are constantly stopping 
him to ask about the car. His Saturn replaces a Nissan Sentra, he says. 
</P>
<P>
One sales obstacle has been an almost complete lack of Saturns equipped with 
automatic transmissions -- a problem that Saturn officials say resulted from 
early customer dissatisfaction with "the feel of the shift." A design change 
was made, and automatics started reaching dealerships about 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting patiently was Jeff Howard, 35, of Reseda, who traded in a Suzuki and 
took possession of his loaded, $13,500 Saturn a week ago. National sales 
manager for Pacific Brands, a supermarket products firm, Howard says he bought 
into "the whole concept" of Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
By that he meant the ballyhooed worker-management-dealer consensus 
decision-making at Saturn, the clean-sheet-of-paper approach to the car and all 
its major parts, the new manufacturing complex far from Detroit, and the car 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It handles beautifully. It's a tremendous little car," Howard declares. "I've 
owned just about every kind of import you can think of -- BMW, Honda, VW, 
Suzuki -- and I'm proud to say I bought an American car." 
</P>

Mobil Loses Wrongful-Dismissal Case: Mobil Corp. said it will appeal a decision 
by a federal court that found a subsidiary had wrongfully dismissed 
environmental officer Valcar Bowman Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., had ordered Mobil Chemical Co. to pay 
Bowman $375,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. 
Bowman charged that Mobil dismissed him because he would not whitewash reports 
documenting Mobil's environmental problems, an act that would have violated 
federal and state environmental laws. Mobil said Bowman's 1986 dismissal was 
part of a cost cutting program.

Record Year for Farm Imports, Exports: The United States exported a record 
$40.2 billion in farm products in fiscal 1990 but also posted record farm 
imports due to U.S. taste for foreign wine, beer, meat, fruits and vegetables, 
according to the Agriculture Department. Even with the $22.5 billion in imports 
-- up $1 billion from the preceding year -- agriculture is a bright spot in the 
U.". trade picture with a trade surplus of $17.7 billion, the agency said. The 
surplus was $18.2 billion in fiscal 1989.

Britain Launches Utility Selloff: The British government said it hopes to raise 
$10.2 billion in the first stage of its electricity industry selloff, its 
biggest and most complex privatization in the last 10 years. Twenty percent of 
the 2.16 billion shares being sold will be offered to foreign investors. The 
shares will sell for $4.73 (240 pence) each, or a total of about $10.2 billion 
(5.18 billion pounds), the government said.

Plentiful Supply of Christmas Trees: There is a good supply of Christmas trees 
nationally for 1990 and prices will be only a little higher than a year ago, a 
spokeswoman with the National Christmas Tree Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
The Milwaukee-based group's 2,800 members expect to sell about 36 million 
Christmas trees for the holiday season, said Cate Miller. "Price is the good 
news for consumers," she said. "There is a very little increase, probably to 
the range from $3.25 to $5.25 per foot for retail. That's just a slight 
increase over 1989 prices (of $3 to $5.25)."

PROFIT AT WORLD'S NO. 2 COMPUTER MAKER DROPS 34%

<P>
Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's biggest computer maker, Thursday reported a 34% drop in 
profit in the first half of its fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The weak results surprised financial analysts who follow the company, the No. 2 
computer manufacturer in the world after International Business Machines Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu reported that group profit dropped to $204.6 million in the six months 
ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected a drop in profits, but not so much," said an industry analyst at a 
Japanese brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu said the lower profit was due in part to development spending, 
including establishing overseas production, and strengthening its sales 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates and special losses, including a drop in the value of its 
shares in telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., also 
ate into profits, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The gloom could spread into the full year ending March 31, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The company spokesman said a stronger yen and continued pressure from high 
interest rates are expected to dampen profits, as is a $47.2-million good-will 
payment in connection with its acquisition of British computer giant ICL 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Fujitsu has lowered group profit forecast for the full business 
year to $708 million from a May forecast of $866 million. 
</P>
<P>
That compares to a profit of $677 million in 1989-90.

WORLD TRADE TALKS FALL INTO DISARRAY

<P>
Talks aimed at liberalizing world trade were in disarray Thursday due to 
deep-seated disagreements over reforming the rules of commerce and a possible 
walkout by several Latin American nations. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the survival of the 4-year-old round of world trade talks, which 
ministers are due to complete in Brussels early next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," lamented one delegate at the headquarters of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the global organization overseeing the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The two most problematic areas were how far to cut farm subsidies and how to 
bring the $680-billion-a-year trade in services such as banking and insurance 
under GATT rules. 
</P>
<P>
No progress was evident in either area, and some positions may even have 
hardened. 
</P>
<P>
The United States disrupted the services negotiations Tuesday night with a 
radical proposal to prevent most-favored nation treatment from being a general 
obligation -- a move delegates said threw into question whether there would be 
a services agreement at all. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, GATT Director General Arthur Dunkel was convening the first 
meeting on agriculture since Nov. 10, but delegates said it was more likely to 
be taking stock of positions rather than settling on a compromise.

JAZZ SCENE GROWING PAINS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: DISCORD EMERGES AS FANS OF STRAIGHT-AHEAD JAZZ LOSE VENUES TO LIGHT 
JAZZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Diego's jazz club scene has matured, but not without growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years alone, clubs such as the Bella Via, Our Place, Vic's and 
Diego's Loft have closed or discontinued jazz. But venues such as Croce's, the 
Horton Grand Hotel and All That Jazz in Rancho Bernardo emerged to take their 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Other jazz spots, such as the Catamaran and Chuck's Steakhouse, switched from 
traditional, straight-ahead jazz to light-contemporary jazz to lure larger 
crowds. And thus began the great debate between the light jazzers and the 
traditional purists. 
</P>
<P>
Light, or "contemporary," jazz was popularized by KIFM (98.1) radio during the 
1980s. You don't need a lot of patience or musical education to appreciate its 
simple, predictable melodies, which are seldom interrupted by improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, spontaneous improvisation is the common characteristic of such 
traditional jazz forms as Big Band music or the small-group be-bop originated 
by players such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker during the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
This essential difference has left two camps of fans and musicians at odds. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people take exception to the fact that they call that music jazz," said 
Tony Sidotti, a disc jockey on KSDS-FM (88.3) who also books straight-ahead 
jazz in local clubs. "However, I do feel that the end result of KIFM's music is 
more positive than negative. You've seen some of that in the last year, with 
(light jazz players such as) David Benoit and Lee Ritenour doing straight-ahead 
jazz albums." 
</P>
<P>
The KIFM-sponsored Lites Out Jazz club circuit now features jazz at the 
Catamaran, Humphrey's, Anthony's Harborside and other venues six nights a week. 
In some clubs, light jazz preempted other forms of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The Catamaran in Pacific Beach and Chuck's Steakhouse (not on KIFM's circuit) 
in La Jolla, for example, were straight-ahead venues that went light. 
</P>
<P>
"For some 20 years, we were sort of a (straight-ahead) jazz club," said George 
Harrington, general manager at the Catamaran for six years. "When I got to town 
in 1985, I met Art Good," who pioneered light jazz on KIFM. "We went over to 
Humphrey's one night to hear light jazz, and the place was packed. We decided 
to go with it at the Catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no conscious decision to use contemporary jazz over straight-ahead. 
It was just something that was happening in 1985, and it looked like a good way 
to fill the room on Wednesday nights. It was a winner from 
</P>
<P>
Day One. The room seats 350, and it has been full the last three Wednesdays." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington doubts he will ever go back to straight-ahead jazz. He doesn't think 
the light jazz and rock fans who now flock to the hotel's Cannibal Bar on 
different nights would have much use for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Lites Out Jazz is winning, unfortunately," said bassist Kevin Hennessy, who 
plays a variety of jazz with several local bands. "I love to play 
straight-ahead jazz, but I never get calls for it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some clubs have kept their traditional jazz, and persistence sometimes 
allows them to build loyal followings. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent as much as $10,000 a month subsidizing our jazz, but now it pretty 
much breaks even," said Ingrid Croce, who features local straight-ahead jazz 
groups twice a day, seven days a week at Croce's, the downtown restaurant and 
bar she owns. 
</P>
<P>
One debate between fans of the two musics has centered on whether KIFM and 
contemporary jazz can help bring new listeners to other forms of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the popularity of light jazz help KSDS and straight-ahead jazz?" said 
Tony Sisti, programming director at KSDS. "I don't know. The sense I get is 
KIFM brings listeners to KIFM. Our audience doesn't tolerate much contemporary 
jazz. A guy called in today while we were playing a Chuck Mangione song and 
said, 'Do us a favor. No more Chuck Mangione.' We play a little fusion or 
contemporary jazz, but we're very selective. We don't play Kenny G., but we 
would play something like the Yellowjackets and Michael Brecker." 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Weissberg, who prefers traditional jazz to the light jazz he presents 
during the summer Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay series, nonetheless thinks 
KIFM deserves some credit. 
</P>
<P>
"They play a lot of music that doesn't get much radio play anywhere else. They 
have more artists and songs on their list than Q-106, B-100, KGB or even 91X. 
In terms of taking chances, no one in commercial radio takes chances, which 
leaves it to college or nonprofit radio to play people like Jelly Roll Morton 
or Miles Davis." 
</P>
<P>
A healthy trend from all this is the blurring of borders among varieties of 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
KSDS plays the top contemporary and traditional jazz albums of the week on its 
"Friday Night Countdown" program. 
</P>
<P>
Elario's, the La Jolla club that for years featured only veterans of 
straight-ahead jazz, is branching out, even trying to lure KIFM's audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Straight-ahead jazz is a very, very tough art form to make money in," said Rob 
Hagey, who books Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
Since Hagey began coordinating the talent last spring, Elario's has expanded 
its lineup to include not only established, legendary straight-ahead players 
such as Art Farmer, Benny Carter and Kenny Burrell, but also rising 
straight-ahead musicians such as Christopher Hollyday and Marcus Roberts; 
cutting-edge jazz musicians, including Sun Ra and Bill Frisell, and even KIFM 
favorites such as Tim Eyermann. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if KIFM's audience comes into the club to hear talent they recognize, 
they might come back to hear a straight-ahead band and like it. That's one 
reason I'm broadening our program." 
</P>
<P>
Even KIFM is expanding its horizons. Following steady criticism from local 
straight-ahead fans, the station added a Sunday night traditional program two 
years ago. Ron Galon, who also has a show on KSDS, is the host. 
</P>
<P>
KIFM Program Director Bob O'Connor said station surveys indicate a small but 
growing audience for Galon's program; in a departure from its staunch 
light-jazz posture of years past, the station may even add a few mainstream 
songs to its play list sometime in the near future, according to O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their differences, fans of contemporary and straight-ahead jazz seem 
to agree on one thing: Local clubs now offer a better selection of jazz than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the club scene is starting to get strong," said Sisti, the programing 
director at KSDS. "The late 1980s represented a pretty weak period, but I think 
the scene is starting to come back. A lot of it is up to the audiences. They 
have to get out and support these places or people can't stay in business."

CalArts is the most famous institution -- with the exception of Magic Mountain 
-- in the Santa Clarita Valley. But area residents do not all take pride in the 
college, which has a reputation for putting on avant-garde plays, cutting-edge 
music concerts and wacky art performances. 
</P>
<P>
"People who live here think of CalArts as someplace that is secluded, with all 
these middle-class or well-to-do students who don't have anything to do with 
the community," said Alfredo Vasquez, a social worker with the Santa Clarita 
Valley Service Center, an agency funded by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Student Tim Myers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people who live around here think of the school as the castle on 
the hill," said Myers, who is a fourth-year student in character animation. 
"They have this image of it being full of crazy artists who dress different and 
have very different ideas about the world." 
</P>
<P>
Myers is spearheading a project that -- along with other recent efforts by the 
school to reach out to Santa Clarita Valley residents -- could go a long way 
toward engendering warmer feelings about the college. He and fellow students 
have put together the fourth annual Winter Show of animation art, which begins 
Saturday, culminating in a benefit auction Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the auction, which will feature original drawings and animation 
cels by prominent animators, will go to the Santa Clarita Valley Service 
Center's Christmas program, which provides low-income families with a holiday 
meal and presents for the children. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they never expected it from us," Myers said. "When we called up the 
center to tell them we wanted them to get the proceeds, the woman on the phone 
started to cry." 
</P>
<P>
Myers, 27, started the Winter Show in 1987, not long after he arrived at 
CalArts from West Virginia University, where he had been studying art. The 
exhibition was, at first, only meant to be a showcase for work by animation 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year, we just stuck some art on the walls and said, 'Yeah, that's 
cool,' " Myers said. "We put some posters up to advertise the show, and people 
came to see it, so it worked." 
</P>
<P>
Myers was happy with the results and decided to do another Winter Show the 
following year and to add an auction to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided there was a potential here to not only show off our work, but to do 
some good too," he said. "I wanted to try to raise some bucks for kids who need 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The plan to auction off the student work quickly fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the students were submitting stuff," Myers said. "Everyone was busy, 
and we just couldn't get them interested. Ten days before the show, the head of 
our department said that if we couldn't get students to bring in their art, the 
show would have to be canceled." 
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to save the event, organizers of the show decided to ask 
well-known animators if they would donate animation cels and drawings that 
could be auctioned. Without an appointment, they went to the office of Ralph 
Bakshi, best known for his feature film "Fritz the Cat," talked their way in 
and got his commitment to donate four cels from his "The Further Adventures of 
Mighty Mouse" television show. 
</P>
<P>
They also received donated art from the Disney studio and Don Bluth (director 
of "The Land Before Time"), and from such television animation studios as 
Hanna-Barbera, Marvel Productions and DIC. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting auction raised about $4,000, which was given to the Shriners 
Hospital for Crippled Children in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The auction of donated art was repeated in 1989, and that year the proceeds 
amounted to about $6,000. But Myers did not want the money to go to another 
large institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after we gave the money to the hospital, we heard that they got a huge 
government grant," he said. "They really didn't need us so much. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that we wanted the money we raised to go to the little guy, the 
people who don't get big grants but still do a lot of good, the people driving 
around in vans and giving out sandwiches." 
</P>
<P>
They donated the 1989 proceeds to the Hollygrove Orphanage in Hollywood and 
Para los Ninos, a social service agency for children in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said the upcoming Winter Show will be the biggest so far. Among the items 
to be auctioned will be drawings from Disney's "The Little Mermaid" and "Roger 
Rabbit," cels from a Babar the Elephant film made by Nelvana Studio in Canada, 
and cels from the "Mutant Teenage Ninja Turtles" television series, from 
Murakami Wolf Films. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be art from such famed animation figures as Chuck Jones, Ollie 
Johnston and Frank Thomas. Ward Kimball, renowned for his work on Disney 
features, sent a letter saying he unfortunately had nothing available to 
donate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to auction off the letter," Myers said with a laugh. "He is such a 
legend that we figured someone would want to have it." 
</P>
<P>
Myers hopes to raise at least $10,000 at this year's auction. 
</P>
<P>
The students looked into several organizations as possible beneficiaries before 
settling on the Santa Clarity Valley Service Center. "They do so much over 
there, and they do it on so little funding," said Myers, who added that the 
center was not chosen because it was close to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, however, believes that because the money is being raised by CalArts 
students, relations between town and gown will improve. 
</P>
<P>
"People like me have said that we have never seen CalArts get involved in 
community activities," Vasquez said. "We can't say that anymore."

PREVIEW: 'PROFOUND' ART CREATED FROM URBAN DEBRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old shoes. Letters from the 1930s. Newspaper clippings. 
</P>
<P>
These are flotsam and jetsam of our lives, ignored in back-yard sheds and junk 
piles. Yet such items are infused with personal histories. Perhaps they were 
once important to someone. Perhaps it is significant that they were thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
Three artists showing at Pierce College's Art Gallery have filled an exhibit 
with such urban debris. Like its title, the show "Found/Profound" offers 
current expression that hopes to be empowered by bits and pieces of anonymous, 
past lives: 
</P>
<P>
* Betty McDonald builds constructions of scrap wood and wire and, in one 
instance, shoes -- "fascinating trash," she calls it. The artist claims to be 
guided by a garbage-can intuition. 
</P>
<P>
"Why I pick up what I do is not known to me," she says in accompanying text. 
</P>
<P>
From such basic beginnings, McDonald ambitiously attempts to present her 
opinions regarding "aspects of being a woman" as well as "censorship, flag 
protection, contemporary icons and our planet in distress." 
</P>
<P>
One particularly striking piece, called "Exposure," features an unclothed 
plastic doll perched on a bed of crushed glass. The doll's head is bound in 
pink ribbon and black thread. A row of lights along the top lend this 
construction a carnival appearance, but block letters warn "DON'T LOOK AT THIS 
NUDE." One assumes that the work falls under the "woman/censorship" heading. 
</P>
<P>
* Along a more personal and painful theme, Nancy Halvorsen has produced a 
series of images and handwritten texts framed by a gooey, tarlike substance 
bristling with bits of twigs and seashells. These works, in both picture and 
word, equate the illness of the artist's mother to the destruction of nature. 
</P>
<P>
"She has cancer, just like the rest of the Earth, the cancer of our greed, of 
our emptiness and insatiable lust for things for objects to own and devour," 
Halvorsen's text says. "The cancer is devouring my mother, just as the cancer 
of our human greed is devouring the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece for Halvorsen's series is a full-page newspaper ad that Exxon 
ran shortly after the Valdez oil spill. The company apologizes and insists that 
it has taken every possible action to clean up the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Images above and below this ad -- human figures bent in sorrow or twisted in 
anger -- cast doubt on Exxon's sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
* Kathi Martin has provided a less assaultive fare. She harks to a less 
complicated era before people were desensitized by constant stimulation. The 
wood and glass boxes she calls "Los Angeles" are filled with faded letters and 
postcards. Tourist pictures show the city as a place of color and beauty. Yet 
the images can evoke discord. 
</P>
<P>
"We have visited these very spots last week," Martin writes in the accompanying 
text. "We couldn't find a parking place and litter was jammed along the edges 
of all the tree lawns." 
</P>
<P>
As Betty McDonald suggests in her text, the most banal items can offer insight 
to a society that produced and used them up. McDonald, Halvorsen and Martin 
struggle to illuminate such discarded wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Found/Profound" continues through Dec. 6 at the Pierce College Art Gallery, 
6201 Winnetka Ave., Woodland Hills. The exhibit is open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., 
1:30 to 3:30 p.m. and 7:30 to 9 p.m. Mondays; 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 7:30 to 
9 p.m. Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. Wednesdays; and 
11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Thursdays. Information: (818) 719-6498.

MYSTERIES R US: Doug Stumpf, senior editor at William Morrow &amp; Co. in New 
York, says the county is the setting for so many mysteries because it's 
"perfect" -- suburban, but with "the crime and sophistication of an urban 
center." Besides, "there's something about a hotter climate and the beach and 
palm trees that gives it a really sexy element you don't get if your feet are 
in the snow." . . . And judging from the manuscripts Stumpf sees, "there's a 
lot of talent coming out of Orange County these days."

Forty volunteers in 22 airplanes searched in vain Thursday over the California 
and Arizona desert for a small plane carrying a 57-year-old Thousand Oaks pilot 
and his passenger. The search for William Crimmins and Lavonne DeSchpper, last 
seen Monday evening when they left an airport at Grand Junction, Colo., will 
continue today, according to Civic Air Patrol spokesman Ed Crankshaw.

The state has removed the Breathalyzer from the Sierra County Sheriff's 
Department substation in Loyalton, meaning that deputies must now make a 
60-mile drive to Downieville to give a breath test to a suspected drunk driver. 
The Sierra County Board of Supervisors and the Deputy Sheriff's Assn. complain 
that the drive of at least an hour over the 6,700-foot Yuba Pass decreases the 
presence of law enforcement, dramatically increases court costs and gives the 
suspect time to sober up.

STREET SMART: ALL WE WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS A PARKING SPACE . . .;

MALL TREKKERS CAN BE NAUGHTY, OR NICE

<P>
OK, Thanksgiving is just a bad case of left-over indigestion. Now 'tis the 
season to be jolly, right? 
</P>
<P>
Get real. Today is D-Day at a local mall near you, the busiest shopping day of 
the year. It's time to pack up the kids and your nerve and head out on the 
highway lookin' for consumer adventure -- or maybe just a good parking spot 
near Nordies. 
</P>
<P>
You and hordes of holiday shoppers will be vying for a finite number of parking 
spaces. It'll be war out there in the department store parking lot, a battle 
ranking up with Antietam and Dunkirk. Don't fret. You can conquer the long and 
winding road that leads to the department store door. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone should be prepared for people who will be discourteous in the parking 
lot or out on the road," advised Officer Linda Burrus of the Highway Patrol's 
Santa Ana office. "It's not worth playing chicken to see who gets that parking 
spot first." 
</P>
<P>
Burrus recommends driving slowly in parking lots during the crowded shopping 
rush. The crunch of traffic and pedestrians makes the season ripe for fender 
benders or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jim Winder of the Brea Police Department said people often concentrate so 
much on getting a parking space that they forget the regular dangers of 
driving. He's seen motorists make unsafe turns or other errant maneuvers while 
they hunted for spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Their attention is spread between a number of things," he said. "On a routine 
shopping day, they know they're going to find a space and so they focus more on 
their driving." 
</P>
<P>
The sensible ones among us know we should stay home during these first frenetic 
days of the holiday shopping rush. But, hey, this is Southern California! How 
could we? 
</P>
<P>
So out we'll go, packing a wallet fat with credit cards and an ankle-length 
list of toys for children of all ages. As if such consummate consumerism isn't 
stressful enough, there is the chore of just getting safely inside the store. 
</P>
<P>
There are the holiday vultures circling the lot in their cars. There are the 
dingbats, folks who make a ritual of gouging your Beamer's shiny sheet metal 
with their clunker car doors. There are autos queued up for that single spot 
opening up a quarter mile down the row. There are the tigers in their '72 
Toyotas, ready to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with all that, motorists should concentrate on keeping their stress level 
in check, experts advise. Losing a parking spot or waiting for some klutz to 
clear out of the way is no reason to blow a piston. Hum a Christmas carol. Let 
sugarplums dance in your head. Do anything to avoid rage. 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing is to realize its not going to be just another normal day at the 
mall," said Andrew Lesser, a physician specializing in stress-management and 
author of "Drive With Less Stress," a handbook of tips to keep your Angst in 
check behind the wheel. "People should tune in to the radio and tune out on the 
traffic. And they should go into the holiday shopping experience not expecting 
to get a parking spot at the front. Then it's easier to accept having to walk a 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
Lesser said a cardinal rule is to never fight over a parking spot. It's just 
not worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply because you see one doesn't mean your name has been automatically 
written on the curb stop," he noted. "People take possession of a parking spot 
in their minds and are unwilling to give up something that they believe is 
theirs, but it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Managers of the malls share many of the same tips. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to be walking a lot anyway, so when you see a spot, take it," 
Huntington Center Marketing Director Pat Rogers advises. She also urges 
politeness. "Try to be courteous, we're all in this together." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers has seen car passengers jump from vehicles and run to open spaces and 
then stand and wave off would-be parkers to hold the space for their friends. 
"That to me is kind of cheating, but people do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Susie Plummer, Fashion Island's assistant marketing manager, said that the time 
people spend looking for an up-front spot amazes her. "When I moved to 
California, I couldn't believe people spent so long looking for a spot," said 
Plummer, who generally takes whatever space is open and walks. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the freeway, traffic can get a bit heavier, but the only mall where cars 
regularly back up down the off-ramp during the holiday shopping season is South 
Coast Plaza, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, motorists should be careful along San Diego Freeway at the Bristol 
Street exit. Burrus suggests coming in the "back way" off the Costa Mesa 
Freeway along MacArthur Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Other tips from traffic experts and mall managers include: 
</P>
<P>
* Arrive before noon or shop in the early evening, when many people eat dinner. 
Avoid arriving between noon and 4 p.m. Most shoppers will be ensconced in their 
favorite stores, so parking lot turnover will be slow. 
</P>
<P>
* Use side streets to avoid major thoroughfares, often congested with motorists 
more concerned with getting to the mall than avoiding an accident. Also, every 
mall has side street entrances that will give you quicker access to parking 
lots. Seek these out. 
</P>
<P>
* When you see a space, take it, rather than cruise around looking for a better 
one. By the time you get a prime space, you'd probably could have already been 
in the mall shopping. Some malls offer an escort service back to your car if 
you park in remote areas, so safety need not be a concern. Ask store managers 
or at mall information booths about whether your mall offers this service. 
</P>
<P>
* Plan your shopping. Work your way around the mall, if possible, and back to 
your car. Handicapped and elderly shoppers should check with mall security to 
see if assistance with packages is available.

GETTING THERE: 
</P>
<P>
Arrive before noon or early evening, when many people eat dinner. Use side 
streets rather than congested highways for quicker access to mall parking lots. 
Use parking structures, usually linked to mall by bridges. 
</P>
<P>
TIPS: 
</P>
<P>
Know what you're looking for, and work your way around the mall, back to your 
car. Ask if mall offers services such as babysitting, parking lot escorts or 
package assistance for elderly or handicapped shoppers.

The buffet was set up for 12 at Chief Warrant Officer Joseph Gurule's home 
Thursday, but the talk was still of loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests at the Gurule's annual Thanksgiving dinner were young Marines 
who spoke about how empty the barracks are these days, about how it's been 
months since they've heard from this friend or that one. 
</P>
<P>
On the living room couch, Anna Garza, 23, petite and brown-eyed, watched her 
two toddlers play with toy cars, gingerly resting her hand on her slightly 
bulging stomach. She is expecting her third child in late March. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the baby kicked for the first time about a week ago, a few days 
before his father, Jose Garza, a Marine Corps E-3 stationed at El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station was called to serve in the Persian Gulf. He was thrilled, 
Anna Garza said, smiling with the memory but wondering whether her husband 
might miss other milestones. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping he'll be back before the baby starts doing all the fun things," 
said Garza, "like when he starts making faces and eating with a spoon. . . . 
What makes it harder is that Tino (her 4-year-old son) keeps asking for his 
daddy." Anna Garza waved goodby to her husband through the window of a bus on 
Tuesday morning at 4 a.m. Gurule, her husband's boss, was also there to see off 
Garza and "two of my others" who had been called to the sudden deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Gurule made a point of inviting Anna to dinner, he said, just as her husband 
stepped onto the bus. "He had a look of relief. . . . I felt really 
heartbroken," Gurule recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The comment seemed to slip out between the clipped and formal speech of the 
muscular career Marine. "Don't have a choice, ma'am," he said a few minutes 
later when asked about his own imminent deployment. "It's our job." 
</P>
<P>
Gurule, and his wife, Cheryl, have made a tradition of hosting Thanksgiving 
dinners for Marines without relatives nearby and for families whose loved ones 
are at sea. Last year they served up three turkeys, three hams and mashed 
potatoes for about 60 guests who crowded into their small home and spilled into 
the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Just one turkey was enough this year. Some of those who attended last year's 
dinner are already in the Middle East, and many wives, with no certainty of 
when their husbands will return, have moved back to hometowns to be with 
parents or extended families. 
</P>
<P>
"I put one on a plane just yesterday and I stood there and cried," said Cheryl 
Gurule, 35. "I was just thinking, 'Gosh, there's another one that I'm sending 
home.' "

DARE PROGRAM FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Huntington Beach City School District board this week agreed to expand its 
Drug Abuse Resistance Education program to include kindergarten through 
fourth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
If the Huntington Beach Police Department's charge for the services of an 
additional DARE officer meet district budget expectations, the district will 
become one of the first in Orange County to involve its younger students in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current DARE program, one Huntington Beach officer serves the 
district and focuses on fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department plans to broaden the program in February to include 
students in seventh and eighth grades. The cost of that program, as well as the 
existing one, is covered by the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The planned expansion into the lower grades, however, would be paid for by the 
district. Officials have earmarked a yet-undetermined sum of state Drug, 
Alcohol and Tobacco Education funding for the new program, said John Magnuson, 
the district's manager of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The Police Department will come back to us with a dollar figure. . . and if we 
can afford it, we'll go ahead and do it," Magnuson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the perceived success of the DARE counseling and instruction curriculum 
prompted district officials to consider including younger students. "We felt it 
would be a good idea to place more emphasis on the K-4 students, and then carry 
it on through" higher grades, he said.JOHN PENNER

PLANNERS APPROVE NEW LIBRARY WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What city officials describe as the largest library wing in the state for 
children has been approved for Huntington Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission this week unanimously approved adding the $5-million 
wing. Unless that vote is appealed to the City Council within 10 days, 
construction can begin on the 26,476-square-foot addition to the library at 
Talbert Avenue near Golden West Street. 
</P>
<P>
Given the overwhelming support the project has received from city officials, 
residents and businesses, library director Ron Hayden said he doubts that a 
council hearing will be called. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the children's library, the wing will include an expanded bookstore, 
a small theater, a video and computer center and a new entry. Some outdoor 
fountains will also be reconfigured. 
</P>
<P>
About $2.5 million of the project's cost will be paid for by fund raising, with 
the remainder covered by federal and state grants and the city, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
The library is expected to open in fall, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The building's look will reflect the design of the existing library designed by 
Richard Neutra, whom city officials call "a master architect." 
</P>
<P>
The only public criticism came from Barbara Milkovich, a resident involved in 
many historic preservation efforts. She called the design "a travesty" that 
"violates the integrity of a major cultural resource." 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials and other residents lauded the architect, Neill Noble. 
"This is a masterful design," resident Claire Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Planning for the second phase of the library's expansion -- a $2-million, 
13,656-square-foot addition anchored by a 340-seat auditorium -- will continue 
while construction begins on the first project, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the second phase is built, commissioners will consider new parking. The 
expansion's third phase calls for Talbert Avenue to be realigned and widened. 
</P>
<P>
However, the land planned for the Talbert realignment was recently discovered 
to be tainted with high levels of methane, which may preclude the city's 
building a road over it. JOHN PENNER

SCAVENGING BANNED AT RECYCLING BINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved an ordinance prohibiting scavenging from 
recycling bins that will be used for the city's curbside recycling program that 
begins next month. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to take the precaution," said Mayor Christian W. Keena. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some concerns about people going through the city in trucks and 
emptying the curbside bins." 
</P>
<P>
Those violating the ordinance would be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a 
fine and jail time, said Damian Hopp, assistant city manager. Other county 
cities, including Irvine, have adopted similar municipal laws. 
</P>
<P>
Income from sale of recycled materials will help pay for the program, which is 
scheduled to begin Dec. 17, said City Manager Fred Sorsabal. 
</P>
<P>
"With the scavenging ordinance we are establishing a means of dealing with a 
potential abuse of the recycling program if action becomes necessary," he 
said.FRANK MESSINA

HELP SOUGHT TO FEED HOMELESS ON HOLIDAY

<P>
Santa Ana Unified School District employees are seeking both volunteers and 
donations for a free meal being planned for as many as 2,000 homeless people on 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner, which will include turkey and all the trimmings, will be served 
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Festival Hall, 220 E. 3rd St. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea of this event is to bring people together for a sit-down dinner 
and fill them up," said Howard Haas, principal of Willard Intermediate School 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Haas and McFadden Intermediate School Principal Al Aitcheson decided to 
organize the dinner because they felt there wasn't enough being done for the 
homeless on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time for all of us to take on responsibility for people on the 
street because there are too many people who are hungry out there," Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
Haas said "people have been coming out of the woodwork" to help with the event, 
but more volunteers are needed to help with setting up, serving food and 
cleaning up. 
</P>
<P>
Students at several schools in the district will help publicize the event by 
making signs and posting them throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get the word out to the homeless so they will know what's 
happening," Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
The use of Festival Hall in downtown Santa Ana has been donated for the event 
by owner Vincente Sarmiento, who also has enlisted the services of his staff to 
help prepare the meal. 
</P>
<P>
The meal also is being sponsored by a number of Santa Ana-based groups 
including the Pena Center and the Bright Light Center. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said at least $20,000 is needed to pay for the dinner. Any money 
collected that exceeds the amount needed for dinner will be used to buy 
blankets and toiletries for those attending the dinner, Haas said. GREG

MIKE PENNER: FOR ONCE, TEAMS WANT FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Say what you will about a bowl game hopeful of selling Oregon-Colorado State to 
Orange County -- sand to Saudi Arabia might be easier -- but say this much for 
the members of the 1990 Freedom Bowl committee: 
</P>
<P>
They've put a winning Ram team back in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like an ad campaign if Don Andersen ever heard one. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we don't even have to change the paint in one end zone," notes Andersen, 
the Freedom Bowl's rookie executive director. "Are we on a budget or what?" 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado State Rams are coming, complete with former Mission Viejo High 
fullback Todd Yert ("The Battering Ram"), former Ohio State Coach Earle Bruce 
("Head Ram I Am") and a real live ram mascot ("Cam The Ram"). 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention a real live Ram defense. 
</P>
<P>
These Rams are a perfect match for Freedom VII, the bowl that only wants to be 
loved. Picture this scene, if you can: A packed stadium in Fort Collins two 
weeks ago, with Colorado State finishing off a victory over Tulsa to the 
soundtrack chant of "FREE-DOM BOWL! FREE-DOM BOWL!" 
</P>
<P>
Andersen swears it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"They had one side of the stadium chanting 'FREEDOM' and the other side 
chanting 'BOWL,' back and forth," Andersen says. "They also tore down the goal 
posts afterward. That's a real kick." 
</P>
<P>
And a real change from last year, when the Freedom Bowl had its eyes on Indiana 
and Anthony Thompson and the University of Florida had its eyes on New Year's 
Day -- only to reluctantly wind up with each other through a mean chain of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"Florida was a last-minute choice," Andersen says. "Our people were waiting for 
Indiana, but Indiana lost on the last week to 2-8 Purdue (leaving the Hoosiers 
5-6) and we had to turn to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Now coming to Anaheim is no big deal to Florida. They have sunshine, golf 
courses, they even have Disney World. They were coming off two straight losses, 
their coach had been fired, their quarterback had been suspended for gambling 
and their athletic director, Bill Arnsbarger, didn't even come to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how excited they were about coming to the Freedom Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Florida sold all of 1,200 tickets for the game, according to Andersen. Cal 
State Fullerton would have traveled better. The school didn't send its pep 
band. "Oh, they were great," Andersen says, so touched by the outpouring of 
Gator aid. (cq) 
</P>
<P>
So the Freedom Bowl learned. 
</P>
<P>
"This year," Andersen says, "we set out to get two teams that were genuinely 
excited about the game. We didn't want teams that looked at this as a 
consolation prize. We wanted teams that considered this an advancement in their 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
That answers the Colorado State and Oregon questions. Colorado State hasn't 
been to a bowl game in 42 years, dating back to the Rams' 21-20 loss to 
Occidental in the 1948 Raisin Bowl. Oregon played in the 1989 Independence Bowl 
but before that, the Ducks hadn't made a bowl appearance in 27 years. This 
marks the first back-to-back bowl trips for Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
For Colorado State and Oregon, Freedom rings as a step up. Both schools are 
excited. Andersen reports that Oregon already has sold 7,000 tickets for the 
Dec. 29 game and is aiming for 15,000. Colorado State has guaranteed 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Washington and Florida combined to sell just 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're already well ahead of last year," Andersen says. "That was our 
philosophy going in. We needed to bring in teams that were going to bring some 
people to the game, just because of the financial state of our game." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: The Freedom Bowl will go belly-up if it keeps waiting for Orange 
County to rally around the game. 
</P>
<P>
Unimpressed by past Freedom matchups not involving UCLA, the county was asked 
to consider a new proposition this August -- the Disneyland Pigskin Classic. 
Excluding the worst name this side of the Poulan/Weed Eater Independence Bowl, 
the Pigskin game had many things going for it: the first date on the college 
schedule; potential national champion Colorado against eventually Sugar 
Bowl-bound Tennessee; scintillating action that resulted in a 31-31 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The game drew 33,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says this is a tough market to crack," says Andersen, who also 
helped promote the Disneyland game, "but here we have Colorado, which is one 
game away from the national championship, and Tennessee, which came within an 
eyelash of beating Notre Dame and is in the Top 10 -- and we sell 4,300 tickets 
over the counter. 
</P>
<P>
"I know people knew about the game. We took out $250,000 worth of ads in The 
Times. We had teams that were rated 1-2 in one poll. And we only sell 4,300 
over the counter." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen keeps looking for an answer. Maybe BYU and Ty Detmer next summer will 
be it. "They're one of the teams were considering for the Disney bowl and they 
have a built-in following here," Andersen says. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe USC in the summer of '92. "USC is likely going to play all its home 
games in Anaheim in '92," Andersen says, "so the Disney bowl would be a 
natural." 
</P>
<P>
But all that matters now is December and Freedom VII. And until the Freedom 
Bowl can complete the never-ending search for a corporate title sponsor -- 
Bigger Bucks For Bigger Names -- Andersen will have to settle for the kindness

USC'S ROSS WON'T BE HAPPY WITH CAREER UNTIL NOTRE DAME IS BEATEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has been a starter at USC since the middle of his freshman season, making 
almost 400 tackles for the Trojans. Three times, he has been named to the 
All-Pacific 10 Conference first team. 
</P>
<P>
A starter in three Rose Bowl games, he never played for a team that lost to 
UCLA. Last week, he was named to the Kodak All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've accomplished more than I expected to accomplish," linebacker Scott Ross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in his time, the Trojans are 0-3 against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for Notre Dame, but after what happened last year in the 
tunnel (a pregame melee incited by the Irish), and losing to them three years 
in a row, I don't even like talking about them," Ross said. "I don't even like 
to mention them." 
</P>
<P>
He will regard his collegiate career as incomplete, he said, if USC loses again 
to the Irish Saturday night at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
USC hasn't beaten Notre Dame since 1982, a string of seven losses, the longest 
in the history of a series that started in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Ross was on the field for three of them, and he has seen enough of the Irish to 
say: "They're all the same. They're all big and ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Ross told a group of reporters this week: "They think they have God on their 
side, and when you play them at Notre Dame, you have priests yelling at you. 
I've got news: God's on everyone's side." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, USC's campus newspaper, he said: "They 
think they are so righteous." And: "When I think of them, I get disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Ross is a great admirer of former USC linebacker Rex Moore, 
who six years ago at the Coliseum, in a game that was nationally televised, 
threw a handful of mud in the face of Notre Dame running back Allen Pinkett. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching," Ross said. "Rex is one of the major reasons I came here." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, like Moore before him, is a loose cannon who, by his own account, was 
almost drummed out of school as a freshman because of his off-the-field antics. 
</P>
<P>
He lived on the top floor of an on-campus dormitory and one of his favorite 
pranks was to put his stereo speakers up against an open window, turn up the 
volume on a heavy metal album or radio station and head off to class, locking 
the door behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to get them (ticked) off," Ross said. "I'd put on Iron Maiden full blast 
and I could hear it (across campus) as I was walking down to class. I'd come 
back an hour later and it would still be going. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't like that. They told me, 'You can't live in university housing 
anymore,' which pleased me because I didn't like living there. Rex had advised 
me, 'Just do a few things wrong and you can have your own place. They'll move 
you out.' " 
</P>
<P>
The strategy worked. But Ross, who now rents a house off campus, almost took it 
too far. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I was given an ultimatum, 'Stay out of trouble or stay out of 
college,' so I cleaned up my act," he said. "I don't get in trouble anymore." 
</P>
<P>
While he used to brag about his aggressive driving habits and a propensity for 
smashing cars, Ross has learned to limit his mayhem to the field, where two 
years ago he led the Trojans with 137 tackles and fell one vote shy of being 
chosen the Pac-10's defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the most part, he has enjoyed his time at USC, with a few notable 
exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three years ago at South Bend, Ind., with Ross only a few months removed 
from El Toro High, the Irish ran for 351 yards in a 26-15 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my gloves on and I was freezing," Ross said. "I had no thoughts of 
getting into the game because I hadn't played in the first (six) games. All I 
was trying to do was keep warm. I was over there bouncing around and Coach 
(Tom) Roggeman turned around and said, 'Can you stop them?' I said, 'Sure,' and 
ran in there. 
</P>
<P>
"(Linebacker) Marcus Cotton was yelling, 'What's this freshman doing in here?' 
I sort of couldn't believe it, either. I ran around with my head cut off and 
didn't do a thing for the whole series. 
</P>
<P>
"I weighed 215 pounds (he has since added 20 pounds to his 6-foot-2 frame) and 
I looked at those (Irish) linemen and they looked like monsters. I said, 'I 
can't believe this.' It was freezing and they were out there in, like, tank 
tops. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a taste of Notre Dame and a taste of defeat." 
</P>
<P>
Ross was taken out after only one series, but in the next week of practice, 
Coach Larry Smith opened the competition at all positions and Ross earned a 
place in the starting lineup. He has been a fixture ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, No. 2-ranked USC and No. 1-ranked Notre Dame were both 10-0 
when they met at the Coliseum. USC enjoyed a statistical edge, but Notre Dame 
took advantage of several Trojan miscues to win, 27-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I had my best game against them, but the big hand in the sky came 
down and drew some plays for them and they pulled it off," Ross said. "I 
thought we had them beat. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really disappointing. If it wasn't for one or two plays, we would have 
won. That's how it is with them. Those things happen to all the other teams 
(they play)." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last season, Notre Dame beat USC at South Bend, 28-24. 
</P>
<P>
Against a USC defense that ended the season ranked first in the nation against 
the run, giving up only 66.3 yards a game on the ground and only six touchdowns 
by rushing, Notre Dame ran for 266 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ross blamed the Trojans' problems on overaggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all sort of maniacs (in practice) that week," he said. "We were all 
out for blood, and I think it hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
The last two losses have been especially difficult for Ross. 
</P>
<P>
"It's twisted my mind," he said. "You try so hard, and it's like they're just 
unbeatable and they have this force that can't be broken. It has really been 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I hate gold helmets." 
</P>
<P>
Ross doesn't hate everything about Notre Dame. He is an admirer of linebacker 
Michael Stonebreaker, who joined him on the Kodak All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
"I like watching him play," Ross said of the Irish senior. "He's supposed to be 
the big (cheese), so I like to see what I have to do to be like him. It's fun 
to watch a good linebacker because it gives you the incentive to be better. 
</P>
<P>
"I get frustrated when I look at other linebackers who don't attack and don't 
tackle. I don't even want to watch them. It makes me depressed. Watching him 
makes me feel good. I like how he plays." 
</P>
<P>
Ross has a similar style -- aggressive, intense, all-out. 
</P>
<P>
He has rarely missed a game, despite several injuries. Even sitting out of 
practice, he said, leaves him wracked with guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Only last month, Ross suffered a broken right hand in the second quarter of a 
game against Arizona. He stayed on the field for two more plays, had a cast put 
on his hand at halftime and played the entire second half. 
</P>
<P>
The next week, however, he had to sit out against Arizona State after a metal 
plate was inserted into his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, when he clenches his fist, he can feel tissue rip. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like a knife in there," Ross said of the metal plate. 
</P>
<P>
But he has continued to play. Notre Dame has provided motivation. This week's 
game has been on his mind for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Like at Oregon State (two weeks ago), I was pretty bored," Ross said. "I was 
thinking more about what a pain it was going to be to ride home on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"These (Notre Dame) guys are the ones I want." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, he's got them. One more time. 
</P>

MORNING BRIEFING: AFTER THIS, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE NERF JOUSTING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout America and in parts of Beverly Hills, Christmas shopping season 
traditionally begins the day after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Toys R Us got a jump on the kid-sports retailing field Wednesday, laying down 
the ceremonial first gauntlet. 
</P>
<P>
The company's full-page color advertisement in Wednesday's USA Today sports 
section read: 
</P>
<P>
"What do you get for feuding fourth graders? 
</P>
<P>
"Nerf fencing, en garde! 
</P>
<P>
"Modern day swordsmen can settle their differences the safe Nerf way. The foam 
blades allow kids to 'parry-parry-thrust' and safely jab back the 
specially-marked targets on their opponents' sword hilts. 
</P>
<P>
"This action-packed contest of skill and speed is for two players ages 8 and 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the former Minnesota Viking kicker who originally patented 
the Nerf ball. 
</P>
<P>
Chapter 11 1/2: At the news conference to announce next April's George 
Foreman-Evander Holyfield heavyweight championship bout at the Trump Plaza 
Hotel in Atlantic City, co-promoter Dan Duva said: 
</P>
<P>
"There is one major problem with the fight. (Donald) Trump had to go to his 
bankers and get permission for one more major expenditure -- George Foreman's 
meal allowance." 
</P>
<P>
Face off: Do you believe in documentary evidence? 
</P>
<P>
If so, a passage in Lawrence Martin's new book, "The Red Machine," might lead 
you away from a notion that has been frozen in the minds of most North 
Americans for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
Martin contends that ice hockey was played in Russia "before the first recorded 
Canadian exhibition." He is bucking conventional wisdom, which says hockey 
originated from a game played by Englishmen on the ice-covered harbor at 
Kingston, Ontario, in 1860. 
</P>
<P>
According to Martin, there is "documentary evidence that Russians were playing 
the game in the middle of the 19th century" in Leningrad, then known as St. 
Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We live under this myth that it is a Canadian game." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie of the century: From Alan Robinson of the Associated Press: "Mickey 
Mantle's 1952 salary was $5,000. His baseball card from that season is now 
selling for $8,000." 
</P>
<P>
Shotgun start, or what?: Persian Gulf crisis or no Persian Gulf crisis, the 
Desert Golf Classic in Dubai, scheduled for February 7-10, is a go. 
</P>
<P>
The Dubai Aluminum Company had something to do with that, coming forward with 
$700,000 in prize money for the opening event on next year's European tour. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing obvious concerns, Ian Livingstone, the company's chief executive, 
said Wednesday: "Dubai is geographically remote from the crisis in the Northern 
Gulf. Business is continuing normally here and the Dubai Desert Classic will 
help to emphasize this point by attracting top players from Europe and other 
parts of the world." 
</P>
<P>
A Dawg's life: From Steve Hubbard of the Pittsburgh Press: "In his passion to 
put the Browns in the Super Bowl before he dies, (Cleveland owner) Art Modell 
ought to remember this: They appeared in 11 NFL or All-America Conference 
championship games in the 15 years before he bought them -- and none in the 30 
years since." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Fred Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Washington State football Coach Mike Price, discussing the effects 
of a 3-8 record, a 55-10 loss to Washington in the Apple Cup game and his being 
criticized publicly by Cougar players: "Hopefully, the guys I recruit in the 
state can read, so I don't think that helps our image very much." TED BROCK

Five films later, I have now seen every single minute of every single "Rocky" 
movie, and I still think the guy he ought to be beating up is his 
brother-in-law. 
</P>

Alydar. Northern Dancer. Go For Wand. I don't know if God rides, but he has a 
heck of a stable. 
</P>
<P>
A halftime tribute to civil rights? Uh, golly, thanks, Fiesta Bowlers, but I 
don't think a marching band playing "We Shall Overcome" was exactly what Martin 
Luther King's followers had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
If Dave Righetti pitches for Tom Lasorda next season, we'll have Righetti and 
meatballs.

OK, I've seen enough. First team that wins a bowl game gets to be the No. 1 
college team in the nation.

Cal State Fullerton's football players held an intra-squad scrimmage last week. 
They lost. 
</P>

Fullerton vs. George Foreman. Let's talk about it.

I have seen the Rams' so-called defense, and it could use Dexter Manley. But 
isn't this the same team with all those drug-abuse warnings plastered all over 
the place?

"Rocky VI" Still suffering from brain damage, Rocky Balboa pays $500 for a 
ringside seat to a fight.

When Miami starts playing Notre Dame's schedule, that's when you can vote Miami 
No. 1 with two defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who votes the Heisman Trophy to that University of Houston quarterback 
-- as they did to that last University of Houston quarterback -- should be 
ashamed. Let's stop rewarding people from a football program famous for two 
things: Being on probation and running up the score on opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky VII" Still getting into street brawls, even though he has brain damage, 
Rocky Balboa takes a job in wife Adrian's pet store -- as a pet. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana. Flesh and blood or incredible, invincible robot creature from 
Mars? You make the call. 
</P>
<P>
I hear Tom Browning's new contract with the Cincinnati Reds includes an 
incentive clause paying his wife big money not to have babies during World

Went to Sea World last week to see that whale. For a minute there, it was the 
Buster Douglas thing all over again. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky VIII" Inspired by the real-life Ken Griffey Sr.-Jr. story, Rocky Balboa 
comes out of retirement for a title fight against his boy. Still suffering from 
brain damage, Pop Balboa loses when Junior pulls old "Yo, your shoelace is 
untied" trick. Junior shaves head into Mohawk and defects to Soviet Union. 
Brain damage worse than ever, Rocky Sr. takes job as sportswriter.

Giants-49ers a tossup? Ha! Easiest prediction of season. Giants win next week. 
The 49ers win rematch in playoffs.

Well, 1990 is almost up. Sam Wyche said anything intelligent yet? 
</P>
<P>
Come on. John Robinson is not what's wrong with the Rams, and you know it.

<P>
So, Monica Seles and Gaby Sabatini played five sets, did they? Maybe now we can 
finally discuss this equal-pay-for-women thing.

<P>
Give that NFL investigator two more weeks and he will probably fine Lisa Olson 
a couple of thousand dollars.

Give the Mets two more weeks and they'll probably tell you Darryl Strawberry 
isn't even left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Shalit from NBC sent me a note saying he's so embarrassed by the Mets' 
statements on Strawberry, he thinks "New York should change its nickname from

Mark Davis last year, Mike Boddicker this year . . . are the Kansas City Royals

"Rocky IX" Wife leaves 300-pound Rocky for muscular Mexican flyweight. Son much 
smarter than Rocky, runs down art-museum steps because it's easier. 
Brother-in-law makes fortune promoting senior boxing tour. Rocky wins first 
fight, but is disqualified for using Uzi automatic weapon and long knife with 
razor-sharp teeth. Stallone apologizes for momentarily slipping into wrong 
character. 
</P>
<P>
I have seen the football bowl lineup, and my New Year's resolution is to watch 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds MVP? Rickey Henderson MVP? You can't kid me. They're exactly the

</P>
<P>
I see golf's "Skins Game" is coming up. Oh, good. I sure hope one of those 
millionaires wins another million. 
</P>
<P>
With this Milli Vanilli situation, now they'll have to strip Ram kicker Mike 
Lansford of any award he wins for that TV commercial of his. 
</P>
<P>
OK, here's Jerry Tarkanian's final offer to the NCAA, take it or leave it. He 
doesn't come within 500 miles of the Final Four. He donates 50% of all money 
forfeited by Runnin' Rebel bail bondsmen. He refuses to recruit in Idaho for 
two seasons. He guarantees NCAA big-shots best table for Wayne Newton midnight 
show. He gives back all Long Beach victories for years coached there. He 
rescinds offer to have UNLV play in tournament four-against-five. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky X" New wife puts red, white and blue trunks in laundry with regular 
whites, really ticks Rocky off. Returns to gym for workout, beats up Stu Nahan. 
Runs down street, hears "Gonna Fly Now" music, finds composer and beats him up. 
"Enough!" he says.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: WEEKEND IS STUFFED WITH ENOUGH SPORTS TO SATISFY 
APPETITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The holiday sports feast continues through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of side dishes, including college and pro basketball, Skins 
Game golf and even, combined in one show, gymnastics and figure skating. But 
football is the main course. 
</P>
<P>
CBS serves up Nebraska-Oklahoma today at 11:30 a.m., and there will be nine 
college games on television Saturday, highlighted by Notre Dame-USC at 5 p.m. 
on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans might have to do what they did in 1974 -- when they rallied from a 
24-6 deficit to beat the Irish, 55-24 -- to top last weekend's 45-42 victory 
over UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
ABC announcer Keith Jackson, who has been around almost forever, worked both 
games, and both are in his top 10 for all-time best. 
</P>
<P>
"The '74 game was lopsided," Jackson said. "But sure, it's in my top 10." 
</P>
<P>
"(Last week's USC-UCLA game is) one of two games I've worked this season to 
make my top 10," Jackson said from his home in Sherman Oaks. "The other one is 
Michigan-Michigan State." 
</P>
<P>
That was the game in which Michigan State won, 28-27, when officials failed to 
call an obvious pass-interference penalty against the Spartans on Michigan's 
two-point conversion try. 
</P>
<P>
"You had a little bit of everything in that game," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
On the air, Jackson called last Saturday's game one of the best of the USC-UCLA 
series. 
</P>
<P>
"Still the best USC-UCLA game I've ever seen is 1967," Jackson said, referring 
to the Trojans' 21-20 victory over the Bruins in which O.J. Simpson scored on a 
64-yard run in the fourth quarter. "You had the Rose Bowl and a national 
championship at stake in that game." 
</P>
<P>
But for sheer excitement from start to finish, last Saturday's game wasn't too 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a break," Jackson said. "We haven't been getting too many lately. 
Notre Dame losing to Penn State didn't help matters. We thought we'd have the 
No. 1 team going Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
Still, USC-Notre Dame is almost always worth watching. So save some room. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on your perspective, the highlight of Sunday's pro football menu is 
the Rams at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will have the team of Pat Summerall and John Madden, which did Thursday's 
Washington-Dallas game, work this game as well. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC game at 10 a.m. Sunday will be Miami at Cleveland, with Don Criqui and 
Todd Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
The ESPN game at 5 p.m. Sunday is Seattle at San Diego, and the Monday night 
game on ABC should be a good one, Buffalo at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Over-stuffed on football? One alternative is the Skins Game on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its eighth year, it is always one of the highest-rated golf events on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped it would be successful, but I never thought it would grow into what it 
has become," said Don Ohlmeyer, the creator of the event whose company produces 
the telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"And this year, we've got an unbelievable lineup -- the player of the century 
(Jack Nicklaus), the PGA player of the year (Nick Faldo), the leading money 
winner (Greg Norman) and (defending champion) Curtis Strange." 
</P>
<P>
Each hole of the $450,000 event has its own prize money. The prize money 
carries over when there are ties. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's competition will be on Channel 7 live at 12:30 p.m., with Sunday's 
round delayed three hours (after pro football) and shown at 3:30 p.m. The 
announcing team includes Roger Twibell, Jerry Pate and Peter Jacobsen. 
</P>
<P>
For those who enjoy figure skating and gymnastics, there's a two-hour program 
called the "Sudafed Symphony of Sports" on NBC's "SportsWorld" Saturday at 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The show, taped at Vail, Colo., in September, brings together some of the 
biggest names in the two sports, including skaters Brian Boitano, Robin Cousins 
and Rosalyn Sumners and gymnasts Bart Conner, Nadia Comaneci, Kristie Phillips 
and Wendy Hilliard. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one athletes took part in choreographed, artist performances, some of 
which put skaters and gymnasts side by side. The show also includes some 
interesting taped interviews.

TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
If you missed out on taping the USC-UCLA replay on Prime Ticket last Sunday 
night, or your cable system malfunctioned, as some did, Prime Ticket will show 
the game again in its entirety on Christmas. It will kick off a retrospective 
of the USC-UCLA series over the past decade. . . . Prime Ticket has hired Bill 
Walton as its UCLA basketball commentator. He will be paired with Mike Walden, 
meaning it will be the team of Walden and Walton.

The Raiders, by beating Miami last Monday, improved to 28-6-1 on "Monday Night 
Football." . . . Oops Dept.: In the category of misplaced graphic, ABC put this 
one over Raider Coach Art Shell at the end of Monday night's game: "Blimp 
provided by Goodyear Tire and Rubber." . . . Just wondering: Does Channel 7 
gets its audiences for its "Monday Night Football" post-game shows from the 
Wally George Show? . . . As if there wasn't enough football on television this 
weekend, SportsChannel offers the Grey Cup Championship, pitting Edmonton 
against Winnipeg, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry will be a guest on "Late Night With David Letterman" tonight. 
. . . Pete Arbogast will be doing double duty for KNX Saturday. First, there's 
the USC-Chicago State basketball game at the Sports Arena at 1:30, then the 
USC-Notre Dame football game at the Coliseum. . . . Joe Buttitta, former 
Channel 5 and Channel 11 sportscaster who is now the voice of Cal State 
Northridge, has made a pilot for a weekly show, "Eye on Golf," scheduled for 
airing in the spring of next year. Former pro golfer Debbie Steinbach of Long 
Beach is the co-host. Buttitta, who also writes for a golf magazine, is an avid 
golfer who carries a single-digit handicap.

Pernell Whitaker, of Norfolk, Va., retained his world lightweight title with a 
unanimous decision over Benji Marquez of Puerto Rico Thursday in a championship 
boxing doubleheader at Madrid. 
</P>

TOP-RATED CALIFORNIA SEEKS NINTH NCAA WATER POLO CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California begins its quest for an unprecedented ninth NCAA water polo title 
today at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Golden Bears (26-1) open the three-day tournament by playing No. 
13 Brown (20-9) at 3 p.m., followed by second-ranked Stanford (24-5) against 
No. 10 Air Force (19-6) at 4:30 p.m. and No. 3 UC Santa Barbara (22-7) against 
12th-ranked Navy (24-5) at 6. 
</P>
<P>
The best matchup of the first round, however, is expected to be at 7:30 p.m. 
between fourth-ranked UCLA (22-7) and No. 5 Pepperdine (21-8). The Waves, who 
have won 15 of their last 16 matches, handed Cal its only loss, 12-11, in 
Berkeley and also won one of three meetings against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Cal, Stanford, Santa Barbara and UCLA have combined to win 18 of the previous 
22 national titles. Navy, Air Force, Brown and Pepperdine have never won. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pepperdine Coach Terry Schroeder: "There are probably five teams that have 
a real legitimate chance at winning the NCAA title, but California is the 
favorite." 
</P>
<P>
Consolation and championship matches continue Saturday and Sunday, with the 
title match scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Sunday. PAUL McLEOD

SOUTHLAND RESORTS RIGHT ON SCHEDULE

<P>
Most ski resorts like to boast their season runs from Thanksgiving to Easter or 
beyond, but more often than not, they have to hedge a bit. That opening date 
frequently turns out to be a turkey. 
</P>
<P>
This year, at least, the Southland and the Rocky Mountains are right on 
schedule, but most of the Sierra will experience a balmy and dry holiday 
weekend -- without all those skiers cluttering up the highways. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Bernardino Mountains, where Snow Summit and Bear Mountain are 
already in operation, Snow Valley made about 16 inches of snow Wednesday, to go 
with four inches that fell naturally, and began its season Thursday. Chairlifts 
Nos. 6, 7 and 13 are running for beginning and intermediate skiers. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain High, near Wrightwood, has also had its snow guns firing away and said 
it hopes to be open by today. 
</P>
<P>
An early-week storm dropped up to eight inches of snow in the Sierra, but that 
was hardly enough to incite widespread jubilation. Mammoth Mountain, for 
example, said it still needs 18 to 24 inches more. 
</P>
<P>
So, the only lift-served skiing definitely available within a couple hundred 
miles of Lake Tahoe this weekend will be at Boreal, which has been open since 
Nov. 2, and Alpine Meadows, where snow-making has covered the runs under the 
Kangaroo chairlift and the Tiegel surface lift. Alpine, incidentally, stayed 
open last season until Mother's Day, May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Northstar was also making snow furiously Wednesday night and called an opening 
today "possible." 
</P>
<P>
Utah has perhaps the best skiing in the West at the moment, after receiving up 
to 30 inches of powder Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Snowbird opened Thursday, Alta today. They join Brighton, which reported a 
39-inch depth Wednesday; Solitude, which has 34 inches, and Park City, where 
the U.S. Pro Tour gets under way this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Deer Valley, completing a $6-million expansion program, is planning a Dec. 1 
lift-off. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado has also picked up some new snow, and virtually all of the state's 
major resorts began operating on at least a limited basis Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mt. Bachelor, Ore., opened Wednesday with depths ranging from six to 16 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Taos Ski Valley, N.M., began operation Thursday with about 60% of its runs 
skiable on a 24-inch base. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In British Columbia, Whistler Mountain launched its season Thursday, 
linking its lifts, as usual, with neighboring Blackcomb, which got going last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sun Valley, Ida., has announced a Dec. 7 starting date. 
</P>
<P>

NOTRE DAME HAS HAD ITS WAY IN SERIES

<P>
The USC-Notre Dame series, which resumes Saturday night at the Coliseum, has 
been dominated in recent years by Notre Dame, which hasn't lost to the Trojans 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a great seven years if you're a Notre Dame fan," Irish nose tackle 
Chris Zorich told Frank Welch of the San Gabriel Valley Tribune after last 
year's 28-24 victory at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of streak where the other team thinks it's jinxed. We've had 
some lucky breaks, but don't the great teams get most of the breaks, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun because our beating them has become an annual thing." 
</P>
<P>
All but overlooked in USC's 45-42 victory over UCLA was a third-quarter field 
goal by Quin Rodriguez, which provided the margin of victory and enabled 
Rodriguez to set a school record with the 52nd field goal of his Trojan career.

USC GETS WINNING SEASON;

<P>
Collin Mackie kicked a school-record five field goals and the South Carolina 
defense shut down West Virginia after two early scores en route to a 29-10 
victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia (4-7) scored on its first two possessions but got no more points 
against the Gamecocks (6-5). South Carolina held the Mountaineers to four first 
downs in the second half -- and two of those came after the game was decided. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina scored the first time it had the ball in the third quarter, 
taking a 20-10 lead on Rob DeBoer's two-yard run with 9:33 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brooks set up the drive with a 34-yard kickoff return to the South 
Carolina 48. 
</P>
<P>
The Gamecocks then overcame a 12-yard loss by running back Mike Dingle and the 
loss of Dingle with a dislocated shoulder. He was injured after catching a pass 
with 13:25 left, but DeBoer proved an adequate replacement. The freshman gained 
seven yards on fourth and two at the Mountaineer 33, the first of eight 
consecutive carries for DeBoer. 
</P>
<P>
DeBoer finished with 98 yards, giving him 700 this season -- the second-highest 
total by a freshman in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Mackie kicked a 36-yard field goal 11 seconds into the fourth quarter and then 
two 27-yarders, the first at 7:26 and the second at 3:40. Mackie had twice 
previously tied the school record of four set in 1977 by Britt Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
While the victory assured South Carolina of a winning season, there was little 
assurance the Gamecocks would go to a bowl. The university said Wednesday it 
wouldn't change its exam schedules to allow the team to play in the 
Independence Bowl on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina was holding out hope for a Peach Bowl bid, but the chances of 
that seem slim because no scout from the Dec. 29 bowl was at the game. 
</P>
<P>
Each team scored on its first two possessions. That left the game tied, 10-10, 
and Mackie's 24-yard field goal with 29 seconds to play in the half gave the 
Gamecocks a 13-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But for an interception by tackle Cedric Bembery, the Mountaineers might have 
been leading at halftime. With the score tied, 10-10, West Virginia drove to 
the Gamecock two. But after a five-yard penalty against West Virginia, Bembery 
intercepted Jon Jones' halfback pass at the goal line, ending the threat with 
8:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia got things going in the first quarter, driving to the Gamecock 13 
on its first series before Mark Johnson kicked a 30-yard field goal with 9:32 
left. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina countered with a 14-play, 80-yard drive capped by Dingle's 
one-yard run with 6:12 remaining. Dingle carried on all but two plays in the 
drive, gaining 54 yards.

EXTRA HELPINGS FOR TWO JOCKEYS

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux and Robbie Davis had their own kind of Thanksgiving celebration 
at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Davis won with three of his four mounts and Desormeaux did him one better, 
including a victory aboard Individualist in the $111,800 On Trust Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Beaten by a half-length by Gum in the California Cup Mile, Individualist 
returned to the scene of his biggest previous victory -- last year's Hollywood 
Prevue Stakes -- and defeated favored Sensational Star by slightly more than a 
length in 1:34 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has a second and two thirds in four turf starts, Individualist, a 
gelded 3-year-old son of Bel Bolide, is most effective on the dirt and probably 
at his best around one turn. 
</P>
<P>
Outrun early, the 6-1 third choice found room to rally on the rail at the head 
of the stretch, quickly opened a 1 1/2-lengths lead and went on to his third 
victory in 14 lifetime starts. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Cal Cup) was a heartbreaker to lose," trainer David Hofmans said. "He 
loves this race track and Kent rode him the way he wants to be ridden. He wants 
to be taken ahold of and make that one run. 
</P>
<P>
"His attitude wasn't good (earlier this year), so (owner) Mr. (John) Mabee 
decided to turn him out and freshen him up, and he seems to have come back very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, who also won with Red Light Disco, Roughvus and Fly Gaelic 
Thursday, is beginning to notice a difference in Individualist. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's coming around now," he said. "He's maturing now and I think he's 
getting race smart. But, I'll tell you, he is kind of a tough horse to deal 
with. He wants to show speed, but he doesn't really want to run that way. When 
he makes the lead, he pulls up. If he doesn't have a target, he thinks it's all 
over with. He wants to play around, but he's got a lot of talent." 
</P>
<P>
The beaten favorite for the second consecutive time, Sensational Star had no 
excuses while beating Gum by a half-length for the place. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse ran a big race," Rafael Meza said of the runner-up, who was 
carrying eight pounds more than the winner (122-114). "I think he got beat 
because of the weight he had to give, especially going a longer distance. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran a good race, but I guess that's racing. If we had equal weight, he 
would have beaten all of them." 
</P>
<P>
Hofmans and Mabee will be seeking another stakes victory today when they send 
out General Meeting in the $111,650 Hollywood Prevue Breeders' Cup Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
A son of Seattle Slew, General Meeting will be trying to emulate 
Individualist's victory of a year ago when he goes seven furlongs against a 
full field of 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive in his debut Oct. 21 at Oak Tree, General Meeting has come back with 
some good works locally -- including a 1:26 1/5 for seven furlongs Nov. 11 -- 
and Chris McCarron again has the mount. 
</P>
<P>
A son of Naskra, Olympio was also much the best against maidens at Santa Anita. 
Eddie Delahoussaye will ride for trainer Ron McAnally. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, who suffered a broken right elbow nine days ago, was named to 
ride Cien Fuegos in the Prevue, but the Seattle Slew colt probably won't run. 
Trainer Wayne Lukas will be represented by Formal Dinner, who chased Best Pal 
in both the Del Mar Futurity and Norfolk Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Others entered Wednesday morning were Mizter Interco, Skylaunch, Palmdale, 
Barrage, Intimate Kid, Dr. Adagio, Nijinsky's Trio, Jimjen, who also is entered 
in an allowance race Saturday, and Gold Crest Express. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who began working horses again Wednesday, is named on five horses 
Saturday, including Exploding Prospect in the $100,000 Vernon O. Underwood 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
The Underwood, which used to be called the National Sprint Championship, has 
attracted a quality field of sprinters. Besides Exploding Prospect, who won his 
first start for new trainer Brian Mayberry, the lineup includes Timebank, 
Thirty Slews, who is unbeaten in three sprint starts; Frost Free, Knight In 
Savannah, Sam Who, Yes I'm Blue, Astro and Answer Do. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye escaped injury when his mount, Bozo's Fantasy, broke down 
shortly after the finish of Thursday's sixth race. Bozo's Fantasy, a 2-year-old 
maiden, suffered multiple fractures of the cannon bone in his right foreleg and 
was destroyed. . . . Thanksgivened didn't reward hunch players in Thursday's 
fifth. The 3-year-old gelding finished ninth, beaten some 20 lengths, at nearly 
26-1. . . . Robbie Davis won with Silly Chatter, Maxibob and Diable Rouge. . . 
. Desormeaux is third in the Hollywood Park standings with 16 winners, two 
fewer than Chris McCarron and four back of Alex Solis. . . . Hofmans and 
Richard Mandella each had two winners Thursday. Hofmans saddled Fly Gaelic in 
addition to Individualist, and Mandella won with Silly Chatter and Diable 
Rouge.

Jockey Pat Day rode his 5,000th winner in a feature race at Churchill Downs 
Thursday, becoming the 12th jockey to reach the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
The victory came in the $100,000 Falls City Handicap, a 1 1/8-mile race for 
fillies and mares 3 years old and older. 
</P>
<P>
Day was aboard Screen Prospect, which paid $5.80, $3.80 and $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really special to win here. It would have been special anywhere, but to 
win it here at Churchill Downs -- we've had such a tremendous amount of success 
here and we've got such a large following as regards the fans," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing, I guess, we haven't done here is win the Derby and we're 
looking forward to doing that in '91." 
</P>
<P>
Day is Churchill Downs' all-time leading rider. The track will donate a total 
of $5,000 to Sts. Mary and Elizabeth Hospital and to Kosair Children's 
Hospital, both in Louisville, in Day's name, according to a statement issued by 
the track.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: LOS ALAMITOS AFRC AND ENVIRONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By APRIL JACKSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some towns have histories that reach back five generations, others seem to have 
sprung up in the past 30 years. The area around the Armed Forces Reserve Center 
in Los Alamitos is grounded in history yet relatively young. 
</P>
<P>
The area took on its current attributes just 50 years ago, when the Naval Air 
Station moved from Terminal Island near Long Beach Harbor to Los Alamitos. The 
1,300-acre tract was home to Navy and Marine fliers; Australian fliers trained 
in naval air tactics there as well. The first mission of the air station was to 
be an air group staging center during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Known as a training center for the "ready reserves," the base squadrons and 
battalions were called to active duty during the Korean War, the Berlin 
blockade and the Cuban missile crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson again activated the naval reservists at 
the center. Twenty-five officers and 156 enlisted men headed out to Lemoore 
Naval Air Station in the San Joaquin Valley to train for duty in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the center's reservists are now readying for the potential of war, 
this time in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The base, renamed the Armed Forces Reserve Center in 1973, is also a state 
coordination center in the event of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But for neighbors of the reserve station, the only shots heard cracking on base 
ricochet from the driving range at the Navy Golf Course. Helicopters account 
for nearly 97% of the base's air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The housing tract just north of the reserve center is a relatively quiet, 
desirable address. "This is the nicest tract in the city of Los Alamitos," said 
Jerri West of Coldwell Banker Realtors. "There's no noise pollution, the planes 
land in Seal Beach at the weapons station, not at the reserve center." 
</P>
<P>
But the proximity of the reserve base has kept local real estate prices low. 
"The most distinguishing feature of this tract is the difference in property 
values," West said. "These homes are about $100,000 less than many comparable 
houses on the Orange County market." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many homeowners in the area are choosing to keep their homes 
instead of moving up in the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Owners go out into the county and look around," West said. "After seeing what 
a prime piece of property they have for the price, rather than trading up, they 
upgrade." 
</P>
<P>
Longevity appears to be the mainstay for Los Alamitos. In the late 1800s, the 
city took root as a company town for the Los Alamitos Sugar Co. But in 1921, a 
worm infestation devastated the sugar beet industry and eventually put the 
company out of business. As the industry fell off, this company town was 
expected to decline as well. However, the townspeople stayed and, over time, 
built a city that the Los Alamitos Chamber of Commerce now calls "Just a Real 
Nice Place to Live." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Friedrichs, a docent at the Los Alamitos Museum, shares the chamber's 
motto. "This is a wonderful place to live," the five-year resident said. 
"Everything is close at hand -- shopping, good restaurants, businesses, the 
beach, even Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Along Katella Avenue, new strip malls are filled with a varied businesses, 
including a health food restaurant, a deli and dozens of specialty shops. Among 
the shops and offices is the caretaker of Los Alamitos' history, the Los 
Alamitos Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Built in the 1940s, the adobe building for 30 years housed the volunteer Fire 
Department. Today, the museum is filled with a hodgepodge of 19th-Century 
curios, but its most significant collection is a photographic display of the 
Los Alamitos Sugar Co. and the city's growth over the decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the original fire hose from the firehouse and old newspaper articles," 
Friedrichs said. "I was just reading an ad from a 1918 paper. They made sugar 
beet farming sound like a sure-fire deal. And, up until 1921, sugar beet 
farming was good." 
</P>
<P>
The sugar beet industry held on through the early 1940s, then folded. 
Fortunately, the creation of the air base brought more income into the small 
city. By 1960, houses began to spring up alongside the base. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the reserve center has always been a good neighbor, sponsoring 
little leagues, Pop Warner football teams and providing a tennis facility. 
</P>
<P>
Residents pay homage to the accomplishments of their hometown heroes through 
the Los Alamitos Hall of Fame, housed in the museum. It honors the achievements 
of local athletes, including such notables as gymnast Cathy Rigby and distance 
swimmer Lynne Cox. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of this area is set best at the little adobe museum, where the future 
is represented by a recent high school track trophy and the past regained in 
photographs.

STYLE: FILLING THE 'MAKEUP GURU' VOID;

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Stevens wants to be to makeup what Jose Eber is to hair and Richard 
Simmons is to the body. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no makeup guru," says Stevens, making it clear that he would like to 
fill that void. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, he's already making a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a number of clients who are walking advertisements," says Candice 
Schnapp, a Newport Beach resident and a regular customer of Stevens. She often 
has Stevens do her makeup before a formal event, such as the recent Opera 
Pacific ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes the worry out," Schnapp says. "If I'm under the gun, I'll put on my 
lipstick liner and end up with lopsided lips. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard's good at making me have more lip than I have, and he's the only one 
who can make my brows look nice." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' aim is to teach clients how to master their makeup so they can create 
their own full lips and perfect brows. 
</P>
<P>
"He insists you watch what he's doing. He wants to make sure you learn his 
technique," Schnapp says. 
</P>
<P>
At his group seminars and one-on-one consultations, Stevens' message is always 
the same: "If I can do it, anybody can." 
</P>
<P>
To spread the word, Stevens joined forces with fellow makeup artist Julia Cross 
and opened the Stevens &amp; Cross Cosmetic Studio in Newport Beach in 
November, 1989. Here, in these contemporary black-and-white quarters adorned 
with colorful murals, there are no secrets. Stevens and Cross believe in 
sharing information, both with each other and with their clients. 
</P>
<P>
"It's information they can't get in department stores," Stevens says. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens came by his knowledge of cosmetics by accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to open up a clothing store for ladies that would carry makeup on 
the side," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
He purchased the cosmetics but then found he couldn't come up with the capital 
for the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get my money back from the (cosmetics) company but they said, 'No. 
Why don't you become a makeup artist?' I couldn't even draw a straight line. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, I was selling $2,000 worth of stuff I'd never heard of," he says. 
The Vietnam veteran and former assembly-line worker at Ford Motor Co. taught 
himself to wield a mascara wand. Seventeen years and thousands of faces later, 
he is sharing what he has learned. 
</P>
<P>
"No one leaves here without learning something," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He does not like to call these makeovers -- to him they're more like cosmetic 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
He asks his clients to show up for appointments wearing makeup to see what kind 
of look they're striving for and where they might be making mistakes. They sit 
facing a mirror under bright studio lights while Stevens paints their faces 
with his palette of powders. Often, he'll push a pencil or brush into his 
subject's hand and have her practice the strokes. 
</P>
<P>
He recently demonstrated his makeup techniques on the studio's model, Tani 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing women want to know is how to do brows," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Cross, watching him work, calls eyebrows the "frame for the picture." Stevens 
uses a brow shadow applied with a brush to fill in sparse areas and extend the 
brow if it's too short. 
</P>
<P>
"Brow pencils will always look drawn on," he says. "We don't change it, we just 
accentuate it." On Wright, the added powder adds definition to the brows but 
doesn't change their naturally smooth arch. 
</P>
<P>
To erase circles under Wright's eyes, he places highlighter on the deepest 
depression. Many women end up accentuating the dark circles they're trying to 
conceal by incorrectly applying the wrong color concealer to the puffy area. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine times out of 10, women wear concealers that are entirely too light, and 
they end up with a raccoon effect," Cross says. 
</P>
<P>
Blush poses the biggest beauty hazard. Women typically apply it too low on the 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always above the hollow," Stevens says. "It's not across the chin, under 
the eye, or all of those crazy places." 
</P>
<P>
Some also choose blush colors that are too bright and end up with an artificial 
look, Cross says. 
</P>
<P>
"You should add just a little blush -- it shouldn't be these strong circles of 
color," she says. "Blush is one product that if women are feeling pale or down, 
they'll reach for it. They get that brush going all over the forehead, nose and 
cheeks." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens prefers to emphasize the mouth and the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I always do a stronger mouth. The mouth will always lead the way," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Without benefit of collagen injections, he can achieve the fuller, pouty mouth 
now in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Most women underplay their lips. Lip liner is the key to bringing them into 
focus. It's not just a crumby line that goes around the mouth." 
</P>
<P>
He uses a mauve-colored lip pencil to outline Wright's already generous lips, 
staying within the natural lines and then using the pencil to shade in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the coloring book method -- you never go over the lines," Stevens says. 
Liner gives the lips shape and prevents lipstick from bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
For the eyes, he uses a nude powder on the lid to even the skin tone, saving 
the colored shadow for the deep recession just under the brow bone. Stevens 
prefers neutral shades with a matte finish, choosing a smoky plum to accent 
Wright's clear blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get into the blues, turquoise or greens on the eyelids, you're in 
trouble," he says. Colors should enhance the eyes, not compete with them. 
</P>
<P>
Before applying mascara, he uses a lash curler, a medieval-looking contraption 
many women abandon because they don't know how to use it properly. Stevens 
positions it on the lashes as close to the lid as possible and squeezes for 
several seconds. The resulting curl can make lashes look twice as long and 
lasts the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
When working with a mascara wand, he first wipes the excess off the tip, then 
uses only the first couple rows of the brush. 
</P>
<P>
"That way you're not sticking the lashes together," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He also has practical suggestions for skin care. To prevent eye makeup and 
mascara from smudging, wash off the oily eye makeup remover with soap and 
water. To keep lips from looking flaky, use a Vitamin E-enriched conditioner, 
then blot off the excess before applying lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman doesn't have to do every one of these things," Stevens says. Just 
eliminating six mistakes and adding two or three positive steps can make a big 
difference in her appearance. 
</P>
<P>
A personal consultation costs $75 and lasts 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the initial 
session, with free follow-ups. For an additional $25, customers can have the 
session videotaped.

James Balagot, 13, of Irvine and Mitch Fenton, 33, of Rancho Santa Margarita 
both learned how to play lacrosse from their older brothers in Long Island, 
N.Y. And both say that once the ancient Indian field sport gets into your 
blood, it's there forever. 
</P>
<P>
Balagot is the Magic Johnson of the four-team Junior High division of the 
Orange County Youth Lacrosse League -- a league that didn't even exist until 
1988. Although he has been in Orange County less than three months, Balagot has 
already established himself as the kind of player who attracts other kids to 
the sport and inspires them to play beyond their previous levels. In a recent 
losing cause, Balagot scored eight of his team's nine goals and was credited 
with an assist on the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Fenton, whom many call the pied piper of Orange County lacrosse, co-founded the 
youth league in the spring of 1988. He coaches lacrosse at Trabuco High -- one 
of four high schools that make up the youth league's other division -- and he 
is the coach/manager of the newest of the two adult lacrosse clubs in the area. 
Ten years ago, when he was in law school, Fenton was instrumental in getting 
San Diego's now-thriving youth league off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Balagot and Fenton both describe lacrosse as a fast-moving, hard-hitting skill 
sport that combines the best parts of basketball, hockey, soccer and football. 
Balagot, who plays soccer and basketball too, says lacrosse is his favorite. 
"My brothers got me hooked on the sport when I was 6 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Fenton says the sport is easy to get hooked on because it offers maximum action 
to anyone who wants to participate. "Everyone gets to be 'quarterback' and 
'wide receiver' at some point in a lacrosse game," Fenton says. "And, because 
lacrosse places more emphasis on quickness, skill and guile than it does on 
speed, strength and size, you don't have to be physically imposing to play 
successfully." 
</P>
<P>
A lacrosse game goes like this: Ten players on each side advance a hard rubber 
ball by running with it or catching it and throwing it with netted plastic 
sticks. The object of the game is to maneuver into a position where the ball 
can be thrown into the other team's goal. 
</P>
<P>
Although "hitting" or "checking" is a key part of the game, its impact is 
controlled by protective equipment and strict rules that prevent the kinds of 
serious leg injuries that are common to football. 
</P>
<P>
"You definitely get bumps and bruises playing lacrosse," Fenton says. "But 
there are very few major injuries like broken bones and damaged knees." 
</P>
<P>
Lacrosse is the oldest sport in North America and perhaps the only sport that 
is native to the continent. As long ago as the 1400s Iroquois and Huron Indians 
in the Northeast called the game baggataway ("little brother of war") and used 
it to settle inter-tribal differences or -- failing that -- to toughen braves 
for actual combat. French settlers thought the netted sticks looked like 
Bishops' crosses and started calling the game lacrosse. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sport's rich history and its popularity in Maryland and New York, 
lacrosse is virtually unheard of in most of the country. And it is just now 
starting to catch on in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Current Youth League president Ann Zanelli says the continued growth of the 
league is critical to the sport's future development. "Our junior high teams 
are set up to feed our high school teams," Zanelli explained. "The high school 
teams will feed local college teams, which will feed the adult clubs and make 
them better." 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Vista, Serrano, Los Alisos and Rancho are the junior high squads that 
feed the high school programs at Estancia, Irvine, University and Trabuco 
Hills, where Fenton coaches. All eight teams are funded by player dues and 
revenue from fund-raising activities conducted by the students and their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids and the parents love the sport," Fenton said. "I'm positive we could 
attract 25 enthusiastic players at any school in the county. The only thing 
holding us back is the lack of qualified coaches and volunteer referees and 
administrators." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County lacrosse is moving onto college campuses as well. Orange Coast 
College is expected to field a team for the first time this year and Chapman 
College and UC Irvine have had teams for the past five or six years. 
</P>
<P>
The two adult lacrosse clubs in Orange County are the Orange County Lacrosse 
Club and Fenton's Brine Team, which is named after its sponsor. Both are 
members of the California Lacrosse Assn., which was founded in 1959. The clubs 
merged when Brine was formed in 1989 but have since split over philosophical 
differences regarding style of play. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Ralph of Placentia and Matt DiDuro of Seal Beach have played with both 
clubs. They say that the Brine Club represents the future in Orange County -- 
possibly because of the club's greater involvement in the youth league and its 
acceptance of "role model" responsibilities for younger players. "The Orange 
County Club has older guys who like a very rough and physical style of play," 
says Ralph. DiDuro must soon decide which club he will play for in the upcoming 
season. He feels the two clubs would be better off if they re-merged. 
</P>
<P>
Fenton isn't so sure. "There's only room for two or three more players on 
Brine," he says. "Plus the schedule is already set and we're all counting on 
the Orange County Club to be ready to play when the season starts in January." 
</P>

'70S ROCK GROUP PROVES NOT READY FOR '90S COMEBACK

"Are you ready, Steve?" No, Sweet's original bassist Steve Priest wasn't there 
Wednesday at the Strand when the group played its first Southern California 
show since 1982. He and original singer Brian Connolly had the good sense to 
leave the group years ago after its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
But don't put it past the remaining original members, guitarist Andy Scott and 
drummer Mick Tucker, to have hired a keyboardist named Steve just so they could 
re-create that classic "Are you ready?" intro to Sweet's best-known song, 
1975's "Ballroom Blitz." The pair (who come to the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano on Sunday) certainly showed no other evidence of class Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and Tucker sported poofy hair and leather duds that would look silly on 
Sunset Strip kids 20 years their junior. And with singer Paul Day, bassist Mal 
McNulty and keyboardist Steve Mann on Wednesday, they played songs that sounded 
silly 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, 15 years ago, that was part of the group's charm. Looking back, 
Sweet's hard-rock-bubble-gum style (one critic termed it "Bazooka-rock") was 
the missing link between the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Twisted Sister, a 
prototype for the '80s pop-metal of Motley Crue, Quiet Riot and Poison. 
</P>
<P>
And truth be told, the group's best songs -- "Ballroom Blitz," "Action" and the 
teasingly bisexual (though sexist) "A.C.D.C." -- have weathered better than the 
band. Any one of them would make a nice hard-rock diversion on Rhino Records' 
"Have a Nice Day" '70s pop anthologies. But that's hardly enough to justify 
Wednesday's hapless display. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet plays Sunday night at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San 
Juan Capistrano. Opening act is Stikkity. Tickets are $16.50. Call (714) 
496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet also plays tonight at Spice in Hollywood, Saturday at the Bacchanal in 
San Diego and Monday at the Hop in Riverside.

THE ORANGE COUNTY CRAZIES' LATEST REVUE TAKES HILARIOUS AIM AT SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA FOIBLES.

No matter how bad things are, there's always hope if you can laugh. 
</P>
<P>
So there must be hope for Orange County, because the Orange County Crazies are 
generating a lot of laughs with their third and latest revue, "It's Not Easy 
Bein' Orange." 
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of Cherie Kerr, this intrepid troupe of 12 comics takes 
aim, in a series of 16 skits, at our Southern California foibles. Many of the 
targets are well-chosen, and even though the writing sometimes misfires, the 
audience never escapes with less than a smile. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes the jokes are killers. 
</P>
<P>
There's a skit about women addicts hooked on shoulder pads that is hugely 
funny, not only in design, but in execution by Dee Dee Hanson and Lauri 
Johnson. Hanson seems possessed -- her face is a seismograph of demonic delight 
as she stuffs some very unlikely padding into her bulging jacket. And Johnson 
has the furtive, hangdog look of one exhausted by her fashion excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Hanson have other shining moments as tacky lounge singers and heads 
of state, where they are ably abetted by Lori Sidwell, Martina Lestico, Anji 
Limon and, especially, LizAnne, who creates a deliciously sentimental Imelda 
Marcos and an unsightly but ever-hopeful dating-service candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The gentlemen aren't quite as on target as the ladies, although the Dudes skit 
excels for pure foolishness, and Bob Harker, Ron Ruhman and Michael Lipoma make 
for three very silly surfer boys. Lenny Fox, who opens the show as a wistfully 
singing orange, brings some sly fun to his impersonation of Walter Cronkite. 
Jon Cianci's plastic face and oversized amiability translate hilariously into a 
sleazy judge and a nerd on the make, while Matt Liffreing helps start the show 
with a bang as a freeway-blowout victim stymied by automated phone service. 
</P>
<P>
But the Crazies are a company first, and as a company, they are hard-working 
and likable, a various and well-matched assortment of people who want to make 
you laugh. And do. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr's contribution to their success is probably off the meter, as she produces 
and directs the show and writes much of the material. The musical interludes of 
Alan Axelrod keep it all moving to rock-'n'-roll time. 
</P>
<P>
After "It's Not Easy Bein' Orange" closes on Dec. 15, the troupe has a new 
revue coming in early '91 entitled "Orange on a Hot Tin Roof." Hmmm. Sounds 
like something that should stick around. 
</P>
<P>
'IT'S NOT EASY BEIN' ORANGE' 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Crazies production of an original satirical revue. Produced 
and directed by Cherie Kerr. With Martina Lestico, Jon Cianci, Lenny Fox, Dee 
Dee Hanson, Bob Harker, Lauri Johnson, Matt Liffreing, Anji Limon, Michael 
Lipoma, LizAnne, Ron Ruhman and Lori Sidwell. Musical director: Alan Axelrod.

15. Matinees Dec. 1 and 15 at 3:30 p.m. Tickets: $10 advance, $12 at the door.

RANDY LEWIS: BOUGHT THE RECORD? THEN STOP WHINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RANDY LEWIS

<TEXT>
<P>
Three cheers! 
</P>
<P>
For once, the system works and justice prevails! The National Academy of 
Recording Arts and Sciences moved quickly and heroically this week in stripping 
Milli Vanilli of its ill-begotten Grammy award in the wake of the outrageous 
revelation that Vanilli's two "lead singers" never sang a note on the album or 
on subsequent concert. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Oh, forget it. Who bleeding cares, huh? 
</P>
<P>
As far as I'm concerned, the only "controversy" about Milli Vanilli is that the 
"group" won a Grammy Award in the first place. But now we're hearing that 
disappointed fans are stomping into record stores -- Milli Vanilli tapes, LPs 
and/or CDs in hand -- demanding their money back. Requesting refunds for the 
very same "music" that up until a week ago they thought was just about the 
sweetest sound this side of Heaven's Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Equally incredible is a lawsuit filed in Oakland -- and you can bet this won't 
be the last one -- suing the band, the record company, concert promoters and 
presumably the parking lot attendants because group "leaders" Rob Pilatus and 
whatever-the-other-guy's-name-is were lip-syncing in "live" performances. (This 
suit also alleges that the quasi-Vanillis lip-synced -- the faint-hearted 
should skip this sentence -- in their music videos!!!! If lip-syncing in music 
videos becomes a crime, the entire music business will go to jail. That's the 
way they are made, kids.) 
</P>
<P>
Get off the bloomin' high horses, OK folks? If you bought an album because you 
like the music, why should it affect your enjoyment of that music if the hunky 
models on the album cover didn't really sing it? It's still the same music -- 
get it? 
</P>
<P>
As to the recording academy and its self-righteous breast-beating about 
maintaining the "integrity" of the award -- where were they when the bloody 
thing was nominated? This is the organization with a 30-year history of 
honoring imitation Vanilli flavorings. 
</P>
<P>
It was over this very category -- best new artist -- that I swore off paying 
any serious attention to the Grammys in 1978. That year, Grammy voters at least 
made one respectable nomination in that category by including Elvis Costello, 
who has since proven himself the most prolific, most consistently challenging 
and rewarding singer-songwriter in rock possibly since Bob Dylan. (Come to 
think of it, Bobby didn't win a Best New Artist Grammy either, nor did the 
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Prince, Bruce Springsteen or . . . ). 
Instead, that year the recording industry gave its highest honor for a freshman 
performer to . . . A Taste of Honey. If A Taste of Honey ever winds up in the 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it will only be in the display for Fastest 
Disappearance Without a Trace. 
</P>
<P>
And ripped-off Milli Vanilli concert-goers? Aren't these the same people who 
snapped up tickets to the group's "concert" last May at Irvine Meadows, 
screaming their heads off and then writing whiny letters castigating rock 
critics who had the audacity to suggest that any applause should be reserved 
for the fine folks at TDK? 
</P>
<P>
The bitter pill that must be swallowed by any of the 7 million or so folks who 
bought Vanilli's "Girl You Know It's True" album and now feel betrayed is that 
it's your own damned fault. Fact is, you went to a concert hoping to hear 
exactly what was on the album (these folks are the first to gripe if a 
dance-pop performer's concerts don't sound just like the record) and that's 
exactly what you got. So can it already. 
</P>
<P>
Those who liked the music will still like the music. Those who were responding 
instead to the image of two gorgeous guys singing pulsating dance-pop tunes -- 
ah, there's the rub. 
</P>
<P>
Pop audiences, encouraged by the music industry itself, demand their singers 
conform to a standard of physical perfection that's every bit as hollow as most 
of the music associated with it. No matter how gorgeous your voice may be, if 
you don't look like you belong on the cover of GQ or Playboy, forget it. 
Conversely, if you look great, who cares what you sound like? We can always fix 
it in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
That's why videos of new pop phenom Wilson Phillips show two of the three women 
singers frolicking in scenic locations, outfitted in revealing, body-hugging 
fashions; the third, who doesn't possess a Cosmopolitan cover-girl's looks or 
body, is dispatched in fleeting cutaway shots, draped in yards of black to hide 
her imperfect body. 
</P>
<P>
I'd rather listen to three minutes of a wrinkled, overweight, 
50-something-year-old black singer named Katie Webster, pounding out old blues 
tunes on her very own piano than to sit through two hours of throbbing, vacant 
Milli Vanilli music -- live or digitally reduced to perfect 4 3/4-inch shiny 
aluminum discs. 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli epitomizes the youth-pop world's credo of surface beauty over 
substance. The fact that the band's two ersatz lead singers were faking is 
all-too fitting, since most of this genre's music only imitates the human 
emotions it pretends to address. 
</P>
<P>
Were audiences genuinely yearning for truth and honesty in the records they 
buy, Milli Vanilli's album wouldn't have sold three copies to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
You want the real thing? Try Bob Dylan's latest album. Go see a Neil Young 
concert or Bonnie Raitt if you want to be assured that the singers on stage 
aren't just moving their lips. Girl, you know that's true. 
</P>
<P>
But Milli Vanilli complaints? Don't make me laugh.

SHINING EXAMPLES OF HAND-ENGRAVED CRAFTMANSHIP COMING TO SAN JUAN IN TRAVELING 
TIFFANY EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In 1889, Charles Tiffany and other New York merchants presented a signed scroll 
to President Benjamin Harrison marking the 100th anniversary of the 
inauguration of George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A century later, the scroll isn't nearly as significant as the vessel it came 
in: an intricately decorated silver cylinder. Tiffany silversmiths were 
obviously proud of the piece they had created, for on the bottom of the 
cylinder they added the words: 
</P>
<P>
"This cylinder was made and inscribed in less than a week's time!" 
</P>
<P>
The silversmiths can be forgiven for tooting their own horn. Today, the highly 
detailed floral pattern sculpted or "chased" on the cylinder is a premiere 
example of a virtually lost art. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany &amp; Co. has included the cylinder in "A Celebrated Tradition: The 
Silver of Tiffany," a traveling exhibit that will stop at the Decorative Arts 
Study Center in San Juan Capistrano from Dec. 1 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
The show spans 150 years of silversmithing and features 30 pieces organized 
around five major themes -- birth, marriage, sport, achievement and state. 
</P>
<P>
"The exhibit talks about the celebratory nature of silver," says Edward 
Wawrynek, vice president of product development for Tiffany &amp; Co. in New 
York City and an authority on American decorative silver. 
</P>
<P>
Proof that fine silversmithing still exists is Tiffany's recently completed 
Tattersalls Tiffany Highflyer Stakes Cup, to be presented at horse races this 
summer in England. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unique in modern times, in that it's so massive and required virtuoso 
silversmithing and chasing," Wawrynek says. 
</P>
<P>
The massive 40-pound bowl has two horses protruding from either side. From hoof 
to hoof, it measures three feet wide and stands two feet tall. The trophy took 
10 men 2,000 hours to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Another racing trophy, this one made in 1873, is equally impressive. The trophy 
features a sculpture of a running horse and a Comanche Indian, who has scarcely 
a toehold on the animal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more sculpture than trophy," Wawrynek says. "It has so much kinetic 
energy." 
</P>
<P>
Many pieces in the exhibit have some small historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
One of the children's table sets was given as a gift in 1881 to Ulysses S. 
Grant III from his "Grandpapa," Ulysses S. Grant, then 18th President of the 
United States. Each piece in the set has a die-rolled scene of marching 
children playing musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
An 1878 Japanese-style tray might not be the grandest piece in the exhibit, but 
for Tiffany &amp; Co. it is the most significant, Wawrynek says. The tray's 
design, which forms a spider's web using copper, gold and platinum, helped earn 
Tiffany the Grand Prix at the 1878 Paris Exposition Universelle. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time it was revolutionary to leave hammer marks in the piece and to mix 
some less noble metals," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Chasing is the art of sculpting the silver by pounding it out with hammers. 
Inside the Benjamin Harrison cylinder can be seen the impressions left where 
the silversmiths' small punching tools pushed out the metal. 
</P>
<P>
Chasers can achieve greater depth and detail than engravers, because they are 
not limited by the thickness of the metal. Where engravers cut away the metal, 
chasers displace and shape it to achieve more of a three-dimensional design. 
</P>
<P>
"When you can count the petals on a flower, that's pretty remarkable," Wawrynek 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Because it demands both skill and time, chasing has become an endangered art. 
</P>
<P>
The public didn't appreciate the extra work. 
</P>
<P>
"People weren't willing to pay higher prices for the additional hand labor," he 
says. "Lack of demand determined scarcity of supply." 
</P>
<P>
Between 1870 and 1930 there were dozens of chasers in the United States. Today 
Wawrynek counts only four who have truly mastered the craft. One of them, Alan 
Jones, works as head chaser at the Tiffany Silver Workshop, creating a number 
of Tiffany's presentation pieces including the Tattersalls trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Silver engravers are another endangered group of artisans. Tiffany employs 12 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
Norman DiSalvo, director of engraving and crystal etching for Tiffany &amp; 
Co., has etched gifts for U.S. presidents from Eisenhower to Bush. He has 
worked on pieces for royalty and the world's social, political and financial 
leaders. He engraved a silver box with the Romanian seal that was presented to 
Nicolae Ceausescu by President Richard M. Nixon in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-engraving is an art that goes back more than 100 years, DiSalvo says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the oldest crafts with no change in the way we do it." 
</P>
<P>
During his 35 years with Tiffany, he has been called on to do finely etched 
drawings of buildings, horses, oil derricks and tall ships. 
</P>
<P>
"I love doing picture work," he says. 
</P>
<P>
DiSalvo and the other engravers work out their designs from a sketch. The area 
where the design will be engraved is painted white so the design can be copied 
onto the actual piece. 
</P>
<P>
Engravers use tools with different points and shapes to cut away the metal. 
When the design is finished it is checked over for mistakes. If a word is 
misspelled, the piece can be smoothed and recut. Occasionally, the engravers 
must start over with a new piece. 
</P>
<P>
DiSalvo has the same pride in his work enjoyed by the silversmiths who created 
Benjamin Harrison's cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as proud of the little key rings I engrave as I am for something for the 
President," he says. "Whether it costs $9 or thousands, I give it the same 
detail." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't want anything inferior leaving his shop. 
</P>
<P>
"Once it leaves, it's history," he says.

The deadline for her term paper was less than a week away before senior Lynn 
Flaherty got down to work. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of loading a backpack with notebooks and pens, she pulled a chair up to 
the computer in her dorm room. Instead of thumbing through a card catalogue in 
the library, she riffled through reference material without leaving her room. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Northwest Missouri State University installed a computer 
terminal in every residence hall room and faculty office, the "electronic 
campus" has transformed life for the school's 5,900 students. 
</P>
<P>
"It does everything. You don't have to go anywhere," said Flaherty, a 
psychology major from Des Moines. "I don't like to hang out in the library, and 
this means I don't have to." 
</P>
<P>
"My brother goes to Drake and he has to go to an office to use a word 
processor. I just chuckle when he talks about waiting in line for computers." 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Missouri is the first -- and so far, only -- public college or 
university in the United States to put a terminal in every room and office, 
then tie them together with a software system designed for college life. 
</P>
<P>
"Without leaving the residence hall, kids can access library information and 
scholarship and job postings," said Robert Henry, a school spokesman. "They can 
write and edit papers for classes, balance their checkbook and find out what's 
going on around campus. They can even look up their phone bills and see how 
much they owe." 
</P>
<P>
The faculty also approves. "I write tests, record grades, look up student 
transcripts and class rolls. Instead of calling the registrar's office, you can 
look it up on the computer," said chemistry Professor Harlan Higginbotham. 
</P>
<P>
If he lost his computer, he said, "I'd just have to retire. A secretary wants 
two days' notice to type an exam. But a computer isn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
The system's 2,400 terminals represent a techno invasion at the campus in the 
rolling farm country of extreme northwest Missouri. The electronic campus 
didn't come cheap, and that is one explanation why it remains an anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
The school spent $2.4 million to set up the electronic campus, and officials 
have spent $600,000 more since then. The initial cost to furnish each dorm room 
with a terminal -- now about 1,500 of them -- was about $300 per unit. The 
university recoups its costs by charging each student $25 per semester. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting campuses computer-oriented is a high priority, but it's a costly item. 
The shelf lives are not as long as you'd like," said Bob Aaron, spokesman for 
the National Assn. of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. "And there is 
a competition between the two strains, the high-tech user versus the general 
user." 
</P>
<P>
Still, other schools have taken the plunge. Carnegie-Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh may be "the most computer-intensive university in the world," said 
William Arms, vice president for academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic principle is that they pay a lot of money to come to Carnegie-Mellon 
and the computers are just like the libraries and playing fields; they are 
things that come with the campus," Arms said. 
</P>
<P>
Students there are not provided with terminals in their rooms. Most buy their 
own so they can hook into the university network, Arms said. 
</P>
<P>
At Northwest Missouri, off-campus students must buy their own or use terminals 
on campus; more and more courses require their use. On campus, computers are 
universal. The 2,800 students living in the 13 residence halls need only share 
terminals with roommates. 
</P>
<P>
"Your patience is a lot greater waiting 30 minutes in your own room instead of 
walking across campus to wait in line at some building," said Jon Rickman, 
director of computer services. 
</P>
<P>
In many disciplines, "electronic workbooks" are available. Students can call up 
a program to quiz themselves on things like chemistry problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The program gives them explanations and then asks them some questions," 
Higginbotham said. "You get immediate feedback on what you're doing right or 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In the English department, the word processing function has improved the 
quality of writing seen by chairman Jim Saucerman. 
</P>
<P>
"It frees them up to write, instead of dealing with the mechanics of writing," 
he said. "It doesn't mean perfection because students who are careless with a 
pen are careless with a keyboard. But overall, the finished product is better 
because they have more freedom to write." 
</P>
<P>
University President Dean Hubbard is proud of his electronic campus: 
"Technology is going to penetrate deeper into our lives. We need students to be 
as comfortable with computers as their parents are with their telephone." 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that is happening. Electronic mail is the system's most popular 
function. Basically a message system, electronic mail is a way to talk to old 
friends and meet new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"As a freshman, I was really into the e-mail," said senior Stephen King, an art 
major from Maryville. "I used to stay on campus just to use it." 
</P>
<P>
With such reliance on an electronic campus, what happens when the system goes 
down? No one knows -- it's never happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We take it down every other month, for about four hours on a Friday afternoon, 
for scheduled maintenance," Rickman said. "We've never had it crash on us. We 
have so many backups that if one part of the system fails, the others pick up 
the slack."

FOR RETIRED TEACHERS, EDUCATION BECOMES A MATTER OF PRIME TIME

Edna Green devoted her life to education, retiring nine years ago as head of 
the science department at a public high school for gifted girls. 
</P>
<P>
Today she is back in school, a student this time, under a program at the 
University of Pennsylvania that permits retirees to audit courses in exchange 
for volunteer work. They are also asked to contribute $50 per semester to a 
scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
Retirees can audit anything from poetry to engineering and can use the 
gymnasium and pool and receive other student benefits, such as reduced theater 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
They volunteer as tutors, counselors, technical assistants, office and library 
assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Last semester, Green took courses in speech, sculpture and poetry. She is 
looking ahead to the fall schedule and volunteered at the campus information 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-year-old Senior Associates Volunteering Valuable Years program (SAVVY) at 
Penn grew out of a trend that began in the 1970s, when retired teachers sought 
ways to stay intellectually active without the pressures and expenses of 
seeking degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Other programs still going include "Prime Timers" at California's state 
universities, "Learning in Retirement" at Duke University in North Carolina and 
the "Senior Adult Program" at Phoenix College in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The special slant at Penn is getting seniors involved in all aspects of campus 
life, even as living textbooks for history students, said Nancy Ellis, 
associate director for education at the Center for the Study of Aging at Penn. 
</P>
<P>
As a U.S. history requirement, for example, Bruce Kuklick has students 
interview people who lived through the Depression, World War II and the New 
Deal. 
</P>
<P>
The 200 senior associates for this year came from teaching, engineering and 
business backgrounds. They range from 62 to older than 90, but most are in 
their 70s. 
</P>
<P>
The program began in 1981 when Norton Shapiro, a federal government retiree who 
was auditing courses, suggested an organization for retirees on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1986, Shapiro was chairman of SAVVY's steering committee, which meets 
monthly to organize activities. 
</P>
<P>
The program was strictly academic at first, said Green, who earned her master's 
degree in biology at Penn. 
</P>
<P>
"The volunteer business didn't come until later, when we thought we ought to 
give something back to the university for what they were giving us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Ellis said, the seniors wanted to be real contributors. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to stuff envelopes, we don't want to file in somebody's back 
room, and we don't want to do menial tasks," Ellis said.

THE NORWEGIAN MASTER IS REGARDED AS A KEY PIONEER OF EXPRESSIONISM. A 
DISTINGUISHED COLLECTION OF 94 OF HIS WORKS IS ON VIEW AT THE COUNTY MUSEUM OF 
ART.

<P>
Occasionally, when life gets a bit much, the desire to escape envelops us. 
Where to go? Once we've dismissed Bali and other exotic places, Scandinavia 
starts seeming like a good getaway. Civilized, cultured and humane, it's just 
far enough off the main stem that one could live above the fray as an observer. 
All the advantages of Euro-American culture without the stress. Endless summer 
days. Cozy winters when it barely gets light. Might be nice to live among one's 
imaginings of a robust and handsome people. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there is Edvard Munch. 
</P>
<P>
Modern Scandinavian literary and artistic tradition has a dark side that 
stretches from Soren Kierkegaard to Henrik Ibsen and Ingmar Bergman. Every few 
years, a Munch exhibition materializes as a reminder of that intense, 
essentially moral strain. The latest today at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art is "Master Prints by Edvard Munch From the Epstein Family Collection." On 
view to Jan. 6, it presents 94 woodcuts, lithographs and intaglio prints by an 
artist acknowledged as among the great masters and innovators of the medium. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the older Vincent van Gogh, the Norwegian Munch holds pride of place 
as a key pioneer of modern Expressionism. Unlike the tragic Dutchman, Munch is 
not a beloved household name, although the two artists shared temperamental 
qualities and some oddly parallel experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Both were passionate, disturbed and drank more than was good for them. Both 
injured themselves in sexually charged circumstances. Van Gogh severed his ear 
after an encounter with a prostitute. Munch accidentally shot himself in the 
hand during a lover's quarrel. Both were hospitalized after nervous collapses. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Munch seems less poignant than the successfully suicidal Van Gogh because 
Munch recovered and lived to be 80, dying in 1944. It seems more likely that 
Van Gogh holds broader appeal because his work speaks of humane and healing 
hope, while Munch's best-known images seem pessimistic and so clearly 
autobiographical that they can be dismissed as one man's skewed view of life. 
Maybe Munch is simply harder to take and truer to the troubled psyche of the 
20th Century. He is the one who seems like a candidate for analysis by another 
older contemporary: Sigmund Freud. 
</P>
<P>
Once seen, Munch's imagery is as unforgettable as it is haunted. It 
participates in a Scandinavian artistic tradition that views human life in 
large and elemental terms. The work is arranged to dramatize its brooding, 
heavily symbolic themes. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in bourgeois Oslo (then called Christiania), Munch had lost both his 
mother and sister to tuberculosis by the time he was 14. Images of sickrooms 
such as "Death Chamber" show faces in blank-eyed grief. Figures in black 
dresses become abstract shapes whose undulating outlines project feelings of 
vertigo. Few artists have so effectively used pattern to express tension. 
</P>
<P>
Munch's many self-portraits show he grew up handsome. And, despite his 
stiff-backed army doctor father, he fell in with the local avant-garde crowd 
that included Hans Jaegger, a young anarchist who espoused free love and wrote 
a novel that was promptly suppressed. The ambience of these early years is 
caught in the etching "The Morning After." Munch's style was conventional then, 
but it didn't stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
By 1892, he'd had the first of a string of passionate, frustrating love affairs 
and spent time in Paris absorbing the whiplash contortions of Art Nouveau and 
the insistent decadence of Symbolism. Where Van Gogh had been a man of the 
earth, Munch was something of a dandy. 
</P>
<P>
That year, his Berlin exhibition ignited outraged protest and was shut down. 
Munch became a hero of the underground and went on to make his main reputation 
in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, his crowd hung out in an Unter den Linden cafe that boasted 900 
varieties of liqueurs. Other intimates of the circle included playwright August 
Strindberg and the Polish poet and satanist Stanislaw Przybyszewski. The female 
muse of the group was Dagny Juell, who eventually dumped Munch and married 
Przybyszewski. In 1901, she was murdered. Munch didn't do it, but you'd never 
know it from the masterpieces of the period. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna" shows the essential woman to be a kind of sainted vampire. "Jealousy" 
uses exaggerated depth to capture the moment a man is gripped with anxious rage 
as his lover stands nude before another. Munch's use of vortex space should be 
counted among the great visual metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
Of all his recurrent motifs, the anguish of carnal love produced the most 
searing images. In prints, the masterpiece is "The Kiss." In it, a pair of 
lovers are united into a single black shape against a wood-grain pattern that 
is both a background and a prison for the figures. They are trapped in it as in 
their desire. 
</P>
<P>
Munch's breakdown came in 1908. After it, his work lost its intensity, a 
circumstance that's caused many an artist to avoid psychotherapy. Actually, his 
later work has considerable merit. It grew a bit stolid but it actually pursued 
themes that broadened away from the neurotic absorption with sex and death that 
became a kind of joke in the Woody Allen era. 
</P>
<P>
Among his most profound themes are variations on "The Three Stages of Woman 
(The Spinx)." In it, the archetypal female is seen as an innocent virgin full 
of hope, a wanton nude and, finally, as a widow in mourning. In variants, the 
virgin stands near a young man on the seashore as if waiting. It's subtitled 
"The Lonely Ones." Later, she stands in intimate conversation with the widow, 
staring out at the surf. It could have inspired the scene where the knight 
plays chess with Death in Bergman's "The Seventh Seal." 
</P>
<P>
The collection on view was started in the '60s by Sarah and Lionel Epstein. Now 
regarded as one of the most distinguished in the world, it includes not only 
Munch classics but less familiar prints like "Melancholy." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Epstein writes movingly of the collection in a catalogue essay that 
reveals her as the mother of five, a champion of liberalism and a particular 
advocate of family planning. Funny, in a way, that such a person would respond 
to Munch's art. There are those who see the artist and the men in his milieu as 
misogynists who subjugated women. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, Sarah Epstein understands Munch's art for what it really is. It sees 
both sexes irresistibly subject to natural forces that drive them together 
willy-nilly in an eternal dance. In it, each partner holds the power of life 
and death. Or, at least, so it seems to the other.

</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: A CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED OUTING IN THE SANDS OF SAUDI ARABIA SHOWS 
THE PRESIDENT LEARNED WELL AT THE FOOT OF HIS PREDECESSOR. RONALD REAGAN COULD

<P>
This year the Thanksgiving Day parade had human floats. 
</P>
<P>
Those top bananas Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings along with "Good 
Morning America" were already in the Persian Gulf region cheering up the 
troops, and Willard Scott himself had only recently gotten back. 
</P>
<P>
"In the main, the guys are holding up real well," Rather of Arabia reported on 
"CBS This Morning" earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
So watching second banana George Bush chow down in Saudi Arabia early Thursday 
morning amid a sea of sand and camouflage seemed almost anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
But there he was in his shirt sleeves, accompanied by First Lady Barbara Bush 
wearing her own desert camouflage and congressional leaders wearing their 
biggest smiles. Bush first delivered pep talks at Army and Air Force 
installations. However, it was his "centerpiece" speech to Marines at about 
4:45 a.m. and his subsequent Thanksgiving meal with them that got live coverage 
on ABC and CNN and extensive tape coverage later that morning on all the 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Jim Miklazewski noted at one point: "This is about messages." And 
symbols. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing more symbolic, in fact, than CNN's intercutting live coverage 
that morning of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher en route by limo to 
deliver her resignation to the Queen with pictures of Bush en route by military 
vehicle to that Marine encampment said to be about two hours from the Kuwait 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Two leaders, two rituals: Thatcher stepping down, Bush stepping it up. 
</P>
<P>
His Thanksgiving visit showed anew how a President, through careful 
orchestration, can command media attention and make it virtually impossible for 
the camera to ignore him. This event also showed how growing skepticism about 
the U.S. military buildup in the gulf region can be reduced to barely audible 
Muzak by dramatic pictures of the commander-in-chief breaking bread with his 
troops in a distant land. Ronald Reagan could not have managed it better. 
</P>
<P>
The setting -- sand and guns in the background -- was perfect. The speaker, 
sprinkling his talk with emotional buzz words calculated to whip up support 
while boosting morale, echoed a politician on the stump: "Let me just say how 
pleased Barbara and I are to be here. . . . And let me say this. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
There were rousing cheers from the troops. 
</P>
<P>
You could spot the sound bites and sight bites that later would follow on all 
the newscasts: Bush waving, shaking hands, smiling, giving autographs, issuing 
a horseshoes challenge, posing for pictures and chatting. 
</P>
<P>
Between mouthfuls of food -- and hardly oblivious to the minicam in his face -- 
Bush carried on a continual conversation with troops closing in on him. About 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein: "The problem is he talks about all this 
negotiation, but he won't get out of Kuwait." About possible war with Iraq: "I 
guarantee you there won't be any more Vietnams. . . . We'll fight to win!" 
</P>
<P>
Today the holiday season, tomorrow the dying season. 
</P>
<P>
TV seemed to be hopping on this tank Thursday, with the emphasis far less on 
the philosophy of war than on the process of war. 
</P>
<P>
As the gulf dilemma drones on and on, TV has been especially brilliant in 
conveying the emotional and human side of the story. The impact of military 
mobilization on the home front, particularly the strain on families, has been 
reported with great sensitivity and insight. And satellite technology has made 
it possible to reunite loved ones by electronically reaching across the seas. 
</P>
<P>
Except for brief comments from the father of a Marine on "CBS This Morning," 
however, voices of dissidents opposing Bush's gulf policy were all but excluded 
from Thursday morning's coverage. The symbolism and emotion of the moment were 
just too powerful. 
</P>
<P>
As the pictures showed Bush greeting troops, Middle East expert and ABC 
consultant Judith Kipper questioned Bush's anti-Hussein rhetoric, saying it 
personalized the conflict and that the President should "slow down." But she 
was cut off by Peter Jennings: 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get away from politics now. . . . For any U.S. servicemen here to be 
able to spend a moment with his or her President is clearly a moment to be 
remembered." 
</P>
<P>
Later on NBC, correspondents Miklazewski and Katherine Couric sat side by side 
in Saudi Arabia and commented on the Bush visit during the "Today" program as 
if they were co-hosting the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade telecast that 
Willard Scott and Deborah Norville would co-host later. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the air, "Today" managed to squeeze in one last guest, and just 
like that, Miklazewski was gone and Couric was joined by O. J. Simpson of NBC's 
"NFL Live." It seemed that Simpson had been in Saudi Arabia preparing a feature 
for Thursday's Detroit-Denver telecast that was about to follow on NBC. He was 
ebullient. 
</P>
<P>
"Morale is up, everyone is very positive," Commander Simpson said. "The big 
question is, 'When are we gonna go home?,' not 'Why are we here?' Let's get it 
on or get out." 
</P>
<P>
It was that sort of holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"So that is Thanksgiving Day for President and Mrs. Bush," Peter Jennings had 
said earlier, wrapping up ABC's live coverage. It had been a feast in the 
desert, turkey, roast beef and ham. 
</P>
<P>
Lots and lots of ham.

A retired police officer shot and critically wounded three of four armed men 
last night after they burst into his home brandishing handguns at him, police 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the intruders as Phouxay Vanhnarath, 19, of Costa Mesa; 
Sayavong Nanthavongdouangsy, 18, of Anaheim, and two male juveniles -- one of 
Garden Grove and one of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the juveniles were being withheld because of their age. 
</P>
<P>
Vanhnarath and the two juveniles, who were hit by shotgun fire, were in 
critical condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet 
Barry said. 
</P>
<P>

A man armed with a shotgun and boxes of ammunition fired about 100 rounds 
through the walls of his Hollywood home this morning, terrifying neighbors and 
triggering a four-hour standoff, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Koutsky, 25, surrendered to police about 5:30 a.m. as police warned him 
over a loudspeaker that a SWAT team was about to storm the bullet-riddled house 
in the 1300 block of N. Gordon Avenue, Sgt. Pat Findley said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured by the shots fired and no other structures were hit, 
although many of the shots penetrated the walls of Koutsky's residence. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the house produced a 12-gauge shotgun, a replica of an Uzi rifle, a 
pair of handcuffs, a sword and boxes of ammunition, Findley said.

The United States posted a budget deficit of $31.46 billion in October in the 
opening month of fiscal 1991, the Treasury Department reported today. 
</P>

The shortfall follows a surplus of $20.84 billion in September and a deficit of 
$26.08 billion in October, 1989, according to the department's regular budget 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's outlays totaled $110.17 billion, while receipts totaled $78.71 
billion, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the category "contribution to the defense cooperation account," the 
government received $1.62 billion in October, mainly for the Operation Desert 
Shield buildup in the Persian Gulf. Overall defense spending totaled $24.09 
billion for the month.

John F. Kennedy Jr., who recently passed the state bar exam on his third try, 
has argued his first case in court, a published report said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, an assistant Manhattan district attorney, argued for 10 minutes 
Wednesday before three judges in the state appellate court that a 
purse-snatcher's conviction should not be overturned, the New York Post 
reported. The judges will hand down a verdict in January. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old son of slain President John F. Kennedy went to work for the 
district attorney in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He had failed the grueling New York bar exam twice and was in danger of losing 
his prosecutor's job if he flunked a third time.

Israel said today it will repair a leaky roof at the Church of the Nativity, 
built at the site where tradition says Jesus was born, because feuding 
Christian sects can't agree on who is responsible for upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
Repairs at the church in the West Bank town of Bethlehem will begin in a few 
days and should be completed by Christmas, said Shmuel Hamburger, a military 
government official. 
</P>
<P>
"The roof is in such bad shape that the last time we had rain two weeks ago, it 
was pouring inside the church," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there were gaping holes in the wood-and-tar roof. Last Christmas, 
buckets for rainwater were set out inside the basilica. The Greek Orthodox 
Church had insisted on fixing the roof, saying it traditionally cleaned the 
roof and therefore should be allowed to do the repairs. The rival Armenian and 
Roman Catholic churches protested, saying the roof should be fixed by all three 
groups -- or not at all.

U.S. ASKS NATO TO HELP FERRY TROOPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States made an "urgent" appeal today to its NATO allies to help 
ferry U.S. soldiers and equipment to the Persian Gulf region, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The pitch for help from North Atlantic Treaty Organization members in ferrying 
troops to the gulf was made by NATO envoy William H. Taft IV at the Brussels 
headquarters of the alliance, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
European allies have already provided some troop-transport assistance, but the 
new request centered on the need for passenger planes, said a U.S. official at 
the NATO mission, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 230,000 American troops in the gulf region now; 200,000 more 
are to arrive in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will probably meet next week on a resolution allowing 
force against Iraq, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon, probably next week, the Security Council will consider a draft 
resolution authorizing member states to use force to bring about the reversal 
of the Iraqi aggression," he told reporters in London. It was the first 
indication that enough support had been gathered to call the meeting before the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
The urgency is due in large part to the fact that Yemen, which has tilted 
toward Iraq in the past, takes over the rotating chairmanship of the Security 
Council from the United States in December. 
</P>
<P>
China and the Soviet Union were said today to be in favor of a political 
solution to the gulf crisis, implying that they are not yet ready to back a 
U.N. resolution on the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides stand for a political solution to the gulf crisis on the basis of 
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions," the official New China News Agency 
said after talks between the two countries' foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, underscoring its readiness to fight to keep Kuwait, began calling up 
battle-hardened military reservists today. It also lifted a curfew in the 
conquered emirate, insisting "normal life" is resuming -- and implying that the 
Kuwaiti resistance has been beaten down. 
</P>
<P>
The latest Iraqi call-up, announced in a Defense Ministry communique broadcast 
on Baghdad radio, involves reservists in their 30s, including battle-tested 
veterans of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
They apparently will be among 150,000 reservists and draftees that Iraq said 
earlier this week will be sent to Kuwait, along with about 100,000 other 
regular army troops. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's official news agency said it was canceling an overnight curfew in Kuwait 
because the emirate is calmer now. The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, 
Cyprus, said the move was meant to "confirm the return of normal life" to 
Kuwait, which Iraq has declared to be an Iraqi province.

The national legislature today asked its chairman to begin talks with the 15 
Soviet republics to reach temporary agreements to prevent the further breakup 
of the country and stabilize the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a package of proposals, the lawmakers also endorsed for a second time 
within a week President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposed restructuring of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
It called on the Soviet leader to act quickly to improve food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers asked Gorbachev to act within two weeks to assure that there will 
be enough food this winter. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution contained a gloomy assessment of the nation's economic and 
political affairs. "The situation in the country continues to worsen and is 
approaching a crisis condition," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Another resolution passed recommended that Gorbachev take all steps "authorized 
by law, up to extraordinary measures" in cases where there is a threat to human 
life, health or property. 
</P>
<P>
That measure removed a requirement for the president to consult with leaders of 
the republics before taking such measures and gave the KGB responsibility for 
dealing with what it called "economic sabotage." 
</P>
<P>
In a 10-minute speech, Gorbachev told the 542-member legislature that "every 
day is precious" and urged them to move swiftly toward a new union treaty to 
replace a 1924 accord uniting the republics.

Student outcry over sexual assaults on women and anonymously posted lists of 
alleged male rapists on bathroom walls has prompted Brown University to require 
special orientation seminars starting next fall for freshmen, an official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Ivy League university will also see to it that every student who comes 
forward with an assault or harassment complaint is provided with a trained 
advocate who will follow the case through, said Robert Reichley, executive vice 
president. The steps are being taken in the wake of a stormy forum on campus 
last week in which members of the audience -- most of them women -- criticized 
university officials for being insensitive and indifferent to the issues of 
sexual assault and harassment.

Asian countries should not be lulled into a false sense of security by low AIDS 
statistics, as there are an estimated 500,000 carriers of the virus in the 
region, a U.N. organization said today. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2,000 of the world's 215,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
were reported in Asia as of February, the U.N. Economic and Social Commission 
for Asia and the Pacific said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
However, the disease could spread rapidly because many more people in Asia, 
estimated to number 500,000, have been infected with the AIDS virus, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"The small number of AIDS cases in the region should not be grounds for 
optimism. Claims by some countries that they had no cases were contrary to 
other available evidence," the release quoted a commission paper as saying.

Ads with sexy bronzed models should be required to carry health warnings that 
tanning can cause skin cancer, medical specialists said today. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising, fashion and marketing industries are irresponsibly promoting 
tans, counteracting efforts to encourage Australians to reduce their 
skin-cancer risk, the Australasian College of Dermatologists said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that each of these pictures should in fact carry a warning, similar 
to those found on cigarette packets: suntanning is a cancer hazard," Dr. Alan 
Cooper, the college's honorary secretary, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see parents with very young babies on beaches with no protection, I 
think that is child abuse," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper called for a concerted effort to promote the image that "the pale 
Australian is in, and the bronzed Aussie is out."

Lloyds Bank PLC said today it has cut 2,000 staff this year as part of an 
ongoing review of its banking operations. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts came mostly through natural attrition and early retirement throughout 
the company, including head office staff, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyds, one of Britain's largest commercial banks, currently employs 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
Further job cuts are expected in the future, but the exact numbers haven't been 
decided, said a spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with bank 
practice.

Other British banks also have been trimming staff and consolidating branch

The New York Stock Exchange halted trading for more than 90 minutes this 
morning because of a power disruption that knocked out the computer system at 
the nation's largest stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The disruption shut down the exchange at 9:41 a.m., 11 minutes into the start 
of its session. 
</P>
<P>
NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano said the problem was identified and corrected 
before 10:30 a.m., but trading didn't resume until 11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule I don't see any real damage (to the market)," said Richard Meyer, 
managing director of institutional trading at Ladenburg Thalmann. "It was not 
that big of a deal. It was a quiet day and this just made it a forced 
quietness." 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the problem was with the exchange's "Dot" computer, which executes 
small orders. "They have a backup system that evidently is not working," one 
trader said.

Stock prices fell modestly today in the lightest trading in almost four years 
due to the Thanksgiving holiday and a power outage that halted trading for 
nearly two hours on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 12.13 points at 2,527.23, 
finishing the week with a net loss of 23.02 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, losing issues edged past gainers by a 7-6 margin. 
</P>
<P>
The long Thanksgiving holiday weekend helped keep trading light at 63 million 
shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The power outage also curtailed volume 
and killed any early enthusiasm, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The last time fewer shares changed hands on the Big Board was Dec. 26, 1986, 
when volume was 48.9 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Blue chips were off before the forced time-out, rose when trading resumed, then 
dropped again in early afternoon trading. Traders blamed a sharp rise in oil 
prices and a drop in bonds for pulling Wall Street off its early highs. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Thursday's surprise resignation decision by British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher had little effect on U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"The policies will likely remain pretty much the same," said Prudential-Bache 
market analyst Hildegard Zagorski. "Share prices in London are up, and that's a 
plus for stocks here."

Scott Mellanby's power-play goal early in the third period snapped a 1-1 tie 
and sparked the Philadelphia Flyers to a 4-1 victory over the Toronto Maple 
Leafs today. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto lost for the fourth straight game and remained winless in 10 road games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, in second place in the Patrick Division, won its second straight 
and closed to within five points of the idle New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Mellanby, who has nine goals this season, scored his first at home when he 
tucked a back-hander between the pads of goalie Peter Ing at 4:03 of the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Tocchet, who had a goal and an assist, dumped a pass to Keith Acton in the 
slot and Acton found Mellanby alone just outside the goal mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Smith made it 3-1 when he picked up a loose puck just inside the blue 
line, skated in and beat Ing to the glove side from the left faceoff circle 
with 12:13 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Kushner scored on a power play with nine seconds to play, slipping a shot 
under Ing from just outside the crease to end the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Flyers' goalie Pete Peeters, making his 10th straight start, made eight saves 
in the final period and turned back 22 shots in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto took a 1-0 lead just 20 seconds into the game when Luke Richardson 
slapped a shot from just inside the blue line over Peeters' left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Tocchet tied the game with his team-leading 15th goal. Tocchet took a pass from 
Pelle Eklund while driving down the slot and slipped a shot between the pads of 
Ing at 6:44 of the first period.

BASEBALL EXONERATES KLEINMAN OF WRONGDOING IN SPIRA AFFAIR

New York Yankees executive Leonard Kleinman has been cleared by baseball of any 
wrongdoing in George Steinbrenner's payment to Howard Spira, but he intends to 
continue his $22-million lawsuit against Commissioner Fay Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
In a nine-page decision signed Nov. 15, Vincent said, "I have resolved all 
questions of knowledge, motive and credibility in this matter in favor of Mr. 
Kleinman." 
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner added that Kleinman's credibility was hurt by "his 
surprising inability to answer some of the simplest questions in a 
straightforward manner." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Spira, an admitted gambler, and Steinbrenner prompted 
an investigation by baseball that led to an agreement in which Steinbrenner 
resigned as managing general partner of the Yankees in August. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman is the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the 
team and was accused of assisting in the $40,000 payment to Spira, who provided 
the Yankees with information about Dave Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner thought about proposing Kleinman as his successor, but Vincent 
decided it would be "inappropriate" during the investigation, and Steinbrenner 
instead proposed Robert E. Nederlander. 
</P>
<P>
Dominic F. Amorosa, Kleinman's lawyer, said today that he intends to continue 
the suit and plans to take public depositions from investigator John M. Dowd on 
Dec. 5 and from Vincent on Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the bad-faith institution of the charges against Kleinman 
initially, Kleinman lost the opportunity to become the managing general 
partner," Amorosa said. "And he now seeks compensation from Vincent and Dowd 
because of their action."

<P>
The Senior Professional Baseball Assn., revamped if not necessarily 
revitalized, began its second season today. 
</P>
<P>
The league for former major-leaguers age 35 and over was dubbed "The Boys of 
Fall" last year, but this year's nickname could be "The Road Warriors." 
</P>
<P>
Where there were eight Florida teams last year, there now are four. The league 
"expanded" westward, with teams in Sun City, Ariz., and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Founder and President Jim Morley said he does not consider his brainchild a 
laughingstock. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the nation is laughing at us, because they don't know us," 
Morley said. "And before you can laugh, you have to know the joke." 
</P>
<P>
Morley is not joking when he says he is optimistic after an inaugural season 
marred by missed paychecks, disappearing owners and revolving-door rosters. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the league is Jim Rice, the former Boston Red Sox slugger. Some of the 
other familiar names include former Oakland A's relief ace Rollie Fingers and 
Cincinnati slugger George Foster.

KANSAS STATE'S SNYDER WINS COACH OF YEAR;

FOOTBALL: BIG EIGHT POLL LAUDS SECOND-YEAR COACH FOR TURNAROUND. RIVAL AT NO. 1

<P>
Bill Snyder, who led Kansas State to more victories this year than they had the 
previous five seasons combined, was an easy winner over Colorado's Bill 
McCartney for Associated Press Big Eight coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, 5-6 in his second year at Kansas State, polled 10.5 votes from a panel 
of media observers. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney, whose Buffaloes finished No.1 and won the conference title a second 
straight year, got 3.5 votes. Kansas' Glen Mason had one vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the most talent," McCartney said of Snyder. "He did the best job. I 
really feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches throughout the conference were raving about the way Kansas State played 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them before when they were pretty good at Kansas State," said 
Oklahoma State's Pat Jones. "But I've never seen a Kansas State team play with 
such intensity. They were so obviously well-organized and well-coached. I think 
Bill and his staff have just done a marvelous job. I think he should be 
national coach of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most impressive thing about Kansas State's season is that the 5-6 
record was molded by essentially the same players who had just come off a 
30-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate people like Bill and Pat and the kind things they say," Snyder 
said. "But I'm kind of humbled by this award because there are so many 
deserving people. It's not just me. It's the people all around us.

LAFLEUR STILL MIFFED AT MONTREAL; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: HALL-OF-FAME WINGER FEELS CANADIENS' PRESIDENT USED HIM TO SETTLE AN 
OLD SCORE.

<P>
Six seasons after he retired from the Montreal Canadiens, the Quebec Nordiques' 
Guy Lafleur still resents the way he was treated by his former team and its 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur contends that Ron Corey reveled in his messy departure from the 
Montreal organization in 1985 because he had rejected approaches by Corey, then 
a player agent, to represent him 14 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I slammed the door and he came back another time and I said, 'Don't bug me 
because I don't need you as an agent,' " Lafleur said Thursday. "He didn't 
forget about that." 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur joined the Canadiens for the 1971-72 season and blossomed into one of 
the NHL's top stars. 
</P>
<P>
The freewheeling right wing with the flowing hair was the NHL's top scorer 
three times. He won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player in 1977 
and 1978 and was the top gun on the Canadiens teams that won four consecutive 
Stanley Cups beginning in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Lafleur was being used sparingly by Canadiens Coach Jacques Lemaire. 
Lafleur was having sleepless nights about his limited role and went to Lemaire 
and General Manager Serge Savard about it. When nothing changed, he retired. 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur later accepted a lifetime front-office job, but wasn't impressed with 
his duties as a goodwill ambassador. He asked that his salary be doubled to 
$150,000, but Corey refused. 
</P>
<P>
"Corey told me there was no office clerk getting paid that kind of money at The 
Forum, and I said, 'You think I am an office clerk. At least put me in an 
office."' 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur, who parted company with the Canadiens in 1985, said the organization 
put its image above everything. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, they think differently. It is their image first, and the players 
after. If the player hurts their image, they will get rid of him. It doesn't 
matter who it is." 
</P>
<P>
"They traded (Chris) Chelios (to Chicago) because they said he had problems off 
the ice. If the guy shows up every night to play the game, off the ice 
shouldn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in September, 1988, and left 
after the ceremony to begin a comeback with the New York Rangers. He played one 
season for the Rangers before signing with Quebec as a free agent in July, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur, in Toronto to promote his new book, "Overtime: The Legend of Guy 
Lafleur," said this will be his last NHL season and that he's looking forward 
to moving smoothly into a front-office job with the Nordiques.

COUNTRY SINGER K.T. OSLIN TAKES A DIRECT APPROACH 
</P>

<P>
The graffiti was printed neatly in black ink on a bathroom stall in a cafe in 
Due West, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"I ain't never gonna love nobody but Cornell Crawford," it declared. 
</P>
<P>
When K. T. Oslin read it, she chuckled. Then, pondering its directness and 
determination, she knew she had a song. The result is "Cornell Crawford," one 
of Oslin's songs in her third country music album, "Love in a Small Town." 
</P>
<P>
Cut after cut, the themes and emotions are from everyday, ordinary life and hit 
special chords within the listener. 
</P>
<P>
It is her first LP in two years, a rather long hiatus for country music. So 
this normally gutsy singer-songwriter confesses to a touch of trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't put out an album every year, you can be dead meat," the 
48-year-old performer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see. But I don't think you become dead meat until you are doing inferior 
work. Or mediocre work." 
</P>
<P>
Based on her previous records, Oslin has little reason to worry. Her albums, 
"80s Ladies" and "This Woman," both sold more than 1 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
She won three Grammy awards during a meteoric rise in country music. In 1988, 
she unseated Reba McEntire as the Country Music Assn.'s female vocalist of the 
year. McEntire had won the honor four straight years. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Toinette Oslin was born in Crossitt, Ark., but spent most of her early 
years in Mobile, Ala. As a teen-ager, she settled in Houston. Ending up in New 
York, she was a chorus girl in theatrical productions and then turned to work 
as a studio backup vocalist and ad jingle singer. 
</P>
<P>
She also showed a flair for songwriting. An aunt lent her $7,000 to finance a 
Nashville showcase performance, which caught the attention of RCA Records. She 
signed an RCA recording contract in 1986 at a time when most record companies 
were looking for singers almost half her age. 
</P>
<P>
Oslin became one of Nashville's most intriguing personalities, launching a new 
career in her mid-40s and writing songs from the perspective of a strong woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I was different," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She was also outspoken. She has said candidly that she hated country music when 
she grew up. 
</P>
<P>
"When I listened to country music in the '50s, it was almost all males who 
seemed very old and sang about drinking and cheating on their wives or 
girlfriends," she said. "A 15-year-old does not relate to that. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, it has changed, and people who say today that they don't like 
country music probably haven't listened to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it I like today, some of it I don't. I don't like the real twangy, 
hard core, straight ahead, old-style country music. I like some of it, but on a 
steady diet, no."

MIKE TYSON is training at Atlantic City's Trump Plaza. The former heavyweight 
champ fights Alex Stewart on Dec. 9. Tyson, however, does believe that all work 
and no play makes Mike a dull boy. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson recently caught a performance by the O'Jays at Trop World. The group 
spotted the big guy in the audience and pulled him up onstage, introducing him 
as "the newest member of our group." The champ then joined them in a song. 
</P>
<P>
Before this, Tyson turned up at the Trump Plaza showcase for the former Miss 
America, Suzette Charles. Suzette, who has never wanted to reign alone like 
Garbo, told her audience that she and the former champ were "more than just 
good friends." That may indeed be true, but it wasn't Suzette who then 
accompanied Mike on an upscale boutique shopping spree on the Boardwalk wherein 
he spent $40,000 on clothes for himself and an unidentified lady friend. Tyson 
has also been seen cruising Atlantic City in his bright red Ferrari, a tall and 
gorgeous blond beside him.

I love to see young people having a good time, don't you?

Country star Tammy Wynette will perform a free Christmas concert Dec. 19 for 
soldiers, reservists and family members at Ft. Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
"This is her special tribute to the soldiers and family members of Operation 
Desert Shield," post spokesman Bill Harralson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 101st Airborne Division, about 19,000 soldiers, began deploying to Saudi 
Arabia in August. About 3,500 soldiers remain at the post, and some reservists 
also are stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, organized by CBS Records, will probably include other entertainers 
to be announced later, Harralson said.

Wynette is best known for her 1960s hits "D-I-V-O-R-C-E" and "Stand By Your
