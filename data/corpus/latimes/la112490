CARLSBAD MAN HOPES TO NAIL DOWN A CRAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Englishman Steve Ward was toiling away in the banger business when a peculiar 
2,000-year-old opportunity suddenly came his way. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he was endeavoring to get San Diego County's appetite hooked on 
bangers, those plump British sausages, he managed to buy 30,000 ancient Roman 
nails discovered 30 years ago at a fortress in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Ward's accountant, who helped arrange the purchase, also issued a challenge: 
"He said, 'Do you think you can get the Americans excited about these nails?' " 
</P>
<P>
Ward, a former race-car driver, figured that, if Americans went wild for Pet 
Rocks in the '70s, they might really gobble up something of antiquity. Even if 
they're nails. And even if they sell for $189 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that anybody with a reasonable amount of intelligence will know 
this is a good thing to own," said Ward, who, as a sideline to his sausage 
distribution business, British Banger 
</P>
<P>
Corp., has now opened A.D. Discoveries in Carlsbad to market the nails. 
</P>
<P>
He figures the nails are more than a mere curio for somebody who has 
everything, saying, "How often can you pick up something that's 2,000 years 
old?" 
</P>
<P>
A buyer at the Nordstrom department store in Santa Barbara thinks Ward may be 
on to something and has ordered 50 of the nails, which are sealed in Lucite and 
resting in a velvet-lined oak box, to offer for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel our Santa Barbara customers have responded (in the past) to 
merchandise of nostalgic or keepsake value," said Nordstrom spokeswoman 
Michelle Garratt. 
</P>
<P>
Ending up on department store shelves probably isn't the worst thing that might 
have happened to the nails. They literally could have killed somebody. 
</P>
<P>
Back in AD 83, a Roman army commanded by Agricola had trudged through Britain 
up to Caledonia, now Scotland, to subdue the tribes there, according to a 
history book Ward keeps. The Roman leader ordered a fortress built in 
Perthshire, but it was later abandoned and destroyed by the departing Romans. 
</P>
<P>
Roman equipment was buried at the fortress, including 8 tons of nails the 
legion didn't want captured, pounded into arrowheads, and fired back at them by 
the highly agitated locals whose lands the Romans had the bad manners to 
invade. 
</P>
<P>
The nails remained in a pit for centuries, covered by 12 feet of clay, until 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the British Steel Corp. discovered the cache during an excavation at the 
site. The top layers were corroded, but had formed a protective cap that kept 
the rest of the nails from exposure to air. 
</P>
<P>
The steel firm kept the nails until the 1980s, and Ward produces a letter on 
British Steel Corp. stationary stating, "You have our assurance . . . (the 
nails) are all Roman nails from the legionary fortress of Inchtuthil, 
Perthshire dated from AD 83 to AD 87." 
</P>
<P>
Ward, 36, born in Yorkshire, said the nails have been extensively studied and 
authenticated since their discovery, and he provides buyers with a booklet 
citing the scholarship done on the nails. They are two lengths: 3 to 4 inches, 
and about 2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, just as the nails are going on the market, Ward has no idea 
whether his investment gamble will be a financial debacle or a brilliant 
stroke. But he simply couldn't pass up the opportunity that "just came about by 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
Last May, his accountant, Tony Redpath, told Ward that he had a client in 
northern England who had come into possession of the nails and was willing to 
sell. Ward bought them, got an import license, and brought them to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
When a U.S. Customs agent inquired what he had, Ward said, "You promise not to 
laugh? They're rusty nails." 
</P>
<P>
Now they're for sale, and Ward hopes the items will take off. Ward's friend, 
Nick Reed, a 27-year-old Briton, is ready to market the nails in their native 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone buys one, they're not going to see one at a swap meet for $20," 
assured Reed.

OFFICER SHOOTS MAN WHO POLICE SAY HAD GUN; 
</P>
<P>
LA COLONIA: THE 60-YEAR-OLD IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. RELATIVES SAY HE WAS 
DRINKING AT HOME BUT WAS NOT ARMED WHEN HE WENT OUTSIDE.

<P>
A 60-year-old Oxnard man standing in the bushes outside his La Colonia house 
was shot three times after aiming a gun at a police officer, Oxnard police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police shot Ubertino O. Ayala in the arm, chest and leg as a horrified family 
member watched. Although police say they recovered a gun at the scene, Ayala's 
family contends that he was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala was reported in critical condition at St. John's Regional Medical Center 
on Friday evening after surgery, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the Oxnard Police Department, the shooting is being 
investigated by the department and by the Ventura County district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. John Crombach, who was on duty Thursday night, said five police officers 
responded after receiving a report on the 911 emergency line about 9:45 p.m. 
from an unidentified woman about a man with a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived at Ayala's house in the 100 block of Featherstone Street, 
Ayala pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Officer Ken Dellinger, 
police said. Dellinger warned Ayala in English, "Police! Drop the gun!" but 
Ayala walked toward the officer, police said. Dellinger then fired his weapon 
at Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to elaborate further on the statement and deferred all other 
questions to the investigating officials, who were not available Friday. 
Crombach said investigators may examine the tape of the 911 call. 
</P>
<P>
According to family members, Ayala, who was slightly drunk after a Thanksgiving 
Day celebration with his family, retreated to a corner of his front yard to 
urinate behind a bush when he was surprised by the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala, who speaks only Spanish, could not have understood the officer, said 
Ramon Ayala, Ubertino Ayala's 30-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't speak a word of English," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in two months that Oxnard police have been involved in a 
shooting in the mostly Spanish-speaking La Colonia neighborhood. On Oct. 6, 
Oxnard police officers shot and killed a man who had reportedly made threats 
against a family. 
</P>
<P>
Heliodoro Rodriguez Montero, 47, was shot by officers after he pointed a gun at 
police at least three times, police said. Three officers, who were placed on 
leave while the shooting was investigated, have been cleared and have returned 
to duty, Crombach said. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials also placed Dellinger on administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
Crombach described the 50-year-old Dellinger as a veteran officer "with a broad 
base of experience," including nearly 20 years on the Oxnard force. 
</P>
<P>
"If Officer Dellinger fired that weapon in self-defense, he certainly felt like 
he was being threatened," Crombach said. He acknowledged that communication "is 
an inherent problem where you're dealing with an ethnic group with language 
barriers." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting triggered an angry response from other family members and several 
neighbors who said they knew Ayala as a quiet man who had never had problems 
with police. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala's wife, Alicia, said her husband had been drinking and was still slightly 
drunk at the time of the shooting. She and her daughter, Celia Zavala, denied 
contacting police. 
</P>
<P>
One family member who saw the shooting said police also threatened to shoot 
him, even though he was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Zavala, Ayala's son-in-law, said he was at Ayala's house to seek advice 
regarding a recent marital separation with Ayala's daughter. He said they had 
been talking outside when Ayala excused himself to go to the bathroom and began 
walking behind a large bush. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala had just rounded a corner of the house when a police officer appeared on 
the other side of a wire fence and began to fire, Zavala said. 
</P>
<P>
Zavala, who said he did not hear any warnings by the officer, said he was 
frightened by the gunfire and ran to hide, but the same police officer who shot 
Ayala approached him and yelled at Zavala to disarm himself. During the whole 
incident, Ayala had nothing in his hands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he didn't have a pistol in his hands," said Zavala, 30. "They were 
about to shoot at me because I had my hand hidden in my shirt." Zavala said he 
was unarmed, but his injured right wrist is wrapped in a bulky brace. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, about 15 family members gathered outside Ayala's hospital room where 
he lay unconscious after undergoing six hours of surgery. Some sat in a nearby 
waiting room, saying the shooting was unjust. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Ayala, 40, said his father was employed at a mushroom farm and had lived 
in California for decades. He said family members are considering legal action 
against the Oxnard Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know a thing like this could happen," Jose Ayala said. "We don't 
even know why the police were there." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Villasenor, 67, Ayala's next-door neighbor, said he was watching 
television when he heard four or five shots outside. When he stepped out to see 
what was going on, he found the neighborhood ringed with police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Villasenor, who has lived next to Ayala for 16 years, said he was surprised 
that his next-door neighbor had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a quiet guy. The police have never been to his house," Villasenor said. 
"He's never bothered anyone."

SHOPPERS -- NOT BUYERS -- FLOOD STORES, MALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER PUMMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was something noticeably absent from the arms of many shoppers 
patronizing The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Few people in the mall's crowded promenade were carrying more than two bags. 
</P>
<P>
And more often than not, shoppers were empty-handed. Lines at the Orange Julius 
and other fast-food stands far outdistanced those at store cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
"People are shopping, but they're not necessarily purchasing," said Wendy 
Levin, area manager for Lanz, a women's clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Ventura County, people's gift-giving generosity this year is being 
closely scrutinized as a measure of the local economy's strength. Thanksgiving 
Day newspapers were fat with circulars from stores trying to persuade consumers 
to part with savings and tap credit cards in uncertain economic times. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in past years in a pocket of relative prosperity in this county," 
said Bob Seitz, executive vice president of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce. 
"This shopping season will give us a strong indication of whether the downturn 
in the national economy has reached Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
While managers of several large department stores in the county said sales 
through midday were running close to last year's levels, dozens of shoppers 
said they were paring their Christmas gift budget as much as 50% this year 
because of misgivings about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an imminent possibility of my husband being laid off, so we're going 
to be careful for the next six months to be sure he has a job," said Joanne 
Buhek, 50, of Thousand Oaks, an administrative assistant at Cal Lutheran 
University whose husband is a quality assurance manager at Northrop's Newbury 
Park plant. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take care of the necessities of life first, and with gas going up 
so much, that doesn't leave a lot of money for other things," said Pedro 
Alejandro, a 49-year-old social worker from Oxnard who was buying two $10 
framed prints and a pair of pajamas for his two sons at a Ventura K mart. "Many 
people will just get a card instead of a gift this year." 
</P>
<P>
Even people who said they plan to spend more on gifts this year than last were 
frugal with their purchases Friday. 
</P>
<P>
John Phillips, 44, of Camarillo bought his grandsons two Nintendo entertainment 
centers for $89 with a special JC Penney coupon. Phillips owns a high-tech hand 
tool manufacturing company that he said fared well over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Every gift that Jackie Colleran bought at The Oaks was not only on sale, but 
marked down additionally from its sale price. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to stay within a budget," said Colleran, 50, a health clerk in the 
Conejo Valley Unified School District. She said she expects to spend $1,000 
this year on presents. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 people were lined up at 7 a.m. when the Ventura K mart on Victoria 
Avenue opened for a four-hour special sale, store Manager Jay Jones said. The 
incentive included such early-bird specials as a $169 videocassette recorder, 
artificial Christmas trees for $34.98 and $3.47 Ninja Turtle action figures 
normally selling for $4.97. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales of Ninja Turtles continue to be absolutely awesome," said Jones, noting 
that Bart Simpson items have fallen out of fashion. "He seems to have run his 
course." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Arimura, manager of Dexter's Camera in Ventura, said that foot traffic 
was fairly brisk at his East Main Street shop, but that the sales outlook for 
the next month is less promising. 
</P>
<P>
"Things will probably be slower, because we are basically a big toy store for 
adults," Arimura said. "When there's an impending recession, people spend less 
on these type of things." 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance to the JC Penney store, Melanie Bonvicino managed to sign up 
only 10 credit card applicants over six hours. She said that suggested that not 
many people want to be saddled with additional consumer debt after the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what Nancy Barron, a resource specialist at Santa Paula High 
School, said she intends to avoid. "It's usually my buffer but it's not going 
to be this year," she said of credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants concerned about how much disposable income they can attract from 
consumers at least have time on their side this year. With Thanksgiving falling 
on its earliest possible date, the traditional shopping season includes nine 
days in November. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of an Oxnard department store said the extended shopping season may 
have contributed Friday to the preponderance of window-shoppers who were using 
their time to comparison shop.

BERNHARDT FOES SUBMIT PETITIONS FOR RECALL ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SIGNATURES MUST STILL BE VALIDATED, BUT OPPONENTS HAVE SUBMITTED 
TWICE THE NUMBER NEEDED TO FORCE THE CITY'S FIRST VOTE ON A RECALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Moving San Diego closer to its first City Council recall election, a group 
seeking to oust Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt turned in more than 6,200 
signatures on recall petitions Friday -- more than twice as many needed to 
qualify the issue for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the 8,265 valid signatures turned in last month, Friday's 
petitions probably will enable the Recall Bernhardt Committee to surpass the 
11,240 signatures needed to force a recall election early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the 2,975 additional names necessary could be achieved with a 
validity rate considerably less than last month's 70% figure, the 
anti-Bernhardt group predicted that verification of Friday's signatures will 
force the 5th District councilwoman into the first recall campaign since the 
City Charter was approved early this century. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited, but we're also sad that it's come to this," said Kathy Gaustad, 
the recall committee's chairman. "Hopefully, this will send a message to all 
elected officials that you cannot promise anything to get elected . . . and not 
live up to the promise." 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt, who previously has threatened a court challenge to try to block the 
recall campaign, could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The signatures submitted Friday were collected by the anti-Bernhardt group 
after their first batch of petitions, turned in Oct. 9, left them nearly 3,000 
names short of the required 11,240-name figure, which represents 15% of the 
registered voters in Bernhardt's district. 
</P>
<P>
Under procedures governing recall elections, groups receive an additional 30 
days to gather names after the city clerk's office declares that not enough 
signatures have been collected. 
</P>
<P>
The quirk in local law that permits that so-called "supplemental" period is one 
point that Bernhardt has suggested might be challenged in court. The question 
of whether the recall election would be held in Bernhardt's current district or 
the new one created under a redistricting plan approved by a federal judge this 
month also could face a legal challenge, as could any foot-dragging by the 
council in scheduling the recall. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that sufficient signatures are verified, city laws specify that the 
City Council must schedule a recall election within 60 to 90 days after the 
issue is presented to the council for action, city election officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely timetable would produce a recall election between early next 
March and April, according to Assistant City Clerk Jack Fishkin. 
</P>
<P>
City officials doubt that the San Diego County registrar of voters' office will 
have time to verify the signatures by next Wednesday -- the deadline for 
placing items on the regular docket for the council's Dec. 11 meeting, its 
final session this year. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to reside in the proper district or ineligibility to vote often results 
in many signatures on such petitions being declared invalid. In addition, 
Bernhardt supporters collected about 800 names on "rescission" forms -- which 
also must be verified -- in which individuals ask that their names be removed 
from the pro-recall petitions. The recall leaders, however, estimate that the 
validity rate will surpass 60% on Friday's signatures, most of which were 
collected by paid workers who received $1.25 per name. 
</P>
<P>
If the council does not act next month, its next opportunity to deal with the 
issue would come at its Jan. 7 meeting, where the members' only discretion 
would be over the timing of the election itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some recall leaders, however, have expressed concern that the council's 
so-called "Gang of Five" -- the majority, which includes Bernhardt, that 
dominates the body on most major policy issues -- might seek to delay action or 
otherwise resist scheduling the election. 
</P>
<P>
But city lawyers and election officials view the potential for any such council 
recalcitrance to be, at best, a remote possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"That's about the worst worst-case scenario I can think of," said Assistant 
City Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick. "When you start imagining things like that, it 
gets a little bit too Machiavellian. I'd expect that, if the petition 
qualifies, the council will do what the law requires it to do." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, City Election Officer Mike Haas emphasized that, under city law, the 
council "doesn't appear to have the discretion not to call a recall" in cases 
where sufficient signatures are collected. At the same time, the council also 
must schedule a tandem race to determine Bernhardt's possible successor, which 
would appear on the same ballot as the recall. 
</P>
<P>
A simple majority vote would determine Bernhardt's political fate. If she 
received more than 50% of the vote, Bernhardt would retain her post, rendering 
the outcome of the companion election on possible successors moot. However, if 
Bernhardt were ousted, the candidate drawing the most votes in the other race 
-- in which Bernhardt cannot compete -- would serve the rest of the four-year 
term to which she was elected last November. 
</P>
<P>
The potential candidates mentioned to date include two former councilmen: Ed 
Struiksma, the two-term incumbent whom Bernhardt upset last November, and 
lawyer Floyd Morrow, who previously held the same seat. Other possible 
contenders include lawyer Mike Eckmann, who lost in last year's 5th District 
primary; lawyer Tom Behr; Mira Mesa activist Lucy Gonzalez and employment 
agency owner Mel Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Recall leaders have cited a number of factors as the impetus behind their 
effort. Prominent among those is their dissatisfaction with Bernhardt's 
approval of a controversial redistricting plan that would shift several 
high-growth neighborhoods from her district into another council district. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponents also have complained that, since her election, Bernhardt has 
accepted campaign contributions from developers after pledging not to do so in 
last year's campaign, and they fault her for hiring her roommate as her City 
Hall chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the recall effort "politics at its very worst," Bernhardt has argued 
throughout the petition-gathering period that the effort is being largely 
orchestrated by individuals who opposed her during last year's election. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want me last November so it's no surprise they don't want me now," 
Bernhardt said recently. "They can try to distort my record, but the fact is 
that . . . I've done what I said I was going to do -- manage growth, protect 
the environment and respond to neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $120,000 cost for a special election also might generate a 
backlash favoring her in an election, Bernhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Though recall leaders dispute that theory, they acknowledged Friday that, 
although they had once felt that their major hurdle would be simply qualifying 
the issue for the ballot, they now recognize that the election itself could be 
even more challenging. 
</P>
<P>
However, as they prepare for the next phase of their battle, they also are 
emboldened by their belief that voters in low-turnout elections -- as the 
recall likely would be, given that it would be the only race on the ballot -- 
tend to be motivated more by anger than satisfaction with the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a very tough fight -- we can't let our guard down now," 
Gaustad said. "Linda Bernhardt is fighting for her political career. I don't 
underestimate what she might do."

Some camping fees at Lake Casitas may be lowered Jan. 1 for families and 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District board gave initial approval to the new 
fees this week and set a public hearing for 1 p.m. Dec. 1 to consider their 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The basic $10 fee would remain the same for the first vehicle, but new fees for 
a second vehicle, a boat or family pet would be less for those staying 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
For example, instead of paying $10 per day for a second vehicle, campers would 
pay $6 per night. 
</P>
<P>
Reservation fees of $10 and $1.50 per person for youth organizations to camp at 
the lake would be eliminated. The camping reservation fee for adult groups 
would increase from $20 to$25. 
</P>
<P>
New recreational vehicle campsites with utility hookups will be available next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
They will have seasonal rates of $14 per space until May 1 and $16 from then 
until Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
The water district received a $238,000 grant this year from the state Parks and 
Recreation Department to develop the 52 hook-up sites, a picnic area and a 
200-foot fishing dock at Coyote Creek. The grant was awarded through bids under 
the 1988 California Wildlife, Coastal and Park Land Conservation Act. THIA BELL

Some kids' ideas are totally out in space. 
</P>
<P>
And that is just where they belong if the youngsters attend one of 10 
elementary school classes for gifted children in the Ventura Unified School 
District. As part of an architecture unit, the students are competing in teams 
to design the best living quarters for a space station. 
</P>
<P>
The project was created by Margaret Gosfield, district Gifted and Talented 
Education specialist, and John Spencer of Los Angeles, one of about a dozen 
space architects nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm interested in bringing space to Earth and making it more available, 
especially to children," Spencer said. "I want to excite kids about the future. 
This is one of the first times kids this young are involved with such a 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The students were challenged to design a comfortable living space where eight 
scientists could live for three months. Sleeping compartments, two bathrooms, a 
kitchen, eating nook, recreation center, medical area and exercise space all 
had to be included. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a bathtub with a zipper so water can't get out," said Erin Anderson, a 
third-grader at Loma Vista School, explaining a Styrofoam box with a cover. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Gallegos, a third-grader at Will Rogers School, had recycled a L'Eggs 
hosiery egg into a sleeping unit; others were using cardboard rolls from toilet 
paper for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Michael SooHoo, a Loma Vista fourth-grader, described how his shower works. 
"The water comes down and washes you and gets vacuumed down," he said, adding 
that the water will be filtered and reused. 
</P>
<P>
The children were carefully fitting these elements into five-gallon water jugs 
that had been sawed in half lengthwise. 
</P>
<P>
The designs showed that the youngsters understood their lessons about 
weightlessness and why astronauts don't need chairs or beds with mattresses and 
sheets in space, teacher Joanne Kaplan said. "It's been very challenging, 
because these concepts are hard to touch," she said. "We just do a lot of 
pretending." 
</P>
<P>
She and other GATE teachers were assisted by members of the Ventura County 
chapter of the American Institute of Architecture. "It was a challenge for us . 
. . to take our architectural language and put it into a form children can 
understand," said Al Okuma, an Oxnard architect. 
</P>
<P>
How successful the children, their teachers and advisers have been will be 
evaluated Wednesday by Spencer and his partner, Carlos Rocha. The winning team 
will receive a trophy that includes a piece from an actual space lab. CAROL

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Chula Vista banks were struck by two separate robbers, who made off with 
an unknown amount of money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers are suspected of committing four other Chula Vista bank robberies 
in the last two weeks, netting $5,969, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects attempted to rob the Bank of America at 801 3rd Street at 
12:53 p.m. Friday, but walked out of the building without any money, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He walked out probably figuring that the gal had set off the alarm," said Sgt. 
Richard Strickland. "He presented a note, got nervous and walked out." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, a stocky, 5-foot-6-inch Latino male weighing about 180 pounds and 
wearing sunglasses, then struck the Household Bank at 599 Telegraph Canyon Road 
at 1:09 p.m., making off with an unknown amount of cash, Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
The same suspect is thought to be responsible for two other Chula Vista bank 
robberies, on Nov. 16 and 21, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The other suspect, a 5-foot-10-inch white male weighing about 160 pounds, held 
up the Great American Bank in the 4200 block of Bonita Road at 9:28 a.m. 
Friday, Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe this suspect was involved in bank robberies Nov. 9 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
In none of the instances was a weapon seen, Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time since we've had two bank series going on at the same 
time," Strickland said. "It's very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Strickland said the two suspects have so far confined themselves to robbing 
banks in Chula Vista.

MANAGER SOUGHT FOR CAMPGROUND

The U.S. Forest Service is looking for a company or individual to manage its 
72-unit campground in Wheeler Gorge next year. 
</P>
<P>
The service will accept bids at its Ojai office until 2 p.m. Dec. 14 and 
expects the operator to begin work in early January, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
California Land Management, a Palo Alto-based company, has been running the 
campground for more than two years, but its contract expires at the end of the 
year, said Al Hess, the Ojai district's recreation officer. 
</P>
<P>
The government, which is not anticipating more than a few bids, will select an 
operator based, in part, on the percentage of fee receipts the concessionaire 
can return to the government, said Ed Gornowski, assistant recreation officer 
for Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
It costs $8 per person per day to stay at the campground. 
</P>
<P>
A person or company with experience in campground management and people skills 
is preferred. 
</P>
<P>
An operator's maintenance responsibilities include providing a trailer or house 
for the caretaker and keeping toilets and picnic areas clean. 
</P>
<P>
"It's -- I'd say -- rustic living," Gornowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-acre Wheeler Gorge is the second-largest campground in the Los Padres 
National Forest and one of only about seven in the northern half of Ventura 
County, Gornowski said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

ROBERTI AND NOLAN ARE BIG SPENDERS IN THE OFFICE;

LEGISLATURE: EXPENSE REPORTS SHOW ASSEMBLYMAN BANE SPENT ALMOST $40,000 ON 
POSTAGE, BUT OVERALL HE WAS THRIFTY.

<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bane could be considered one of the U.S. Postal Service's best 
friends in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Based on recent reports for a variety of legislative office expenses, the 
Tarzana Democrat in 1989 spent nearly $40,000 in taxpayer funds, one of the top 
expenditures in the Assembly for postage. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my postage is high . . .but my other expenses are not," said Bane, 
whose overall office tab of $225,758 ranked him as the Assembly's second-most 
thrifty member. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly's overall No. 1 spender in office expenses was Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier) with $322,380. The average for the Assembly was almost $275,000. 
In the Senate, Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) spent the most, running up a tab 
of $626,286. The Senate average was $477,003. 
</P>
<P>
Among San Fernando Valley-area lawmakers, the top spender in the Assembly was 
Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), with expenses of $306,596, while in the Senate, David 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) topped the list at $575,037. Nolan could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Forsythe, Roberti's spokesman, cited Roberti's position as president pro 
tem of the Senate -- the top leadership job in the upper chamber -- as a major 
reason for his higher expenses. "The demands of him as leader go beyond just 
serving the 23rd Senate District," Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
The expense reports cover about 20 categories, including staff salaries, 
travel, cars, district office expenses, postage, telephones, furniture, 
equipment, supplies, subscriptions and photocopying. It generally costs more to 
run a Senate office than an Assembly office because senators represent larger 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the expenses is for employee salaries and benefits, 
according to the reports prepared annually by the Assembly and Senate rules 
committees. The latest reports cover Dec. 1, 1988, through Nov. 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Berg, Senate Rules Committee executive officer, said many factors 
influence the bottom line of a legislator's expenses. For example, office rents 
in Newport Beach are considerably higher than rents in South-Central Los 
Angeles. Also, he said some lawmakers who represent several counties are 
allocated more staff or may need to rent multiple district offices. 
</P>
<P>
Other Valley-area highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), the Assembly's top spender in 
1988 with $332,552, reduced his expenses to $277,719. "I was as frugal as 
possible," Friedman said, noting that one reason for his No. 1 spot in 1988 was 
that some expenses from 1987 were not paid by the state controller's office 
until 1988. Friedman's district includes Studio City, Encino and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
* Telephone bills for Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar) were higher than their Valley colleagues'. Robbins reported 
$35,144 for his office calls. Katz listed $25,349, followed among Valley 
Assembly members by Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) at $22,395. 
</P>
<P>
Aide Teri Burns said Robbins' staff responds to many constituents via the 
telephone and returns calls from people throughout the state seeking to discuss 
issues related to Robbins' chairmanship of the Senate Insurance Claims and 
Corporations Committee or membership on the annual Budget Conference Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, cited his role in 
formulating statewide transportation measures as one reason for his telephone 
bill. Katz also said an increasing amount of telephone time is used to telecopy 
documents around the state. "Phone and Fax is the way a lot of business is done 
these days," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
* Retiring Assemblywoman Marian W. LaFollette (R-Northridge) was among the 
Assembly's top spenders, running up a tab of $305,581. The assemblywoman could 
not be reached for comment, but an aide, Rob Wilcox, cited several reasons 
including the size of her district which stretches from Mt. Wilson to Malibu 
Canyon and staff duties for a task force studying the breakup of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox contended that the accounting system was designed to hide the true 
number of staffers employed by Democrats in the Assembly who control committee 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilcox: "Often these staff members who are hired for a job for a committee 
often don't handle any committee business." The expense totals, in fact, do not 
reflect staff and other costs associated with committee assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Said one Democratic staffer, who asked not to be identified: "If someone has a 
major committee chairmanship, expenses are defrayed into the committees." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Connelly, chief administrative officer of the Assembly Rules 
Committee, dismissed the criticism as partisan, saying GOP lawmakers are upset 
because some of them "have spent a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Connelly defended the system, saying that the 20 or so categories listed "are 
the same for all 80 members." He pointed out, for instance, that while Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown's office expenses were listed as $269,392, the expense 
report also showed that the San Francisco Democrat spent another $2 million to 
run the speaker's office. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Assembly member expenses increased about 4%, Connelly said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Berg said member spending dipped 2% in the legislative year that 
began in December 1988 and ran until through last November. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just not been spending money, conscious of the public's concern," Berg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, cutbacks are expected to be much deeper because passage earlier this 
month of Proposition 140 is expected to force an almost 50% reduction in the 
Legislature's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
Bane, chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, which is expected to weigh how 
to make the cuts, said one way to reduce costs would be to eliminate committee 
hearings when the Legislature is not in session. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility, he suggested, is to shut down district offices. In fact, 
Bane said he believes so much in his constituent mail program that he would 
"rather eliminate my district office" than his correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
Bane estimated that a large part of his postage stamp bill paid for letters to 
people in his district. "I've always been a great believer in communication 
between elected officials and constituents. The cheapest way to do that is 
through the mail," said Bane. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1988, voters approved Proposition 73, which included a prohibition on 
lawmakers sending out mass mailings at taxpayer expense. Under prevailing 
interpretations of the law, legislators cannot send "substantially similar" 
letters to 200 or more people. 
</P>
<P>
That has forced lawmakers to be more creative in the way they communicate with 
constituents. Bane -- in a practice followed by a number of lawmakers -- said 
most of his computerized letters are sent in batches of fewer than 200, which 
does not violate the mass mailing ban. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Bane's letters have touched on a wide variety of subjects, 
including alcohol and drug problems, and obscure legislation to require 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be surprised if there were any constituents in my district who didn't get 
a communication from me of this kind," Bane said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFICE EXPENSES FOR VALLEY LEGISLATORS 
</P>
<P>
Office-related expenses reported by the Legislature's 120 members recently were 
released for the 1989 session. Included in the reports are staff salaries, as 
well as spending on such items as postage and telephones. In the Senate, Dan 
McCorquodale (D-San Jose) was the top spender at $626,286. In the Assembly, 
Frank Hill (R-Whittier) topped the field, having spent $322,380. The following 
is a sampling of spending by Valley-area lawmakers.

<P>
Thousand Oaks City Council members will say goodby to two council members at a 
special ceremony Tuesday at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Four-term Councilman Lawrence E. Horner and one-term Councilman Tony Lamb will 
turn their seats over to newly elected Councilwomen Judy Lazar and Elois 
Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the council included a woman was in 1986, when Madge L. Schaefer 
was elected to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to welcoming the new councilwomen, members will choose a new mayor 
and mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Alex Fiore, the top vote-getter in his reelection bid, will step down and 
a new mayor will be named by the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Frank Schillo is expected to be named to the one-year position. 
Schillo, 56, served as mayor in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Horner said he was not saddened that his 16-year tenure on the council is 
ending. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to devote most of his time to work and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
He is a vice president at Northrop Corp., which recently announced plans to 
close its plant in Newbury Park at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb, a retired inventor, did not seek reelection. PSYCHE PASCUAL

HARPER CONTINUES SLOW-GROWTH PUSH; 
</P>
<P>
MOORPARK: THE FORMER COUNCILMAN, WHO LOST HIS BID FOR MAYOR EARLIER THIS MONTH, 
CONTENDS HE MAY LAUNCH HIS OWN CAMPAIGN FOR A CITY ORDINANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he lost his bid for mayor in this month's election, former Moorpark 
City Councilman Clint Harper is not giving up his fight to slow growth in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who was soundly defeated by fellow council member Paul Lawrason in the 
Nov. 6 election, said if the council does not approve putting a proposed 
"comprehensive planning ordinance" on the ballot in March or June then he might 
wage his own campaign to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, proposed by Harper while he served on the council, would give 
residents the opportunity to vote on major developments that would require the 
city to amend its General Plan, the blueprint for future development in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, in an interview Friday, said Moorpark voters should be the ones who 
determine the city's future growth and not the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents are more conservative on land-use issues than politicians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said he plans to talk to local activist Bob Crockford about the 
possibility of putting together a campaign to place the measure on the ballot. 
The two were successful in getting Measure F, the city's current slow-growth 
ordinance, before voters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Crockford said he would be willing to work with Harper again. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are going to be major changes in the General Plan, then people should 
be allowed to vote on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Controlling growth was at the center of Harper's aggressive campaign against 
Lawrason, whom he continually attacked for accepting developer contributions. 
Harper said accepting money from builders would only influence Lawrason's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrason has dismissed Harper's accusations, saying that the developer 
contributions meant little except that he had a broad range of support in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely oppose rapid, out-of-control growth," Lawrason said. "My approach 
has always been one of moderation. I have no intention of changing anything 
along those lines." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrason said he will continue to vigorously support Measure F, but opposes the 
concept of a comprehensive planning ordinance. He said voters elect public 
officials to make planning decisions for them, and that if they don't agree 
with those decisions they can vote the officials out of office. 
</P>
<P>
Harper disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time it took to recall a council member, a lot of changes could have 
already been made to the General Plan," he said. "By then, the damage is 
already done." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has not completely ruled it out, Harper said it is doubtful he will 
run for the council seat that became available with the election of Lawrason as 
mayor. Lawrason's council position expires in two years. The council, which had 
the option of appointing an interim member to the panel, voted this week to 
wait until a special election March 5 to fill the vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally would love to do it," but his family is opposed to it, Harper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said the fifth seat will be the swing vote on future 
development issues, including the comprehensive planning ordinance that is now 
being studied by city staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bernardo Perez, who supports the proposed ordinance, agreed with 
Harper that as it stands now the council is split on whether to place the 
measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't run myself, I certainly would do whatever I can to elect someone 
to the council with philosophies similar to my own," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a physics professor at Moorpark College, said he and his family moved 
to Moorpark from Van Nuys in 1977 to escape the rapidly developing San Fernando 
Valley. At that time Moorpark had a population of about 4,000. It has since 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said since Moorpark incorporated in 1983, the city has lost some of its 
rural atmosphere but that "it hasn't taken that last step toward urban sprawl." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, he said he will continue to speak out on growth and 
environmental issues. "I don't have plans to fade into the sunset," he said.

WATER COMPANY TO RAISE RATES BY 5% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern California Water Co. has won approval to increase rates in the 
Simi Valley District by 5%, beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The state Public Utilities Commission this week authorized the rate increase 
for the company, which serves about 12,000 residents in and near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, customers will have to pay about $1.26 more each month, company 
officials said. The typical customer now pays $24.54 for 2,170 cubic feet of 
water a month. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the rates were increased to pay for the rising cost of 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
The city's other water purveyor, Calleguas Municipal Water District, serves 
most of the city's 100,000 residents. CARLOS V. LOZANO

AREA GROWTH AND TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Election results are now in and it appears that Prop. C won by a razor-thin 
margin of 14,502 votes. As a result, 8.5 million Los Angeles County residents 
are now faced with a one-half cent sales tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Think about it. A small percentage of the county's population is forcing the 
rest of us to live with the burden of higher taxes to pay for a transit system 
that is doomed to fail. Prop. C won, not because of a reasoned debate on the 
merits of rail, but because of heavy campaign contributions from the railroads. 
They stood to gain most from the sale of their white elephant right-of-ways to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. C is absurd, since the county still has $370 million waiting to be spent. 
Not one single major transportation improvement has been completed with the 
money from the 1980 Prop. A vote, with the exception of the Long Beach rail 
line, which cost $800 million more than projected. Metro Rail's overruns have 
climbed to $538 million without moving one passenger! All of this would be 
understandable if rail was a viable solution to our traffic problems. But rail 
only diverts patronage from existing RTD buses. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to solve our traffic problems is to deal with the underlying cause 
-- out-of-control growth. In the downtown area alone, more than 55 million 
square feet of new construction will be built in the next three years. The real 
culprits are the Los Angeles City Council, CRA, Mayor Tom Bradley and the 
County Board of Supervisors, none of whom seem to be able to understand that 
overdevelopment creates traffic. 
</P>
<P>
What we need are tough limits on growth and development, and an honest 
admission of the cause of our problems.

VETERAN'S SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks very much to staff writer Greg Krikorian for his wonderfully written and 
very moving Veterans Day story (Metro, Nov. 12) on Wallace Perry, a World War 
II veteran who journeyed to Belgium on behalf of a woman he barely knew to find 
the grave of her father who had been killed in battle back in 1944, and to lay 
a medal on the grave site. 
</P>
<P>
It really was frustrating to hear that Perry was unable to locate the woman 
upon his return to tell her of his success. That made the follow-up article 
(Nov. 16) all the more satisfying to find out that the woman had indeed been 
found, and that she was thrilled and touched.

THE DIFFICULT MATTER OF GIL LINDSAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council is set to ease out their veteran colleague, 
Gilbert Lindsay, who can no longer serve the residents of the 9th District. 
Councilman Lindsay is paralyzed and unable to speak. 
</P>
<P>
It has become a pressing matter of compassion, and necessity, to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Because the City Charter makes no provision for the removal of incapacitated 
members, the council must take a roundabout method to get Lindsay out of 
office. The charter does allow the removal of a member who is absent from the 
city for 60 unexcused days. Lindsay is technically out of the city because he 
is in an Inglewood hospital. If he remains there through the first of next 
year, the council should remove him. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, the first black member to serve on the council, was appointed in 1963. 
During his tenure, he has aided greatly in the commercial rebirth of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
During the years, however, he has paid less attention to his own back yard. 
There has been scarce redevelopment in the poor and working-class neighborhoods 
that stretch south from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th District needs more jobs, major stores and banks, affordable housing 
and services for the older black population and the younger, Latino families. 
Gangs, drugs and other crime also plague much of the district. These problems 
require the attention of a strong advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Lindsay, who will turn 90 next week, can no longer provide adequate 
representation. The council's move to provide new vigorous leadership is 
appropriate.

MAN HELD IN ATTEMPTED RAPE, ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man attempted to rape a woman Friday at Torrey Pines State Beach and then 
held police at bay for several hours while threatening to commit suicide, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two joggers shortly before noon found a man armed with a 6-inch hunting knife 
on top of a woman on the beach, apparently attempting to rape her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The joggers frightened the man and chased him into a canyon near the north end 
of Torrey Pines Golf Course, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the man, who identified himself only as Frank, hiding in the 
bushes of the canyon and attempted to negotiate with him to surrender. Police 
twice shot the man with a Taser gun, with little effect, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man threatened to commit suicide several times and threatened police with 
the knife before surrendering at 4:40 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was turned over to the state police on suspicion of attempted rape, 
assault with a deadly weapon and displaying a weapon in a deadly manner, San 
Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman escaped serious injury.

SEN. CRANSTON AND ETHICS HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The front-page photo of Sen. Alan Cranston taking the oath at the Senate Ethics 
Committee hearing was mesmerizing ("Cranston's Deeds, Keating's Money Linked, 
Panel Told," Nov. 17). At first it made me sad for all of us; I had always 
believed the man fought for good causes against big-moneyed interests. 
</P>
<P>
His fate in history is now no more honorable than former Washington Mayor 
Marion Barry's. Is there a concerted effort to discredit left-of-center 
politicians? 
</P>
<P>
Or is it that Americans just don't care any more? Politicians with "vision" 
always seem to get killed like the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr., or 
discredited like Gary Hart. Culturally we're reduced to giving Grammys to the 
largest album sellers whether they actually sing on their albums or not. Should 
we be surprised that young people admire gangsters who drive expensive cars and 
wear flashy jewelry? What role models are there for people of conscience? Those 
phony Bible-thumpers on TV?

COMPARING CIGARETTES AND OTHER DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to the individuals your paper interviewed during the 
smokeout. I became an ex-smoker as of March 27. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to that date, I smoked up to three packs a day for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
The last months of my smoking cigarettes were the worst time of my life. I 
literally lived to smoke. Day after day, I would get up out of bed and light 
one up, sometimes as many as two or three in a row. When I would get ready for 
work, or even while driving to the job, I would smoke up to half a pack. When I 
got to the office, the first thing I would do is light up again. During my 
breaks and lunches, I would smoke an entire pack. The cravings were as insane 
as my desire to buy up to four cartons of cigarettes a week. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the last two weeks of this past March, I felt a slight pain on my 
lower right side of my chest. I knew that this could only be the beginning of a 
respiratory ailment like emphysema, lung cancer or some other disease. I was 
later told that I was suffering from loss of circulation. 
</P>
<P>
I made a decision that day; I prayed to God and asked him for help. I haven't 
had a smoke nor a desire for one since that day passed. Don't get me wrong; I 
suffered withdrawal for almost two months. But I accepted my pains knowing that 
in the long run I would live longer and healthier.

DEBATE OVER U.S. POLICY IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of your correspondents (letters, Nov. 15) criticize British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher for her reference to "stern military action in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
One of them says, "the lives that will be lost will not be English lives, but 
the lives of young Americans." This is not necessarily so. The second largest 
military contingent in the area is the British one.

DEBATE OVER U.S. POLICY IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How could our Administration have been so stupid? It's obvious now that the 
Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Council of Churches have seen 
fit to enlighten us. 
</P>
<P>
All that would have been required last August would have been for these highly 
principled bodies to have passed their resolutions deploring the Iraqi conduct 
and forwarded these to Hussein. Think of all the problems and costs this would 
have saved us, since no doubt, immediately upon receiving his copies of these 
resolutions, Hussein would have seen the error of his ways, withdrawn his 
troops and apologized to the Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
May the good Lord protect us from his benighted servants!

AROUND THE VALLEY: ROLLING IN GREEN FOR A GOOD CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Tosches , Rich Tosches is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Get your T-shirts. Step right up and get your golf hats and visors. Get 'em 
while they last. Get your golf towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Get your $330 cashmere sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Get outta here! 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who thinks $330 is a bit much for a sweater would have felt very 
uncomfortable at last weekend's Ronald McDonald Children's Charities golf 
tournament at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, very few such lowlifes were allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
Those few were called employees. Or sports writers. 
</P>
<P>
The very ordinary-looking $330 sweaters hung limply at the back of the tent. 
They were the same shade of off-white as the background color of American 
currency. Surely a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
Were any sold? 
</P>
<P>
No, a saleswoman said, "but we have had several inquiries." 
</P>
<P>
Inquiries? About a sweater? 
</P>
<P>
 What would you ask? 
</P>
<P>
How many sleeves? Is financing available? 
</P>
<P>
When would escrow close? 
</P>
<P>
The sweater was symbolic of the country club, which cost $300 million to build 
and costs $150,000 to join and claims to have a waiting list of more than 2,500 
people -- several hundred just from the San Fernando Valley -- for the 300 
available spots. Among those already installed as members are George Bush, 
Ronald Reagan, Wayne Gretzky, O.J. Simpson, Japanese home run hero Sudaharu Oh 
and Tom Selleck. 
</P>
<P>
The sweater was also symbolic of the tournament, which is by strict design an 
event for the wealthy, though with a socially redeeming bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Want to watch Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Greg Norman and some of the other 
top names in the game play a few rounds of golf? 
</P>
<P>
It would have cost you $200. Pretty steep for a golf tournament, which 
generally carries an admission price of $10 or $12. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, for just another $130, you could buy a sweater. 
</P>
<P>
And even if you were a golf fanatic and stumbled upon an extra $200 in the 
weeks before the tournament, you'd probably still have been out of luck, 
because the tournament organizers halted ticket sales at 5,000. Tickets have 
sold out in both years of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it sounds like a lot of money, but it really isn't anymore," said Joyce 
Greiner, 48, who traveled from Rancho Mirage to watch the event. "Where else 
can you see this many of the real great golfers, and get so close to them 
because there aren't big crowds? 
</P>
<P>
"And $200, well, you can't even buy a dress for that money anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
Those who got in, you may have guessed, were unlikely to discuss bowling 
averages or changing their own engine oil. 
</P>
<P>
There were, for example, a lot of beepers. Several hundred by a very 
unscientific count. If everyone present were somehow paged at exactly the same 
moment, the conjoined thunder-beep might have shattered the windows of 
Sherwood's $25-million colonial clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it rich people, or is it Memorex? 
</P>
<P>
 David Myner, 56, of Simi Valley attended the tournament for the second year. 
Many of his friends, he said, were also there. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend $200 on a lot less important things than this," said Myner, an avid 
golfer who said he plays at least twice a week and has attended the last nine 
Los Angeles Open tournaments at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"When you really love golf and you get a chance to see these guys at a place 
like this, you have to grab it. I don't make enough money that $200 isn't a lot 
of money. It is. But so what? It won't kill me." 
</P>
<P>
It would, however, have caused a serious wound to Bob Wright, 39, of Reseda. He 
would have loved to have been among the spectators padding about in leather 
sneakers on Sherwood's carpetlike grass. Instead, he watched on TV, padding 
about in his living room on his even more carpetlike carpet. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go last year, but really couldn't even think about doing it," said 
Wright, an electrician's apprentice who plays frequently at the less-than-posh 
Van Nuys Golf Course. "I mean, $200 is pretty ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm single, and I think if I had the money I might have thought about blowing 
it on a ticket when they were available during the summer. But I didn't even 
have that kind of money then." 
</P>
<P>
There is no plan to change any part of the tournament, according to tournament 
host Greg Norman. The 54-hole tournament will return to Sherwood next year, and 
the ticket policy remains. 
</P>
<P>
"It is all going very well," said Norman, the Australian who topped the PGA 
Tour's money list in 1990 with $1,165,477 in earnings. "The players are happy, 
the fans are happy and the sponsors are happy. 
</P>
<P>
"And all of it couldn't be for a better cause." 
</P>
<P>
And that's the reason the tournament, with all its overflowing opulence, will 
-- and should -- continue. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath all the glistening chandeliers and inside all the $330 sweaters and 
underneath all the face lifts and hair weaves is this: 
</P>
<P>
The event has raised more than $2 million for several charities, the largest 
being the 130 Ronald McDonald Houses, homes where the families of 
cancer-stricken children can reside while the young patients fight for their 
lives in nearby cancer hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
And still, too often, the homes where families say a last goodby, where the 
hearts of mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters are forever broken. 
</P>
<P>
For cushioning that wrench, hail to the rich people. 
</P>
<P>
For a change.

CUSTODIANS OF THE TRUE HOLIDAY SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it opened 20 months ago, the Episcopal Service Alliance Center for the 
homeless, located in the midst of retail stores in Laguna Beach, was threatened 
with being set ablaze and was later vandalized. Three months ago, the center 
announced that it would close for lack of support. Today, it is on its feet, 
thanks to an anonymous donation and help from the community. 
</P>
<P>
In Corona del Mar, volunteers at a program run by St. Michael and All Angels 
Episcopal Church have been offering shelter to help homeless people gear up for 
winter, to find job leads and counseling. The program, run almost entirely by 
volunteers, has recently joined the Orange County Interfaith Housing Shelter 
Network, which enlists churches and synagogues as shelters. 
</P>
<P>
As the holiday period unfolds for the more fortunate among us, important 
grass-roots organizations such as these are working to help those down on their 
luck in Orange County. To assist people in getting back on their feet, the 
programs provide various services, including employment aid, food, clothes, 
transportation and referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the bustle and preoccupations of the holiday season, these organizations 
can be overlooked. But we should remember that they are custodians of the true 
holiday spirit. They deserve support and encouragement.

LASER SYSTEM BENEFITS ARGUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN DOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $21,000 laser system designed to beam programs from Pierce College's Media 
Center to specified classrooms on campus has been criticized by many 
instructors, and the school's newspaper, the Roundup, has reported that the 
system may not work. 
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to transmit 40 channels, 40,000 microbits of computer 
data and 40,000 telephone lines, as well as simultaneously send 12 separate 
signals from the Media Center to different campus locations. 
</P>
<P>
The laser project was initiated about a year ago by Cathy Cameron, dean of 
academic affairs. It has the backing of campus officials such as Dan Love, 
acting vice president of administration. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the $21,000 for the program was appropriated at a time when the 
college had to cut $1.7 million from its budget. 
</P>
<P>
William deRubertis, chairman of the political science and economics 
departments, said the pictures transmitted by the laser are inadequate for 
viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Meyer, an earth science professor, said the system "isn't practical and 
it wasn't thought out." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said showing a film on a videocassette recorder in class is better than 
the laser system because the teacher can start and stop a video tape at will. 
Because there is no communication between any classroom and the Media Center, 
this would not be possible if the tape was being played there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not pay to install a television in every room," he said. "They should 
just give a few televisions and VCRs to each department, which would allow 
teachers to play tapes without having to go through the Media Center." 
</P>
<P>
The system also was designed to transmit live satellite pictures to a 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what the odds are of having a live broadcast scheduled the same 
time as a class? I hope that not another dollar is spent on it," Robert 
Zappala, an astronomy professor, said. 
</P>
<P>
According to an article in the Roundup Oct. 24, Cameron and two other key 
people involved in the project disagree on whether the system works. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kopas, Media Center director, said that the system does not work. Cameron 
said she is not sure if it works. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Schick of Canyon Cable, the contractor for the project, said he 
believes the system works. 
</P>
<P>
Love agreed to demonstrate the system for the newspaper, but despite several 
requests has not yet done so. DAN DOW

FUNDS SOUGHT FOR BETTER LIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DORA ROMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Associated Student Union at Valley College has started a drive to raise 
funds to improve night lighting on the Van Nuys campus because of safety 
concerns voiced by both students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
There also had been complaints about poor night lighting in previous semesters, 
student leaders said, but little was done about it. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, an ASU survey determined that more than 50 outside lights were 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
The administration replaced some, but not all, of these lights, ASU leaders 
said. New lighting packs were installed on the outside walls of the bungalows 
on the south and southeast portions of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, about 40 ASU students and teachers held a candlelight vigil to 
discuss what could be done. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get the whole student body aware that we want to do something 
about the problem," said ASU president Alaine Jelsyik. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the vigil, Jelsyik said, the ASU is seeking donations from 
various businesses to repair the broken lights and to change all lights from 
opaque glass to a brighter, clear glass. 
</P>
<P>
"After a year of nothing being done, we needed to start a project for better 
lighting and the safety of all students," said Shoshana Blum, student 
commissioner of handicap awareness. 
</P>
<P>
A campus fund-raiser to collect money to replace and repair light bulbs also is 
under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, members of Night Watch, an Administration of Justice Club project, 
are escorting students to their cars at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to drop my night class because of the fear I had, walking alone 
after class," said student Yvonne Rodriguez. DORA ROMAN

ON CAMPUS: COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS; 
</P>
<P>
CAFETERIA STOPS PLASTIC FOAM USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACI D. ANTRAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students concerned about the environment on the College of the Canyons campus 
in the Santa Clarita Valley have persuaded the privately run school cafeteria 
to halt the use of plastic foam. 
</P>
<P>
Cafeteria manager Pedro Dalmau said that the change to biodegradable paper 
products took place earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the campus chemistry club recently researched environmental problems 
that can be caused by lightweight, cellular polystyrene that does not readily 
decompose in landfills. Club members then wrote to the Santa Clarita Valley 
Community College District Board of Trustees expressing their concerns. 
However, the board had not as yet addressed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than waiting to be asked, the cafeteria was gracious enough to 
volunteer to make the change," club president Christopher A. Drap said. 
</P>
<P>
In their letter to the board, club members wrote, "We feel very strongly about 
the environment and want to do what we can to protect it . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The letter cited the effects plastic foam has on the atmosphere and used Cal 
State Northridge's recent switch to paper and plastic plates, bowls and cups as 
an example worth following. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts last year to convince officials to make the change apparently fell 
through because of lack of support, Drap said. This year's success may have 
been because of a group effort rather than an effort by individuals last year, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very exciting to know that we can do something like this," Drap said. 
"It is very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
Dalmau said that the cafeteria, operated by Nature's Harvest, was ready to make 
the switch after ideas were thrown around last year. "Maybe other colleges will 
change to follow the example," he said. JACI D. ANTRAM

What's red and black and green all over? 
</P>
<P>
This year's San Diego State basketball team, which will fill their new red and 
black uniforms with enthusiasm, youth and inexperience. The Aztecs open their 
season today at No. 5 North Carolina (4:30 p.m. PST, no local radio or 
television), and, by the time it's over, they could be Carolina blue as well. 
</P>
<P>
The waiting has become as tiresome as the five weeks of practice. SDSU has had 
good days, bad days and long days. Finally, it is Game Day -- and the schedule 
is telling them to grow up. In a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a challenge," Coach Jim Brandenburg said. "I think 
it's going to be a heck of an experience for our guys. Whether it's a good 
experience or a bad experience will depend on our attitude going in." 
</P>
<P>
The old schoolyard saying is that it's not whether you win or lose, but how you 
play the game. Just this once, as the Aztecs suit up in the Smith Center -- 
affectionately called the "Dean Dome" -- that may be true. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't show intimidation, if we play hard and smart, I think it will 
really be a plus for this basketball team," Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
There are six newcomers plus three players who redshirted last season joining 
the SDSU mix. How green are the Aztecs? Well, during a stop in play in Monday's 
exhibition game, one of the Aztecs got up, peeled off his warmup jacket and 
started to enter the game. He got about five steps onto the court before he 
heard Brandenburg. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to check in," Brandenburg hollered, pointing at the scorer's table. 
</P>
<P>
So, before the Aztecs left for North Carolina Thursday, Brandenburg mustered up 
his best "Hoosiers" speech after Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I (told) the guys they have worked all of their life to play in front of large 
crowds against great national competition," Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he turned philosophical -- on the subject of noise. 
</P>
<P>
"At North Carolina, there will be a lot of noise," he said. "Who is to say what 
is good noise and bad noise? Noise is noise, whether it's in the (San Diego) 
Sports Arena or in the Dean Dome. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is make sure the crowd noise drives us rather than 
intimidates us." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, SDSU will look to veterans Marty Dow, Arthur Massey and Vern 
Thompson for leadership. Dow, a 7-foot-1 senior center, was developing into one 
of the Western Athletic Conference's better big men last year before a torn 
tendon in his foot ended his season. Massey is a senior point guard who has 
displayed leadership potential in practice this fall. And Thompson is a 6-6 
senior forward who started 20 of 31 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (21-13 last year) is coming off its first season with 
double-digit losses since 1965-66. But Coach Dean Smith put together the 
nation's top-ranked recruiting class, and the Tar Heels were picked by Atlantic 
Coast Conference coaches to win the league. Three starters return from last 
year's team -- guard King Rice (9.2 points, 6.4 assists per game), forward Pete 
Chilcutt (9 points, 6.6 rebounds a game) and swingman Rick Fox (16.2 points, 
43.8% three-point accuracy). 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard in the Dean Dome, but I think if we don't blank out 
because we're playing at North Carolina, we can compete real well," Massey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brandenburg: "These games can do so much for us as far as things it's 
going to take to be successful. We are the sum of our experiences. When you 
have these experiences, if you handle them correctly, they can make us better 
people and better basketball players. This can make us a better basketball 
team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the only time these two teams have played, North Carolina defeated SDSU, 
103-92, in front of a sold-out crowd at San Diego Sports Arena in 1988.

This game is not for the Western Athletic Conference championship or a bid to 
the Independence Bowl. It does not come wrapped in hopes and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
This one is about pride. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State plays host to Texas El Paso at 7:05 tonight in San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium after a roller-coaster season and a heady week of bowl talk. The 
Aztecs (5-4, 4-2 in the WAC), in the running for the Independence Bowl until a 
Maryland-Louisiana Tech matchup was announced Wednesday, will try not to look 
ahead to next week's nationally televised game with No. 2 Miami as they finish 
WAC play with two goals in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clinching a winning record, which would give them two consecutive winning 
seasons for the first time since 1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finishing in a second-place tie in the WAC. This will happen if the Aztecs 
win tonight and Colorado State loses at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
After starting 2-4 overall and 1-2 in the WAC, accomplishing these tasks would 
be cause enough for the Aztecs to break into Handel's hallelujah chorus rather 
than the school fight song. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of very positive things could happen with a win (today)," Coach Al 
Luginbill said. "No. 1, we'll finish 5-2 (in the WAC) and improve our 
conference standing. And we have the opportunity, if Hawaii beats Colorado 
State, to tie for second place. 
</P>
<P>
"From where we were five weeks ago, that's a tremendous accomplishment. Having 
a winning season is enough to play for -- at least for me," he said. "This game 
will establish ourselves as a team to be contended with each year." 
</P>
<P>
The only problem is, the Aztecs aren't sure exactly what they will face. 
</P>
<P>
"They've changed everything (from game to game) this year, from a run-and-shoot 
offense to a throw-it-up-50-times-a-ballgame," Luginbill said. "I don't know 
which offense we're going to face Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
This is the final game for UTEP (3-7, 1-6), which will be playing to avoid the 
cellar. The Miners are tied with New Mexico (1-6) for last-place in the WAC. 
New Mexico's season is over. 
</P>
<P>
But here's the catch: UTEP quarterback Howard Gasser is back from a knee injury 
suffered in the season opener against Brigham Young. He made his second start 
of the season last week against Air Force and although the Miners lost, 14-13, 
Gasser completed 32 of 48 passes for 364 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sort of like New Mexico," SDSU defensive end Pio Sagapolutele said. 
"They're big up front. They're good run blockers, but their pass (blocking) is 
kind of doubtful. We'll be going into this game blitzing more." 
</P>
<P>
Also back is receiver Reggie Barrett, who has missed time this season with an 
assortment of nagging injuries. Barrett still leads the team with 35 receptions 
for 593 yards and three touchdowns, and he is one of the WAC's all-time leading 
receivers. He is 15th on the all-time WAC list with 145 receptions and 10th 
with 2,441 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It took until the end of the season for us to feel very good about ourselves," 
UTEP Coach David Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Gasser and Barrett will pump some life into the UTEP offense, ranked 100th in 
the nation in scoring (16 points a game). Of course, they will be going against 
SDSU's defense, ranked 100th (463 yards and 36 points a game). 
</P>
<P>
UTEP is more concerned with its offense than SDSU's defense, though. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're 100th in the nation in scoring offense, everybody you line up 
against looks like the New York Giants," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Giants? The shadow SDSU quarterback Dan McGwire (6-foot-8) casts over opposing 
defenses continues to get bigger. He passed for a career-high 530 yards and two 
touchdowns last week against New Mexico, and he seems to get better each week. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been awesome," Lee said. "He stands up and throws the ball right over the 
top of people. He's got the easiest, smoothest delivery I've ever seen. He's 
got great touch. He's a great prospect. He's a pro quarterback playing behind a 
very good offensive line. And gosh darn, (Dennis) Arey and (Patrick) Rowe are 
fantastic. . . . You've gotta be perfect on every down to stop these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe is ranked first in the nation with 125.44 yards receiving per game, and 
Arey, at 101.33, is fourth. Rowe has 1,129 yards receiving this season, and 
Arey, at 915, is 85 yards from the 1,000-yard mark. SDSU likely will become 
only the second team in NCAA history with two receivers over 1,000 yards in a 
season. The first was Houston in 1988, when James Dixon and Jason Phillips both 
surpassed the 1,000-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
This all adds up to an average of 41 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to fight and play hard this year as we have all week," Lee 
said. "It's our last one. We're coming to the coast where the girls don't wear 
a lot of clothes and they're all suntanned and bronze. We have a lot of young 
kids, and I'm concerned about that. I don't want a blowout ending this season 
going into next season." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of only 18,000 is expected. . . . Injury update: SDSU reports no 
serious injuries. For UTEP, fullback Kevin Bogan (knee) is out. Redshirt 
freshman Patrick Bailey will start in his place. Bailey has played in two games 
this season, gaining 48 yards on 16 attempts . . . Any chance the Aztecs will 
be looking past UTEP toward Miami next Saturday? "There is so much riding on 
this game, I would hope we're past that," SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said. . . . 
SDSU won at UTEP last year, 34-31. Quarterback Dan McGwire passed for 282 yards 
in that game but threw a career-high six interceptions.

VALENCIA CUTS LA QUINTA OFF AT PASS

Ken Lee, Valencia High School linebacker, insisted he was merely in the right 
place at the right time Friday night when he intercepted two passes within 35 
seconds of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one came right out of the blue," Lee said. "The ball hit me in the 
face. The second one was tipped and came right to me." 
</P>
<P>
Lee's good fortune helped Valencia turn a close game into a 42-15 rout over La 
Quinta in the second round of the Division VI playoffs in front of 4,000 fans 
at Bradford Stadium. Valencia (11-1) will meet Sunny Hills (9-3) in the 
semifinals on Friday at a site to be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Lee returned his first interception 44 yards to set up teammate Ryan Roskelly's 
two-yard run that pushed Valencia comfortably ahead, 35-15. Before La Quinta 
could regroup, Lee intercepted his second pass and returned it 30 yards to set 
up another Roskelly touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"He made some big plays," said Mike Marrujo, Valencia coach. "I thought 
everyone played very well tonight. I was very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia avenged a 19-14 upset loss to La Quinta in the first round of last 
year's playoffs by combining the passing of Marc O'Brien and the relentless 
running of Roskelly and Willie Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien completed eight of 15 pass attempts for 123 yards and one touchdown. 
Roskelly had 106 yards rushing and scored four touchdowns, but Barnes was 
Valencia's most impressive player with 117 yards rushing, as he repeatedly 
eluded tacklers with his shifty running. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very impressive," said Roger Takahashi, La Quinta coach. "You watch 
them on film and they're impressive and then when you got up against them, 
they're very impressive. We couldn't match up with them and would have had to 
have played a perfect game to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta quarterback Donald Hopkins was anything but perfect, though. Hopkins 
passed for 200 yards and a touchdown and ran for another, but he also threw 
three crucial interceptions in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins completed 11 of 28 attempts and finished with 2,359 yards and 17 
touchdowns for the season. Valencia's defense also limited La Quinta to only 70 
yards rushing to compliment its potent offense. 
</P>
<P>
Roskelly has been asked to pick up the slack in the absence of teammate John 
Fewell in Valencia's running attack. Fewell was declared academically 
ineligible last week. Roskelly responded with scoring runs of four, two and one 
yards and caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was a significant weakness in Valencia's impressive win. The 
Tigers averaged only 16 yards per punt. Still, Marrujo wasn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my punter, 'Just don't get a kick blocked,' " Marrujo said. "I don't 
care how far he kicks them, as long as we don't one blocked." 
</P>
<P>
Takahashi said he expected the worst when Brea-Olinda upset Valencia to win the 
Orange League title, pushing Valencia into La Quinta's playoff bracket. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked at the draw sheet and saw them in our bracket, I knew they were 
going to be tough to handle. They're a hungry team after failing to win their 
league."

EISENHOWER IS SHOCKED BY MATER DEI;

<P>
For two weeks, Eisenhower High School was at the top of the Southern Section 
Division I, but the Eagles came crashing down in the fourth quarter Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei scored 20 points in a fourth-quarter blitz to knock off top-seeded 
Eisenhower, 34-20, in the quarterfinals of the Division I playoffs in front of 
6,500 at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly expected. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower came into the game with an 11-0 record and a No. 12 ranking in USA 
Today's national poll. The Eagles had given up a grand total of 80 points in 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei had won only one more game than it lost, but its offense began to 
click in recent games. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs' offense had proved nearly unstoppable once already in the 
playoffs. Last week, Mater Dei rolled to a 58-31 victory over Long Beach Poly, 
passing and running for impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Mater Dei trashed Eisenhower's stingy defense. The offense carried 
Mater Dei (7-5) into next week's semifinals against Quartz Hill, a 24-14 winner 
over Rubidoux. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Billy Blanton completed 13 of 17 passes for 220 yards and three 
touchdowns. At one point, Blanton, a junior, completed six consecutive passes 
for a 21.5-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Derek Sparks gained 188 yards and scored two touchdowns in 26 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
The big passing yardage might have been expected, what with Eisenhower coming 
from the run-oriented Citrus Belt League. But Sparks' running was an added 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we could throw," Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "We wanted to 
keep them off balance." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time it looked easy. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton's first pass was a step too long for receiver Ricky Ellis. Otherwise it 
would have gone for a 75-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Ellis slipped behind Eisenhower's defense for a 69-yard touchdown on a 
play that was nearly identical. This time, however, Ellis ran under the ball at 
the Eisenhower 30 and sprinted into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Between, Blanton found Tom Martinez standing alone in the end zone for a 
32-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first quarter, Mater Dei led, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We told our kids we can't give up the turnovers or the big plays," Rollinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An interception set up Eisenhower's first touchdown, a 12-yard pass from 
quarterback Jason Davis to Demond Thompkins. The Eagles' second came on an 
85-yard run by Marcus Collins. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . and it was 14-14," Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis hit Thompkins on a fade pattern with 4:49 left in the third quarter, but 
Robert Talley's extra point hit the upright. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks' one-yard run and an extra point by Cliff Roberts gave Mater Dei a 21-20 
lead with 11:57 left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Monarchs turned the game into a runaway soon after. 
</P>
<P>
First, the defense recovered a fumbled pitch by Davis at the Eisenhower 15, 
setting up a seven-yard touchdown pass from Blanton to David Gonzalez with 8:53 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Mater Dei stopped Eisenhower on fourth and goal at the Monarch eight. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Sparks blew through a huge hole and cut back three times to 
avoid defenders to complete a 92-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
There was 3:57 left and Mater Dei held a firm, 34-20, lead. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the greatest win," Rollinson said.

ANNOUNCER DOUCETTE'S FANS DECIDE TO TALK BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your Nov. 10 Viewpoint letter that referred to Eddie Doucette as a 
bad announcer, several of my friends and I seriously question this judgment. 
</P>
<P>
We travel often from Los Angeles to San Diego on game days and tune in to KMPC 
because we're Rams fans and think Eddie is terrific. As women, we're not 
supposed to know much about football, right? Well, we don't have any trouble 
following Doucette's play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
When Bruce, Phil and Steve asked, "Is it us when it comes to knowing what's 
happening on the field?" -- our answer is, yes, it is. Learn the game of 
football, guys, before you tune in to Eddie. We love him!

FALLOUT CONTINUES FROM ARIZONA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am utterly confused by Cal's reaction to the current controversy in Arizona. 
Cal, a campus widely known for its liberalism and advocacy of civil rights, has 
let its athletic department totally reverse that reputation. 
</P>
<P>
This once again stresses the point that some athletes live in their own little 
world, sheltered from the real world. They can't believe when the outside world 
questions their actions. 
</P>
<P>
The comment by a Cal wide receiver, "Martin Luther King had a dream and I have 
a dream: to play in a bowl game," portrays his team as being even worse than 
first expected. Every NCAA player dreams about playing in a bowl game or in the 
NCAA tournament, yet we must realize that sports is not everything. There are 
much greater issues facing the country, and the actions of the Cal football 
team just give athletes an even worse reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that an emblem on a helmet or a half time show dedicated to 
King should be more than enough to calm the opposition. In fact, though, this 
does the opposite by trivializing the whole subject. 
</P>
<P>
Black players especially, but not exclusively, should particularly value what 
Martin Luther King did for this country. Any act of disrespect towards him 
should be met with severe criticism. Cal should follow the lead of other NCAA 
teams who refused to play in Arizona and decline the bowl invitation.

READER CAN'T BEAR ARTICLE ON HUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boy, oh boy . . . Sounds great . . . What does a guy have to do to become a 
heroic great bear hunter like Mr. Rose? Scaring an animal up a tree with a pack 
of "radar packing robotic" dogs and shooting it between the eyes with a shotgun 
sounds like the sport for me! Is there a secret handshake in this club? Does 
ESPN plan on covering it this fall? Or is this like playing baseball? To be any 
good do you have to have started as a boy? Kudos to The Times for occasionally 
(Nov. 14) writing one of these reminders that this is not a sport. It's nothing 
but cold-blooded murder!

FALLOUT CONTINUES FROM ARIZONA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your story on Sunday ("It's No Holiday for Arizona"): 
</P>
<P>
Do you really think that forcing people to pay for a holiday would make people 
honor Martin Luther King? Quite possibly all the boycotting may force Arizona 
into another vote. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday may be voted in. What then? Every year when the King holiday rolls 
around, will people remember the great actions of the man as we do now without 
a paid holiday, or would they be more likely to remember the way they were 
manipulated and coerced into paying for another holiday?

MAGIC, HEARN CHARGED WITH WRONG RESPONSE TO ARREST OF WORTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hope I'm not the first to advocate fairness in our consideration of James 
Worthy. A man's own conscience is generally sufficient judge, jury and sentence 
in a publicized occurrence of this kind. 
</P>
<P>
This particular event could have been handled privately and not subjected to 
the public domain were it not for the media's thirst for denigrating trivia.

Millionaire James Worthy, whose business is playing basketball with the Lakers, 
is arrested for soliciting a prostitute or prostitutes in Houston, we learn 
after the game.

Chick Hearn wouldn't breathe a word of it. In all events, Hearn bends over 
backward to make us believe the Lakers belong essentially to a church. It's too 
late for these kinds of lies.

NEWPORT HARBOR A 27-7 VICTIM OF 'NEAR-PERFECT' SUNNY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One thing for certain, the Sunny Hills High School football team did not play a 
perfect game Friday night. The Lancers did fumble once and there was that 
costly face-mask penalty that set up a Newport Harbor touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
However, that was about the extent of Sunny Hills' mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
With their 27-7 victory at Buena Park High School, the Lancers advanced to the 
Southern Section Division VI semifinals for the sixth time in the last eight 
seasons. They will play Valencia (11-1) next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be difficult for Sunny Hills (9-3) to duplicate Friday night's 
performance. Every aspect of the Lancers' game was in over-drive: 
</P>
<P>
* The offense had 279 yards rushing, including 156 by Mike Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
* The defense gave up only 142 yards and sacked Sailor quarterback Steve Walker 
eight times. 
</P>
<P>
* The special teams lended a hand with two field goals by Matt Young and a 
95-yard kickoff return by Kenny Overby to start the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"If you scripted this game, it couldn't have come off better," Sunny Hills 
Coach Tim Devaney said. "We'll have to look at the (game) films, but I can't 
think of much we did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's fumble on the Newport Harbor 14-yard line was one error, but it 
would be hard to come down on the senior running back. After all, it was his 
74-yard touchdown run in the second quarter that broke open a 10-0 game. 
</P>
<P>
On the play, Sullivan took a pitchout, swept right and then cut behind a 
vicious block by Overby. At that point it was clear sailing. 
</P>
<P>
"Overby took the guy out and all I had to do was make a couple of moves," said 
Sullivan, who averaged 11.1 yards per carry. "It was, 'Sully left,' then, 
'Sully right.' Then it was off to the races." 
</P>
<P>
When not blocking for Sullivan, Overby did some running of his own. He gained 
95 yards in 16 carries, 71 of which came in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing out of sync for the Lancers was their passing game. Jamal 
McKenzie completed only two of seven passes for 13 yards. However, he did score 
Sunny Hills' first touchdown on a 15-yard bootleg in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's only score in the second quarter came after a 50-yard kickoff 
return by Russell Olshefski, who was face-masked at the end of the play. The 
penalty gave the Sailors (8-4) the ball on the Lancer 26 and, six plays later, 
Michael Stipe scored on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the game, the Lancers took turns harassing Walker, who lost 52 
yards on the eight sacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Margarita High School parlayed a blocked punt and two big plays -- from 
95 and 80 yards out -- for a 21-0 first-half lead and held on for a 24-14 
victory over Bell Gardens in the Division IV quarterfinals Friday night at Bell 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (12-0), playing their first season with seniors, won the right to 
face Baldwin Hills, a 21-7 winner over Canyon Springs, in next Saturday's 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely did some nice things in the first half," Eagles Coach Jim 
Hartigan said. "We decided to loosen things up. You can't be conservative and 
win the championship. We threw more than we normally do." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita quarterback Trevor Yankoff threw only 10 times, but he 
completed six of those for 193 yards, including a 95-yard scoring pass to David 
Shearer with 59 seconds remaining in the first half to give the Eagles a 21-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita jumped to a 7-0 first quarter lead after Ryan Zalta blocked a 
Lancer punt and Ron Mehrens recovered the ball on the Bell Gardens 29-yard 
line. Yankoff hit Mike Farris with a 22-yard pass to the one-yard line, where 
he scored on a sneak. Travis Lucero kicked his first of three conversions. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle running back Josh Ireland made the score 14-0 with 6 minutes 48 seconds 
left in the half when he took a pitchout from Yankoff, cut through right tackle 
and headed 80 yards for the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
After Jason Ortiz thwarted a Lancer drive with an intercepted pass, Yankoff and 
his teammates were pinned on their own five with third and 15. But he hit 
Shearer streaking down the right sideline for a 95-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens (8-4) fought back with two scoring drives in the second half, led 
by running back Alfred Zamudio, who finished the game with 169 yards in 31 
carries, but Lucero's 22-yard field goal with 2:04 left in the third quarter 
padded the Eagles' margin. 
</P>
<P>
"Bell Gardens showed a lot of heart (in the second half)," Hartigan said. "They 
did a nice job of punching it at us. We need to play a complete game."

Javier Escobar scored four goals Friday night to lead UCLA past Pepperdine, 
10-9, in the opening round of the NCAA water polo finals at the Belmont Plaza 
Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-ranked Bruins will play top-ranked California at 6 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Cal (27-1) rolled past 13th-ranked Brown (20-10) in the first game of the 
three-day tournament, 16-6. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands or was tied 19 times between fifth-ranked Pepperdine 
(21-9) and UCLA (23-7). UCLA had lost seven of its last 13 matches. Pepperdine 
had won 15 of its last 16. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Oliver Hill tied the match, 9-9, with his third goal with 5:44 left. 
Escobar's shot with 2:17 left gave the Bruins the lead. 
</P>
<P>
A slap shot by Pepperdine's Blair Bishop at the buzzer after a length of the 
pool pass by goalie Wells Guthrie, glanced off the outside of the left post. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine held UCLA's leading scorer, Stefan Pollmann, a junior from Berlin, 
to one goal. In other games, second-ranked Stanford (25-5) scored on 10 of 20 
first half shots to take a 10-3 lead and eventually defeat 10th-ranked Air 
Force (19-7), the Western Water Polo Assn. champion, 14-6. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked UC Santa Barbara (23-7), which shared the Big West title with 
Pepperdine, struggled with a pesky Navy team, but outscored the Midshipmen, 
5-0, in the final 5:46 and won, 16-9. Navy, the Eastern Water Polo Assn. 
champion, cut the Gaucho lead to 11-9 with 5:59 left in the match on the 
seventh goal by two-meter man Luis Nicolao. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Pete Zamoyski scored four goals and Jasons Likins had three for Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara meets Stanford in the other semifinal tonight at 7:30. The 
championship match is Sunday night at 7:30.

In a matchup of junior quarterbacks, Hart High's Ryan Connors outperformed El 
Modena's Jose Prado to lead the Indians past the Vanguards, 14-7, in the 
quarterfinal round of the Southern Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (9-3) will play top-seeded Esperanza, a 31-7 winner over Leuzinger, in the 
semifinals next Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Connors completed 14 of 25 passes for 218 yards and a touchdown, although three 
passes were intercepted. Prado was nine for 16 for 134 yards with one 
interception and fumbled inside the Hart one to end a scoring opportunity in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Connors started the game quickly. After Hart took the opening kickoff, he 
passed 50 yards to Doug Distaso and then 30 yards to Brian Bernier for the 
touchdown with just 34 seconds elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena (8-4) answered at the end of the first quarter on a two-yard 
touchdown run by Adam Garcia and had another chance to score moments later. 
After the kickoff, El Modena's Tim Gray intercepted at the Hart 45 and returned 
the ball almost to the goal line. But on first down and inches, Prado fumbled 
the snap, and Hart recovered on the El Modena 3. The Vanguards never again 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Hart finally broke the tie with a 12-play, 70-yard drive. HEATHER SMALLEY

Mookie Blaylock sank a baseline jumper with one second to play at Phoenix 
Friday night and the New Jersey Nets' ordeal on the road was finally over. 
</P>
<P>
The basket, which gave Blaylock 26 points, lifted the Nets to a 116-114 
victory, ending a record 34-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets (3-9) didn't lack for persistence. They almost ended the streak, which 
began Dec. 19, in the season opener at Philadelphia, losing when Derrick 
Coleman was called for goaltending at the end of regulation play and the 76ers 
won in overtime, 112-110. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets ended their skid against a team that had lost only nine games at home 
all last season. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers had a season high 39 points for Phoenix, but from the start the 
Suns were in a battle. At one stage in the second quarter they trailed, 41-26. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the Suns caught up early in the fourth quarter, the Nets didn't give 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Johnson sank two free throws with 10 seconds to play to make the score 
114-114. Blaylock then dribbled the length of the court, turned on the right 
baseline and swished the jumper. The Suns lost the ball on the inbounds pass in 
their last possession. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 143, Golden State 119 -- On the way to their 10th consecutive victory, 
the unbeaten Trail Blazers ran into a problem at Portland. The speedy Warriors 
led, 34-27, after 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Portland Coach Rick Adelman went with his small lineup, guards Danny Ainge, 
Terry Porter and Clyde Drexler and forwards Buck Williams and Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
With full-court pressure, this group turned the game around in a hurry. By 
halftime, the Trail Blazers led, 76-52. The Warriors were never close in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 97, Washington 88 -- On their way to two consecutive NBA championships, 
the Pistons made defense their trademark. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Auburn Hills, Mich., the Pistons shut down the league's leading 
scorer, Bernard King, who was averaging nearly 31 points. In 30 minutes he was 
only five for 16 from the field and had only 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 112, Houston 111 -- The Pacers' Reggie Miller sank two free throws with 
four seconds to play at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Chuck Person gave the Pacers a one-two punch that overcame another 
fine performance by Akeem Olajuwon. Miller had 35 points and Person had 33. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon had 29 points and 16 rebounds and led the Rockets back from a 12-point 
third-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 111, Cleveland 105 -- There are times when no matter how well the 
opposition plays, Charles Barkley won't let the 76ers lose. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of those nights at Philadelphia. The Cavaliers played a strong game. 
But Barkley was too much. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, 14 for 19 from the field, had 36 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and 
four steals. In a 7-0 run after the Cavaliers took a 102-100 lead with two 
minutes left, Barkley had four points, two rebounds and a steal. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 116, Charlotte 100 -- The Hornets were beginning to believe they could 
handle the other expansion teams. The Heat showed them it wasn't necessarily so 
in this game at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied early in the fourth quarter, Kevin Edwards scored seven 
consecutive points to trigger a 14-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 107, Dallas 104 -- Paul Pressey's driving layup with 13 seconds 
left at Dallas gave the Spurs the lead for the first time in the fourth quarter 
and they held it. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson had 32 points and 13 rebounds for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 115, Sacramento 105 -- While Larry Bird and Robert Parish spent most of 
the game at Boston resting, rookie Dee Brown had 14 points in a reserve roll 
for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 97, Seattle 96 -- Karl Malone had 30 points and 12 rebounds at Salt Lake 
City, but the Jazz almost blew a six-point lead in the last two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Utah led, 97-91, and didn't score again. The Sonics cut the lead to one and had 
the ball, but Xavier McDaniel missed a 15-foot jumper at the finish. DAN HAFNER

CHAPMAN STRUGGLES PAST SEATTLE IN TOURNAMENT OPENING ROUND

<P>
First-round games in your own tournament are usually set up for the little guy 
to take a fall. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to roll over the patsy and set up a championship game to please to 
your fans. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday night in the first round of Chapman's Doubletree Classic men's 
basketball tournament, the Panthers were outplayed by Seattle, supposedly the 
weakest of three National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics schools in the 
tournament, and struggled to an 80-73 victory at the Hutton Center. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman will play Grand Canyon, a 69-63 winner over Southern California College 
Friday, for the championship tonight at 7. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a struggle, wasn't it?" Chapman Coach Bob Boyd asked. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd tried to assess why his team played poorly and had to fight off a rally 
that saw the Chieftains cut the Panthers' lead to 73-70 with 1 minute 49 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Seattle looked well-prepared for us," he said. "Our nonchalant play in the 
first half is a mystery to me. But good teams win when they play poorly and I 
hope that applies to us." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle showed early on that it wouldn't be taking the road to patsyhood. 
</P>
<P>
After some sloppy play by both teams early in the first half, Chapman led, 
14-10, with 13 minutes 34 seconds remaining. The Chieftains (1-3) then went on 
an 18-4 run, which gave them a 28-18 lead after Joe Weatherford scored on a 
rebound of Aaron Waite's failed three-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle then extended its lead to 36-21 before the Panthers came back. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful dunk by Rog Middleton, who missed two days of practice this week 
because of recurring tendinitis in his left knee, sparked a 13-0 run that 
brought Chapman to within two points with 1:20 remaining. Seattle led, 38-34, 
at the half. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In the other Chapman Doubletree tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon 69, Southern California College 63 -- Despite a game-high 26 
points from senior center Jeff Bickmore, the Vanguards (1-1) lost. SCC led, 
46-41, with 10:58 left to play, but Grand Canyon rallied. Maurice Carter, who 
scored 15 of his 23 points in the second half, scored eight consecutive points 
in a 10-0 run to give Grand Canyon a 51-46 lead 7:30 left.

SAN DIEGO SECTION TEAMS IN RUNNING FOR TITLE

<P>
There will be a strong San Diego presence at Woodward Park today at the State 
Cross-Country Championships, though the attention of the Division I race 
centers on teams from the Central and Southern sections. 
</P>
<P>
Madera High of the Central Section will try to become the first non-Southern 
Section boys' team to win the state Division I cross-country championship, and 
the Agoura girls' team will try to break its streak of three consecutive 
runner-up finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Madera and Agoura, the state's top-ranked boys' and girls' teams and ranked 
third and second, respectively, in the nation by The Harrier magazine, won 
their section Division I titles last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Section figures to be nipping at the heels of the Agoura girls, 
though, as section champion Mt. Carmel bids for its first state title. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel, known as the Red Wave because all seven of its runners finish 
within a minute of each other, is ranked second in the state in the Kinney 
Cross-Country Poll and fourth nationally. Junior Susan Scott won the section 
title Saturday as six Sundevils finished in the top 10. Only the first five 
runners for each team score. Mt. Carmel set a large-school section record with 
27 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Sundevils -- fourth in the state meet last year -- were second in the 
Sweepstakes race at the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura girls, who won at Mt. SAC, will be looking to unseat three-time 
champion Palos Verdes. The Chargers have already upstaged the Sea Kings three 
times this season -- including the Southern Section Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande and Agoura's Deena Drossin are the 
individual favorites for the Division I titles. Quintana finished second to 
three-time titlist Bryan Dameworth of Agoura last season and Drossin has 
claimed two of the last three championships. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys race, San Diego High School, which upset three-time section 
champion Poway, will try to foil Madera's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Poway's boys, which had three runners in the top five before falling off in the 
section finals, is represented in both the boys and the girls races. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Diego Section teams must be considered favorites in the other girls' 
races. San Pasqual and La Jolla are ranked No. 1 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla, which won the Division II title in 1989 with the third-best score in 
state meet history (88 points), is competing for the Division III title. The 
Vikings are led by section champion Julie Schoene, who helped La Jolla win the 
section final with a near-perfect 17 points. Six runners finished in the top 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual is competing in Division II and also had six runners finish in the 
top eight, including second-place Deanna Hadley. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's best hope for an individual title is Fallbrook sophomore Milena 
Glusac. She finished ninth in 1989 in the Division I race, but competes this 
year in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' races, No. 2 Helix should challenge for the Division II title No. 
1 Fair Oaks Del Campo. 
</P>
<P>
In Division I, Newhall Hart, the state's No. 2 boys' team, will race Madera for 
the third time this season after finishing second to Madera in the Stanford and 
Mt. SAC invitationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can beat Madera," Hart Coach Gene Blankenship said. "I think we're 
the No. 1 team in the state." 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City Section champion Belmont and runner-up Woodland Hills Taft could 
contend with Oxnard Channel Islands for a top-five finish. 
</P>
<P>
The new divisional format for the state meet -- which categorizes schools by 
enrollment -- also places three of the nation's fastest girls in different 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin, Becky Spies of Livermore and Jeannie Rothman of Westlake Village 
Westlake, the top three finishers in the Division I final a year ago, will 
compete in Divisions I, III and II, respectively, making it possible for each 
runner to win a state title.

Behind three running backs who combined for six touchdowns, St. Paul of Santa 
Fe Springs routed Beverly Hills, 42-7, Friday night in the quarterfinals of the 
Southern Section Division III playoffs at El Segundo High. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ramos, Shawn McKinney and Anthony Morales each scored two touchdowns to 
lead the Swordsmen, who outgained the Normans, 247 to 121, in total yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the same thing that we did all year," Ramos said, who gained 92 yards 
in 14 carries. "Our offensive line just drove them off the ball real well." 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul (7-3-2) constantly pressured Beverly Hills quarterback Ziv Gottlieb, 
sacking him seven times for minus 66 yards. Gottlieb completed 11 of 22 passes 
for 134 yards with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"The key for us was the pressure we put on Gottlieb," St. Paul Coach Miguel 
Olmedo said. "We couldn't give him time to pick us apart." 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter on touchdown runs of two and 
eight yards by McKinney. The Normans threatened early in the second quarter, 
but were stopped by a 55-yard interception return by Rudy Leyvas. St. Paul 
scored seven plays later on a two-yard run by Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
After a six-yard touchdown run by Morales, the Swordsmen led, 28-0, at the end 
of the firsthalf. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills, which helped the Swordsmen by turning the ball over four times, 
allowed two more touchdowns in the second half on a four-yard run by Morales 
and an eight-yard run by Ramos, as St. Paul led, 42-0, early in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills, the fourth-place team in the Bay League, finished with a record 
of 6-6. The Normans finally scored with 1:53 left in the game on a two-yard run 
by Greg Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
"We just made too many mistakes," said Brian Cook, Beverly Hills assistant 
coach. "We don't know if it was nervousness or not. But St. Paul played a heck 
of a game and took advantage of every mistake we made."

LOYOLA USES TRICK PLAY TO UPSET FONTANA, 10-7

<P>
Loyola High went deep into its bag of tricks, using the fumblerooski to set up 
its only touchdown, and hung on for a 10-7 upset victory over Fontana in a 
Southern Section Division I quarterfinal game Friday night at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 7-3 in the fourth quarter and having trouble moving the ball, Loyola 
quarterback Corby Smith took the snap, put the ball on the line of scrimmage 
and watched as guard Aaron Pingel picked it up and ran 23 yards to the Fontana 
seven-yard line. Three plays later, Smith scored on a one-yard keeper to put 
the Cubs ahead, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been practicing that play all year, from the first week of practice," 
Loyola Coach Steve Grady said. "We planned all this week to use it tonight. The 
time presented itself, so we went for it. We knew Aaron would either be a hero 
or a goat." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, The Times' 11th-ranked team, improved to 10-2 and will play Canyon High 
of Canyon Country, a 21-20 winner over Bishop Amat, in a semifinal game next 
Saturday. Third-ranked Fontana, the defending Division I champion, ended the 
season 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana had a chance to win in the final minutes. The Steelers took possession 
at their 41-yard line with 3:50 to play. They drove to the Loyola 33, but on 
fourth and eight, running back Richard Stephens was stopped a half-yard short 
of the first down. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola took over with 1:38 to play and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
The game, played before a crowd of about 8,000, was closely contested from the 
opening kickoff. Neither team could sustain much offense. Fontana finished with 
252 yards and Loyola had 142. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana running backs Hollerith Jones and David Griffin each had a few long 
runs, but they were consistently stopped deep in Loyola territory. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is what we expected," Fontana Coach Dick Bruich said. "We knew it 
would be tough. Loyola adjusted very well." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola drove 80 yards in a 10-play drive that included the fumblerooski play to 
score its lone touchdown. The drive took 5:36. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana dominated the clock in the first half, keeping the ball for 17:43 to 
6:17 for Loyola. But the Steelers could manage only one touchdown, which came 
on a 23-yard reverse by Griffin in the second quarter and capped a 20-play 
drive that covered 95 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, which ran only 12 plays for 67 yards in the first half, cut the lead to 
7-3 at halftime when Lance Harmon kicked a 38-yard field goal with six seconds 
remaining.

The odds were against Orange Glen High School going into Friday night's game at 
Helix High School. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen was facing the county's No. 1-ranked defense and the No. 3-ranked 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Helix had given up only 23 points all season and had lost just once -- to 
highly regarded Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen wasn't supposed to defeat Helix, 15-14, in the quarterfinal of the 
San Diego Section football playoffs. But Noel Toloumu's winning touchdown with 
28 seconds remaining kept alive what has become a three-year Orange Glen 
tradition: 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots had defeated the Highlanders in the playoffs the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were supposedly the best defense," Orange Glen receiver Brian 
Kooiman said. "But they had almost everybody back from last year. We were 
pretty confident going in. We knew we could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the fourth quarter, when Orange Glen scored its two touchdowns 
that the Patriots took control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Toloumu scored on a one-yard run to give Orange Glen (8-4) the victory. Orange 
Glen had driven the ball to the six-yard line and faced a fourth-and-five when 
Helix was called for offsides. The ball was moved half the distance, to the 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Randal carried 2 1/2 yards, missing a touchdown by a foot. Toloumu 
scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
"The best team won tonight," Orange Glen Coach Rob Gilster said. "I believe we 
were the best team." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Boozer put Orange Glen within striking distance, hauling in a 71-yard 
touchdown pass from Omar Navarro on the Patriots' first possession of the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Navarro, who completed 22 of 44 passes for 254 yards, Orange Glen drove 
steadily throughout the game, but was continually stopped by the Highlanders 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime coach told us we were stopping ourselves in the first half," 
Kooiman said. "We got a few things straight, and we finally got it together." 
</P>
<P>
Helix scored in its first possession of the game. Andreal Crimon scored on a 
eight-yard pass from Greg Wilbur. In the second quarter, Chris Baker scored on 
a 14-yard pass from Wilbur. They also connected on a two-point conversion to 
lead 14-3 at the half.

MORSE GIVES VISTA HARD FOOTBALL LESSON

CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unsuspecting fan who left her car before entering De Vore Stadium at 
Southwestern College Friday night didn't have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know much about football," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than two hours later, she got a lesson from the best, as 
top-ranked Morse manhandled Vista, 48-14, in a 3-A quarterfinal game featuring 
runs usually reserved for a guy named "Rocket." 
</P>
<P>
Morse (12-0) had two of them. Gary Taylor and Conan Smith run everywhere but 
circles around Vista (6-6). Together, they went ballistic. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was the long-winded one. He ran for touchdowns of 35, 17 and 66 yards. 
Smith was the sprinter. He went in twice from the 1-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a pretty good offensive team," Morse Coach John Shacklett said. "I'm 
never too concerned with being held scoreless." 
</P>
<P>
Vista made a valiant effort to stay in the game, and did, for about a quarter 
despite not gaining any yards in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers even scored first, on a nine-yard run by Donte White at 11:00. The 
run was set up when Vista recovered its onside kick on the Morse 45, and Jose 
Perez threw a 36-yard pass to Aaron Rounsifer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't too pleased with that," Shacklett said. "They caught us flat." 
</P>
<P>
But Morse came up for air and scored the next four touchdowns, Taylor and Smith 
traded scoring runs, to take a 28-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We played as hard as we could play," said Vista Coach Dick Haines, who watched 
the Panthers' six-game winning streak come to an abrupt halt. "I'm proud of my 
kids. (Morse) just outmanpowered us. They had too many tools." 
</P>
<P>
And Teddy Lawrence was the keeper of the tool box. 
</P>
<P>
After Vista's Chato Jackson scored on a two-yard run to open the third quarter, 
pulling the Panthers to 28-14, Taylor scored on a 66-yard run from his 34. 
</P>
<P>
Then Lawrence unleashed a couple of touchdown passes that couldn't have been 
prettier, or more on target. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence found Dwain Bostic on a 21-yard pass play with 10:23 remaining, then 
threw over half the field when he connected with Glenn Steele for a 65-yard 
play with 1:26 left.

EL CAMINO GETS VICTORY IT WOULD RATHER FORGET

One point-playoff victories rarely are considered disappointments. Usually they 
are cherished and talked about for years. 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of El Camino Coach Herb Meyer, he'd just as soon forget 
Friday's 17-16 victory over visiting Escondido in the section 2-A quarterfinals 
as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
His team reverted back to their early-season penchant for mistakes by turning 
the ball over three times. They allowed 10 points in the last minute of the 
first half, which included an 82-yard kickoff return by Escondido's Keith 
Williams. The extra-point try failed when the holder fumbled the snap. And 
Meyer's top running back, Von Robinson, broke his hand in the first half. He 
likely is out of next week's game against La Jolla or West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The game was in doubt until El Camino defensive backs Mike Flanagan and Lamont 
Girton blocked Escondido kicker Travis Sinohui's 47-yard field-goal attempt 
with 1:08 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Sinohui made a 47-yarder on the final play of the first half. But with the game 
on the line, the snap was high and by the time Sinohui got to kick, Girton and 
Flanagan were on top of him. 
</P>
<P>
But the blocked kick was one of the few bright spots for El Camino (8-4), which 
was outplayed for much of the game by a team it defeated, 31-7, only two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"(Escondido) played about the same way as last time," Meyer said. "We're back 
10 weeks ago. This is not the way it's supposed to be. We're regressing. The 
way we played looked like we didn't belong here. This is ridiculous. It's 
disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
The most disappointing aspect for Meyer was his team's turnovers -- two fumbles 
and an interception. El Camino quarterback Noel Prefontaine's fumble with 3:30 
remaining in the fourth quarter on the Escondido 37 gave Escondido a chance to 
win the game. 
</P>
<P>
Prefontaine's interception in the first half set up Sinohui's field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But the most costly turnover belonged to Escondido. With seven minutes left in 
the third quarter and Escondido close to taking the lead, running back Eddie 
Iglesias fumbled on the El Camino one-yard line. Once again Flanagan and Girton 
were the culprits. Flanagan stripped the ball and Girton recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was in the end zone, until I realized Lamont (Girton) had the 
ball," Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido made it look easy early as it took the opening kickoff 64 yards in 
seven plays for a 7-0 lead. On the drive quarterback Jerry Singleton completed 
his only two passes of the half for 23 and 28 yards to Williams and Richard 
Cardoza. Iglesias scored the touchdown on a one-yard run.

KEARNY HANGS ON FOR 14-13 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
Kearny spared no suspense Friday in its second-round San Diego Section 2-A 
football playoff game against San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny spared no points, either. 
</P>
<P>
The Komets' defense halted a fourth-quarter San Marcos drive, and Kearny held 
on for a 14-13 victory in front of 3,000 at Mesa College. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Kearny chased a few demons for the City Western League. The 
league's teams have had great success in the 2-A playoffs each year when they 
are not facing an opponent from the North County. Unfortunately, Kearny usually 
faces one no later than the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, eight teams from the Avocado League have reached the 2-A final. 
Four have won. In the same span, only one Western League team has gotten that 
far, and lost. So, with those numbers blaring at Kearny, the predictable nearly 
happened again Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny (10-1-1), which had been ousted from the playoffs in the first round the 
past two years, had first and goal at the two-yard line as they clung to that 
14-13 lead late in the fourth quarter and failed to score. When the Knights 
(7-4-1) took over at their six with 4:14 remaining and got a 41-yard run to 
midfield from running back Mark Frazier, Kearny Coach Willie Matson could see 
it all happening again. 
</P>
<P>
"When he popped that (run)," said Matson with a sigh, "I said, 'Golly, gee.' " 
</P>
<P>
Frazier, a junior who carried 18 times for 133 yards, led a wishbone attack 
that totaled 189 yards. The option often confused Kearny's defense, but just 
when it counted most the Komets clamped down. They threw quarterback Lance 
Gallegos for a two-yard loss, then, on fourth and three at Kearny's 47 with 
2:19 left, the Komets stood Frazier up at the line of scrimmage. Frazier was 
stopped a yard short. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a heck of a job on the quarterback," Matson said. "But you're not going 
to hold down a guy like Frazier the whole game. The defense did a hell of a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
After Kearny forced San Marcos to punt on the game-opening drive, the Komets 
marched 80 yards on 17 plays, chewing up 8:26 on the clock, to open the 
scoring. Darnay Scott scored on a four-yard run to make it 6-0 after the 
extra-point kick failed. The two key plays on the drive were pass completions 
by quarterback Sam Page, who had been struggling. Page completed nine of 16 
passes to five receivers for 108 yards. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos took a 7-6 lead with 2:40 left before halftime on Frazier's 
nine-yard run. But with 1:17 left, Kearny answered on a one-yard plunge by 
Page, who made it 14-7 when he passed to Jemal Lucas for two points. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights scored on a two-yard run midway through the third quarter on 
Frazier's two-yard run, but failed the tie the game when Bryan Wright's kick 
for the point-after was wide right.

What is an artist? Someone who can perform, entertain or, more likely, sell 
records. Did the recording academy ever ask whether Vanilli used their own 
voices? If not, it has no right to complain. 
</P>
<P>
I'll bet even Madonna and Michael Jackson can't recognize their own voices in 
the mix of their records!

FACES . . . : CROSSOVER DREAM COMING TRUE FOR CLIO WINNER KATHLEEN GARRETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Judging by her schedule, Kathleen Garrett is on her way to becoming hot 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week I had seven auditions in one day," she says. "We arranged it so that 
I wore one type of wardrobe all morning and another type in the afternoon. I 
put 90 miles on my car that day. By the last audition, I couldn't even read the 
script." She collapses back on the sofa and grins. "I've never heard of anybody 
having seven." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, not every actress wins a Clio Award, either. The advertising 
industry's Oscar, Clios honor top commercials in a contest that this year 
included 25,490 entries from 59 nations. Garrett won best actress for a spot 
she did for a New England department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial, which will air as part of a Clio Awards special Wednesday at 
8 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11, Garrett's character re-enacts a phone conversation 
in which she tells her sister about a white sale. It may not sound like a meaty 
role, but Garrett manages to infuse it with her trademark humor. 
</P>
<P>
"When I did that commercial, we did six takes of it and I couldn't get it 
right. So finally, I started doing it in accents," she says, demonstrating. 
"That loosened everyone up." 
</P>
<P>
Without Garrett's knowing it, the ad agency entered the spot in the Clio 
competition. When Garrett found out she won, she was away from home, checking 
her answering machine for messages. 
</P>
<P>
"I went absolutely ape," she says. "I was out of my mind, going, 'I won a Clio! 
I won a Clio! Gimme a pen!' " 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, who cut her teeth on roles like the tragic Greek heroine Clytemnestra, 
has played "the naked porno queen" in an episode of "Hooperman" and Melanie 
Mayron's grandmother in a "thirtysomething" flashback. Most recently, she 
appeared in a Trident gum commercial as "the girl carrying the groceries who 
falls down." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why," she jokes, "I went to drama school in England."LAUREN LIPTON

In this "turn out the videos and hope for a hit record" era, two untalented

Vanilli or the Grammy committee that votes for junk like this.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC;

TALMI RETURNS TO CONDUCT POWERFUL BRUCKNER PIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Symphony music director Yoav Talmi returns to the podium Friday night 
to lead the orchestra in Anton Bruckner's mighty Seventh Symphony. This will 
launch the Israeli maestro's traversal of all nine Bruckner symphonies, one of 
the three cycles he has planned to unify his programming over the upcoming 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He is already two symphonies into his cycle of the complete Mahler symphonies, 
and last month he inaugurated an open-ended cycle of Requiems by various 
composers with the Faure Requiem. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi has cannily paired the hour-long Bruckner with the always-popular 
Mendelssohn Violin Concerto, with soloist Ida Levin. Bruckner has not been a 
staple with the local symphony, although a performance last season of his 
Fourth Symphony (the "Romantic") under German guest conductor Christoph Perick 
was both well-performed and well-received by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"My choice of music takes into account not only my wishes," Talmi explained, 
"but also the expectations of the people we have here. I cannot launch a 
Bruckner series as if I'm in Chicago and New York, where they have a tradition 
of performing this music." 
</P>
<P>
To get local audiences accustomed to the Austrian composer's hyper-Romantic 
idiom, Talmi has promised just one jolt of Bruckner per season. In the 1991-92 
season, he will conduct the Bruckner Ninth Symphony, which won him the coveted 
Grand Prix du Disque when he recorded it with the Oslo Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi will discuss his programming preferences and the orchestra's current 
season at 8 a.m. Tuesday on classical music station KFSD-FM. He will co-host 
the hour with station program director and genial morning host Kingsley 
McLaren. 
</P>
<P>
Fan of Mozart. San Diego's Mainly Mozart Festival bursts on the local music 
scene at the beginning of each June with a flurry of concerts and then 
disappears for another year. To raise the festival's profile during the rest of 
the season, a pair of recitals will be presented at the Kingston Hotel, the 
festival's primary sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Felix Fan, the 15-year-old La Jolla prodigy will perform Sunday, Dec. 
2, at 6:30 p.m. accompanied by pianist Karen Follingstad. Earlier this year, 
Fan won first prize in the American string Teachers Assn. solo competition in 
College Park, Md. He studies under Eleonore Schoenfeld of the USC music faculty 
and is a sophomore at La Jolla High School. Fan's program will include 
Beethoven's "Magic Flute" Variations and works by Schumann and Bartok. Cynthia 
Phelps, principal violist with the Minnesota Orchestra and regular soloist with 
the Mainly Mozart Festival, will give a recital Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly Mozart music director David Atherton will attend Fan's performance and 
the dinner afterward in the hotel restaurant. Atherton had not been scheduled 
to return to San Diego until late next month, but minor back surgery caused him 
to cancel his December London conducting engagements and return to San Diego, 
where he maintains a home, for recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
Singers' circuit. Swedish baritone Hakan Hagegard, who will appear in San Diego 
Opera's season-opening production of Mozart's "Cosi fan Tutte" in January, was 
well-received last month as the count in San Francisco Opera's new production 
of Richard Strauss's "Capriccio." Earlier this month, tenor John Duykers 
stirred audiences of the Lyric Opera of Chicago's "The Voyage of Edgar Allan 
Poe" by American composer Dominick Argento. Duykers will make his San Diego 
Opera debut in April as Enoch Pratt in Carlisle Floyd's "The Passion of 
Jonathan Wade." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen West, another singer familiar to San Diego Opera patrons (he sang the 
wily Rangoni in last season's "Boris Godunov"), sang another key role in the 
surreal Argento work. (The set for "Poe," by the way, was constructed locally 
in the San Diego Opera scenic shop.) 
</P>
<P>
Local soprano Virginia Sublett is singing the role of Nightengale and Fire in 
the current New York City Opera production of Ravel's "L'Enfant et les 
Sortileges." 
</P>
<P>
Conductors: Karen Keltner, San Diego Opera associate conductor, spent last week 
at Florida's Orlando Opera, where she conducted three performances of 
Offenbach's "The Tales of Hoffmann." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Symphony has confirmed that Michael Palmer, music director of the 
New Haven Symphony, will fill in for the ailing Robert Shaw in January's 
performances of the Mozart Mass in C Minor, K. 417. 
</P>
<P>
Unusual this week. The 500-voice UC San Diego Gospel Choir will perform under 
the direction of Ken Anderson at 8 p.m. Tuesday in Mandeville Auditorium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In its television debut, the San Diego Early Music Ensemble will present "Songs 
of Courts and Cathedrals" on KPBS (Channel 15) Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. The 
ensemble sings Renaissance vocal music in a variety of local settings, from the 
Renaissance Room of the San Diego Museum of Art to the courtyard of the Mission 
San Diego de Alcala. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At the Poway Center for the Performing Arts, Mozart's rarely heard one-act 
comedy with music "The Impressario" will be given in concert form by the 
International Orchestra under guest director Karen Keltner. The sole 
performance will be a 8 p.m. Friday. San Diego Opera general director Ian 
Campbell will narrate, assisted by singers Virginia Sublett, Kerry O'Brien and 
William Eichorn.

Howard Rosenberg, wake up to Econ 101! What corporation ignores the needs of

By labeling Burger King "a groveler and a coward" is Rosenberg trying to deny 
it the freedom to respond to its customers? Am I not entitled to a concerned

Since when is a corporation "gutless" just because it doesn't happen to share

BRUCE, BONNIE AND BROWNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Robert Hilburn's Nov. 19 article, "Killing 'Em Softly With His Songs": The 
piece reads more like a tribute in a teen fan club flyer than an analysis in a 
major newspaper. Hilburn says Bruce Springsteen "faced the (personal) issues 
and questions of the last two years head-on." 
</P>
<P>
But it is worth noting that he did not utter a word on stage about our coming 
war with Iraq or did he go beyond giving a brief thanks to the Christic 
Institute, which is pursuing a lawsuit against many of the Iran-Contra crooks 
who got off so lightly for meddling in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Jackson Browne did several songs about the shameless activities of 
Reagan, the CIA and the vicious, drug-running "freedom fighters" in Central 
America. This was, after all, supposed to be a folk concert by three of our 
most politically engaged performers. 
</P>
<P>
So when Hilburn describes Springsteen's "Brilliant Disguise" as a "supreme 
moment of confrontation and confession" it becomes clear that the rock critic 
is fixated on the gossip about his icon. Does he see no irony in celebrating 
Bruce for "facing the issues," given Springsteen's neglect of politics in this 
supremely political moment?

Did Hilburn bother to show up for the two opening acts? Those of us who did saw 
Jackson Browne give one of his best performances in years and Bonnie Raitt tear 
up a set that showed how happy she was to share a bill with Browne and 
Springsteen.

SCR'S COMMITMENT TO ARTISTIC FREEDOM UNQUESTIONABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, articles in The Times Orange County Edition ("SCR Rejects Offer to 
Join Panel" by Zan Dubin and "Will No One Represent O.C. at State Arts Forum?" 
by Randy Lewis, Calendar, Nov. 16) may have led some people to question South 
Coast Repertory's commitment to the cause of freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
These stories had to do with SCR's declining an invitation to join a panel at 
the California Confederation of Arts statewide meeting -- an invitation issued 
verbally on short notice and outside normal channels. Once we understood the 
nature and importance of the CCA's invitation, David Emmes agreed to appear on 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Lewis used this regrettable but honest breakdown in communications as 
an opportunity to call into doubt South Coast Repertory's commitment to fight 
challenges to artistic freedom. To draw such a judgment on the basis of one 
incident, while ignoring SCR's actions over time, is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
There is no cause to doubt SCR's commitment. In this year of attacks on 
government arts funding and a national campaign to weaken artistic freedom, SCR 
has not retreated or compromised. In specific support of the National Endowment 
for the Arts and artistic expression in general, we stuffed our theater 
programs with a flyer urging our audiences to advocate an unrestricted 
reauthorization of the NEA. Even after that action had threatened SCR's funding 
from the city of Costa Mesa, we printed a second message reiterating our stand 
and inserted that in our programs. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Benson monitored meetings of the Costa Mesa City Council and voiced 
strong opposition to proposed language for Costa Mesa grant applications (a 
Times editorial favorably cited his testimony). SCR joined in an amicus brief 
filed by Theatre Communications Group in support of current suits to strike 
restrictive language from NEA grant applications. All our concerns regarding 
threats to artistic expression have been communicated to our audiences through 
the artistic directors' letter in our programs and in the pages of our 
subscriber newsletter. One program essay, "Endowing the Nation's Spirit," was 
part of the local NEA office's report to Chairman John E. Frohnmayer. 
</P>
<P>
We have taken advantage of every media opportunity to speak in support of the 
endowment and against censorship. Emmes was part of a public radio business 
feature that ran nationally; SCR literary manager John Glore was a guest on 
KABC Talkradio; Benson was interviewed for a CNN broadcast; and we were 
interviewed by Newsweek and have been in numerous articles in the Register, The 
Times, the Daily Pilot and others. For the Sept. 23 edition (of The Times), 
Emmes wrote a column at the invitation of the editorial staff in which he 
strongly supported an unrestricted NEA and defended the right of the Costa Mesa 
Civic Playhouse, at a time when it was under fire, to produce "Sister Mary 
Ignatius Explains It All for You." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the place where SCR has for 26 years supported freedom of expression 
is on its stages. We have never shied away from confronting controversial 
issues in the plays we have produced. We have received national recognition for 
producing challenging plays that colleagues in some other major cities tell us

AMPHITHEATER NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We bought our house in 1978, long before our State Fair Board decided to put an 
outdoor amphitheater in the midst of our residential neighborhood. During the 
season, there are usually two concerts a week that rock our house -- even with 
all the doors and windows closed. 
</P>
<P>
And we live 2 miles away, as the crow flies. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, we had an out-of-town guest, and we had to leave for hours 
because of the concert. We could probably reap a nice penny renting seats on 
the front lawn, because you can hear the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
We have been plagued with the noise, the congestion and the rubbish (thrown by) 
people going to and from (the amphitheater), to say nothing of the lawns they 
trample. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Ned West, who runs these concerts, is glad to pay the fines for 
exceeding the noise limits because he is making so much money on the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The state board has foisted this on us, and we, the citizens of Costa Mesa, are 
powerless. Agencies concerned with noise pollution have singled out this 
amphitheater as an example of what should not be allowed.

MISREAD SCULPTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to " 'Novel Ideas' Bound by Literal Works" by Cathy Curtis 
(Calendar, Nov. 16): 
</P>
<P>
With all my respect to one of (The Times') most vicious art critics, who knows 
her stuff very well, I would like to set one very important item in that 
article straight, which will completely change the distorted and wrong way she 
reviewed my sculpture "The American Dream." The book I was given was a double 
paperback by Edward Albee, the author of "Who Is Afraid of Virginia Wolf?" The 
actual title of the book was "The Zoo Story" and "The American Dream" (two 
stage plays). 
</P>
<P>
The second one, which I focused my piece on, was written by Albee in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
If you will read this short play, you will realize that I am not at all 
interested in putting genitals where they do not belong or purposely getting 
off on the trendy fad of explicitness and censorship. I had a very valid reason 
for my "good measure" placement. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to categorize an artist's work when it's singled out of context or 
put into the wrong context without knowing the overall guts of the artist's 
work.

CBS' 'BROKEN BADGES' NEEDS TO BE RECALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Broken Badges" is a grating echo of "The A-Team" from Stephen J. Cannell, a 
new CBS series about as dully formulaic and predictable as television gets. 
Although regularly airing at 9 p.m., it premieres at 8 tonight (on Channels 2 
and 8) with a distended two-hour episode so incredibly exciting and suspenseful 
that you're constantly on the edge of your seat. 
</P>
<P>
Poised to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
What we get tonight are the beginnings of one of those special undercover 
police units assigned to cases that regular cops can't or won't handle. The 
location is a place called Bay City, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The leader will be police psychologist Eleanor Hardwick (Terry Donahoe), whose 
by-the-book methods will clash with the street-toughness of Beau Jack Bowman 
(Miguel Ferrer, who also plays forensics expert Albert Rosenfield on ABC's 
"Twin Peaks"). 
</P>
<P>
A New Orleans Cajun cop destined to be the group's main member, Beau Jack 
arrives in Bay City with a murder suspect he is supposed to turn over to the 
local cops. However, the suspect escapes after being left alone in a crowded 
airport, handcuffed to a baggage rack. A murder suspect left alone? So much for 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Jack better retrieve the suspect, his chief screams at him on the phone, 
or DON'T BOTHER TO COME BACK!!! He doesn't bother to come back. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Bowman meets the other cops who at the end of the episode will be 
his colleagues in the unit. Psychological misfits and dangerously unstable, 
here they are: nerdy ventriloquist Stanley Jones (Jay Johnson), who has a 
fistfight with his uniformed puppet; stressed-out Toby Baker (Ernie Hudson) and 
J. J. Tingreedes (Eileen Davidson), a tattooed, leather-loving wild woman so 
addicted to danger -- ooooooh -- that no other cop will work with her. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, these raucous clown cops will get their act together and track down 
the murder suspect and the white-collar meanies behind an insidious plot to 
undermine quaint old Bay City. It gets ugly. Sample dialogue: "I will not 
hesitate to drop you like a set of keys, you got that?" 
</P>
<P>
This story is not just full of holes, it is a hole, a huge one. Just how it is 
that Beau Jack becomes Bay City Jack, working for yet another chief who hates 
his guts, is a thing of wonder. 
</P>

'ONION FIELD' TOUCH TO 'COP FOR THE KILLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The TV movie "In the Line of Duty: A Cop for the Killing" (Sunday at 9 p.m. on 
NBC Channels 4, 36, 39) doesn't quite know whether it wants to be "The Onion 
Field" or "The A-Team." 
</P>
<P>
Its ostensible subject is the grief affecting other cops after a policeman's 
murder. But, unfortunately, the ambushed officer who goes down in a hail of 
bullets -- Charles Haid ("Hill Street Blues") -- is by far the most believable 
one on screen, and after he's gone we scarcely have enough invested in his 
cartoonish partners to care about how they work through their pain and 
reintegrate into the undercover narcotics squad. 
</P>
<P>
There's a stereotypical internal affairs investigative unit that tries to ply 
the surviving members apart. And they have their own problems: Lieutenant 
Wiltern (James Farentino) feels guilt over initiating the drug bust that led to 
the murder. Matt (Steven Weber), the longhair on the narc detail, is starting 
to act as spaced-out as the druggies he's supposed to be arresting, and keeps 
showing up at strip joints instead of work. 
</P>
<P>
Less problematic for the team, but more for realism-oriented viewers, is 
gorgeous Julie (Susan Walters), who's way too fabulous a babe to be doing this 
grunt-work; she should be posing for swimsuit issues, not knocking down doors 
downtown. Charlie's Angels live! 
</P>
<P>
How do they deal with their grief? Ultimately, by telling each other things 
like "Sometimes things just happen" or "You just gotta deal with it," whatever 
that means, followed by finally going out and seriously kicking some 
drug-dealer butt. 
</P>
<P>
It takes the message in the final freeze-frame -- "Last year in the U.S., 145 
officers were killed in the line of duty" -- to remind you how serious this all 
is supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
The script by Philip Rosenberg and Rick Husky offers nothing but cliches, but 
kudos to director Dick Lowry for investing this with a tense, solid urgency it 
doesn't really deserve. Lowry may have been working with a D.O.A. teleplay, but 
he dealt with it. CHRIS WILLMAN

COMPUTAINMENT: 'ALTERED' STATES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Accolade's "Altered Destiny" turns a romantic evening for two into . . . "The 
Twilight Zone." It is a traditional adventure-style game with a good story set 
against an effective, entertaining science-fiction backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
It's Friday night and regular guy P.J. Barrett makes a date with girlfriend 
Trudy Foxlitner to watch videos at his place. P.J. stops after work to pick up 
his television from the repair shop. Entering the shop, he passes a large, 
Neanderthal warrior carrying a television. You guessed it: P.J.'s TV. But 
neither the repair man nor P.J. wants to confront the big guy, so P.J. takes 
home a loaner. And that's when P.J.'s life turns really weird. As soon as P.J. 
turns on the TV, he gets sucked through the tube into somewhere described as 
"between here and there." Our hero immediately meets a disappointed, frail 
specter named JonQuah. (JonQuah was naturally expecting the warrior with the 
wrong television.) Settling for second best -- or just what he can get -- 
JonQuah gives P.J. the old you-must-save-the-universe routine and leaves him to 
drift down into a world of sci-fi fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
While Accolade continues to provide excellent support for its adventurers, the 
company is still having trouble programming smooth movement functions for its 
characters. P.J. runs into a few spots that make play frustrating. Watch 
yourself in the Canyons of Fear and the Caves of Death. 
</P>
<P>
Save often. Sometimes every few steps. Save at the Bottom of the Stairs -- and 
prepare to die -- a lot, while trying to cross the bridge.

WHAT ARE FANS FOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I really wonder what was going through Melissa Henry's mind when she wrote her 
letter ("Enough already with the letters from incensed New Kids on the Block 
fans!" Calendar, Nov. 10). 
</P>
<P>
Her letter comes as no surprise in an adult society where no one does much of 
anything except complain about students' falling test scores and other 
shortcomings of today's young people. The letters we write as New Kids fans 
allow us to give back to them in some minute way. In our hearts, we know we 
have done the right thing by defending them. 
</P>
<P>
Everything comes to pass anyway, but for now, let the New Kids fans exercise 
their right to freedom of speech.

CSUN ENTERS RECORD BOOK, LOSES DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOULDER, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The helter-skelter system Cal State Northridge copied from Paul Westhead went 
over about as well in the Matadors' Division I debut as it has for Westhead's 
1-10 Denver Nuggets, who reside 35 miles southeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, despite making an NCAA-record 16 three-point baskets in a record 44 
attempts, fell to Colorado, 113-89, before 3,519 Friday night at Coors Events 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
Buffaloes Coach Joe Harrington sat down center Shaun Vandiver and guard Stevie 
Wise, the top two scorers in the Big Eight Conference last season, for most of 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Vandiver, a 6-foot-10 senior, scored 27 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in 25 
minutes. Wise scored 29 points, including four three-point baskets, in 27 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The closest CSUN came in the second half was within 11 at 61-50 after Kyle 
Kerlegan sank three three-point baskets in a 56-second span with 16 minutes 34 
seconds remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, a former Cal State Long Beach coach, called a timeout and Kerlegan 
and the other CSUN starters came out. With Northridge's second team on the 
floor, the Buffaloes reeled off 18 points in a row to take a 79-50 lead with 
12:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I hit three threes but I asked to come out," Kerlegan said. "Fatigue 
hurts. Who is to say I wouldn't have missed the next four? I help the team as 
much as I can and when I'm fatigued I come out. I'd rather have someone with 
fresh legs come in than stay in and hurt the team." 
</P>
<P>
Kerlegan, who insisted the 5,345-foot altitude was not a factor, returned in 
time to hit two more three-point shots. He finished with a Coors Events Center 
record for three-point baskets (10) and three-point attempts (21), and fell 
just short of the NCAA records of 12 and 22 in those respective categories, set 
by Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler against Detroit in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1 senior from Canada College in Redwood City, whose 145 three-point 
baskets last season were the most for any high school or college player, 
finished with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
By themselves, the Matadors broke the two-team Coors Event Center record for 
three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say enough about their shooters," Harrington said. "In the end we had 
more depth and we wore them down. We had more inside. That is the way it is 
when you are starting a (Division I) program." 
</P>
<P>
For the first four minutes, the Matadors' offense worked to perfection. 
Northridge hit four of its first five shots, a game-opening three-point basket 
by David Keeter, a pair of three-point baskets by Kerlegan and a follow shot by 
Todd Bowser. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Buffaloes realized what hit them, Northridge led, 13-4, with 16:53 
remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy took out the weary starters for freshman 
point guard Andre Chevalier, Kirk Scott, the lone returnee from last season's 
team, and junior college transfers Sean Davis, Brian Kilian and David Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
Second-unit players did not have the hot hand of the first team, however. They 
missed four consecutive shots, including a dunk by Davis and three-point 
attempts by Davis and Chevalier that caught nothing but air. 
</P>
<P>
With 13:59 remaining, Cassidy put the starters back in, but the lead was down 
to two and the momentum belonged to the Buffaloes, who built a 46-34 lead by 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still a very young team," Cassidy said. "In our enthusiasm to get the 
job done in the half-court defense, we overextended ourselves. On the 
full-court defense, we expect them to beat the pressure initially, but we 
didn't get back and recover." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors were also hurt by a 59-51 rebounding disadvantage although Shelton 
Boykin, a transfer from Valley College, stood out with 11 rebounds in 24 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I could have fought a little harder on the boards," Kerlegan said. "I 
had some mental lapses when I didn't block out." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor was the Matadors' 37% shooting from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Gibbs, who was converted from wing to point guard three weeks ago when 
Eugene Humphrey quit the team, missed nine of 10 attempts, including four from 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"At this level, Division I, it is very, very difficult to make that 
transition," Cassidy said. "He gives us all he has. He feels bad right now, but 
I'm not going to let him get down on himself." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gibbs' shots were off, his playmaking skills were sharp, as his 
school-record 15 assists attest. 
</P>
<P>
Keeter finished with 16 points for CSUN and David Swanson and freshman Martin 
Smith each scored 11.

2ND-HALF THUNDER AGAIN CARRIES QUARTZ HILL, 24-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A familiar trend continued in Quartz Hill High's 24-14 win over Rubidoux in a 
Southern Section Division I quarterfinal Friday night at Rubidoux. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill (10-2) scored 24 consecutive points in overcoming a 14-0 
second-quarter deficit to advance to the semifinals for the first time in the 
school's history. 
</P>
<P>
Rubidoux, the Citrus Belt League's third-place finisher, led, 14-6, at the 
half, but Quartz Hill rallied for three fourth-quarter touchdowns and will meet 
Mater Dei next Friday. Mater Dei defeated Eisenhower on Friday, 34-20. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill has outscored opponents 102-0 in the second half the past four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Rubidoux (5-8), which failed to complete a pass, rolled up 155 yards of offense 
in the first half, but was limited to 33 thereafter. Quartz Hill posted 181 of 
its 304 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill running back Selves Smith rushed for 60 yards in seven carries, 
including 59 after intermission and scored a touchdown midway through the 
fourth quarter that gave Quartz Hill its first lead of the game. Teammate Erik 
Thomas added 48 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty rough in the first half," Smith said. "We had trouble with their 
misdirection plays. We came out fired up in the second half and showed people 
the team that could do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jake Haro connected with Robert Keller on a 59-yard pass play to 
close to 14-6 with 2:24 remaining in the second quarter. Keller, however, was 
wide left on the point-after attempt. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless third quarter, Keller reeled in a 30-yard touchdown pass from 
Haro for the pair's second touchdown of the game to cut the deficit to 14-12 
with 11 minutes, 52 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Haro completed five of 10 for 135 yards . 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill stopped Rubidoux on downs and marched 62 yards in nine plays with 
Thomas dashing in from five yards to give the Rebels their first lead of the 
game, 18-14, with 5:45 left. 
</P>

Hansen delivered a crushing hit on Sammy Knight to force a fumble on the 
ensuing kickoff. Thomas recovered at the Rubidoux 40 and five plays later, 
Smith scored on a 19-yard run with 1:27 left to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like every game we come on in the second half," Haro said. "They 
surprised us, but we got up after that first touchdown pass and everybody came 
together."

DIVISION I-AA LEAGUE OF SOUTHLAND FOOTBALL TEAMS CARRIES MERIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach and Cal State Fullerton, among others, should be realistic 
and forget about playing Division I-A football. 
</P>
<P>
Both schools spend too much money and energy trying to be competitive against 
all odds. And to what advantage? Their records are average, at best, and 
attendance is still poor. 
</P>
<P>
When the music stops and college football's teams and conferences finally fall 
in place, presumably in the next few years, Fresno State will leave the Big 
West Conference for the greener -- as in more profitable -- pastures of the 
Pacific 10 Conference. At that time, the rest of the Big West should consider 
joining the ranks of Division I-AA football. And Cal State Northridge and Cal 
State Sacramento should join them. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Fresno -- and San Jose State this year -- the Big West plays 
football at a level similar to that of the Division I-AA Big Sky Conference -- 
a level only slightly better than the Division II Western Football Conference, 
of which Northridge and Sacramento are members. 
</P>
<P>
When Fresno leaves, the Big West will be left with eight schools -- only six of 
which play football. Pick up Northridge and Sacramento and the numbers to go to 
10 and eight. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and Sacramento don't have far to go in football to be on par with 
Big West schools, whose scholarship levels are more along the lines of Division 
I-AA anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, the Big West -- with the likes of Nevada Las Vegas and New 
Mexico State -- still would be considered big time, and perhaps be even more 
balanced because its athletic programs no longer would be wasting money while 
hopelessly trying to become respectable in football. 
</P>
<P>
Such an alliance makes a lot of sense geographically, financially and 
competitively. 
</P>
<P>
Practice makes perfect: Most major-college basketball programs play preseason 
exhibitions against teams with religious affiliations or from foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Not Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's opener at Colorado, the Matadors had played no one but 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sick of playing against each other," point guard Keith Gibbs said. "It 
is hard to tell how good we are." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, intra-squad scrimmages give a team of newcomers little opportunity to 
familiarize themselves in a game situation. Without another team to compare 
itself to, Northridge had no idea what it needed to work on nor how well its 
new Loyola Marymount-style offense would work. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado, meanwhile, played the Australian National Team on Nov. 6 and the 
Spirit Express on Nov. 17. Colorado State, which Northridge faces tonight in 
Fort Collins, Colo., also has played two exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy said he attempted to schedule an exhibition against New 
Zealand, but those plans fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's women's basketball team didn't play an exhibition, either, but 
Coach Janet Martin found an alternative. She broke up the monotony of 
intra-squad scrimmages by having her team play against men from the school's 
intramural program. 
</P>
<P>
School of coaching: The Notre Dame High class of 1962 had three pretty good 
football coaches in its ranks -- Glendale College's John Cicuto, former 
Glendale coach and current assistant Jim Sartoris and UCLA's Terry Donahue. 
Cicuto was an offensive tackle and nose tackle, Sartoris played quarterback and 
Donahue played offensive guard and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Cicuto and Sartoris have stayed especially close since meeting at Notre Dame in 
1958. When Sartoris became the head coach at Glendale, he hired Cicuto to be 
his defensive coordinator. And when Sartoris stepped down as coach before last 
season to concentrate on his duties as athletic director, Cicuto replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale struggled through a 5-4-1 campaign last season, leading Cicuto to fear 
the worst. "For a while I thought I'd be the first coach Jim would fire as an 
A. D.," Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Fat chance. After two losses to open this season, Glendale has won eight in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Here's a particularly forgettable quote by Coach Pete Cassidy out of 
last season's Northridge basketball media guide: "He is a good defensive player 
and when all is said and done I know Eugene will be there for the team." 
</P>
<P>
In the stands maybe. On Nov. 6, Eugene Humphrey, CSUN's starting point guard, 
quit the team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So Coach Mel Hankinson is predicting a top 10 finish for The Master's College 
basketball team. Seems like only last season that Hankinson was saying the 
Mustangs would be galloping off to Kansas City, site of the NAIA championship 
tournament. Make sure those flight reservations are refundable. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, in its last postseason appearance, the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
football team won the Division II national championship. The Mustangs' coach: 
Joe Harper, who concluded his first season at Cal Lutheran a week ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after San Luis Obispo's football playoff victory over 
Northridge, Mustang Coach Lyle Setencich seemed to take a backhanded swipe at 
CSUN tailback Albert Fann. In praising his own tailback, Joe Fragiadakis, 
Setencich pointedly singled out Fragiadakis and Portland State's Curtis 
Delgardo as "the toughest running backs" in the Western Football Conference. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when Fragiadakis was being recruited out of DeAnza College, CSUN 
was one of his suitors. "We wanted him," CSUN Coach Bob Burt said. "But I think 
he took a look at (Fann) and decided he might not get much of a chance to 
play.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
Words of Wisdom, II: Setencich also stated the obvious -- that Cal Poly's 
defense was tailor-made to stop Northridge's tailback-oriented I formation 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, to a fault, seemed intent on proving otherwise. CSUN called a 
running play to Fann on the first play on all but three of its 15 possessions. 
Fann gained 26 yards on those 12 runs and finished with 80 yards in 31 carries. 
Jason Ferguson, with two yards in two carries, was the only other Matador 
running back to carry the ball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Vaughn led the team in tackles and Kenny Wallace topped the list in 
sacks, but the key player on defense for Northridge was the Matadors' own Mr. T 
-- Terrell Taylor. After one of CSUN's last practices, an unusually sloppy 
effort, a players-only meeting was called. The team captains called for the 
meeting, but Taylor did most of the talking. Said Burt: "He's not a captain, 
just the leader.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before Burt became coach in 1986, CSUN had seven winning seasons in 24 years of 
playing football. Burt's teams have finished above .500 five years in a row and 
his record with CSUN is 34-21, a .618 winning percentage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Albert Razo appears to be Northridge's punter of the future. In the 
Matadors' final two football games he punted 15 times for 637 yards, an average 
of 42.5 yards a kick. Razo, formerly a quarterback at La Habra, also faked a 
punt and threw a 13-yard pass to Eric Treibatch for a first down. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gene Urcan, CSUN's latest volleyball recruit, reminds Coach John Price of 
another 6-5 middle blocker -- Matador sophomore Coley Kyman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kane, CSUN's former career rushing leader, has not given up on his 
professional football aspirations. Kane, who completed his CSUN eligibility in 
1986, reportedly will give the World League of American Football a try. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Julie Arlotto, a senior from Simi Valley High, has started 86 consecutive games 
for the Northridge women's basketball team. After averaging 12.6 points and 5.4 
rebounds a game last season, Arlotto is No. 4 on CSUN's career scoring list 
with 1,018 points and is second with 280 free throws. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Walt Ker, coach of the CSUN women's volleyball team for 12 seasons, won match 
No. 350 last week against U. S. International. He has a career record of 
352-113, a winning percentage of .757. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Words of the wise: There's a cliche that says you're only as good as your last 
man. In cross-country, it's altered slightly to ". . . fifth man." Glendale 
College found that out the hard way last week in the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
No team had a better one-two punch than Glendale, but the Vaqueros still 
finished a disappointing sixth. Hugo Allan Garcia and Obed Aguirre finished 
first and seventh, respectively, but Vaquero runners three through five placed 
54th, 69th and 80th.

STATE FEATHERWEIGHT TITLE ON LINE FOR ARLETA'S RUELAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When 11-year-old Rafael Ruelas announced that he wanted to be a boxer, trainer 
Joe Goossen glanced at the 85-pound child from Arleta and, in a soft voice, 
told him to forget it. He used a soft voice because his normal speaking voice 
might have knocked over the amazingly skinny kid. 
</P>
<P>
But Ruelas persisted. And Goossen allowed him to start hanging around the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, eight years after that introduction, Ruelas and Goossen will 
step through the ropes at the Country Club in Reseda for a shot at the 
California featherweight championship. Ruelas, 19, will fight Richard Abila 
(21-6) of Las Vegas for the title in a scheduled 12-round bout. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas often has been sensational in piling up a 21-0 record with 18 knockouts. 
Between May and July of 1989 he fought four times and scored four knockouts, 
all in the third round. He followed that streak by knocking out his next four 
opponents in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Ruelas went against decidedly tougher competition. And while 
it took him a bit longer, the results were the same. He knocked out Job Walters 
of New York in the ninth round of a bout in Las Vegas and, in his most recent 
fight, knocked out Felipe de Jesus of Mexico in the seventh round in 
Sacramento. It was the first time either had been stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"People shouldn't lose sight of the fact that Rafael is only 19," said Dan 
Goossen, president of the Van Nuys-based Ten Goose Boxing Club and Ruelas' 
manager. "And at just 19, he is handling men in the ring, and handling them in 
a convincing style." 
</P>
<P>
And people are beginning to notice. Based on his performance against de Jesus, 
Ruelas has vaulted in the North American Boxing Federation ratings of 
contenders from No. 8 to No. 2. A victory Tuesday night will set up a strong 
bid for a world championship early next year, Goossen said. Among the 
possibilities is a bout against International Boxing Federation champion Troy 
Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
"It all seems like it has happened so fast," Ruelas said. "It just doesn't seem 
like it was very long ago when we got started, when I first put on gloves. It 
has gone by in a hurry. And, by next year, I want to be fighting for a world 
title." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the card will be an exhibition bout featuring World Boxing Council 
junior middleweight champion Terry Norris. Norris, who will fight Sugar Ray 
Leonard on Feb. 9 in Madison Square Garden, will take on two opponents in 
four-round bouts as part of his training for the Leonard fight. 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, former middleweight contender Alex Ramos of Simi Valley will 
take on Roberto Rosiles (21-11-1) of Mexicali, Mexico, in a scheduled 10-round 
bout. Ramos is 29-8-2 and will be fighting for the second time after a layoff 
of more than two years.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CSUN WOMEN FALL IN OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday was a day of firsts for the Cal State Northridge women's basketball 
team. The Matadors played their first game as a Division I team and their first 
game under Coach Janet Martin. 
</P>
<P>
They also experienced their first loss at the Division I level, falling, 68-35, 
to Cal State Fullerton in the first round of the four-team Fullerton 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge fell behind, 35-19, at halftime and struggled offensively throughout 
the evening, shooting 26% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's Julie Arlotto finished five of 13 from the field and scored a 
team-leading 10 points. No other Northridge starter scored more than four 
points. Haily Griffith and Jody Bittner came off the bench to support Arlotto 
with six points each. 
</P>
<P>
Arlotto grabbed eight rebounds, and point guard Joan Weinerth led the team with 
10 rebounds. Fullerton led Northridge in total rebounds, 43-42. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton center Genia Miller notched game-high totals of 24 points and 11 
rebounds. Former Golden West star Claudette Jackson had 11 points for 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In other women's games:

career high, scoring 20 points and pulling down 12 rebounds to lead the host 
Cougars in the nonconference victory. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (3-1) was aided by Keira Irwin's 15 points and eight assists and 
Shannon Solway's 10 points. Canyons' starting center, Jennifer Haig, was 
limited to about 10 minutes because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars took a 38-25 lead in the first half before Hancock (3-1) scored 11 
unanswered points. Canyons extended a nine-point halftime lead to 17 but again 
allowed a Hancock run that cut the lead to four points with four minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEN 
</P>
<P>
Cal Baptist 91, Cal Lutheran 80 -- The Kingsmen could not contain Cal Baptist's

FIDDLER ON THE MOVE;

<P>
THE HAUNTING THEME SONG FROM 'THE CIVIL WAR' HAS THRUST JAY UNGAR INTO THE 
LIMELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Burns, the producer of the acclaimed PBS documentary "The Civil War," 
recently had a fiddler named Jay Ungar over to his Walpole, N.H., house. Ungar 
and his friend, Molly Mason, were playing some music for Burns and his wife, 
when Burns asked to hear "Ashokan Farewell." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Burns needed an introduction to the haunting, mournful song. "Ashokan 
Farewell," written by Ungar, was the theme song to the 11-hour "Civil War" 
series, which aired in late September and became the most popular show ever on 
public television. Some 14 million people tuned in to the initial episode. 
</P>
<P>
Burns figures he's heard the song 2,000 times. Yet when Ungar and Mason played 
it in his house, Burns said he and his wife started to cry. "It is a remarkable 
piece of music," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't the only ones affected by the song, which was the sole piece of 
contemporary music in the series. Thousands of people have contacted Burns, the 
series' publicists, local PBS stations, music stores and Ungar trying to find a 
recording of the song or its sheet music, so that they can play the song 
themselves. One man in Georgia wrote Ungar that he bought a violin and began 
taking lessons just so he could learn "Ashokan Farewell." 
</P>
<P>
"I've literally gotten hundreds of letters from people desperate to find that 
tune," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ungar, previously an obscure professional musician who lives in 
the Catskill Mountain village of West Hurley, N.Y., is suddenly in the 
limelight. "Nobody anticipated the interest that would occur," he said. "It 
makes me really happy that it's touched that many people." 
</P>
<P>
It likely will also make him much wealthier. Because of the demand, Warner 
Communications' Elektra Nonesuch label plans to release the soundtrack of "The 
Civil War," including "Ashokan Farewell" and 27 other songs, on Wednesday. On 
the same date, radio stations will get a single of "Ashokan Farewell," and 
Warner's publishing unit is preparing the sheet music for mass distribution. 
(Ungar said he originally got $4,500 from Burns' production company for use of 
the song.) 
</P>
<P>
The song previously was available on a 1984 album called "Waltz of the Wind," 
performed by a group named Fiddle Fever and distributed by Flying Fish Records. 
Fiddle Fever is an occasional band that includes Ungar, Mason and Russ 
Barenberg, among others. 
</P>
<P>
When he listened to "Ashokan Farewell," Burns said he knew "it would be a 
fantastic piece of music for 'The Civil War,' " a five-year project that Burns 
was then just beginning to plan. "It contains all of the tragedy and 
bittersweetness that the Civil War speaks to us." 
</P>
<P>
The version of the song that introduces each chapter of "The Civil War" is 
taken straight from the "Waltz of the Wind" album, but Ungar and his friends 
also played variations of the song and other music for the series. 
</P>
<P>
Ungar, 44, composed the song in a couple of hours early one morning in 1982. He 
and Mason run a music-and-dance camp in the Catskills each summer at a place 
called the Ashokan Field Campus, which is owned by the State University of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult sometimes when these programs end to go back to the world of 
automobiles and telephones," he said. "I was feeling very sad from coming down 
from this wonderful experience and I started to express it musically, and this 
is the tune that resulted. I was actually in tears when I composed it." 
</P>
<P>
Ungar, who lives with Mason and his 14-year-old daughter, Ruth, was born in the 
Bronx and started playing the violin at age 7. When he's not performing with 
Fiddle Fever, he and Mason join other musicians to perform in concert, at 
dances or as studio musicians for filmmakers such as Burns. He also hosts a 
live music show on an Albany, N.Y., radio station. 
</P>
<P>
Ungar said he has trouble describing "Ashokan Farewell" in a word or two. "It 
has something about it that sounds like you've heard it before, and yet it's 
strangely different," he said. Ungar also isn't used to describing the song as 
a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the sort of tune that I would have ever imagined would come out as a 
single," he said. 
</P>

<P>
Photo, Jay Ungar's "Ashokan Farewell" became the musical signature of Ken 
Burns' widely seen PBS series "The Civil War," and is now sought after on 
record and sheet music. "I was actually in tears when I composed it," he says.

RICK DU BROW: CBS' DREAM SEASON TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE;

TELEVISION: THE NETWORK IS REELING FROM FINANCIAL REVERSALS BROUGHT ON BY ITS 
HEAVY INVESTMENT IN SPORTS PROGRAMMING.

<P>
CBS' flirtation with a glorious comeback is over. 
</P>
<P>
About all that the network could give thanks for this week was that it had 
nothing to do with Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
Just days after a memorial service for CBS Chairman William Paley, who died 
Oct. 26 at 89, his company experienced a nightmare of a week that foreshadowed 
dark days and a struggle for survival for the company he built. 
</P>
<P>
The signs were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' brief prime-time honeymoon behind "Designing Women" and "Murphy Brown" hit 
a snag as leaders NBC and ABC began to assert themselves in the November 
ratings sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, CBS was third again in the sweeps, which help determine ad rates for 
TV stations. And although it was still a surprising second in the overall 
season thus far, it was slipping significantly. 
</P>
<P>
But if CBS Entertainment at least was admirable in trying to mount a program 
revival under its new boss, Jeff Sagansky, the network's corporate side was 
suddenly reeling again from blow after blow under company President Laurence 
Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
In a stunning string of reversals, partly from huge failures with sports 
investments such as the World Series, CBS suffered these black eyes: 
</P>
<P>
* On the heels of a 30% dip in profits for the third quarter of this year, CBS 
said it will not only lose money in the fourth quarter -- but that the network 
will probably finish in the red next year. 
</P>
<P>
* CBS, which already has slashed its news staff, will lay off an additional 30 
to 50 employees of the division. All three networks have been pressed 
financially by the Persian Gulf crisis and a media-wide advertising slump. But 
ratings-weak CBS is the most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
* It now seems certain that CBS will lose nearly $100 million in the first year 
of its exclusive $1.08-billion contract for network rights to baseball. The 
contract is for four years. Bad luck hit CBS when Cincinnati swept Oakland in 
four games in the World Series, robbing the network of expected income in later 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
The American League playoff was also a four-game sweep, costing CBS more 
income. 
</P>
<P>
* To save $30 million, CBS said it will cut its compensation to its stations -- 
the money it pays them to run its shows -- by 20% next year. It's not the first 
network to try such a maneuver, and it won't be the last. But CBS isn't really 
strong enough now to throw its weight around. 
</P>
<P>
And with some affiliates angered by the move -- since they already figured next 
year's budgets with the compensation included -- they may well be open to 
overtures from sellers of syndicated programs who offer them a better payoff. 
</P>
<P>
What does this mean? It could mean disaster for CBS if angry affiliates decide 
to preempt the network's shows and run syndicated programs instead. Fewer 
stations running a network show means fewer viewers, lower ratings and, as a 
result, decreased advertising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
It could strike at the heart of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
* After Paley's death, it was reported that a major tax liability on his 8% 
share of CBS Inc. stock could cause his executors and family to sell it, thus 
making the network a possible takeover target again -- despite the 24.9% stake 
owned by Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Disney corporation is mentioned as a prospective buyer. 
</P>
<P>
CBS previously was wracked by uncertainty and financial headaches after raising 
money to fight off a takeover attempt by cable magnate Ted Turner. The network 
never fully recovered from the struggle -- and, as it turned out, might have 
been better off under the visionary Turner, who had the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
* In an embarrassing turn of affairs, CBS' main hope against takeover notions 
may be that it now is so unattractive financially -- with current losses, 
predicted losses, sliding ratings and the millstone of far too much money 
invested in sports programming. 
</P>
<P>
* Reports persist that Tisch, who has shown little expertise at show business 
and has sold off key parts of CBS, including its profitable records division, 
may be looking for a way to sell the company, period. 
</P>
<P>
It was not likely that anyone would try to sell CBS while Paley was alive, even 
though Tisch was the real power at the organization for the last few years as 
the largest stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
In another cost-cutting move, CBS has decided to cancel the glitzy affiliates 
meeting it holds each spring at the Century Plaza Hotel -- to which spouses and 
children also came -- and replace it with a strictly business annual gathering 
of station executives in New York. 
</P>
<P>
It probably makes good sense. CBS will save several million dollars. And NBC, 
and possibly ABC too, may be thinking of following suit. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all the foolishness of these affairs -- at which networks wine and 
dine their station owners and families in a star-studded, pep-rally kind of 
atmosphere heralding the new fall program lineup -- the no-nonsense approach 
only illuminates the growing signs of worry at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, it is clear proof of the diminishing fun in a business that has 
grown and thrived on flair and showmanship and now is in the hands of 
corporations that simply don't understand the entertainment world -- where 
flamboyance is as important as bookkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' tough situation is regrettable because it did make a flamboyant move in 
shelling out $3.6-billion for sports -- baseball, NFL football, NCAA tournament 
basketball and the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics -- in a daring gesture to win 
viewers and prove the network is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the move has backfired thus far -- not merely because CBS 
overpaid for the rights and put itself in a hole, as many believe, but also 
because of an amazing string of just plain bad breaks. 
</P>
<P>
There were, of course, those blowouts in the baseball championships -- with the 
result that CBS was only able to broadcast two-thirds of the potential 21 
post-season playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
But CBS has thrown snake-eyes in sports all year in what it called its "Dream 
Season." 
</P>
<P>
Here's what happened: 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco destroyed Denver in the Super Bowl, 55-10; hardly a spellbinding 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
* The Detroit Pistons wrapped up the NBA title against Portland in only five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
* The University of Nevada-Las Vegas blew away Duke for the college basketball 
title, 103-73, another yawner. 
</P>
<P>
* And the All-Star baseball game was delayed by rain for more than hour, ending 
late at night. 
</P>
<P>
For CBS, from the board room to the playing field, it's been the year of living 
dangerously.

MORTON DOWNEY JR. (ACTOR) IS BACK; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONALITY: HIS NOTORIETY SEEMS TO HAVE BOLSTERED HIS NEW CAREER AND GIVEN HIM 
CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH TO GO AT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PECCHIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morton Downey Jr. is on his best behavior. There are no in-your-face spritzing 
verbal tirades, no demeaning personal assaults, no intimidating scowls. He 
barks at his dog ("Chill, Sagittarius!") once when it threatens to scratch the 
closet door, but throughout this interview, Mr. Jerk is Mr. Nice Guy. 
</P>
<P>
It should come as no surprise. The man whom many critics accused of being an 
actor when he was claiming to be a passionate talk show host is now . . . an 
actor. Downey gleefully parodied Geraldo Rivera in a recent episode for HBO's 
"Tales From the Crypt" and appeared in NBC's TV movie "Thanksgiving Day," which 
aired Monday. He can also be seen in the feature film "Predator 2," as well as 
the upcoming "Down and Dirty." 
</P>
<P>
None of these roles is anything (even for him) to shout about, but you have to 
start somewhere and appreciate what comes your way. Downey, showing flashes of 
the old brilliance, says of his role in "Thanksgiving Day": "It's a great 
little part, I got to throw up on Mary Tyler Moore." 
</P>
<P>
Downey's notoriety seems to have bolstered his new career and given him 
confidence with which to go at it. He says his past has made him as qualified 
as anyone else in the acting game. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes from having been a vice president for a large American corporation," 
he says, beginning a rundown of his credentials. "It comes from having been a 
lobbyist . . . an activist . . . a demonstrator in the civil rights days . . . 
on the Democratic national party . . . an entertainer . . . broke . . . married 
. . . having to raise my own kids. I realized, I've lived every character 
that's out there." 
</P>
<P>
One of five children of Irish tenor Morton Downey and dancer/actress Barbara 
Bennet, young Morton Downey Jr. possessed the genes -- and the means -- to 
forge a successful future. But obstacles made their way into his upward path: 
an occasionally abusive father, an alcoholic mother who was dead by the time he 
was 19, long family separations. Downey figured a career in show business would 
be a stroll through the park compared to adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
So off he went -- singing, disc-jockeying and lobbying for political aspirants. 
Then came "The Morton Downey Jr. Show," and with it, relative infamy. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have to bring up that kind of intensity for 48 minutes, for the 
hourlong show, it really starts to take its toll," he says. "I found myself 
taking the Downey persona with me after taping, and it really began to get in 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
When ratings dipped and top markets began to drop his nightly screamfest, the 
producers yanked the plug midway during the second season. Downey claims the 
cancellation was due more to politics than to declining Nielsens. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the top markets went through executive changes, and the new guys in 
charge said, 'Pull Downey, I don't want him on our schedule.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the kinder, gentler Downey will press on. Scripts lay on his kitchen 
counter for his perusal, he says. Cable station CNBC's "Downey," a lighter 
version of the old show that he claims is intended to improve female 
demographics, rolls along. Recently, the loudmouth appeared as a panelist on 
NBC's revived "To Tell the Truth" but quickly tired of that format. Downey says 
he was offered the host's job on the revival but declined because being a game 
show host might undermine his movie career. 
</P>
<P>
The film role that broke the ice for Downey was the one he landed on "Predator 
2." When Spotlight, Downey's agency, submitted his name for the role of a 
reporter covering a smattering of grisly L.A. slayings, they pretty much got 
what they expected. Downey, using the anatomical obscenity that is often 
associated with his name (but cleaned up here to "jerk"), says who people think 
he is is his greatest strength. 
</P>
<P>
"(The agency) people came back with 'Downey Jr.? That jerk?' But the beauty of 
that is they all want to meet the jerk of all jerks. And when they meet him," 
whispers Downey conspiratorially, "it's kind of disquieting because I'm not the 
jerk I am on television."

IMMIGRANTS FULFILL A 'COVENANT' WITH GOD; 
</P>
<P>
JEWISH TRADITION: A LOCAL RABBI HAS UNDERTAKEN AN EFFORT TO GET SOVIET 
NEWCOMERS CIRCUMCISED. A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL IS HELPING OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The boys were frightened. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the hospital in a van about 7 a.m., they fidgeted in various 
examining rooms with their parents while the medical staff and rabbis prepared 
a nearby operating room for the morning's circumcisions. 
</P>
<P>
Finally a nurse summoned the first patient, a sturdy lad of 2 1/2 named Simon 
Elbaum. "This is what it means to be a Jew," explained his father, Boris. "It 
will be physical proof that he is Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
Thus Simon completed a religious obligation. A recent immigrant with his family 
from the Soviet Union, the youngster had never had the foreskin of his penis 
removed -- a procedure customarily performed on all Jewish boys eight days 
after birth as a mark of the Jewish people's special "covenant" with their God. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, such rituals were until very recently against the law. As 
a result, tens of thousands of Soviet Jews remain uncircumcised and, in the 
eyes of their religion, unfulfilled. "If you are not circumcised there is 
constant conflict between your body and your soul," said Rabbi Naftoli Estulin, 
director of the Los Angeles-based Chabad Russian Immigrant Program and a Soviet 
immigrant himself. "The soul is Jewish, but the body is not." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his ongoing effort to change all that, Estulin on Tuesday brought 
five Soviet Jewish children, ages 2 to 12, to St. Mary Medical Center in Long 
Beach. By next Wednesday he hopes that 23 children will have submitted to the 
knife wielded by a specially trained rabbi -- called a mohel -- followed by 
blessings over wine in the presence of family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a religious and social need in the community," said Dr. David 
Tillman, associate administrator of the hospital, which has donated the use of 
its operating room as well as the services of a staff urologist to act as an 
observer and an anesthesiologist to put the children to sleep. "As a Catholic 
hospital, we understand the importance of sacred ceremonies." 
</P>
<P>
Estulin, who has made it his personal mission to see to the circumcision of 
every Soviet Jewish immigrant in Los Angeles who wishes to undergo the 
procedure, says he has already overseen about 3,000 of the operations since 
1974. But the real push, he says, started just last spring when the 
liberalization of Soviet emigration policies caused a dramatic increase in the 
number of Soviet Jews arriving in Southern California. Since June, Estulin 
says, he has overseen about 300 circumcisions -- an average of more than 10 a 
week -- on patients ranging in age from 3 to 57. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the adults, Estulin says, undergo the procedure at regular Sunday 
clinics held in a Los Angeles urologist's office, where they are given a local 
anesthetic and afterward stitched up. 
</P>
<P>
But children, unlike babies who can be easily controlled and adults who can 
deal maturely with what they are experiencing, need to be given a general 
anesthetic, according to the rabbis. "They get nervous," said Rabbi Gershon 
Schusterman, Estulin's associate. "When they're sedated and sleeping, it 
simplifies the procedure immensely." 
</P>
<P>
So the children are taken to hospitals where the circumcision ceremony -- 
called a bris -- is performed in an operating room with a proper medical staff 
in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable," Estulin said. "On one side they are scared, but (the 
parents) are so happy after you tell them it was done." 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to be the mood on Tuesday as the young patients awaited their turn. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be real Jewish people," said Tamara Linchevsky, 31, whose 
6-year-old son, Boris, was next in line for the operation. "It's a good 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Linchevsky's husband David, 32, said he also needs circumcising but would wait 
to see how his son fared before submitting himself to the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
And Boris Elbaum, 29, said he had been circumcised just three months before and 
had now brought his son, Simon, in for the ritual. "It was a logical step in my 
life," Elbaum said of his own circumcision. "This is one of the steps towards 
personal harmony; I've fulfilled my obligation. It's a moving of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
Jews believe that the first circumcision was performed about 3,800 years ago by 
Abraham, who, at age 99, became his own first patient. Since then, they say, 
the rite, which Jews believe was commanded by God, has survived from generation 
to generation as one of the major distinguishing marks of Jewish identity. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups practice circumcision, too. Most Muslim men are circumcised for 
reasons having to do with religion and culture. And in America, doctors say, 
about 85% of newborn infant boys are routinely circumcised for preventive 
medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
While the practice came under fire in the mid-1970s by people who considered it 
unnecessary, said Dr. Stuart Chalfin, the staff urologist who observed 
Tuesday's procedures, recent studies showing that circumcised men are less 
likely to suffer from urinary infections and penile cancer have begun to swing 
the pendulum among medical practitioners back toward acceptance of the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"Now most urologists and pediatricians have come around to feeling that it is 
recommended," Chalfin said. "I think it's a good idea. A properly performed 
circumcision is safe and seems to be beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
Things went well on Tuesday, with the operations done by midafternoon. While 
the boys may experience some discomfort for up to two days, Chalfin said, they 
should have no difficulties after that and should be fully healed in about four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Following each operation, the two rabbis -- Estulin and Schusterman -- along 
with Rabbi Jacob Schechet, who served as the mohel, met with the patient and 
his family in the hospital's recovery room. There they recited blessings over 
wine, offered their congratulations and bestowed Hebrew names on the 
still-groggy boys. 
</P>
<P>
One observer added to the surreal quality of a scene featuring rabbis wearing 
prayer shawls and skullcaps over green hospital-issued surgeons' gowns. She was 
Sister Anne Hynes, a hospital chaplain and nun, who said she had come to her 
first bris to show her support for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all together on this," Hynes said. "Reaching out to other groups is part 
of the hospital's mission. These are our roots; the Jewish tradition. It gives 
meaning to Bible reading and Scripture studies and helps us be more effective 
in our ministries." 
</P>
<P>
Among the adult Jews, though, the dominant mood after the circumcisions seemed 
to be celebratory. "Mazel tov, mazel tov," the rabbis said to the Linchevskys, 
enthusiastically intoning the traditional Jewish congratulation. 
</P>
<P>
The parents beamed while their son bawled.

A LONE VOICE IS HEARD AS BISHOPS SKIRT 'PROBLEM'

A Roman Catholic bishop addressed the issue of the church's prohibition of 
contraception at a meeting in Washington of the church's U.S. hierarchy. But 
his was a lone voice. The others at the meeting last week skirted the 
"problem." 
</P>
<P>
Most Catholics reject the church's prohibition of contraception. This 
widespread dissent has been repeatedly documented and is widely recognized 
throughout the church. 
</P>
<P>
But the bishops don't talk about it, having been firmly called to heel about it 
by Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bishop Kenneth E. Untener, 53, of Saginaw, Mich., a warm, 
straightforward man standing at a microphone among about 300 of his fellow 
bishops, spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
"When the people disagree," he said, "it means something." 
</P>
<P>
"Some compare us to a dysfunctional family, which is unable to talk about its 
problem even though we all know about it." 
</P>
<P>
He urged attention to the sensus fidelium, or "sense of the faithful," which, 
as long taught in the church, often brings fuller understanding of Christian 
truth through ordinary believers. 
</P>
<P>
While the Holy Spirit acts through the "magisterium," the bishops, to guide the 
church, the Spirit also acts through the people, Untener said, and their 
convictions should be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that a document on sexuality that the bishops were considering advised 
those who dissent from the church's stand against contraception to prayerfully 
reconsider, he said they might respond: 
</P>
<P>
"We will if you will." 
</P>
<P>
It has become obvious that many lay people, many priests and even some bishops 
are not convinced that the ban on contraception is sound doctrine grounded in 
biblical principles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bishops should "listen to what this is saying about Christian understanding 
of sexuality and what it means for the family in marriage," he said, and 
added:. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't, it can cause great damage to the church at large." 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, none of the bishops took him up on it, although several thanked him 
privately for his courage in mentioning the unmentionable. One did refer to it 
glancingly as something to be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"There may still be questions and a considerable amount of dissent" about 
contraception because "we have been reticent in asserting our position," said 
Bishop James T. McHugh of Camden, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to assert values and principles" and "inform the new generation 
what that position is," he said of the sexuality document, which gently 
reiterated the ban and was approved. 
</P>
<P>
Although not mentioning the particular "problem," Auxiliary Bishop Austin B. 
Vaughan of New York wanted the entire sexuality document delayed to get 
response from parents, many of whom oppose its call for sex education. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that bishops aren't exactly suited to deal with the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all celibate," he said. "None of us are parents. By U.S. standards we're 
all aging. . . . We're not experts. We're a little out of touch with what's 
going on. We should give interested parents a shot at this document." 
</P>
<P>
Mentioned or not, the contraception issue has simmered for years in the church, 
going back to the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65, which started to take up 
the matter before Pope Paul VI removed it from council consideration. 
</P>
<P>
He put it before a papal commission of bishops, theologians and various 
experts. Eventually, a strong majority of them recommended modification of the 
contraception ban. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pope Paul rejected that recommendation and in 1968 issued his 
controversial encyclical, "Humanae Vitae," reasserting the prohibition and 
touching off waves of dissent among theologians and others. 
</P>
<P>
Several foreign national hierarchies expressed reservations about the 
encyclical. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys in this country have found that more than 80% of Catholics do not 
accept the teaching. Some scholars have contended that the encyclical has 
tended to undermine church teaching authority. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco told a synod of bishops in 
Rome that 70% of U.S. Catholics ignored the contraception ban and most priests 
supported that defiance of it. 
</P>
<P>
His candor somewhat backfired. When some news reports implied he had criticized 
the church position, he quickly made clear that he firmly backed it. 
</P>
<P>
Something of a further damper was put on the issue in 1987 when Pope John Paul 
met with a delegated group of bishops in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to dissent against the contraception ban, he said some claim this is 
"totally compatible with being a good Catholic and posed no obstacle to 
reception of the sacraments. This is a grave error."

The Jewish community of North America is facing "a crisis of major proportions" 
that has been caused by the lack of commitment to passing on Jewish ethnic and 
religious traditions to a new generation, according to a national commission 
that has studied the situation for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Jewish Education in North America, a body composed of 44 
scholars, educators, philanthropists and community officials, says it has found 
that "large numbers of Jews have lost interest in Jewish values, ideals and 
behavior, and there are many who no longer believe that Judaism has a role to 
play in their search for personal fulfillment and identity." 
</P>
<P>
The commission says this situation "has grave implications, not only for the 
richness of Jewish life but for the very continuity of a large segment of the 
Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, nearly 60% of the 1 million Jewish children of 
school age in North America do not receive any formal Jewish education. It says 
that only 40% of the Jewish children in the United States and 55% of those in 
Canada are currently enrolled in a Jewish school. 
</P>
<P>
In schools, the report says, "the presentation of the subject matter is often 
uninspiring, and there is a dearth of high-quality curricular and educational 
materials." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the commission recommends the raising of $25 million to $50 
million over the next five years to help to professionalize Jewish education, 
raise it to the top of the Jewish communal agenda and establish three to five 
"lead communities" to function as local laboratories for change.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev lashed out at Russian Federation leader 
Boris N. Yeltsin and other critics Friday after winning legislative blessing on 
his request for more powers to stabilize the economy and safeguard order. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, I have been criticized for the paralysis of power. Now that 
I'm trying to break free from it, we're being told that the president is 
establishing his own dictatorship," Gorbachev told a news conference in 
response to a question about his relations with Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Yeltsin, the Soviet leader's most powerful rival and the 
country's most popular politician, have been trading verbal blows over 
Gorbachev's latest plan to bring the Soviet economy into line and halt the 
breakdown of the state by restructuring the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
It was endorsed in general terms Friday by the Supreme Soviet, the national 
legislature, which gave Gorbachev two weeks to draw up a detailed blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was proposed by Gorbachev to resolve the "paralysis of power" brought 
about by several republics functioning independently and by the hostility of 
the state bureaucracy, headed by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, to 
Gorbachev's ambitious reform agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev's plan, the machinery of government -- the ministries and state 
commissions -- would be put under his direct control. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet resolution also enhances the president's already vast 
executive powers by authorizing unspecified "extraordinary powers" in the event 
of threat to human life or property. An earlier version of Gorbachev's plan was 
approved in principle Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The legislature also gave Gorbachev 14 days to work up a program to increase 
the availability of food in the shortage-plagued Soviet Union by compelling 
republics and local governments to honor agreements to supply food to other 
parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has condemned Gorbachev's plan as a move to shore up power for himself 
and stop drives for greater independence in Russia and the other 14 constituent 
republics. Yeltsin had proposed another solution to the crisis of power -- a 
coalition cabinet whose members would be proposed by the republics. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a political struggle of opposing forces, which have different aims," a 
clearly frustrated Gorbachev told reporters after being asked to comment on 
Yeltsin's criticism. "If someone opposes us, he opposes perestroika." Gorbachev 
said that his vision of the redivision of Soviet power agrees at least 80% with 
Yeltsin's proposals, but he stressed that he would not back down from a 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept the challenge by my opponents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some radical deputies supported the concept of more power for Gorbachev, saying 
the country needs to take drastic measures to halt the breakdown of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our food crisis is provoked by the destabilization of executive 
power," said Sergei B. Stankevich, deputy mayor of Moscow. "Yesterday I 
received notifications from nine regions of Russia that they are about to stop 
milk supplies to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"We only have dry milk supplies for about three days in Moscow. You can see how 
serious it is." 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak, whose city has voted to enact its first 
widespread food-rationing program since the end of World War II, even 
criticized the resolution as too weak. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not support it because I think it's a toothless resolution," Sobchak 
said. "I think we now need tougher measures, up to and including disbanding 
local organs of power that break laws by failing to fulfill contracts. This is 
creating a situation where large cities such as Leningrad . . . find themselves 
threatened by hunger." 
</P>
<P>
But liberal deputies cautioned that new powers for the president could be 
abused unless the republics are given a large role in determining who will hold 
the offices Gorbachev wants to create. There will be a Federation Council made 
up of leaders of the republics, which would have power to make important 
decisions, as well as a vice presidency and a Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"If this new system of executive power is not legitimized by the republics, it 
cannot end the war of words between the center and the republics," Stankevich 
said. "If there is just a strengthening of executive power without new 
relations with the republics, I'm afraid we could enter a new stage of 
dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
A draft of a new Union Treaty, which would fix relations between the republics 
and the Moscow-based central government, was handed out to members of the 
national and republican legislatures Friday and will be published in Soviet 
newspapers today, Gorbachev announced. 
</P>
<P>
Although several republics -- including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia and 
Georgia -- have served notice that they will not sign the new treaty, Gorbachev 
again stressed the importance of keeping the union together. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot divide the country. When attempts were made, the result was 
bloodshed and there were grave consequences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that individual republics will be able to secede only 
according to the rules spelled out in a law adopted this year and added that, 
if pushed, he will not hesitate to use his powers -- which include the ability 
to impose direct presidential rule -- to enforce order. 
</P>
<P>
"I should say that as president, in the final analysis, I also have my limits," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's patience was exhausted by a front-page article published Friday in 
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the country's largest daily newspaper, that harshly 
criticized his request for more power. 
</P>
<P>
"The president already has vast legitimate power, which none of his 
predecessors had," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's voice filled with anger as he attacked the article before the 
Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is ordered by a certain power that does not want the situation in the 
country to be normalized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told the news conference that his opponents have no grounds to 
criticize his resolution, because they have not suggested any worthy 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"Are there any plans that claim to be a serious challenge to our constructive 
program?" Gorbachev asked. "No. 
</P>
<P>
"They tend to oppose anything the president says today or tomorrow," he added, 
"even if the president says one thing today and another tomorrow."

BUSH, ASSAD MEET ON 'COMMON GOAL'; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: SYRIA HAS BEEN LABELED BY THE U.S. A MAJOR SUPPORTER OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. BUT THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL 'WORK CLOSELY WITH' 
THOSE OPPOSING BAGHDAD.

Proclaiming that he will "work closely with" any country willing to oppose 
Iraq, President Bush met here Friday with President Hafez Assad of Syria, a 
country the Administration has publicly labeled a major supporter of 
international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Assad, in a Holiday Inn just outside the airport here, was 
Bush's last, and most controversial, stop on an eight-day, six-nation, 
17,000-mile trek through Europe and the Middle East that was dominated by the 
President's efforts to solidify international support for his campaign against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I have one American troop, one man, one woman left there in the 
armed forces in this gulf, I will continue to work closely with all those who 
stand up against (Iraq's) aggression," Bush said in a press conference in Cairo 
several hours before meeting Assad. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows" that there are "differences between the United States and 
Syria on a wide array of questions," Bush said. But, he added, "we do have a 
common goal." 
</P>
<P>
The reference to unspecified "differences" was the closest Bush came to 
publicly mentioning the Administration's previously stated conclusions that 
Syria has been implicated in some of the most devastating terrorist acts of the 
last decade, including the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cairo press conference, which he held jointly with Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak, Bush also announced that he is "hoping to" meet with Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir when Shamir visits the United States early next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
That announcement could defuse some of the opposition to the Assad meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the United States and Israel have been strained in recent 
months, particularly since the United States joined in a U.N. Security Council 
resolution criticizing Israel over the killing of 20 Palestinians by police 
during fighting on Jerusalem's Temple Mount. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also predicted that he is "very, very close now" to getting Security 
Council approval of a resolution approving the use of force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of the status quo, and so is the rest of the world," Bush said. "I 
have confidence that we will be successful in the Security Council." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's two-hour meeting with Mubarak in Cairo and his three hours of talks with 
Assad here had virtually identical subjects but vastly different overtones. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has been one of the strongest U.S. allies in the Arab world, and his 
nation has had a strongly positive image in the United States ever since his 
predecessor, Anwar Sadat, signed a peace treaty with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Administration and its predecessors have placed Syria on the 
official list of countries involved in "state-supported terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, given that contrast, the White House took pains to minimize 
public view of Bush's talks with Assad while maximizing exposure of the Mubarak 
meeting. Bush's meeting with Mubarak was publicized weeks in advance, while the 
Assad meeting was announced only Wednesday. And Bush held an extensive 
televised press conference with Mubarak, but left here with no public comment. 
</P>
<P>
His staff later issued a written "readout," saying that Bush and Assad had 
undertaken a "full and frank" discussion that included "an extended 
conversation of the question of terrorism." Bush, according to the statement, 
also urged Assad to help win the release of American hostages held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush completed his frenetic diplomatic travels, the gulf crisis continued to 
occupy the attention of world officials. 
</P>
<P>
In London, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd predicted that the Security 
Council would meet sometime next week to vote on a resolution on force. But in 
China, where Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met with his 
Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, the Foreign Ministry issued an equivocal 
statement on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides stand for a political solution to the gulf crisis on the basis of 
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions," the official New China News Agency 
quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying after the 90-minute meeting between the 
two ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"They hold that so far as there is still hope for a peaceful solution, the 
international community should continue to work to that end and try its best to 
avoid a war," the statement continued. 
</P>
<P>
Because China and the Soviet Union -- along with Britain, France and the United 
States -- have the power to veto Security Council resolutions, Washington must 
win at least the other four nations' abstentions to gain the resolution Bush 
has been seeking. And in reality, abstentions probably would not suffice. The 
Administration badly wants explicit Soviet approval of any military action 
against Iraq. Officials believe that if the Soviets agree, the Chinese will go 
along to avoid being isolated on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have been eagerly seeking 
approval of a resolution on force against Iraq by the end of this month, when 
the U.S. term as head of the Security Council ends. The next nation holding the 
council's rotating monthly presidency is Yemen, which has tended to support 
Iraq in the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The need to hold together the international coalition against Iraq is at the 
heart of Bush's decision to hold the controversial meeting with Assad. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who met with Bush for about two hours Friday morning, said at the 
joint press conference that Syria "is one of the key countries" in the 
anti-Iraq coalition. "We shouldn't neglect it," Mubarak said. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has had angry relations with its neighbor Iraq for years and currently 
has 7,500 ground troops in the gulf as part of the U.S.-led multinational force 
lined up against Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Assad has pledged to at least double 
that force. Egypt has 15,000 troops in Saudi Arabia and has pledged another 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
But while Syria's help may be a military asset, it has also been a political 
problem for Bush. Because of Syria's involvement in terrorism in the past, U.S. 
officials avoided high-level meetings with Syrian officials throughout the 
1980s. The last President to meet Assad was Jimmy Carter in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, any meetings between U.S. and Syrian officials tend to further 
strain relations between the United States and Israel, which regards Syria as 
one of its most dangerous enemies. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel on Thursday, Defense Minister Moshe Arens criticized the meeting, 
saying that "in the Middle East, the meeting is the message." 
</P>
<P>
"Misunderstandings could arise when (Bush meets) Assad but prefers not to visit 
Israel," Arens said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Jerusalem Post said the summit sent a signal that "radicalism, 
fanaticism, terrorism and anti-Americanism pays." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, however, issued a considerably milder statement saying that Bush's 
meeting with Assad must be seen "against the backdrop of President Bush's major 
effort to form and maintain the coalition against Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
During his press conference, Bush rejected suggestions that the talks 
constituted any threat to Israel, saying that ending Iraq's occupation of the 
gulf is in the best interests of all nations in the region, including Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I am focusing now on . . . this gulf coalition; Syria's a part of it," Bush 
said. "Nobody should read more into it or less into it." 
</P>
<P>
The President also stepped around the delicate subject of Israel's relationship 
with the Palestinians, saying only that "the United States remains determined 
to be helpful, to be a catalyst in bringing peace to the West Bank question." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, too, was cautious on the issue. The "plight of the Palestinian people 
must be brought under focus. Their inherent rights to self-determination should 
be exercised," he said, adding that the current international coalition "shall 
address other problems with the same zeal and commitment" displayed in the 
struggle against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But Mubarak qualified his remarks by saying the Palestinian issue should be 
taken up "in the right context." He did not insist on any specific linkage 
between Arab support for the United States in the gulf and U.S. support for 
Arab claims against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Bush repeatedly has hinted that a defeat of Iraq could open the way for a peace 
settlement between Israel and the Arabs. But he has resisted linking the two 
issues explicitly. 
</P>
<P>
The connection between the two Middle Eastern conflicts remains among the most 
delicate international issues Bush faces in managing the effort against Iraq. 
And the issue has been highlighted by Bush's meeting with Assad, who has long 
been one of Israel's most implacable enemies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the long-standing enmity between Israel and Syria is precisely one of 
the reasons that makes U.S. officials consider Assad such an important ally in 
the gulf conflict. As a strident Arab nationalist, Assad has credibility with 
many Arabs who consider other leaders, including Mubarak and the royal families 
of the gulf, too conservative and too close to Western interests. Assad's 
involvement, therefore, helps blunt claims by Iraq's Hussein that the coalition 
against him is merely an attempt to restore Western colonial domination of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Syria has a long border with Iraq, and its military presence on 
Iraq's border helps tie down Iraqi troops who otherwise would be free to 
confront U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. Assad, however, has not yet said whether 
he would actually be willing to use his troops in a war against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Hafez Assad seized Syria's presidency in a 1970 coup. Assad met with President 
Carter in 1977 in what was the high point of U.S.-Syria ties. But the Camp 
David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel that Carter brokered in 1979 and 
the Reagan Administration's efforts to arrange a Lebanese-Israeli accord in 
1983 turned Syria against U.S. efforts in the Mideast. In 1984, U.S. warplanes 
attacked Syrian positions in Lebanon. In 1986, the State Department put Syria 
on its terrorism list because of the role of Syrian officials in an attempt to 
blow up an El Al flight.

COLOMBIA AND DRUG CARTEL SEEKING TRUCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Colombian government and the Medellin cocaine cartel dangled new carrots in 
front of each other Friday in what officials called the most promising effort 
to date to end the country's bloody anti-drug war. 
</P>
<P>
The Medellin cartel, led by Pablo Escobar, announced a truce Friday in its 
kidnaping campaign and promised to free several hostages if the government 
guarantees drug traffickers' safety. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials, in turn, said they were preparing the way for the 
surrender of hundreds of drug suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The official statements came after the unprecedented proposal by the cartel 
late Thursday to gather as many as 300 of its members in a high-security 
compound guarded by either the army or international human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
Evaluating both the cartel's proposal and the government's relatively warm 
response, analysts said both sides want to avoid any resurgence of bombings and 
other indiscriminate terrorist attacks -- the government because it wants to 
protect its popularity and the cartel because the government's strong 
anti-trafficker campaign has weakened it. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Colombian leaders who have been negotiating privately with the 
cartel delivered its offer to the government. The statement does not mention 
whether Escobar is among the traffickers proposing to confine themselves in a 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
The cartel's proposal and the government's response were hailed by many 
Colombian leaders Friday as evidence that the two sides are seeking an 
understanding to end the country's drug violence. Such an agreement would mark 
a drastic change in the government's policy of cracking down militarily on 
cocaine traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
However, other Colombian and foreign officials say they doubt that a final 
chapter is opening in the country's anti-drug war. They point out that 
traffickers are trying to place conditions on a government that has pledged 
never to negotiate with them. They also note that another cartel based in the 
city of Cali is not a party to the Medellin traffickers' plans. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the offer, the Medellin leaders say the government must 
guarantee their safety, prohibit their extradition to the United States and 
drop a demand that they confess their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The government responded to the cartel's statement by further softening its 
anti-drug stance. President Cesar Gaviria had already offered a deal to 
traffickers who surrender: a trial in Colombia rather than extradition, which 
the drug lords fear. He also promised reduced prison sentences for traffickers 
who confess their crimes and become informants. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo said after the cartel's offer that its members 
would have to confess only one of their crimes, not all of them, as Gaviria 
demanded when he announced his plan in September. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we are on the threshold of a transcendental act to bring peace to 
Colombia," Giraldo said in a television interview. He assured traffickers that 
they will not be extradited if they present themselves to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The country's director of criminal courts, Carlos Mejia, said Friday that the 
government would guarantee the safety and protect the legal rights of 
surrendering drug suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar and other cartel leaders are blamed for the killings of scores of 
judges, journalists and political leaders. The terrorist campaign intensified 
last year, when traffickers gunned down a leading presidential candidate, Sen. 
Luis Carlos Galan, at a campaign rally. 
</P>
<P>
The assassination prompted the government to decree both the extradition of 
drug suspects and the confiscation of their property. Traffickers responded 
with bombings and other attacks that killed about 550 people. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the cartel suspended its indiscriminate terrorism and began 
kidnaping journalists and other prominent Colombians in a more subtle attempt 
to pressure the government. Authorities blame the cartel for at least 10 recent 
abductions. 
</P>
<P>
The cartel's members say they are holding the hostages to protect themselves 
from police, whom they accuse of killing and torturing drug suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Justice Minister Giraldo announced a plan to try suspected 
traffickers using a system of multiple, anonymous judges. 
</P>
<P>
At the criminal courts division, Mejia said Friday that the government is 
"making arrangements for high-security prisons and cell blocks" for traffickers 
convicted under the new system, to be put in place in January. 
</P>
<P>
But many foreign officials say the plan will not work. 
</P>
<P>
"The Colombian government is still years away from being able to try and 
convict traffickers here," said a U.S. official familiar with narcotics matters 
in a recent interview in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
He and others doubt that traffickers will ever submit themselves even to 
Colombia's justice system, which has been damaged by the cartel's violence 
against judges. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier statements, the cartel's members have demanded that the government 
treat them not like common criminals but like fighters in one of the country's 
leftist guerrilla groups. An official peace plan offers guerrillas who give up 
their weapons a full amnesty for political crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel groups accepting the plan have gathered in so-called peace camps while 
they negotiate with officials. One of the groups, the M-19, laid down its arms, 
received a full pardon and transformed itself into a political party last April 
after gathering its forces in the town of Santo Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear from the cartel's proposal at what point its members would be 
disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, one of the leaders who has been 
negotiating with the cartel, said Friday that traffickers want to follow in the 
path of the M-19. 
</P>
<P>
"What would be carried out with the drug traffickers would be a process similar 
to that given to the M-19 gathered at Santo Domingo," Lopez said in a radio 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria, who served as campaign manager for the slain candidate Galan, has 
repeatedly denied amnesty for traffickers, whom he calls common criminals. 
</P>
<P>
But after taking office, the 43-year-old economist began offering the Medellin 
cartel incentives, including an end to extradition, to give up its fight.

Consumers crowded America's retailers on Friday, the start of the traditional 
Christmas shopping season, but the holiday spirit -- and gift buying -- was 
tempered by the specter of a national recession. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't whip out their credit cards," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of 
the Retail Marketing Report newsletter, after surveying shops and malls in the 
New York area. "Mostly," he added, "they were just looking." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the shopping season got off to a slow start Friday 
morning at many malls where crowds were sparse, lines relatively short and 
parking abundant. Some retailers blamed the warm, sunny weather for keeping 
people outdoors, and noted that business picked up at many shopping centers 
later in the day. Many consumers said it was hard to get into a shopping mood. 
</P>
<P>
"People are talking about cutbacks. There are too many crises," said Edward 
Johnson, a Pasadena resident who was looking to cut his holiday spending bill 
in half from last year by bargain hunting at the Glendale Galleria. "It just 
seems like it's not the time to go shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Along with growing concerns about the U.S. economy, the annual 
day-after-Thanksgiving outpouring of shoppers comes in a year that has 
witnessed a string of big retailing bankruptcies. To avoid big losses and 
profit declines posted over the past 12 months, many merchants have cut costs 
by firing thousands of workers and trimming inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers also have tried to attract customers with a blizzard of special 
sales, price markdowns and other promotional gimmicks, but those tactics 
appeared, at best, only moderately successful on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The subdued Christmas shopping mood of many consumers dovetailed with reports 
that consumer confidence has fallen to the lowest level since the 1981 
recession, largely because of the weakening economy and the Persian Gulf 
crisis. A survey released Friday by Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates, a leading 
market research firm, shows that consumers have continued to grow more cautious 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly survey of 450 households across the nation, the firm found that 
46% of those polled plan to spend less than they did a year ago on holiday 
gifts, versus 25% spending more. A year ago, heading into what proved to be a 
very weak Christmas for retailers, 36% said they planned to spend less and 33% 
predicted that they would spend more. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Chicago, observers said the crowds seemed thinner than a year ago 
and that shoppers were carrying fewer packages. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Baugh, a Salvation Army worker collecting Christmas donations on upscale 
North Michigan Avenue, said that last holiday season many shoppers "actually 
gave bills, but this year it's just spare change." 
</P>
<P>
In northwest Atlanta's Cumberland Mall, shoppers lined up to buy Reebok 
sneakers at discounts of up to 34% at a Rich's department store. 
</P>
<P>
One shopper, Alma Hart, said she bought $300 worth of sneakers. "A big sale 
like this helps," she said. Across the mall at a Macy's store, the shoe 
discounts were not as deep and the customer traffic was slower. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown San Francisco, early morning promotions at the Emporium department 
store on Market Street lured a horde of bargain hunters. Katy Sullivan, who 
came in from Fresno to get a jump on Christmas shopping, said the store seemed 
to be more crowded than in previous years, and the sale prices were much better 
than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of 30% off, it's more like 40% this year," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, already hit hard by Wall Street layoffs, major department stores 
appeared much less crowded than last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to be a busy day, but it wasn't," said a saleswoman in the 
small-appliance department at Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
Among the best-selling items was one of the least expensive: a slim, 
lightweight telephone, the Swisstel, selling for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
At Northline Mall in Houston, a city that has been buoyed by recent increases 
in crude oil prices, shoppers seemed to be doing more looking than buying. 
Despite national surveys showing concern about the economy, many people 
expressed no worries about their circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Rodriguez, a 33-year-old heavy-equipment operator for the city of 
Houston, said the Persian Gulf crisis "seems so far away, and I am not 
personally involved." 
</P>
<P>
He is going ahead with plans to buy his 9-year-old son a video game. "Santa 
will bring it," Rodriguez said. "Our Christmas this year will be the same as 
last year. Nothing has happened to make us cut back." 
</P>
<P>
The mood was even more upbeat among shoppers at upscale Bellevue Square, in the 
economically strong Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more money than I've ever had" for presents, said shopper Janet 
Knudsen. Still, Knudsen said, "It's perceived that everyone else is spending 
less this year, so I've scaled back, too." 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers and retailers in San Diego were also in a relatively upbeat mood. Dane 
Lowe of Poway, shopping at Horton Plaza in downtown San Diego, said she did not 
view the economy as "a real big problem. . . . If everyone buys into it being 
bad, then it will go down the tubes. It's a state of mind. If you want it to be 
bad, it will be." 
</P>
<P>
At the Fashion Valley shopping center north of San Diego, business was brisk 
throughout the day. Most merchants and shoppers said that sales and good buys 
were plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very busy. It's much better than last year," said Carol Ball, a 
fragrance counter manager at Robinson's department store. "Business has been 
down slightly (during the past several months), but we've been doing very well 
today." 
</P>
<P>
The mood at several other Southern California shopping centers was more subdued 
Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the crowds of past years, the day started with only a small knot of 
shoppers at the entrance to Nordstrom at Brea Mall in Orange County. "I thought 
there would be more (shoppers) down here," said Anita Rule of Anaheim, who had 
come to shop with her sister, Rachel Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
At South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, the giant mall's parking lots were half 
empty when the day began, but were nearly full with cars by mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Henwood, general manager of South Coast Plaza, said he was a little worried 
about the earlier small crowds, but was mindful of how Southern Californians 
appreciate a beautiful day and expected -- rightly, as it turned out -- that 
shoppers would show up in droves in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are doing better than anticipated," Henwood said. "We enjoyed a 
very relaxing start today with the weather outside. It was ideal." 
</P>
<P>
The morning shopping crowd at Century City Shopping Center and Marketplace was 
also sparse as Sylvia Morren, co-owner of Fil a Fil, arranged merchandise in 
the empty men's and women's shirt shop. "It was very slow last week, and we do 
not feel at all that it is the biggest shopping day of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Century City shopper Bertha Taylor said she is cutting her Christmas shopping 
back by half this year -- not because she has had a financial catastrophe, but 
because she is "worried about what's going to happen next" in this shaky 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Discount stores appeared to be doing a brisk business. The parking lots of a 
Target and nearby Pic 'N' Save in Pacoima were packed, in sharp contrast to a 
very quiet Sherman Oaks Galleria on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Carbajal, walking out of the Target store, said, "We're just being more 
careful" this year. "Usually we just kind of freely buy, but not this year," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts note that it is far too early to tell whether this will be the 
nation's fourth weak Christmas season in a row. Holiday business generally 
accounts for 50% or more of many big retailers' profits, so gloomy predictions 
have aroused deep concerns. 
</P>
<P>
With more and more shoppers in recent years waiting until the final week before 
Christmas to buy their gifts, the early days of the season play a less 
important role. Some retailers have also expressed hope that the early arrival 
of Thanksgiving this year, providing a longer shopping season, could boost 
business. They say that resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis would raise 
consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Also working in the retailers' favor is the fact that many shoppers -- even 
those who are worried about the economy -- are not about to scrimp on 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
In Century City, business was bustling at Toys International, where talking 
Bart Simpson dolls (Don't have a cow, man!) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
merchandise were particularly popular items. 
</P>
<P>
"People will cut back for themselves and buy strong for the kids," said manager 
John Brandt. "We are not seeing the horrible Christmas everyone's talking about 
in retail. . . . At worst, I'd say this will be a fair Christmas. We'll be up 
over last year."

BRITISH FIND WRECKAGE OF TRAWLER HIT BY ROYAL NAVY SUB; FOUR FEARED DEAD

Britain's Defense Ministry said Friday that it had found the wreckage of a 
fishing boat that was dragged underwater by a Royal Navy nuclear submarine, and 
that its four crew members were feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Defense Ministry official Archie Hamilton confirmed the trawler Antares 
had been pulled down when its nets were snagged by the submarine Trenchant. 
</P>
<P>
"The search for the crew continues but, sadly, it now seems extremely unlikely 
that they will be found alive," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
He told Parliament a full inquiry will be made but he rejected calls to suspend 
submarine movements in the area, saying this "would inhibit the activities of 
the Royal Navy to a very extensive degree." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's incident in the Firth of Clyde off western Scotland reopened a 
controversy over a series of sinkings and accidents to fishing boats for which 
the Defense Ministry has been blamed. 
</P>
<P>
A naval vessel's underwater video equipment spotted the wreckage of the 52-foot 
Antares early Friday 390 feet below the surface, the coast guard said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . People are getting angrier and angrier," said the Rev. Alastair Dunlop, 
a minister in Carradale, the trawler's home port. "Everybody finds it hard to 
believe that a modern submarine does not know there's a fishing boat above it."

TRAFFIC JAM SWEET FOR SCOOTER SALESMEN; 
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT: WITH THE MILITIA WAR OVER, PEOPLE ARE MOVING FREELY AGAIN. IT'S A READY 
MARKET FOR THE HANDY VESPA.

The Lebanese Vespa salesman is smiling. He has already sold six motor scooters, 
and it's only early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The snarled traffic in front of his shop is a delight to his eyes. His sales 
pitch is music to the ears of his customers: "On this scooter you can get from 
here to the other side in 15 minutes. Vespas hardly use any gas. And these 
fenders -- if someone opens a car door and hits you, you won't be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The salesman, Nabel Sheik Moussa, and his partner, Hajj Khaled, are making 
money hand over fist selling Vespas to Beirutis long frustrated by traffic 
jams. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, freedom of movement has been the first tangible result now that Beirut 
is almost free of battling militias. It seems as if everyone is on the move. 
</P>
<P>
The curious are crossing the old Green Line that traditionally divided 
Christian East Beirut from the mostly Muslim western half to see what there is 
to see. Merchants -- who never stopped making the crossing, even during long 
periods of constant militia battles -- do so now without fear of snipers or 
outbreaks of shelling. 
</P>
<P>
Army personnel are clearing the old downtown routes of land mines. And the 
nearby Ring Road soon will be open. The city's area previously was 10 square 
miles -- but now Greater Beirut encompasses 150 square miles of coast and 
mountains, including several ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
With everyone using their new freedom of movement, the streets have slowed to a 
crawl. Enter the Vespa. 
</P>
<P>
"Spare parts are available and cheap," Khaled proclaims, "and at checkpoints 
there's no delay. After all, there's no trunk to have to open." Until the 
Lebanese army took over the checkpoints last week, they were manned by 
militiamen who regularly demanded that drivers open their trunks for a security 
check. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the little cycles carry bankers wearing neckties, book-toting students and 
florist-shop delivery boys. Moussa tells the story of one school principal who 
bought a two-seater Vespa so her chauffeur could continue to work after she 
gave up using her car. 
</P>
<P>
The partners say that about 10% of their customers are women. Last week, Moussa 
sold Vespas to two nuns. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of militias from Beirut has brought not only a change of 
transportation but also a change of speech: Moussa used the term "other side," 
for example, rather than East Beirut. There is an obvious attempt to use the 
names of neighborhoods rather than referring to the long-divided Christian and 
Muslim sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The various militias, whose names translate as Party of God, Hope, Progressive, 
Promise, Unity, Liberation, Giants, Tigers and Guardians, are no longer 
publicly in evidence. They will be remembered primarily as extortionists, drug 
dealers and thieves. 
</P>
<P>
"No one will steal your Vespa," says Khaled, making another important point. 
"It's too small to attract the attention of the tough guys; they want Harleys." 
</P>
<P>
A bumper sticker seen on the Green Line -- officially, now, the former Green 
Line -- summed up how most Lebanese feel about the fall of the militias: "I 
like your approach; now I'd like to see your departure." 
</P>
<P>
But with "approach" and "departure" difficult because of clogged streets, there 
are those who think almost nostalgically of the times when shelling kept the 
traffic sparse and easy to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"Just one little shell," said a foreign resident wistfully, without intending 
anyone harm.

FOR MEXICO, THE ISSUE IS JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH-SALINAS TALKS WILL FOCUS ON FREE TRADE AND ITS IMPACT ON BOTH NATIONS.

<P>
When Presidents Bush and Carlos Salinas de Gortari sit down Monday afternoon to 
an outdoor lunch near the city hall of Agualeguas, a small farming community in 
northern Mexico, one issue will overshadow all others: jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will be meeting for the sixth time -- they first met as 
presidents-elect late in 1988. As other sensitive issues have slipped slightly 
from the top of the agenda in the touchy U.S.-Mexican relationship, the 
question of free trade and its impact on jobs in each country has only been 
magnified. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who is scheduled to return to Washington early today after a grueling 
weeklong trip to Europe and the Middle East, will set out for the 27-hour visit 
after spending barely two days at home. 
</P>
<P>
Although he could have easily added it to his five-country Latin American trip 
that begins Dec. 2, the President decided to make it a separate event to 
demonstrate the Administration's special interest in Mexico and its desire for 
improved economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUES: In the White House view, Salinas "is a new kind of Mexican leader," a 
Bush aide said. The 42-year-old Harvard-educated economist has tried to move 
his country toward market-oriented reforms, "and we want to encourage that 
process," the official explained. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush leads the applause, the cheering section will include Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. Even as Bush and Salinas confer, he will be 
taking a delegation of U.S. business executives around Mexico to talk on a more 
nitty-gritty level about trade and business prospects with their counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner, behind 
Canada and Japan. U.S. exports to Mexico last year were worth $25 billion, 
according to White House statistics. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike past years, when U.S. and Mexican leaders each had reasons for 
shying away from free-trade agreements, Salinas is now actively courting them, 
having proposed a free-trade agreement to Bush in June. The reason: to hang 
onto some of the capital now heading toward the competitive, low-cost 
production centers in Asia and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
OBSTACLES: But here's the rub: Although Bush and Salinas are likely to find 
themselves approximately on the same side of the fence on this issue -- a 
rarity in the often-acrimonious U.S.-Mexican relationship -- they are both 
likely to face opposition at home. 
</P>
<P>
As viewed by some on the U.S. side of the border, the opening up of trade could 
mean a further seepage of investment -- and jobs -- southward, prompting 
protests from Congress. And among Mexican opposition leaders, there is concern 
that a trade agreement, with the resulting expansion of foreign parti- cipation 
in the Mexican economy, would bring about exploitation of Mexican workers. 
</P>
<P>
While possible approaches and safeguards for those concerns may dominate the 
presidential sessions in northern Mexico, two other longstanding topics, drugs 
and immigration, will also require attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico wants to make sure the border remains open and people can come across, 
and we'll express our concerns about drug smuggling," the White House official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: An actual free-trade agreement could be several years away. 
Complicated terms must be negotiated. But Bush appears willing to count the 
trip a success if it produces merely harmonious discussions with the Mexican 
president and a sense of progress in the future toward eliminating tariffs 
between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll come away re-emphasizing the importance of an agreement and of getting 
to work on it quickly," said one White House official. "Keeping the economic 
relationship on track is the main thing."

MANILA UNDER FIRE FOR ITS DEALS ON MARCOS ASSETS

<P>
Vowing "no favors, no excuses," President Corazon Aquino's first official act 
in office in February, 1986, was to create a commission to chase at least $10 
billion in assets and cash allegedly looted from the impoverished nation by 
deposed dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos and his cronies. 
</P>
<P>
Today, nearly five years later, critics say that the Presidential Commission on 
Good Government has little to show for those high hopes except excuses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its ambitious aims, the commission has recovered only about $125 
million. And scandals appear endemic: Several former members, including the 
Philippines' present ambassador to Canada, Ramon Diaz, have been charged with 
graft, while 70% of the commission's field workers have been fired or 
reassigned because of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the commission now is making deals with two top beneficiaries of 
Marcos' corrupt regime: his widow, Imelda, and sugar czar Roberto Benedicto. A 
third key Marcos crony, Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., celebrated last week when 
Aquino's anti-graft court ordered the release of more than $1 billion in 
sequestered stock because commission lawyers had not filed proper papers. The 
government is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
All three cases have focused new disapproval on a watchdog group increasingly 
seen as a symbol for the inefficiency and corruption in Aquino's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate lesson is if you're going to steal in the Philippines, steal 
big," said Guy Sacerdoti, editor of the Philippine Economic Newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
In Imelda Marcos' case, a federal judge in Los Angeles has scheduled a Dec. 10 
hearing on a proposed settlement of a $5 billion lawsuit filed by the 
Philippine government. The agreement would give the Philippines an estimated 
$250 million, the results of a 60-40 split from seven Marcos-held bank accounts 
in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the Aquino government would drop the suit and agree to seek 
dismissal of civil cases pending in several other U.S. courts, as well as 
abroad. She was acquitted of criminal racketeering in New York last July. 
</P>
<P>
"The Imelda deal is not as bad as it looks," said Horacio Paredes, an Aquino 
spokesman. "I know we're talking $5 billion and settling for $250 million. . . 
. But it's practical. Making a deal with Imelda makes more sense than chasing 
her forever. Even if we win in court, how do we know we'll get $250 million?" 
</P>
<P>
The case doesn't affect up to $2 billion believed hidden in Marcos' 50 Swiss 
bank accounts. But Swiss officials have told the government that no money will 
be released unless Imelda Marcos is successfully prosecuted in the Philippines. 
That won't happen as long as Aquino continues to bar Marcos from returning home 
to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
"We're content to let the accounts stay frozen," Paredes said. 
</P>
<P>
The Benedicto deal, secretly signed in Singapore on Nov. 3, is drawing even 
more fire. Under the accord, the government agreed to provide absolute immunity 
from prosecution in exchange for $16 million from Swiss bank accounts, $15 
million in deposits at the California Overseas Bank and about $35 million in 
property and stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Benedicto will be granted immunity in criminal cases, given a passport, and 
allowed to keep at least $35 million in stock in 22 companies, as well as 
haciendas, planes, farmland and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear Benedicto is the winner," said political scientist Alex Magno. "The 
government gets companies that are losing money. Benedicto gets companies that 
are making money. In addition, the government recognizes his ownership of 
companies he was only fronting for. That means companies that were not legally 
his are now legally his." 
</P>
<P>
"It means crime pays," complained Tito T. Guingona, majority floor leader in 
the Senate. "It's illegal, unjust and inequitable." 
</P>
<P>
Even the commission's lawyer, solicitor general Frank Chavez, complained that 
Benedicto is returning "at most 10%" of Swiss bank holdings. The former Marcos 
crony "again put one over on the government," Chavez wrote in a public letter 
to commission chairman David M. Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Castro defends the deals as a way to avoid costly and lengthy litigation, as 
well as to raise badly needed foreign exchange for a government facing 
financial disaster from the gulf crisis and a ballooning trade deficit.

Leftist rebels shot down a Salvadoran fighter-bomber Friday in eastern El 
Salvador, killing the pilot, military sources and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the armed forces press office said the jet crashed because of 
mechanical failure. 
</P>
<P>
A soldier at the army's 6th Infantry Brigade in Usulutan city said the A-37 
Dragonfly was downed near Santa Elena while it was providing air support to 
government soldiers battling guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Air force sources confirmed that the plane was shot down and that the pilot, 
Lt. Eduardo Escobar Amaya, was killed. They said the other crew member bailed 
out and was hospitalized with undisclosed injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A local resident who asked not to be identified said the plane was seen being 
shot down by a SAM-7 ground-to-air missile. However, the air force sources said 
the rebels used machine guns. They are known to have Soviet-made 
12.7-millimeter machine guns, which they used last year to shoot down another 
fighter-bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Both the soldier and the air force sources insisted on anonymity. Rebel 
officials had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
A communique by the armed forces press office confirmed the pilot's death and 
crewman's injury. However, it said the plane went down because of mechanical 
failure.

DEMOCRATS CHALLENGE OVERTURE TO SYRIA; 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM: BUSH-ASSAD MEETING WAS 'ILL-ADVISED,' SENATE MAJORITY LEADER 
MITCHELL SAYS. BUT REPUBLICANS DEFEND THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION.

<P>
Democratic congressional leaders expressed strong reservations Friday about 
President Bush's discussion of the Persian Gulf crisis with Syrian President 
Hafez Assad, whose nation remains on the State Department's list of countries 
that support terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
While Republicans guardedly defended the President's meeting with Assad in 
Geneva, Democratic leaders of the House and Senate urged Bush to avoid forming 
a new alliance with Syria just because it opposes Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest criticism came from Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.), who called the meeting "ill-advised." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Syria has a "worse than dismal record on human rights" abuses as 
well as a history of "condoning terrorism," Mitchell said he had "grave 
reservations" about the meeting, which ended a decade-long U.S. policy of 
shunning high-level contacts with the Syrian regime. 
</P>
<P>
Although lower-ranking U.S. emissaries have met periodically with senior Syrian 
officials, including Assad, the meeting in Geneva was the first summit-level 
session between the two countries in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) was less critical, saying Bush's 
decision was based on "pragmatic" considerations. However, he said he shared 
Mitchell's "serious concern" because of Syria's record of supporting terrorism, 
including its implication in the midair bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there are deep concerns about Syria's connection, in our country's 
opinion, with incidents of terrorism," Foley said in an interview on the Fox 
Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
Defending his decision to meet with Assad, Bush told reporters that, despite 
his differences with Assad, he is willing to "work closely with" any country 
that joins the anti-Iraqi coalition and that "stands up against aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell and Foley's Republican counterparts, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
of Kansas and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois, both 
supported that view -- with Michel likening it to the Western alliance with 
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"We married up with Stalin in our own self-interest," Michel noted, suggesting 
that Syria's support could be crucial in the event war breaks out with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Dole said that while "we don't have to embrace Assad . . . and must be very 
careful in our dealings with him," it is useful to have a dialogue with Syria 
because "we happen to be on the same side" in the present crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Dole added that Syria had been "helpful" in arranging the release of some of 
the Western hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon and expressed the 
hope that Bush's meeting with Assad could lead to more releases. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the controversial meeting is likely to add fuel to an already 
smoldering fire on Capitol Hill, where hearings begin next week on Bush's gulf 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats called the hearings after Bush announced last week that he is nearly 
doubling the size of the U.S. military deployment in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ignited what House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Les 
Aspin (D-Wis.) called a "mini-firestorm" of criticism because of concern that 
Bush may be preparing to abandon diplomacy in favor of military action to force 
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell and Foley, just back from Saudi Arabia, where they joined Bush in 
celebrating Thanksgiving with American troops, said they are now convinced that 
the additional buildup does not yet signal a change in policy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no decision yet to use U.S. forces affirmatively or offensively," 
Foley said in an interview on CBS' "This Morning."

In the wake of large anti-U.S. and pro-Iraqi demonstrations in Sudan, the State 
Department on Friday authorized embassy dependents to leave the country and 
warned American private citizens to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary military government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir has 
sided with Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Well-managed demonstrations have been reported in cities including the capital, 
Khartoum. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State Department said there is reason to believe there is a 
high potential for anti-American terrorist attacks in Khartoum. 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said this week that there is evidence that Iraqi-backed 
terrorists have been casing American installations in Khartoum in preparation 
for a possible wave of actions against U.S. diplomats and citizens if 
hostilities should break out in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, continuing drought and famine, compounded by civil 
war, have made the western and southern Sudan unsafe for travel. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is a principal supplier of food aid to Sudan, despite the 
difficulty of delivering supplies to refugee centers, where an estimated 3 
million to 4 million people are at risk of starvation.

The Irish Republican Army forced a kidnaped driver to deliver the biggest bomb 
it has ever used against British troops in Northern Ireland, police said. But 
the "human bomb" attack against a security checkpoint near Rosslea failed when 
the driver of a van packed with 3,300 pounds of explosives warned security 
forces, and only the detonator exploded. The driver and soldiers were unhurt.

Major opposition parties said they will boycott elections next month in Serbia, 
the biggest Yugoslav republic, because Communist officials rejected demands to 
change rules on casting and counting ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 9 voting will be the republic's first multi-party parliamentary 
election since the Communist takeover in 1945. But the 12 parties said 
authorities plan to rig the vote. Serbia's Communist-controlled Parliament 
denied requests to allow opposition officials on state-run ballot-counting 
commissions and to permit some Serbs abroad to vote.

Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Druze Arab and captured a second trying to 
cross from the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights into Syria, the army said. 
Military sources said mountain trails in the area are used by both spies and 
smugglers, and that the incident was the first of its kind in the area for at 
least five years. About 15,000 Druze, members of a secretive Islamic sect, live 
on the strategic plateau that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast 
war and annexed in 1981.

Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said Poland is unable to pay the interest on 
its $42-billion foreign debt and called on the West, including the United 
States, to help Warsaw's bold reforms with extra aid for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki said Poland made substantial progress last year, with inflation 
dropping from 80% in January to 4% in November. "We are closer to a market 
economy," he said. But he said Poles paid a high price, with drops in 
production and wages, and higher unemployment.

VETO OF DAM MAY END WATER DIVERSION PROJECTS IN WEST 
</P>

<P>
Supporters and opponents agreed Friday that the veto of the Two Forks Dam 
project in Colorado could spell the end of huge projects aimed at diverting 
water in the water-scarce West. 
</P>
<P>
But both sides also agreed that the decision by the Environmental Protection 
Agency to kill the Denver-area project would not spell the end of the fight 
over a project that pits developers against conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA confirmed Friday that it would not approve construction of the Two 
Forks Dam project, the largest non-federal water project in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's assistant administrator for water, LaJuana S. Wilcher, said she 
would uphold the recommendation of the EPA's Denver office to bar construction 
of the 615-foot dam just downstream of the confluence of the South Platte River 
and its North Fork. 
</P>
<P>
"The applicants made a good-faith effort to downscale the project size and 
compensate for the loss of wetlands and aquatic resources," Wilcher said. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the smaller project would still flood 24 miles of freely flowing, 
scenic stream and almost 11 miles of gold medal trout fishery. . . . It would 
inundate an area of unquestionable natural beauty that provides a diversity of 
fishing and recreational opportunities and a rich aquatic habitat close to the 
Denver metropolitan area." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Denver wants the project to increase water supplies for its 
suburbs. The project calls for building the dam to creating a reservoir on the 
South Platte River, southwest of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision affects not just Denver, but it may be the end of all big water 
projects," said William H. Van Schooneveld, chairman of the group behind the 
project. "If EPA can veto this, there really isn't any project that anybody can 
develop that can pass the EPA." 
</P>
<P>
Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society, agreed on the 
veto's significance. 
</P>
<P>
"It says once again that the era of building these enormous projects is over," 
she said, adding that the agency has previously used its veto powers under the 
Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of those vetoes are final, however, and a federal court in Virginia 
recently reversed a veto. "There are a lot of grounds for appeal," Van 
Schooneveld said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Denver Water Board has fought like crazy for this project over the years," 
Babcock said. "I would be amazed -- they have a lot of high-priced lawyers -- 
if they didn't go to court on this." 
</P>
<P>
Big dams have made possible the growth of big cities and farms in the West. 
Critics say that too much water has been diverted, threatening the balance of 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers in March, 1989, approved a permit to build the dam, 
and former Ronald Reagan Administration officials had indicated support for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Babcock said the veto decision "is extremely significant, in particular, 
because of what it says about Reilly and his EPA." Reilly was appointed by 
President Bush.

ASSAULTS ON WOMEN, 'RAPE LISTS' ALTER BROWN UNIVERSITY POLICY

Student outcry over sexual assaults on women and anonymously posted lists of 
alleged male rapists on bathroom walls has prompted Brown University to require 
special orientation seminars starting next fall for freshmen, an official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Ivy League university will also see to it that every student who comes 
forward with an assault or harassment complaint is provided with a trained 
advocate who will follow their case through, said Robert Reichley, executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is there have been many mechanisms by which woman who 
have suffered any kind of assault or harassment could bring their case 
forward," Reichley said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do most is make sure that henceforth . . . we are going 
to, in addition, provide an advocate. That person will be there to provide help 
and counseling to whoever wishes to pursue a case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The steps are being taken in the wake of a stormy forum on campus last week in 
which members of the audience -- most of them women -- criticized university 
officials for being insensitive and indifferent to the issues of sexual assault 
and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the controversy that led to the forum came from an anonymously authored 
"rape list" that has appeared repeatedly on the walls of bathrooms on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The list has contained as many as 30 names of male students who women allege 
raped them. In turn, men who have been named have complained to the university, 
although administration officials say there is little they can do because the 
charges against them have been made anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
Reichley said the university sympathizes with the anger that women on campus 
feel, but he said the school in no way condones the list. Janitors have been 
scrubbing the list away when they find it and will continue to do so, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no more fair and just for women to write on a wall accusing men of a 
serious crime, and to do so anonymously, than it is for men to write the names 
of women on restroom walls and suggest they are available," Reichley said. 
</P>
<P>
Reichley said the university will issue a lengthier announcement Monday on 
steps it plans to take regarding sexual assault and harassment on campus.

The CDC will use a telephone monitoring system to track cases of respiratory

serious respiratory ailments, especially in young children. Previously, health 
officials had alerted the CDC of outbreaks by weekly postcards. CDC officials 
said they will help doctors and public health officials learn of outbreaks 
sooner, thus cutting down on diagnostic testing of ill children.

RISKS SEEN IN DECISION NOT TO SPRAY FOR MEDFLIES; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: OFFICIALS DON'T WANT TO 'JUMP THE GUN' AFTER FIND, BUT SOME 
EXPERTS FEAR AN OUTBREAK. 
</P>

<P>
The decision not to begin malathion spraying in San Bernardino County, despite 
the discovery of two Mediterranean fruit flies there earlier this month, is a 
potentially risky move that bends established guidelines on eradication of the 
pest, agriculture officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's risk in anything, but I don't think it's that risky," said Roy 
Cunningham, a USDA entomologist and chairman of the state's science advisory 
panel on the Medfly. "We can't jump the gun on this thing." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real risk," said Richard Rice, a UC Davis entomologist who also serves 
on the advisory panel. "My concern is that if we don't respond now, we're going 
to deal with it on a larger scale next spring." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reynolds, western regional director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
said the latest discoveries were in two intensely monitored areas and were 
probably isolated finds that pose no immediate threat. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that it's not clear what we've got," Reynolds said. 
"Obviously, we don't want to play games with this because it could be a costly 
decision. But at this point in time, we don't have enough information to say 
there is a breeding population." 
</P>
<P>
In previous eradication campaigns, malathion spraying has been ordered whenever 
two Medflies were found within three miles of each other -- a criterion that 
the San Bernardino finds fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
But officials have decided on a more "flexible" approach, according to 
Reynolds, because no other flies have been found, and because they worry about 
waging another long, costly and controversial eradication campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are just guidelines," Reynolds said of the three-mile standard. "You've 
got to weigh all the factors." 
</P>
<P>
While residents in the affected area will be spared the rumbling flights of 
malathion helicopters for the time being, some of the state's scientific 
advisers are questioning whether the "wait-and-see" approach is courting a 
larger and more intense outbreak later. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the discovery of the two latest female flies in virtually the same 
area infested earlier this year supports contentions that the Medfly is 
entrenched in Southern California and continues to survive despite official 
claims of eradication. 
</P>
<P>
"It suggests to me that we haven't eradicated the Medfly," Rice said. "I'd 
rather see us take a stronger approach and really clean this thing out." 
</P>
<P>
The two Medflies were discovered Nov. 15 in Rancho Cucamonga and Upland, a week 
after local, state and federal agriculture officials had jubilantly declared 
victory in their 16-month, $52-million war against the Medfly. The campaign was 
the largest ever waged in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said the latest finds pose a quandary for them. 
</P>
<P>
Doing nothing now could open the possibility of a Medfly population explosion 
in the spring. But launching an eradication program now, in the winter, when 
the life span of the Medfly can reach up to four months -- compared to three 
weeks in warmer weather -- would require malathion spraying and sterile fly 
releases at least until May. 
</P>
<P>
"An eradication program now would have to be one of these long, drawn-out 
winter programs. There's a tremendous cost," Cunningham said. "Of course, no 
one wants to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said he supports delaying such a program, at least for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, of the USDA, said Friday that a survey of traps in the same area this 
week failed to turn up any new Medflies, bolstering his belief in the 
wait-and-see strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the information we have now, I have no concern," he said. "But if 
another one is found, that would certainly change things."

The body of Thousand Oaks motel executive William Crimmins, described by 
friends as an excellent pilot, was found Friday along with the body of a woman 
passenger in the burned wreckage of his single-engine airplane in the mountains 
near Kingman, Ariz., officials with the Arizona Civil Air Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Crimmins, 57, and passenger Lavonne DeSchpper had taken off from South Dakota 
and were reported missing Monday when they failed to land in Thermal, Calif., 
where DeSchpper was planning to spend Thanksgiving with friends. 
</P>
<P>
They were last seen Monday evening leaving an airport at Grand Junction, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
A search by the Civil Air Patrols of California and Arizona began Tuesday and 
ended Friday afternoon, when one of the crews saw the wreckage from the air 
about 8,400 feet up the side of a mountain southeast of Kingman. 
</P>
<P>
Crimmins, a vice president of Motel 6, and DeSchpper died instantly and the 
plane's emergency locater transmitter was destroyed on impact, said Joyce 
Kienitz, public affairs officer for the Arizona Civil Air Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Kienitz said that it is unclear what might have caused the crash, but that 
Crimmins was "a very safety-conscious pilot who didn't seem the type to travel 
in bad weather." The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the 
crash.

FOREST RANGERS ON LOOKOUT FOR TREE RUSTLERS

<P>
Christmas tree rustling in California's national forests is one holiday season 
rite that must be stopped, forest rangers said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot people think that if I just take one, it's not a problem," said Carla 
Van Dyne at the Tujunga district office of Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they start cutting or even damage (the tree), it is going to die." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service officials said tree poachers are a problem in the Los 
Padres, Angeles and San Bernardino national forests, stretching from Ventura to 
San Bernardino counties. Tree thievery is especially serious in Southern 
California forests because there are relatively few evergreens to begin with, 
and the trees face disease, insects and smog, foresters said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Padres National Forest in northern Ventura County has only six federal 
employees to keep watch over the 500,000-acre Mt. Pinos reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty for taking a tree is usually a $50 fine, but the penalty can be as 
heavy as a $5,000 fine and include a one-year jail term.

STUDY FINDS SHARP RISE IN OZONE DAMAGE TO YOSEMITE PINE TREES 
</P>

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of pine trees in Yosemite park damaged by ozone has increased 
fivefold in the last five years, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
The report says 29.7% of Yosemite's pines show mottling caused by damage from 
ozone, a colorless, odorless gas produced by auto and industrial emissions. A 
similar study in 1985 found 5.7% of the trees had suffered damage then, the 
National Park Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Yosemite, which celebrated its 100th birthday as a national park 
Oct. 1, said they need to study the 1990 findings before they can comment on 
ways to alleviate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A decade-old master plan for the park in the central Sierra Nevada calls for 
abolishing vehicle traffic by tourists into Yosemite Valley, their prime 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
No timetable has been announced to force tourists to switch to trams or buses 
and leave their cars above Yosemite Valley. National Park Service Director 
James Ridenour has promised that park maintenance facilities will be moved out 
of the valley, perhaps starting in the 1992 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone damage is widespread in the park, according to the 1990 study that Dan M. 
Duriscoe of Three Rivers, Calif., prepared for the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the results of this study, no area in the yellow pine zone can be 
said to be free of ozone pollution," Duriscoe wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeffrey and ponderosa pine with visible ozone injury had poorer needle 
retention than uninjured trees," he said. "Of the 1,650 trees sampled, three 
were found with obvious severe ozone stress -- very thin crowns and chlorotic 
mottle on the current year's needles. If ozone concentrations continue at their 
present level or increase, these (trees) will die or will continue to exist in 
a state of decline." 
</P>
<P>
The effects of ozone in the Sierra Nevada were discovered in the 1970s at 
Sequoia National Park, 100 miles south of Yosemite and less than 150 miles 
north of Los Angeles. The Park Service has commissioned research to determine 
if ozone affects giant sequoias as it does pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Ewell, Sequoia's air quality specialist, said officials may start a 
system to warn visitors when the park's ozone is high, much like the smog stage 
alerts in the Los Angeles Basin.

Roald Dahl, author of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," "James and the Giant 
Peach" and other tales for children, died Friday, his agent said. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl died at John Radcliffe Hospital, where he was admitted Nov. 12 with an 
undisclosed infection, according to his agent, Murray Pollinger. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl wrote nine books of short stories, three novels, 19 children's books, and 
numerous screenplays and scripts for television, including "Tales of the 
Unexpected." Last year, his total paperback sales in Britain topped 2.3 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was adapted for the film "Willy Wonka and 
the Chocolate Factory." Dahl also wrote the screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 
book "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang." 
</P>
<P>
Dahl was born Sept. 13, 1916. He is survived by one son and four daughters by 
his marriage to actress Patricia Neal; another daughter is deceased. Neal and 
Dahl were divorced in 1983 and he married Felicity Ann Crosland.

There was a slight increase in the number of abortions performed in the United 
States, the Centers for Disease Control reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC said 17,614 more abortions were performed in 1988 than in the preceding 
year, an increase of 1.3%. In 1988, 1,371,285 abortions were reported, and in 
1987 there were 1,353,671 abortions, according to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
But the national ratio -- the number of abortions per 1,000 live births -- 
dropped from 356 to 352, officials said.

PILOT DIES IN FIERY CRASH OF HELICOPTER; 
</P>
<P>
FATALITY: ACCIDENT OCCURRED ON RANCH USED EXTENSIVELY FOR FILMS AND 
COMMERCIALS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The pilot of a small helicopter died Friday when his aircraft crashed and 
burned just north of Simi Valley in hills frequently used as a backdrop for 
films, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred about 4:15 p.m. in a remote area of Big Sky Movie Ranch at 
the north end of Erringer Road, Ventura County Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot's identity was not available Friday, and the cause of the crash had 
not been determined, Ventura County Fire Capt. Jim Arledge said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department and Federal Aviation Administration are 
conducting a joint investigation of the crash, Sheriff's Deputy Mo Tua said. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Littlefield, 22, and Philip Derryman, 14, said they were tossing a 
football along Erringer Road when they heard the "rough-running engine" of the 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we heard, not a crash, but like a crunch," Littlefield said. "About 30 
seconds later, we saw a plume of black smoke coming up. We ran to the top of 
the first hill, looked down and saw the fire." They ran to a neighbor's house 
to report the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of our biggest fears," said Debra Early, manager of Big Sky Movie 
Ranch. "Helicopters hover over all of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Early said she did not know why the privately owned helicopter was flying over 
the ranch and said it was not working on a film production. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch's 9,400 acres of hills and canyons have been used extensively by 
Hollywood production crews for such television shows as "Little House on the 
Prairie" and "Rawhide." The helicopter crashed in a hilly area used recently to 
shoot television commercials for Mazda trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Arledge said firefighters extinguished a small blaze and later sprayed down the 
wreckage that was scattered over a 100-foot area. 
</P>
<P>
Arledge said firefighters were lucky that the area where the crash occurred was 
mostly dirt, because strong winds Friday would have caused the fire to spread 
quickly.

PROTESTERS SHOP FOR AUDIENCE AT MALLS; 
</P>
<P>
DISSENT: CUSTOMERS ARE THE TARGET OF GROUPS SUPPORTING ANIMAL RIGHTS AND THOSE 
OPPOSING ABORTION AND WAR.

Shopping malls may be well established as the hub of Southern California social 
life, but on Friday they became political parade grounds as well, where 
anti-abortion and anti-war protesters, animal-rights advocates and opponents of 
China's Communist government demonstrated before crowds of holiday shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino's Central City Mall, shoppers expecting to be welcomed by 
red-costumed Santa Clauses and holiday decorations watched as animal-rights 
protesters filed past in a solemn funeral procession for minks and foxes killed 
for their fur. Some protesters toted a cage similar to those used to hold 
fur-bearing animals. Others unfurled lynx stoles with the heads still on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a wonderful day to have a protest," said Susan Finsen, a 
spokeswoman for Californians for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. "Better that 
shoppers see this now than later -- after they're stuck with these objects 
they'll be embarrassed to wear." 
</P>
<P>
Fur protests have become such an annual post-Thanksgiving event over the past 
three years that pelt industry officials manned telephone lines Friday to 
counter such picket sign messages as "Fur Coats Are Worn by Beautiful Animals 
and Ugly People" and "Fur Free America." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they do it because this is the No. 1 shopping day of the year and 
folks are deciding on their winter garments," said Tim Sullivan, animal welfare 
director for Fur Farm Animal Welfare Coalition, a pro-fur organization. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan insisted that fur-producing animals are treated humanely. "Only good 
quality care," he said, "can produce a fine quality pelt, particularly on an 
animal whose chief commodity is what it's wearing on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 anti-abortion protesters stopped patrons in front of Mervyn's and 
Target retail chain stores in a Torrance shopping center, complaining that the 
stores were in league with abortion advocates. They were joined by similar 
demonstrations in San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange county malls. 
</P>
<P>
Monika Moreno, 29, a spokeswoman for the Torrance abortion protesters, said 
that they took aim at Target and Mervyn's because their parent company, 
Dayton-Hudson Corp., made a one-year, $18,000 grant to Planned Parenthood of 
Minnesota -- a group aligned with abortion rights forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The day after Thanksgiving and Christmas are traditionally the biggest 
shopping days of the year," said Moreno. "We're here to get to the shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
Target employees passed out a Dayton-Hudson leaflet insisting that the grant 
was not being used to support abortions and that the firm has taken no position 
on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills and Costa Mesa, animal-rights activists also marched against 
fur sales. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, members of the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival held a news 
conference outside an Egghead Discount Software store to protest the alleged 
glorification of war in computer games. In Rosemead, Chinese pro-democracy 
marchers asked shoppers to boycott Toys R Us stores for selling toys made in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an animal-rights protest in San Francisco, where protester and rock 
singer Grace Slick looked on as six activists were arrested, there were no 
reports of arrests at any of the Southern California demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Some shoppers -- already braced for close encounters of the rude kind with 
other shoppers -- were clearly not thrilled at the prospect of having to get 
past picketers on their way to post-Thanksgiving bargains. 
</P>
<P>
"Some customers think it's an inconvenience for them," said Target manager 
Gloria Jost. 
</P>
<P>
One 36-year-old nurse tried to ignore the abortion protesters and their signs. 
"A Christmas shopping area is not a place to express your political view," she 
said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
Others welcomed the protests as an interlude that allowed them to stop and 
think before they rushed into store aisles. Laurie Gonzales, 36, who had gone 
shopping with her daughter and just paid for Christmas gifts at Target, wished 
that she had seen the protesters before she entered the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't be shopping here because I don't support abortion," she said, 
adding: "I feel guilty, but economic-wise, I have to shop here because it's one 
of the cheaper retail stores."

AUTHORITIES PUZZLED BY OUTBREAK OF HOLIDAY VIOLENCE

<P>
The outburst of holiday violence continued in Los Angeles County on Friday, as 
the Thanksgiving period death toll from gang-related shootings, arson and 
random gunfire reached 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I just keep seeing a lot more violence," said Sheriff's Lt. Joe Patterson, 
stationed in Norwalk. "It's something that's going on in our society. It just 
seems to be getting worse. The weekend's not even begun yet. Here it is only 
Friday, and we've had this many victims already." 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old gang-tattooed youth died after being shot in the back of the head 
during an apparent drive-by shooting early Friday in Norwalk, sheriff's 
officials said. The victim, Antonio Rivera, of Norwalk, was pronounced dead at 
a local hospital where he had been brought by friends who said they found him 
lying in the street, bleeding, near his car. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:15 Friday night, Long Beach police reported a man fatally shot on Nevada 
Street. Officers said the shooting did not appear to be gang related. The man 
died at Long Beach Memorial Hospital shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
In another killing, Edward Babb, 27, a construction worker, was walking north 
of downtown Los Angeles on his way to a friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner 
when he was accosted by two men demanding money. 
</P>
<P>
"He told them he didn't have any, and he was shot" and killed, said Los Angeles 
Police Detective Sam Catalfamo, who quoted witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old Northridge youth was fatally shot at a party in Chatsworth, 
reportedly in a dispute over his beeper, Los Angeles Police said Friday. Marc 
Squires was shot while attending a party Wednesday night on Bryant Street, said 
Detective Michael Brandt. He died Thursday at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunman apparently wanted the youth's beeper. "It seems kind of 
hard to believe that that's something worth fighting over," Brandt said. No 
arrests had been made but police were interviewing several witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, a man and woman were discovered shot to death in a Montrose 
apartment, apparently the victims of a murder-suicide that occurred more than 
two weeks earlier, authorities said. Deputies were sent to the apartment in the 
2300 block of Mira Vista Avenue at the request of the woman's father. The 
father called authorities after unsuccessfully trying to contact the daughter 
for 10 days, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies found the couple, whose names were not released, on the bedroom floor 
of the apartment they shared, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. A semiautomatic 
handgun and two discharged shell casings were found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies were responsible for at least one casualty on the holiday 
victim list. Deputies saw Palema Tonga Matangi, 27, of Long Beach, crossing the 
street at Orcutt Avenue and 67th Way in north Long Beach, near where a 1989 
robbery occurred. One unidentified deputy, thinking that Matangi fit a 
description of a robbery suspect, shot and wounded him when he did not keep his 
hands in his pockets as ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Matangi, who was unarmed, was struck by bullets in the torso, the right arm and 
the right leg. He underwent surgery Friday at Long Beach Memorial Medical 
Center and was in critical condition. No charges had been filed in either the 
shooting or the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, an emotionally distraught man blasted the back wall of his home 
with more than 70 shotgun rounds, prompting a neighborhood evacuation. He held 
deputies at bay for four hours, before surrendering without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
A young mother and her 7-month-old baby were killed in an apparent arson fire 
in the 7300 block of Petrol Street in Paramount early Thursday. The names of 
the victims were not released. Five other residents in the apartment were 
injured by flames and smoke that engulfed the apartment. Fire investigators 
found a three-gallon plastic gasoline can in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
"The gas can led investigators to believe the fire was intentionally set," a 
sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, a Molotov cocktail was thrown through the front window of a house 
in Pasadena, igniting a fire that injured a man and forced a family, including 
several small children, to flee, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The firebombing, which occurred shortly after midnight, may have been the 
result of a family argument, county fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanksgiving generally had been one of the quieter holidays in terms of 
crime," said Los Angeles Police Lt. Ross Moen, watch commander in the 
department's Pacific division, which saw its first Thanksgiving Day homicide in 
five years when Paul Yanez, 22, of Venice, was shot to death on Westminister 
Avenue late Thursday. No witnesses to the killing had been identified and no 
motive had been determined, Moen said.

FIFTH POT FARM LINKED TO OTHERS FOUND IN DESERT

Narcotics investigators said Friday that they have discovered another indoor 
marijuana farm, this one under construction near Barstow, that is linked to a 
multimillion-dollar network that dug four other similar farms under the desert 
in the Antelope Valley and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested, bringing to 12 the number of people being held in 
California and Arizona as the result of a widening probe into the alleged drug 
network. Authorities have seized plants valued at $77 million from the 
sophisticated organization, which they consider a major supplier of 
California's marijuana market. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest discovery, two San Diego-area building contractors were arrested 
Wednesday at a desert home near Daggett, where federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents and San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies found an 
almost complete cultivation site in a building designed to look like a horse 
barn, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
No drugs or weapons were found, Sheriff's Sgt. Del Wiedeman said. 
</P>
<P>
John McIntosh, 38, and John Ralston, 49, were being held at the Barstow 
sheriff's station on $1 million bail each on suspicion of conspiracy to 
distribute marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, two subterranean farms were raided in the Antelope Valley and four 
men were charged, including Lancaster contractor Frank Gegax, whom 
investigators described as the central figure in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Antelope Valley farms and two discovered in Arizona last month, the 
Daggett site was under construction and intended as an above-ground plantation, 
Wiedeman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the farm was "definitely connected to (the) Gegax" network. 
</P>
<P>
The latest raid followed a tip from employees of a Needles fuel distributor who 
saw news reports of the Arizona arrests and recognized a diesel fuel truck that 
reportedly had supplied fuel for generators for the underground farms, Wiedeman 
said. They told authorities that they had seen the truck in Daggett this week, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found the truck at the Daggett farm, Wiedeman said. 
</P>
<P>
They also found that the same type of pipe at the Daggett farm was used for the 
watering systems at the other farms, he said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: UCLA BEATS UC IRVINE, 134-101, SETTING A SCHOOL SCORING 
MARK.

<P>
Darrick Martin turned to his UCLA teammates, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
"You tired?" he asked, slapping a hand fiercely at each response. "You tired? 
You? You?" 
</P>
<P>
Then he turned to UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, whose Anteaters challenged 
11th-ranked UCLA to a fast-and-furious, running, three-point bombing game 
Friday and lost, 134-101, in the season-opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
"No, coach, we're not tired." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick calls it "a disease," this offense-mad game that has 
seen its apex in Loyola Marymount and its nadir with the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
But this UCLA team, whether Harrick likes it or not, thrives on the fever and 
proved it by breaking the school scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine countered with 42 three-point shots, three more than the NCAA mark 
set by -- guess who? -- Loyola Marymount against North Carolina in an NCAA 
tournament game on March 13, 1988, but two fewer than CS Northridge's NCAA 
mark, set earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
No UCLA team has scored more points than the Bruins did in the first-round of 
the Great Alaska Shootout before a sellout crowd of 7,947 in Sullivan Arena. 
And no Shootout team ever scored more. 
</P>
<P>
The school record was 133, set Dec. 23, 1969, at Pauley Pavilion against 
Louisiana State and Pete Maravich. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament record also was 133, set by Arizona in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Butler's free throw with 24 seconds left put the Bruins over the top 
for both marks, to the delight of UCLA's traveling party of 180 and the 
puzzlement of Butler. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe we were approaching 150," said Butler, who scored 15 points 
and was one of eight Bruins in double figures, led by Tracy Murray's 24 points 
and Don MacLean's 22 and punctuated by 20 points from freshman Shon Tarver off 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say enough about Tarver," Harrick said. "I thought he ignited us in 
the second half." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA -- which plays Alaska Anchorage at 9 p.m. tonight -- won convincingly in 
the end, but Irvine, off a 5-23 season that was the worst in school history, 
hung on throughout the first half and until about four minutes into the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine made 11 of 23 three-pointers in the first half. In all, the Anteaters 
made 15 of 42, both school records. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius Banks, a community college transfer who wasn't in the Anteaters' top 
six before the game, led Irvine with 20 points, including four for four in 
three-pointers in the first half. Jeff Herdman and Jeff Von Lutzow added 15. 
Center Ricky Butler, the leading returning scorer, had foul trouble in the 
first half and scored only seven points in a game not suited to his skills. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA trailed by as many as three points in the first half and led at halftime, 
69-65. 
</P>
<P>
The score stood tied, 77-77, when UCLA went on a 24-4 run. MacLean scored eight 
of those 24 points, but the critical blows were dealt by Tarver, alternating 
between three-pointers -- he had two in that stretch -- and dunks, of which he 
also had two. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA has got a helluva team," Irvine's Mulligan said. "It's not like we were 
playing dogs. We faded with about 15 minutes left. We were playing against a 
great team. Guys like Murray, Darrick Martin, really hurt us. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get tempo. We got tempo." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine plays Texas Tech today at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Virginia 80, Siena 77 -- Siena led 18th-ranked Virginia for most of the 
game, but the Cavaliers' Bryant Stith made four free throws in the final eight 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Stith, who scored 23 of his 33 points in the second half, hit two free throws 
to give the Cavaliers a 78-76 lead, then two more after Siena threw away the 
inbounds pass and fouled. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers play South Carolina at 7 p.m. PST tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Siena plays Nevada at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina 63, Nevada 61 -- The Gamecocks, who got 15 points from Jo Jo 
English and 14 from Barry Manning, held off a late rally. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Anchorage 70, Texas Tech 58 -- The host team was led by Jackie Johnson 
with 20 points in winning its 12th game in the 13-year history of its 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shootout Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Zimmerman, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery three weeks ago, 
entered the game with about nine minutes left and played seven minutes, scoring 
all his points on a three-point play.

PRIDE AT STAKE FOR USC, NOTRE DAME; 
</P>
<P>
TROJANS: THEY WILL BE TRYING TO END SEVEN-GAME LOSING STREAK TO THE IRISH IN 
TODAY'S 5 P.M. GAME AT THE COLISEUM.

<P>
Not much will be at stake today when USC plays Notre Dame at the Coliseum -- at 
least as far as the race to the national championship is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
But not much was at stake last week when USC played UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
That one, though, proved to be a game for the ages. The lead changed hands four 
times in the last 10 minutes, and USC won, 45-42, on a 23-yard touchdown pass 
from Todd Marinovich to Johnnie Morton with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
So, what to expect this week? 
</P>
<P>
"This game promises to be another classic because we've got very much the same 
scenario," USC Coach Larry Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, the game figured to have a direct bearing on the national 
championship race, but that was before the Irish were defeated by Penn State, 
24-21, and lost their No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
Now, only an improbable series of events could vault seventh-ranked Notre Dame 
(8-2) back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
USC (8-2-1) would have liked nothing better than to face the Irish when they 
were ranked No. 1, but the Trojans won't be wanting for motivation before a 
sellout crowd of more than 90,000 and a national television audience. 
</P>
<P>
They haven't beaten Notre Dame since 1982, when Michael Harper scored a 
controversial touchdown with 48 seconds left, fumbling as he crossed the goal 
line to give the Trojans a 17-13 victory at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame has since won seven consecutive games against USC, the longest 
streak in the history of a series that started in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who split two games against Notre Dame when he coached at Arizona, is 
0-3 against the Irish as the Trojans' coach. But when asked if he felt pressure 
to end the streak, Smith said that he did not. However, he added evenly: "I 
feel a deep desire (to win)." 
</P>
<P>
Last season's 28-24 loss at Notre Dame, in which the Trojans enjoyed a 
statistical advantage, left USC with a bitter taste. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans squandered a 17-7 halftime lead, regained the lead at 24-21 in the 
fourth quarter, then gave up the game-winning touchdown with 5:18 left. USC's 
last gasp ended at Notre Dame's seven-yard line when Marinovich threw three 
consecutive incomplete passes. 
</P>
<P>
As if that weren't enough to leave them angered, the Trojans were further upset 
that Notre Dame had incited a pregame melee by refusing to let them enter a 
tunnel that leads to the locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish later sent a letter of apology to the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was really classless," USC linebacker Scott Ross said of the 
incident. "But I can't say that I might not have done the same thing in their 
situation. We were thinking of doing it this year, but Coach Smith threatened 
that if we did, we'd be off the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep it on the field." 
</P>
<P>
The teams are similar in that they both have weak secondaries. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tony Sacca of Penn State passed for a career-high 277 yards and 
three touchdowns against Notre Dame. Sacca's previous career high of 243 yards 
was set against USC two months ago at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
That's just about the difference between the teams' pass defenses. Notre Dame 
has given up 266.5 yards a game through the air; USC has allowed 226.1, 
including 409 to UCLA's Tommy Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, they're a lot like us," Irish Coach Lou Holtz said of the 
Trojans. "They've given up big plays. They're very young on defense, but I want 
to say this: They're very talented on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich passed for 333 yards and three touchdowns against the Irish last 
season, setting school records of 33 completions and 55 attempts. USC ran for 
only 119 yards last season, but Smith hopes to attain a better balance this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The Notre Dame offense no longer features quarterback Tony Rice, who stymied 
the Trojans for three seasons with his option running as the Irish battered a 
defense that ranked among the nation's best against the run. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Notre Dame has as much offensive speed as it has had in several years, 
Smith said, and sophomore quarterback Rick Mirer ranks among the national 
leaders in passing efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer has rushed for 170 yards and six touchdowns and passed for 1,694 yards 
and eight touchdowns, completing 55.7% of his 185 attempts with six 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich will start at quarterback for USC, Coach Larry Smith said 
Friday. . . . Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, bothered by a deep thigh bruise, will 
play but won't start for Notre Dame, Coach Lou Holtz said. The injury kept 
Ismail out of the second half of last week's 24-21 loss to Penn State. . . . 
USC had won five consecutive games and 11 of 13 against Notre Dame before its 
current losing streak started in 1983, when Notre Dame won at South Bend, 27-6. 
. . . Notre Dame leads the series, 34-23-5. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz, on the effect of last week's loss to Penn State: "If it wasn't Southern 
Cal, I'd be concerned, but we have a history of getting up to play Southern 
Cal, the same as they do for us." . . . Against common opponents: USC beat Penn 
State, 19-14, and Stanford, 37-22; Notre Dame lost to Penn State, 24-21, and 
Stanford, 36-31. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, USC will accept a formal invitation to play Michigan State in 
the John Hancock Bowl Dec. 31 at El Paso, and Notre Dame will accept an 
invitation to play Colorado in the Orange Bowl.

South Grand Prairie High senior quarterback Bill Shafer, a victim of Texas' "no 
pass, no play" regulations, was allowed to play one last game Friday, and he 
made it count. 
</P>
<P>
Under Texas University Interscholastic League rules, Shafer and five other 
starters were technically eligible only until the hour of the final school bell 
Friday (3:10 p.m., CST), after failing at least one course during the last 
six-week grading period. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the noon kickoff at Texas Stadium, the first of a scheduled prep playoff 
tripleheader, allowed Shafer to start against Arlington High. 
</P>
<P>
Shafer led his team to a 20-15 victory, completing 12 of 27 passes for 215 
yards and one touchdown before the game ended at about 2:55 p.m., allowing 
Shafer 15 minutes to shower and change. Had the game lasted beyond the 3:10 
time limit, he would have been required to take off his uniform and gear and 
climb into the stands.

GOLF SKINS GAME; 
</P>
<P>
THE PRIZE MONEY EXCITES EVEN THE QUIET PLAYERS

<P>
Gary Player wasn't expected to win the big one. Neither was Arnold Palmer. No 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
In the first Skins Game, played in 1983, the big winners were expected to be 
Jack Nicklaus and/or Tom Watson, who was then considered the best player in the 
world. Everybody knew that. 
</P>
<P>
"So when Player sank that (four-foot) putt on the 17th hole for $150,000, he 
got so excited he started hyperventilating. He really did," said Don Ohlmeyer, 
founder and co-producer of the Skins Game. "And then on the 18th hole, he was 
still so excited that he duck-hooked his tee shot." 
</P>
<P>
Player, who said at the time that the most he had gambled on any hole was $10, 
came away the winner that first year with $170,000. Palmer, who said he had 
played a hole for $25 once, finished second at $140,000, with the majority won 
on a 40-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
"When Arnold sank that putt on the 12th hole, he started running around the 
green like a 20-year-old kid," Ohlmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes with the Skins Game, the eighth of which begins today on the TPC 
Stadium course at PGA West with prize money of $450,000. Call it unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
"You can play good golf and not win a skin. It's embarrassing," said Curtis 
Strange, the defending champion who was shut out his first year, then came back 
last year and won 11 skins and $265,000. He will compete in the two-day, 
18-hole event against Nicklaus, Nick Faldo and Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
The first six holes are worth $15,000 each, the second six $25,000 each and the 
final six $35,000. The prize money is carried over if a hole ends in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, considered one of the best players in the world, and Norman, the PGA 
money leader this season, are the newcomers. Nicklaus has played every year. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only thing we don't have this year is one player that might have a 
big mouth, like Lee (Trevino) or Fuzzy (Zoeller)," Strange said. "We don't have 
a comedian. It will be quiet this year." 
</P>
<P>
Added Nicklaus: "It was quiet the first year." 
</P>
<P>
Then Zoeller came along in 1985 and Trevino in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one year Fuzzy giving Jack a kiss after he made a putt to carry the 
money over," Ohlmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Zoeller played in the Skins Game three years and is the record money winner at 
$695,000. Nicklaus is second at $580,000, followed by Trevino, who played the 
last four years, at $435,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four players are chosen by a PGA Tour panel and the third by a 
sponsor's exemption. The defending champion has an automatic invitation. 
Trevino was not asked to return. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee has been a delight for us," Ohlmeyer said. "The hole in one he made on the 
17th (in 1987) helped make the Skins Game what it is. And he is going to play 
in the Senior Skins Game this year. But adding some new faces helps keep this 
game unique." 
</P>
<P>
The TPC Stadium Course, a Pete Dye-designed layout, also lends to the event's 
uniqueness. Long noted for its difficulty, the holes are surrounded by railroad 
ties, rocks, huge crater-type bunkers, water and rolling terrain. The course, 
which is also a site for the Bob Hope Classic, plays to 7,271 yards from the 
black tees and has a rating of 77.1. This is the fifth year for the event here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough course for me," Strange said. "But it's match play, and it only 
takes a couple of holes to come home a winner. For skins, it's more of full 
throttle. A go-all-out, let-her-go-type of format." 
</P>
<P>
Before Faldo played the course this week, he said he had heard it was crazy. 
Friday, he said it was great -- for match play, that is. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you had a scorecard in your hand, you would tear every hair from 
your head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, whose style of game seems well suited to the course, appeared eager for 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a driver's course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran of the group had this advice for the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch this year." Nicklaus said to Faldo and Norman. "Then come back and play 
hard next year." 
</P>
<P>
No chance.

Skins Game Notes 
</P>
<P>
ABC-TV will telecast the Skins Game live today at 12:30 p.m. and delayed Sunday 
at 3:30 p.m. . . . All four players have designated a portion of their winnings 
to charity: Jack Nicklaus to the Junior Golf program; Greg Norman to the 
Australian Junior Golf program; Nick Faldo to an orthopedic research program in 
London and Curtis Strange to the Virginia Boys Home. . . . Most money on one 
hole was won by Nicklaus in 1984, when he sank a 10-foot birdie putt on the 
18th hole worth $240,000.

MOTORSPORTS: THE TURKEY NIGHT GRAND PRIX CHECKERED FLAG IS THE LAST THAT WILL 
WAVE AT ASCOT.

<P>
For 30 years, Thanksgiving dinner for the Agajanian family has ended with the 
senior member pushing his chair away from the table and saying, "Let's go to 
the races." 
</P>
<P>
That has meant Ascot Park and the Turkey Night Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
It was the same this year -- and yet it was different. 
</P>
<P>
Cary Agajanian, eldest son of the late J.C., who started the Ascot tradition in 
1960, made the call last Thursday and his mother, Faye, and his brothers, Jay 
and Chris, and their families made their pilgrimage to the little track on the 
edge of Gardena for the United States Auto Club national championship midget 
race. It was Faye's first trip back since her husband died seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was the last one they will make. The Agajanians' lease on Ascot Park is up 
Dec. 31 and the new leasee plans to raze the 37-acre facility to make way for 
industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bittersweet feeling," Cary Agajanian said. "It's wonderful to see all 
these people here tonight and realize what Ascot has meant to them, but it's 
sad for me and my family because this has been our life. I started coming here 
with my dad when I was 16, and Jay and Chris started as soon as they were old 
enough to tag along. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how people feel when a business shuts down, like the Herald 
Examiner last year, but it must leave an empty feeling. I think this is worse 
for us because it's not only been a business, but it's been almost like home. 
I'm about spent emotionally. This is the third 'last night at Ascot' for me, 
and each one gets harder to take." 
</P>
<P>
Motorcycles, once the staple at Ascot, had their farewell Sept. 29 when a 
record standing-room-only crowd of 11,032 watched Ronnie Jones of Oklahoma City 
win a Grand National half-mile championship race. Last Saturday night, it was 
sprint cars -- the centerpiece of Ascot's programing for the last 15 years -- 
that had their last outing when 8,224 came and watched Ron Shuman of Tempe, 
Ariz., win the Don Peabody Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the grand finale Thanksgiving night when 8,468 fans made it the 
second-largest auto race in the track's 33 years. Only the World of Outlaws' 
winged sprint car appearance in 1985 was larger: 8,844. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of Turkey Night Grand Prix, it could better have been called the Friday 
Morning Farewell. There were a record 107 midget cars on hand, so many that the 
100-lap main event did not start until 11:40 p.m. and did not end until 12:20 
Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Fox, a veteran Indy 500 driver from Janesville, Wis., led the final 50 
laps and beat P.J. Jones, Parnelli Jones' son from Rolling Hills, to the 
checkered flag. Jones had led the first 50 laps after beating Fox to the first 
turn in a battle of front-row cars. Fox earlier had set a track record of 
93.018 m.p.h. during qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
The 107 cars was the largest number for any USAC championship event, according 
to Dick Jordan, a USAC official on hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wanted to have their car here for the last night at Ascot," Jordan 
said. "We had cars and drivers from 13 states." 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the drivers, including 57-year-old Mel Kenyon, came from Indiana, the 
hotbed of midget racing. It was Kenyon's 25th trip West for the Thanksgiving 
night race. He won in 1963 and again in 1975 when Agajanian had to move the 
race to Speedway 605 in Irwindale because Ascot was closed temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always enjoyed coming here to race, and I've never seen a crowd like this 
one," Kenyon said. "It's just great to see. It's too bad it's for the last 
race. And the great competition is more than I've ever seen, too. I'm just 
sorry I can't be a part of the last race." 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon failed to make the 30-car main event after qualifying 44th and being 
unable to finish better than seventh in the 15-lap last-chance semifinal. He 
wasn't the only one. Chuck Gurney, the two-time defending champion, and Sleepy 
Tripp, the five-time USAC Western States champion, also missed the main event. 
</P>
<P>
So did Tom D'Eath, who is better known as the driver of the Miss Budweiser 
unlimited hydroplane, but who races midgets during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lots were filling up by 4 p.m. Thursday, two hours before 
qualifying and four hours before the first race was scheduled. Because of the 
huge field, it did not start until 9:15. 
</P>
<P>
The longest lines were at the concession stands, where fans were buying all 
sorts of memorabilia -- race jackets, shirts, sweaters, caps, posters, patches, 
pins, anything with the Ascot logo on it. 
</P>
<P>
For $20, you could get a jar of sticky dirt from the Ascot track, complete with 
a Certificate of Authenticity and a roster of noted drivers who raced there -- 
from A.J. Foyt to Rick Mears to Johnny Rutherford to Steve Kinser to Bob Hogle 
to Ron Shuman to Parnelli Jones to P.J. and Page Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Jones, P.J. and Page's mother, bought a block of 35 seats for the Jones 
Fan Club and very nearly saw her 21-year-old son, P.J., join his father as a 
Turkey Night winner. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the finest dirt tracks in the country, if not the finest," 
Parnelli Jones said in accepting his place in the Midget Racing Hall of Fame. 
"I'm still hoping something might happen to the developer, and we could 
continue racing here. I'm not giving up hope until the place is cleared." 
</P>
<P>
The long wait for the 100-lap finale was worth it. After P.J. Jones 
horsepowered his way into the lead at the start, Fox pressured him with all the 
experience at his command. Just as the halfway flag was being displayed, Fox 
slipped past Jones and took over the lead for good. But Jones held off Robbie 
Flock and Brent Kaeding to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
For the thrill seekers, there were 11 cars that flipped during the long night. 
Two got upside down during warmups. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth victory for Fox at Ascot, but his first in the Turkey Night 
Grand Prix. It was also his fourth USAC victory this season. He is the 16th 
Indy 500 driver to win on Thanksgiving, but the first since Bubby Jones in 
1976. Fox has been in three Indy races, finishing seventh in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For car owner Steve Lewis of Laguna Beach, it was his first Turkey Night prize 
in 13 tries. 
</P>
<P>
In the USAC championship points, both leader Jeff Gordon of Pittsboro, Ind., 
and challenger Mike Streicher of Findlay, Ohio, failed to finish in the main 
event. This left Gordon with an almost insurmountable lead of 35 points going 
into tonight's final race at Imperial Raceway in El Centro. Gordon, 19, will 
become USAC's youngest midget champion merely by starting the main event. 
</P>
<P>
One group of fans brought a huge banner that read, "Good Bye Ascot. We will 
Miss You." National Speed Sport News, a national racing publication, flew in a 
special Ascot edition from Ridgewood, N.J., for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a national happening for racing," said Wally Pankratz, a veteran racer 
from Orange who has been coming to Ascot for 25 years. Pankratz was the first 
one out of the main event when his engine let go. 
</P>
<P>
After the race was over, fans seemed reluctant to leave. Some were still 
milling around at 3 a.m. And, as long as there were people there, the rumors 
continued to circulate that Ascot might rise again and sputter along as 
Riverside International Raceway did for a while after it officially closed. 
</P>
<P>
"I know people think we're kidding about closing, but we're definitely not 
(kidding)," Cary Agajanian said. "Riverside was a different situation. There, 
the track was controlled by the man who owned the property. Here, we have no 
control of the property. It was owned by the Zeiglers, and they have leased it, 
starting Jan. 1, to Howard Mann. 
</P>
<P>
"I have talked with him weekly, and he has asked if we could move our stuff out 
early so that his company (Andrex Development) could get going with their plans 
for the property. That doesn't sound like we're staying now, does it?" 
</P>
<P>
Agajanian did say, however, that his family intends to stay in racing, one way 
or another. 
</P>
<P>
"The family will be doing race promotions, but at the moment we don't know 
where or when," he said. "We own the rights to a number of events, like the 
Turkey Night race, several World of Outlaws shows and the motorcycle Grand 
Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to find a facility to replace Ascot, but that seems remote at 
the moment. Failing that, we will promote races on a one-at-a-time basis, the 
way our dad did when he started out." 
</P>
<P>
The long night ended with the playing of Auld Lang Syne. As the crowd joined in 
the singing, a teary-eyed woman turned to her husband and said, "Where are we 
going to go Saturday nights?" 
</P>
<P>
And where are the Agajanians going next Thanksgiving night? 
</P>

RETURN OF LAPPER HELPS UCLA'S SOCCER CHANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA fullback Mike Lapper's junior season for the nation's second-ranked soccer 
team could have ended 90 minutes after it started. 
</P>
<P>
But Lapper, in his first game for the Bruins since last winter, scored a goal 
to even the score, and one of his roommates, freshman midfielder Joe-Max Moore 
from Irvine, added the overtime winner in UCLA's 2-1 playoff victory last 
Sunday over the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
That extended Lapper's season by at least another 90 minutes, because the 
Bruins (16-1-3) meet No. 17 Southern Methodist (17-3-1) Sunday at 1 p.m. at 
UCLA's North Soccer Field in the NCAA West Regional final. SMU upset No. 11 
Fresno State, 2-1, last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA-SMU winner advances to the Final Four tournament Dec. 1-2 in Tampa, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
It was the prospect of playing for the national championship that motivated 
Lapper to return for the playoffs after missing the regular season to recover 
from a broken leg, although he could have stayed out and had two years of 
eligibility remaining. College players are given five years to complete four 
years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
But Lapper has such a promising future in the sport that UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid 
didn't figure the defender from Huntington Beach would remain on campus for two 
more years. 
</P>
<P>
So, after receiving a doctor's approval, Schmid gave Lapper the option of 
joining the team for the playoffs. "It was his decision," Schmid said. "There's 
no way I'd make a decision like that for a kid. But I talked about it with 
Mike. He's going to do more than just play college soccer. He's going to 
continue with the Olympic team, and he also has a future with the national 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's playing in the Olympics in '92, I don't think he'd come back to school 
that year. So we probably wouldn't have had him here for a fifth year, anyway. 
If he had been a player whose highest level of soccer was going to be in 
college, I would have been more concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Lapper, 20, already is a member of the pool from which the under-23 team that 
will attempt to qualify for the 1992 Summer Olympics will be chosen. But he 
said that he wasn't looking that far ahead when he made his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be part of the national team and the Olympic team, but you never 
know what's going to happen in the future," he said. "The reason I came back is 
because I want the opportunity to play for a national championship. Even if I 
was still injured, I would have tried to come back." 
</P>
<P>
It was apparent to Lapper that he wasn't still injured when he began practicing 
with the team about two weeks before the end of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
But just to be sure that he was ready, he asked his former club coach, Roger 
Wyett of the North Huntington Beach Untouchables, to work with him on his 
timing. 
</P>
<P>
It paid off 15 minutes into the game against San Diego when Lapper scored from 
15 yards out after a pass from Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for someone to pass to when Joe yelled, 'Shoot it,' " Lapper 
said. "It wasn't an ideal shot. I think it nicked one of their guys and went 
in. But it was a great feeling. What more can you ask for in your first game 
back?" 
</P>
<P>
Although Lapper lines up on the offensive end for set plays, he made his 
reputation as a defender. 
</P>
<P>
"He's only 6 feet tall, but he's an exceptional header of the ball," Schmid 
said. "There are very few people in the country who can beat him in the air. 
He's also a very determined tackler. When he makes his decision to tackle, you 
know he's coming." 
</P>
<P>
One of those tackles went awry in last summer's Olympic Festival at 
Minneapolis. Playing for the South team, he broke his leg while trying to steal 
the ball from a West forward. The forward was his UCLA teammate, junior Cobi 
Jones from Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks he's pretty tough now," Lapper said of Jones. "He's still kidding 
me. He tells me, 'If you don't be quiet, I'm going to break your leg again.' I 
don't think I'll ever hear the end of it." 
</P>

FARWEST FINANCIAL SUFFERS $89-MILLION LOSS IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ailing FarWest Financial Corp. reported a third-quarter loss of $89.9 million 
on Friday, pushing its principal operating subsidiary, FarWest Savings &amp; 
Loan Assn., closer to a possible government takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The loss also adds to growing pressures that the billionaire Belzberg brothers 
of Canada, FarWest's majority owners, invest a sizable amount of money to bring 
the thrift's capital up to regulatory requirements. If they choose not to, they 
face the possibility of losing their entire investment in the S&amp;L if it is 
seized by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L, which has $3.5 billion in assets, acknowledged last month that it 
is insolvent. It is FarWest Financial's only major asset. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Findley, a Brea bank and thrift consultant, said the loss was "probably 
more than they anticipated at FarWest, but it wasn't unexpected. You just don't 
know what is going to happen these days in a federal exam as they make you 
write down loans and real estate." 
</P>
<P>
All of FarWest's loss for the quarter was accounted for by a federal 
requirement that the thrift subsidiary set aside $91.8 million as a reserve 
against potential losses from real estate, loans and investments. 
</P>
<P>
A sizable part of the thrift's financial problems stem from the decline in 
value of its huge portfolio of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. FarWest 
Savings' junk bond holdings totaled $395 million as of June 30, down from $600 
million earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at FarWest Financial in Beverly Hills could not be reached for 
comment Friday, nor could officials of the S&amp;L, headquartered in Newport 
Beach. FarWest Financial's latest loss compared to a $22.9-million deficit for 
1989's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, the holding company reported total 
losses of $119.7 million, compared to a $6.6-million loss for the same period 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, FarWest Savings President Charles Green said the 
third-quarter loss occurred because federal regulators required the thrift to 
set aside new reserves to cover $42.7 million in losses on loans, $22.3 million 
in losses on real estate held through foreclosure and a $26.8-million loss on 
its junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest, through the Belzberg brothers, maintained a close business 
relationship with former junk bond king Michael Milken, sentenced to 10 years 
in prison Wednesday for securities fraud and other crimes. In the late 1980s, 
FarWest invested about $600 million in junk bonds peddled by Milken's firm, 
Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
But the thrift bailout bill of 1989 required that junk bonds be removed from 
S&amp;L portfolios by July, 1994, and required thrifts to begin carrying such 
bonds on their books at either their purchase price or, if lower, their current 
market price. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, FarWest has written down the value of its junk bond holdings for 
several successive quarters because their values have fallen as the market for 
high-risk securities collapsed in the wake of the Drexel-Milken scandal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its junk bond woes, FarWest has been hit hard by federally 
required writedowns of its loan and real estate portfolios. The S&amp;L was a 
major lender in the Texas and Colorado commercial real estate markets before 
the oil bust of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement Friday, Green said FarWest Savings currently is preparing a 
plan to bring its capital up to the minimum level required by the federal 
government but did not say when that plan would be completed. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L's previous capital improvement plan was rejected in October, 
driving the thrift into insolvency.

FarWest Financial -- A Nov. 24 story about FarWest Financial Corp. incorrectly 
stated the company's relationship with Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. FarWest and its subsidiary, FarWest Savings &amp; Loan, had only a 
remote business relationship with Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond 
division. Also, FarWest Savings purchased about $300 million of junk bonds from 
Drexel, not $600 million as was incorrectly reported.

SPECIALTY SHOPS GIVING STUDIOS A NEW SHOWCASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After perusing the Judy Jetson cosmetic kits and Fred Flintstone bolo ties, Pat 
Hockings found just what she wanted: a $2 refrigerator magnet with the likeness 
of her Space Age cartoon hero, George Jetson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a Jetsons and a Flintstones fan," said Hockings after 
shopping at a Torrance gift shop owned and named after Hanna-Barbera, the 
Hollywood animation studio whose cartoon characters populate the store. "There 
is nothing in there you really need. You just go into the store for the fun of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
George Jetson has joined Kermit the Frog and Mickey Mouse in the mall in the 
most recent effort by Hollywood studios to exploit the popularity of their 
well-known film and television characters. The market for such shops, however, 
is limited by the small number of entertainment firms with a stable of 
characters that have broad appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not expect this to be a trend that can be duplicated by everyone," 
said Sarah A. Stack, a retail industry analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards. "I think very few cartoon or character franchises have the impact of 
Disney." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Walt Disney Co. and Hanna-Barbera have opened up company-owned stores. 
Jim Henson Productions, which has agreed to be purchased by Disney, has a 
licensing agreement with a Toronto-based chain of stores called Muppet Stuff. 
Meanwhile, the Children's Television Workshop agreed to let a California toy 
store and children's apparel chain use the name and characters of its popular 
"Sesame Street" program. 
</P>
<P>
In a growing mail-order operation, Time Warner Inc. hawks Bugs Bunny jelly 
beans and "Murphy Brown" coffee mugs and shirts through its Warner Bros. 
Collection catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood studios have long derived profits from licensing the likenesses and 
names of their characters for use on everything from T-shirts to Yogi Bear's 
Jellystone Park Camp-Resorts camp grounds. The new stores lend the studios and 
their productions greater exposure and can serve as an important marketing tool 
if managed well, say industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
And in tough economic times, the name of a well-known and trusted entertainment 
program or character goes a long way in setting a new retailer apart from 
competitors. "It's the integrity" of the name that is valuable, said Gene 
Platin, who heads the four-store Sesame Street General Store chain. 
</P>
<P>
The merchandise of these stores meshes with retailing and demographic trends. 
"We have noticed is a big surge in children's toys, children's clothes, family 
oriented gift items and just fun types of things," said Iris Callie, vice 
president of leasing for Westfield Inc. Westfield operates the Westside 
Pavilion, where Hanna-Barbera opened its first mall store in July. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. launched the trend three years ago when it opened the first 
Disney store in Glendale. The chain, which helps promote recent Disney film 
productions, has grown to nearly 80 stores, including its first international 
outlet on London's fashionable Regent Street. 
</P>
<P>
Disney spokesman Chuck Champlin said the company is "very pleased with the 
operation," which will grow to more than 100 stores next year. "We don't see 
any decrease in the popularity, and we get many repeat visitors in each 
stores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The stores also give Disney more power to control and manage the carefully 
cultivated image it has created for its characters. "You could argue that many 
of the Disney characters are brands . . . and as long as they continue to 
cultivate the core images of those brands they can do no wrong," said Robert 
Kahn, executive director of corporate image consultants Landor Associates in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Television Workshop also scrutinizes the operations of the 
Sesame Street General Store chain, said Platin. "Every product that does not 
carry the Sesame Street name they have to approve. Our buyers cannot just go 
out and buy a crayon set. They have to send it to New York (where the workshop 
is based) to get approval" first. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Hanna-Barbera, whose productions have often dominated 
Saturday morning childrens' television programs, joined the fray by opening a 
store at the Universal Studios Tour in Florida and then in malls in West Los 
Angeles and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our classic characters are going to be very important," said Sandra Gilbert, 
vice president of Hanna-Barbera's retail operations. "But it's the new 
characters and the new shows that will add freshness to the stores." 
</P>
<P>
The stores, decorated in the vivid colors used in the Flintstones and Jetsons 
television cartoons, are geared to attract and entertain kids and their parents 
with a mix of gifts, toys and apparel. At the back of the stores, a space-age 
console out of a Jetsons cartoon lets kids view Hanna-Barbera cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Aiming at nostalgic parents and children is a strategy that seems to have paid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"Cartoons never burn out -- I still watch the Flintstones," said Kris Dykes of 
Torrance, who picked up a Scooby-Doo whistle at the Hanna-Barbera store in the 
Del Amo Fashion Center. "I have a kid, and every time we walk by the store she 
goes inside." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes said there is enough room in the retailing world for Hanna-Barbera and 
Disney stores to grow. At the Del Amo Fashion Center, Disney officials say 
business has actually increased since a Hanna-Barbera store opened in the same 
mall in September and several shoppers say the patronize both stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to the Disney store all the time," said Jennifer Peterson, a San Pedro 
resident who had just finished strolling through the Hanna-Barbera store with 
her two infant daughters. "I like it, and there is something for kids to do," 
she said of the store. 
</P>
<P>
But the Del Amo Fashion Center, the largest shopping mall in Southern 
California, may be the exception in housing both a Disney and a Hanna-Barbera 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not see a need to have both a Disney store and a Hanna-Barbera," said 
Callie at the Westside Pavilion, which also houses a small Muppet Stuff store. 
"With a Hanna-Barbera store, there is no need for a Disney store."

WILL WASSERMAN GET LESS THAN HE WANTS FOR MCA?; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE ANSWER COULD COME SUNDAY, WHEN DIRECTORS CONTINUE THEIR 
MEETINGS OVER MATSUSHITA'S BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Has Lew R. Wasserman lowered his expectations for MCA Inc.? 
</P>
<P>
That question may be answered as early as Sunday, if MCA and its 77-year-old 
chairman proceed with reported plans for a New York board meeting to consider 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s bid for the Hollywood conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of bargaining -- and years of flirtation with various suitors -- 
Wasserman is pondering a Matsushita buyout offer that is said by several 
sources to be lower than the price he had long demanded for his company, which 
owns Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
Bargaining between MCA and Matsushita continued Friday in New York, and 
positions may still change. But individuals close to the talks have said 
negotiators were discussing a deal under which MCA shareholders would receive 
between $70 and $75 a share, or as much as $6.85 billion, including both cash 
and the value of stock in a new spin-off that would own the company's New 
York-area TV station. 
</P>
<P>
MCA insiders say Wasserman has talked in the past of getting as much as $100 a 
share for MCA and had expected the negotiations with Matsushita to be conducted 
in a framework ranging between $75 and $90 a share, or as much as $8.22 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
But Matsushita and its top U.S. representative, Creative Artists Agency 
Chairman Michael Ovitz, came in much lower, apparently arguing that MCA's worth 
has declined because of softening markets both here and in Japan. In the words 
of one Matsushita partisan: "Look at what's happened to asset values. They've 
gone down." 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman is said to be hungry for a buyer because he believes that media 
companies will need vast financial resources to compete in coming decades, and 
because he fears that no successor would succeed in keeping MCA away from 
predators and break-up artists. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the rough bargaining has left the MCA chief with an excruciating dilemma: 
Should he reject the offer and risk seeing his company's stock collapse to less 
than $35 a share, where it traded before the Matsushita talks surfaced? Or 
should he take the money, and risk capping his 54-year MCA career with a 
disappointment? 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Wednesday evening, Wasserman is said to have favored scrapping 
the talks because Matsushita was offering too little. But some 11th-hour 
changes in bargaining positions allowed the discussions to continue, amid some 
expressions of pessimism on both sides. Spokesmen for both companies have 
declined to discuss the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be personally shocked to see a deal for $70 to $75. Shocked and 
disappointed," said Michael Klein, an executive with Los Angeles-based Gruntal 
&amp; Co., which represents what Klein characterized as a "huge group" of MCA 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
MCA shares dropped $3.125 to $65.375 as more than 1.6 million shares traded 
hands in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, amid press reports that any 
buyout would probably bring less than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and others have assumed that Wasserman would command a higher price 
thanks to his reputation as a hard-nosed bargainer. They have also theorized 
that Wasserman could simply reject an inadequate offer, while waiting for a 
counter-bid from some big American company. 
</P>
<P>
That might become more likely if a change in federal "financial interest and 
syndication" rules makes it easier in the next few months for giants such as 
General Electric or Capital Cities/ABC to couple a film producer such as MCA 
with their broadcast interests. "Knowing Lew as I do, I still have to believe 
that he would like to wrap this deal in the American flag," said one 
stockholder and longtime associate of the MCA chairman. Wasserman was once 
Ronald Reagan's agent and has been a major contributor to both Democrats and 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
But buyers for a company as big as MCA are rare birds in the best of 
circumstances -- Lazard Freres &amp; Co., MCA's investment banker, has been 
scouring the globe for years in search of a viable bidder for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
And no hint of a counteroffer appears to have surfaced during the bargaining 
with Matsushita, despite a number of earlier approaches by companies such as 
Sony Corp., Walt Disney Co. and RCA Corp. "In this kind of market, any deal 
that can get done is a good deal," said one big MCA shareholder, who declined 
to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Many media and entertainment stocks are trading near their 52-week lows, and 
investors have been made especially wary by the steep decline in Time Warner 
Inc. stock since Time Inc. bought Warner Communications last year. 
</P>
<P>
Such big MCA shareholders as Los Angeles-based Capital Group Inc. and music 
mogul David Geffen had reportedly expected a minimum of $80 a share for their 
stakes in the company, which total about 15 million shares. But sources 
familiar with those investors on Friday indicated that both would accept a 
buyout in the reported range without complaint. Neither Geffen nor Capital 
Group analyst Gordon Crawford returned calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
(At a hypothetical $72.50 per share, Geffen would reap a $180-million profit on 
his shares, which were valued at $54.50 each when he received them earlier this 
year in the sale of his record label to MCA. But part of the payout would be 
tied up in stock of the TV spin-off, which is said to be valued as high as $6 a 
share.) 
</P>
<P>
If Ovitz and the Matsushita officers had offered a so-called preemptive bid of 
$80 or more, many investors feel Wasserman would have had little choice but to 
accept. But the relatively low apparent bid may place a great deal more 
emphasis on questions of corporate governance: Will the Japanese company 
ultimately be a good parent to the company that Wasserman helped build with 
MCA's founder, the late Jules Stein? 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita is said to have agreed to give a wide range of MCA executives 
employment contracts for as long as five years. But the mood at the bargaining 
table has been tense, according to a number of individuals, and Wasserman is 
said to have been angered by repeated press leaks and what he regards as 
"low-ball" bargaining by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
While such factors don't affect the arithmetic of any deal, they are likely to 
make Wasserman's decision unusually difficult. 
</P>
<P>
As one longtime associate put it on Friday: "I don't think even he knows what 
he's going to do."

OIL SURGES AS BUSH TAKES TOUGH STANCE ON FORCE IN MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oil prices soared Friday, buoyed by sentiment that President Bush's visit to 
the Mideast had bolstered international support for the use of force in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
January crude futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled at $31.90 a 
barrel, up $2.27 on the day and up nearly 6.7% from the $29.78 close last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said oil prices were likely to remain firm next week as foreign 
ministers attend a United Nations session to discuss a resolution authorizing 
force to oust Iraq from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush's tough talk in the Mideast and next week's U.N. meeting are making this 
market nervous to the upside," said Tom Bentz, an analyst with United Energy 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, visiting troops in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, said he felt a U.N. 
resolution on force should be approved before Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting tired of the status quo and so is the rest of the world," Bush 
told reporters after two hours of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, 
Washington's closest Arab ally. 
</P>
<P>
Prices remained firm even after Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Moscow 
was not committed to future military action against Iraq. U.S. officials say 
Soviet cooperation is crucial to Bush's plan to get a resolution through the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
No exact date has been set for the next session of the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. prices caught up with gains made in London on Thursday, when markets here 
were closed for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing catch-up after London rose on Bush's ultimatum in Saudi Arabia," 
said Brian Tagler of Lehman Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Also boosting oil was news Thursday that Britain would send 14,000 more troops 
to the gulf, calming speculation that Margaret Thatcher's resignation as leader 
of the Conservative Party might signal a softening of Britain's determined 
stance against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Britain's decision to send troops in the wake of Thatcher's resignation was 
bullish because it meant they're still as hawkish," Tagler said. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said Friday's activity was extremely light, with many participants away 
on long Thanksgiving holiday weekends. 
</P>
<P>
In London, January futures for the benchmark crude North Sea Brent Blend rose 
on the International Petroleum Exchange to $30.50 a barrel from $29.99 on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On the NYMEX, unleaded gasoline for December delivery added 3.45 cents to 82.40 
cents a gallon, while spot heating oil rose 3.42 cents to 88.66 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, former Saudi Oil Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani said a short, 
destructive war over Kuwait early next year could result in oil prices 
averaging $71 a barrel in the first quarter.

Hong Kong Scales Back Forecast: The Hong Kong government revised the forecast 
for the British colony's gross domestic product in 1990 to 2.3% from 2.5% 
predicted in August. 
</P>
<P>
It also revised the inflation rate to 9.7% from 9.5%. The government's chief 
economist, K. Y. Tang, said the colony's economy could have been harder hit by 
the slowdown in domestic exports to the United States, Britain and Japan if not 
for continued strong growth in re-exports. A government statement said domestic 
exports in the third quarter continued to decline by about 2% in real terms 
over a year earlier while imports rose about 12% in the same period.

Manville Plan Criticized: Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., which is both a 
co-defendant and beneficiary in the massive Manville asbestos case, complained 
that a proposed reorganization of the cash poor Manville trust is a "disaster." 
At a hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., Owens attorney Roger 
Podesta asked Judge Jack Weinstein to withhold approval of a key element of the 
restructuring plan for the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust. A 
cornerstone of the new plan -- submitted to Weinstein on Monday -- is the 
proposal to set up a single class-action suit that combines about 130,000 
federal and state asbestos cases, and to appoint a lawyer committee to 
represent them.

Deficits Loom in 30 States: At least 30 states face budget deficits because of 
the rising cost of services, falling tax revenues and slackening consume 
spending, according to surveys by the National Assn. of State Budget Officers 
and the Boston Globe. The deficits range from $42 million in Tennessee to $1 
billion in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are spending less, and the less they spend, the more likely 
businesses are to lay off workers. State governments also have trimmed their 
payrolls. Job losses, by both public and private employers, are adding to state 
spending, as unemployed workers sign up for state benefits and more families 
join welfare rolls. Such layoffs have depressed states' third major source of 
revenue: personal income taxes.

ANAHEIM EX-OFFICER SHOOTS 3 ARMED BURGLARY SUSPECTS 
</P>

<P>
In a bloody confrontation with armed burglars, a retired police sergeant opened 
fire with a 12-gauge shotgun, leaving one suspect brain-dead and two others 
critically wounded, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared out of my wits," said Earl Swoap, 53, as he described his 
encounter with the intruders in his North Hanover Street home. "One of them 
pointed a gun right at my head." 
</P>
<P>
One of the alleged intruders, a 16-year-old Santa Ana boy, was pronounced 
brain-dead by physicians at UCI Medical Center in Orange. Two other suspects, a 
17-year-old Garden Grove boy and 19-year-old Phouxay Vanhnarath of Costa Mesa, 
were listed in critical but stable condition Friday night, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a fourth suspect, Sayavong Nanthavongdouangsy, 18, of Anaheim, was 
not injured. The names of the juveniles were withheld because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
Nanthavongdouangsy was being held at the Anaheim Temporary Detention Facility 
on suspicion of attempted robbery, according to Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry. 
</P>
<P>
Swoap, a Hughes Aircraft security guard who retired from the Yakima, Wash., 
police force 13 years ago, said he was acting in self-defense, shooting at the 
four teen-agers to protect himself and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known if Swoap will face any charges in connection with 
the shooting, which occurred at 9:35 p.m. Thursday, Sgt. Frank Van DeWeerd 
said, adding that the case was still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Based on interviews with Swoap, police and neighbors, the following is an 
account of what happened: 
</P>
<P>
Swoap said that he and his wife had just gone to bed when they heard a noise 
"that sounded like someone kicked the door in." 
</P>
<P>
Swoap said he grabbed his 12-gauge shotgun and crept into the hallway, noticing 
that someone had turned on a light. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding a corner into the living room, Swoap came face to face with the 
suspects, three of whom were holding handguns, Swoap and police said. 
</P>
<P>
What precisely happened next is still unclear, but police said Swoap opened 
fire, blasting away at the intruders as they attempted to escape out the back 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Swoap chased the intruders outside and fired again as at least two 
of them piled into a late-model Toyota Celica. The shotgun blasts blew out the 
car's rear window and two of its tires. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether any of the intruders were wounded in the house or 
whether they returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some shooting inside, and then he (Swoap) followed them out," Van 
DeWeerd said. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect was spotted by several neighbors running toward the end of the 
street. He appeared uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
The car, with its driver wounded in the back of the head, veered out of control 
and came to rest in the front yard of a house across the street, according to 
several witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor, who asked not to be named, said that he heard four shots, then 
looked out the window and spotted a silver-colored car idling on the front 
lawn. 
</P>
<P>
When he ran across the street to investigate, he saw one of the suspects lying 
on the grass next to the car, moaning and holding his legs. His face was 
covered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
As he reached into the car to turn off the engine, the neighbor said he felt a 
warm body and realized that another wounded man was slumped over in the front 
seat. His head was bleeding profusely. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the intruder who had run off apparently could not find an escape 
route and doubled back to the car, where he pulled the neighbor out of the way. 
He then opened the car door and "flung the other guy out of it like a piece of 
meat," the neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
Putting the car into reverse, he stepped on the accelerator, slammed into a 
tree, jammed the car into first gear and bolted off, tearing out wide patches 
of grass. He was last seen driving north toward La Palma Avenue, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded men, later identified as Vanhnarath, was last seen running 
in the same direction as the car, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Vanhnarath and Nanthavongdouangsy were arrested shortly afterward near 
Brookhurst Street and Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire shattered the quiet in this tranquil neighborhood near Magnolia and 
Lincoln avenues. Residents congregated Friday afternoon in small clusters, 
recounting the night's events. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very quiet neighborhood," said Bob Puig, who lives across the street 
from Swoap. "Nothing ever happened like this before." 
</P>
<P>
In an intensive care waiting room at UCI Medical Center, the parents of the 
16-year-old suspect sat limp in each other's arms a short while after doctors 
told them their son would not survive the shotgun wounds in his head. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's stepfather was nearly silent, but from the mother came a torrent of 
words as she lapsed between English and her native Vietnamese, reminiscing 
about how close the family had been before leaving Vietnam in 1981. She said 
her son was a former Boy Scout and a youth volunteer at the Buddhist temple 
they attended, but he had trouble adjusting to American culture as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very, very angry," the boy's mother said, asking that she not be 
identified. "He did something wrong. But whoever did it (shot him) should have 
shot at his legs, not at his head. . . . He's too young. The guy did it to 
kill." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nanthavongdouangsy's father, Donechanh Nanthavongdouangsy, claimed 
his son was not involved with the break-in and was falsely arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview through an interpreter, the Laotian immigrant said his son was 
at home about 10 p.m. when he got a phone call from Vanhnarath, who reportedly 
told young Nanthavongdouangsy that he was wounded and needed a ride to a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not in that house," the father said. "I don't believe it. He was home 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to comment on the father's claim. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, there have been a rash of so-called home invasions in Orange 
County, in which Asian gangs have recruited teen-agers for planned robberies. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish for the police to work and find whoever are the adults behind these 
children," said the mother of the 16-year-old suspect. "We don't wish to see 
other families experience what is our experience."

O.C. RURAL JAIL NO PICNIC ANYMORE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: OVERCROWDING FROM MAIN JAIL FLOODS MUSICK MINIMUM-SECURITY COMPOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Welcome to Musick," Sheriff's Deputy Craig Nelson told the 24 stony-faced jail 
inmates, just off the bus from Santa Ana on a cold, rainy night and now huddled 
on wooden benches. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the easiest time you're going to do in Southern California, provided 
you follow the rules and regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Few inmates who have had the opportunity to compare accommodations at other 
jails with those at Orange County's James A. Musick Branch Jail would argue. 
</P>
<P>
After Nelson's introduction, the inmates are shown a videotape that opens with 
an aerial view of the sprawling 100-acre complex -- nestled between the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station and a Lake Forest neighborhood -- as strains of soft 
pop music fill the background. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, not the movie," muttered one inmate, well-schooled in the routine. 
</P>
<P>
The narrator begins a monotone recitation of the rules: "Mustaches must be 
neatly trimmed. The upper lip will be visible. Sideburns will be stovepipe in 
design and have no flares." 
</P>
<P>
This particular group of "swimmers," as deputies call inmates not yet assigned 
bunks, looked like the kind of fellows who hadn't followed a rule or regulation 
since junior high. But once checked in, most follow Nelson's advice for the 
simple reason that not doing so means expulsion from the rural, camp-like 
atmosphere of the county's most relaxed detention facility -- and a quick trip 
back to the Central Men's Jail in Santa Ana, where breathing room is scarce and 
tension runs high. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys out here are much easier for our people to work with," said Lt. 
Vincent Battit, the night watch commander. "There are no violent criminals, no 
dope salesmen, no sex offenders. . . . We err on the safe side, and it saves a 
lot of bruises and contusions." 
</P>
<P>
But Musick is not the "country club" to which law enforcement officials 
sometimes jokingly refer. The severe overcrowding throughout Orange County's 
jail system has penetrated this compound; almost a third of the inmates live in 
huge, cramped tan-colored tents that were never meant to be more than temporary 
housing when set up five years ago. And incidents of violence -- though mostly 
minor -- are on the increase. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department tries to restrict entrance to minimum-security Musick 
to inmates who seem not to be violent or likely to flee. Once there, they are 
housed in crowded barracks and are allowed to move freely within their own 
compounds several hours each day. Most leave the facility each morning to work 
on county projects or in kitchen and housekeeping crews at other jails -- where 
the inmates are too high-risk to be trusted with such tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"The overcrowding limits our ability to segregate inmates," said Assistant 
Sheriff Jerry Krans, who oversees the county jail system. "I can't remember an 
assault on a staff member, but fistfights between inmates are fairly frequent. 
I think we have one or two of those a day." 
</P>
<P>
Musick was originally a work farm, and it retains much of its agricultural 
heritage. Some inmates tend to the facility's cantaloupe, corn and other crops, 
or to its chickens, pigs and cattle. Its 8,000 chickens lay more than 6,000 
eggs a day, enough to meet the entire jail system's demand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not exactly pet therapy, but just the fact that they're around the 
animals softens them a bit," Krans said of Musick inmates. "You get a tough 
macho type, and he helps deliver a baby pig or calf. That has a warming 
effect." 
</P>
<P>
Visiting hours are more relaxed than at the county's four other jails. While 
Musick lacks a visiting center and must make do with mess halls between 
mealtimes, prisoners are allowed to sit at tables with family members and hold 
hands with their loved ones. At Central Men's Jail, communication with visitors 
is by telephone across a thick glass window. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1963 on land purchased from the Irvine Co. for $250,000, Musick -- 
then called the Orange County Industrial Farm -- was designed to house about 
150 inebriates, non-supporters, and other low-level offenders. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department took over administration of the farm in 1974 and it 
was renamed the James A. Musick Facility to honor the county's sheriff, who 
retired that year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, a women's compound was added after women inmates sued the county, 
demanding that they, too, be given access to a low-security facility for 
minimum offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it holds more than 1,200 prisoners in four separate compounds, each of 
them surrounded by a chain-link fence topped with spiraling strands of razor 
wire. The women's section alone -- called South compound -- now has space for 
170 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
The women have virtually no contact with the men. In one of the facility's mess 
halls, about a dozen women inmates stand behind a wall and prepare food trays, 
which are then handed through a small opening to the men as they file by. 
</P>
<P>
But the men never see who's serving them. 
</P>
<P>
"If they could see the women, there'd be trouble," Battit said. 
</P>
<P>
The barracks of the original East compound, a quadrangle of buildings that 
opens onto a courtyard of neatly trimmed hedges and billowing shade trees, are 
crammed with rows of closely spaced bunk beds. West compound, a quadrangle that 
is considered the facility's most secure area, was created in 1986 from 
construction housing trailers purchased in Oregon. The trailers were supposed 
to be temporary; they held more than 460 prisoners on a recent night, and the 
county has no plans to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
North compound is the most vivid reminder of the county's struggle with 
overcrowding. There, behind the intimidating chain-link fences, stand five huge 
tents, each supported by aluminum framing, with plastic windows all around. 
</P>
<P>
The windows were put in when the county refurbished the tents last year. Now 
that inmates can see out, Krans said, they are less likely to poke holes in the 
expensive fabric so they can keep an eye on guards. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the tents -- labelled yellow, blue, red and green for identification 
purposes -- hold 90 prisoners each, while a fifth tent serves as the group's 
day room, with a pool table and exercise equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The tents have linoleum floors on concrete foundations, independent heating and 
air-conditioning systems. Newly constructed bathrooms in adjacent structures, 
with rows of toilets and sinks, are a big improvement over the single toilet 
and urinal that previously served each tent, Battit said. 
</P>
<P>
But the air is stifling even on a cold night and the odor of cigarette smoke is 
strong. Small groups crowd around card tables, others watch the TV in the front 
part of the tent; still others lay on their bunks and read, write letters, or 
stare at the high, canvas ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the conditions are atrocious, and it frustrates the hell out of me," 
said Battit. "You feel like your hands are just tied together." 
</P>
<P>
Similar tents are used at the Rikers Island Prison Complex in New York and in 
state prisons in Michigan. But the California State Board of Corrections 
doesn't recognize them as permanent inmate housing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shelter or housing that is barely constitutional, but we haven't been 
sued to get rid of them," Krans said. "They provide ample shelter for the 
inmates that are there . . . and it's basically use them or release them." 
</P>
<P>
The four compounds together have bunks for 1,086 men and 170 women. On a recent 
night, the facility held 1,075 men and 120 women. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers change almost constantly; as the Central Men's Jail approaches its 
court-ordered population limit, sheriff's officials search their records for 
Musick inmates who can be released early. Then they scan the prisoner lists in 
Santa Ana for inmates who are safe enough risks to be shifted to Musick. 
</P>
<P>
One such list comes across Musick's fax machine about 10:30 each night. Those 
prisoners are eligible to be released the following day; they are roused 
shortly before midnight, "dressed out," given their personal belongings and 
remaining cash, and released as soon into the new day as possible -- often just 
a few minutes after midnight -- freeing up valuable bunks. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials have an agreement with nearby residents not to release 
prisoners directly into the neighborhood. Inmates are allowed to arrange their 
own transportation away from the jail; if no one can pick them up, they are put 
on a bus to downtown Santa Ana and released there. 
</P>
<P>
With tents and trailers serving as inmate housing, and more than 600 prisoners 
leaving Musick each day to work, it is not surprising that escapes are 
relatively common. So far this year, 13 prisoners have decided they'd done 
enough time -- nine escaped from the facility, and four others left their work 
crews outside the jail. Ten of the 13 have since been rearrested. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people here who leave are homesick, and we know where to find 
them," Battit said. "They run right to their mother or girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
A prisoner who escapes is not eligible to return to Musick. The relative ease 
of escape, however, forces deputies to keep a close watch on prisoners' moods 
and personal situations, as bad news from home can send an inmate over the 
fence at the first opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Those with family emergencies can apply for a court order freeing them to 
attend a funeral or visit a hospital bed. In the meantime, though, if Musick 
deputies think an inmate is upset enough to try an escape, he is quickly 
transferred back to Central Men's Jail. 
</P>
<P>
One night this week, a 36-year-old Mexican immigrant with six months to go on a 
failure to appear conviction got word that his son was in an Anaheim hospital, 
suffering heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
The inmate was clearly troubled, and Battit asked a deputy to bring him in for 
a talk. 
</P>
<P>
"If I let you stay, you're not going to take a walk?" Battit asked the man. 
"You understand my concern that I don't want you to do this?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I understand, sir, I don't want more time." 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to promise me something," Battit continued. "If you need some help, 
see the deputy. Don't do anything dumb." 
</P>
<P>
Battit let the man stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to take care of these people, not to punish them," Battit said. 
"That's already been done by the county."

CHRISTMAS BUYING SEASON GETS OFF TO SUBDUED START; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: SUNNY WEATHER IN ORANGE COUNTY KEEPS EARLY CROWDS DOWN, BUT PARKING 
LOTS FILL UP LATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Consumers crowded America's retailers on Friday, the start of the traditional 
Christmas shopping season, but the holiday spirit -- and gift buying -- was 
tempered by the specter of a national recession. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't whip out their credit cards," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of 
the Retail Marketing Report newsletter, after surveying shops and malls in the 
New York area. "Mostly," he added, "they were just looking." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County and elsewhere in Southern California, the shopping season got 
off to a slow start Friday morning at many malls where crowds were sparse, 
lines relatively short and parking abundant. Some retailers blamed the warm, 
sunny weather for keeping people outdoors, and noted that business picked up at 
many shopping centers later in the day. Many consumers said it was hard to get 
into a shopping mood. 
</P>
<P>
"People are talking about cutbacks. There are too many crises," said Edward 
Johnson, a Pasadena resident who was looking to cut his holiday spending bill 
in half from last year by bargain hunting at the Glendale Galleria. "It just 
seems like it's not the time to go shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Along with growing concerns about the U.S. economy, the annual 
day-after-Thanksgiving outpouring of shoppers comes in a year that has 
witnessed a string of big retailing bankruptcies. To avoid big losses and 
profit declines posted over the past 12 months, many merchants have cut costs 
by firing thousands of workers and trimming inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers also have tried to attract customers with a blizzard of special 
sales, price markdowns and other promotional gimmicks, but those tactics 
appeared, at best, only moderately successful on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The subdued Christmas shopping mood of many consumers dovetailed with reports 
that consumer confidence has fallen to the lowest level since the 1981 
recession, largely because of the weakening economy and the Persian Gulf 
crisis. A survey released Friday by Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates, a leading 
market research firm, shows that consumers have continued to grow more cautious 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly survey of 450 households across the nation, the firm found that 
46% of those polled plan to spend less than they did a year ago on holiday 
gifts, versus 25% spending more. A year ago, heading into what proved to be a 
very weak Christmas for retailers, 36% said they planned to spend less and 33% 
predicted that they would spend more. 
</P>
<P>
At the Brea Mall, the day started with just a small knot of shoppers at the 
entrance to the Nordstrom store, instead of the crowds of past years. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought there would be more (shoppers) down here," said Anita Rule of 
Anaheim, who had come to shop with her sister, Rachel Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
And the vast parking lots at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa were half empty 
when the day began, but were nearly full with cars by mid-afternoon. "It's 
slow," said Chris Castille, Brookstone store manager. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Henwood, general manager of South Coast Plaza, said he was a little worried 
about the earlier small crowds but was mindful of how Southern Californians 
appreciate a beautiful day and expected -- rightly, as it turned out -- that 
shoppers would show up in droves in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are doing better than anticipated," Henwood said. "We enjoyed a 
very relaxing start today, with the weather outside. It was ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa police dispatched extra officers to the mall to control traffic. By 
Friday evening, motorists were lined up on the San Diego Freeway, waiting to 
get off on the Bristol Street exit to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic is pretty heavy out there," Officer Mike Cohen said. "There's about a 
half-hour delay getting off the freeway and another half-hour delay to get out 
of the parking lot. And parking's a whole other story." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said extra officers will be assigned to monitor traffic around the mall 
until Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster police assigned an officer just for parking lot duty at Westminster 
Mall and also put officers on the rooftop to watch for prospective car thieves. 
By early evening, the lot was "very packed," and traffic on the streets around 
the mall was "heavy," Lt. Larry Woessner said. 
</P>
<P>
Other malls in Santa Ana and Newport Beach, however, escaped without traffic 
major tie-ups, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police had not planned any special measures around MainPlace/Santa 
Ana, where traffic was reported as moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach police reported "very light" traffic around Fashion Island in the 
morning, a condition that did not change much by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers and retailers in San Diego were also in a relatively upbeat mood. Dane 
Lowe of Poway, shopping at Horton Plaza in downtown San Diego, said she did not 
view the economy as "a real big problem. . . . If everyone buys into it being 
bad, then it will go down the tubes. It's a state of mind. If you want it to be 
bad, it will be." 
</P>
<P>
At the Fashion Valley shopping center north of San Diego, business was brisk 
throughout the day. Most merchants and shoppers said that sales and good buys 
were plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very busy. It's much better than last year," said Carol Ball, a 
fragrance counter manager at Robinson's department store. "Business has been 
down slightly (during the past several months), but we've been doing very well 
today." 
</P>
<P>
The morning shopping crowd at Century City Shopping Center and Marketplace was 
also sparse as Sylvia Morren, co-owner of Fil a Fil, arranged merchandise in 
the empty men's and women's shirt shop. "It was very slow last week, and we do 
not feel at all that it is the biggest shopping day of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Discount stores appeared to be doing a brisk business. The parking lots of a 
Target and nearby Pic 'N' Save in Pacoima were packed, in sharp contrast to a 
very quiet Sherman Oaks Galleria on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Carbajal, walking out of the Target store, said, "We're just being more 
careful" this year. "Usually we just kind of freely buy, but not this year," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts note that it is far too early to tell whether this will be the 
nation's fourth weak Christmas season in a row. Holiday business generally 
accounts for 50% or more of many big retailers' profits, so gloomy predictions 
have aroused deep concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Chicago, observers said the crowds seemed thinner than a year ago 
and that shoppers were carrying fewer packages. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Baugh, a Salvation Army worker collecting Christmas donations on upscale 
North Michigan Avenue, said that last holiday season many shoppers "actually 
gave bills, but this year it's just spare change." 
</P>
<P>
In northwest Atlanta's Cumberland Mall, shoppers lined up to buy Reebok 
sneakers at discounts of up to 34% at a Rich's department store. 
</P>
<P>
One shopper, Alma Hart, said she bought $300 worth of sneakers. "A big sale 
like this helps," she said. Across the mall at a Macy's store, the shoe 
discounts were not as deep and the customer traffic was slower. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown San Francisco, early morning promotions at the Emporium department 
store on Market Street lured a horde of bargain hunters. Katy Sullivan, who 
came in from Fresno to get a jump on Christmas shopping, said the store seemed 
to be more crowded than in previous years, and the sale prices were much better 
than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of 30% off, it's more like 40% this year," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, already hit hard by Wall Street layoffs, major department stores 
appeared much less crowded than last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to be a busy day, but it wasn't," said a saleswoman in the 
small-appliance department at Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
Among the best-selling items was one of the least expensive: a slim, 
lightweight telephone, the Swisstel, selling for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
At Northline Mall in Houston, a city that has been buoyed by recent increases 
in crude oil prices, shoppers seemed to be doing more looking than buying. 
Despite national surveys showing concern about the economy, many people 
expressed no worries about their circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Rodriguez, a 33-year-old heavy-equipment operator for the city of 
Houston, said the Persian Gulf crisis "seems so far away, and I am not 
personally involved." 
</P>
<P>
He is going ahead with plans to buy his 9-year-old son a video game. "Santa 
will bring it," Rodriguez said. "Our Christmas this year will be the same as 
last year. Nothing has happened to make us cut back." 
</P>
<P>
The mood was even more upbeat among shoppers at upscale Bellevue Square, in the 
economically strong Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more money than I've ever had" for presents, said shopper Janet 
Knudsen. Still, Knudsen said, "It's perceived that everyone else is spending 
less this year, so I've scaled back, too." 
</P>
<P>
With more and more shoppers in recent years waiting until the final week before 
Christmas to buy their gifts, the early days of the season play a less 
important role. Some retailers have also expressed hope that the early arrival 
of Thanksgiving this year, providing a longer shopping season, could boost 
business. They say that resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis would raise 
consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas is Christmas," explained Kris Leddin, a homemaker from Davenport, 
Iowa, who was shopping at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago. "You 
still have to buy for everybody, you can't leave anybody out, so you still have 
to spend." 
</P>

The deputies who run Orange County's jails do not carry weapons: Sometimes, the 
only thing protecting them from inmates is what the sheriff's academy teaches 
about "command presence." 
</P>
<P>
It is an authority that extends from the way they stand, the way they carry 
themselves, and their tone of voice when they speak to the men and women behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
Most deputies come to their jobs -- at a starting annual pay of $31,224 -- 
expecting the violence and meanness that accompanies the task of holding 
society's accused or convicted troublemakers, officials say. They have been 
spit at, yelled at, and had their eyes scratched, hair pulled and badges torn 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the profession you chose and you deal with it," explained Deputy Margaret 
Cooper, who has worked in the Santa Ana Intake-Release Center five months. 
</P>
<P>
But what they didn't bargain for, deputies say, is the added pressure of having 
to hustle 90,000 prisoners a year through an overcrowded system as lawsuits and 
a federal court order loom in the background. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a day that goes by that you don't have to think about 
overcrowding," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's jails are built to hold 3,203 inmates. They currently house 
4,400, however, and the system is almost always filled beyond capacity. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1,380 deputies who operate the five jail facilities, it means every day 
is a race to shuffle people in and out of cells. And they must run that race 
within the confines of a court order and rules affirming the prisoners' civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"The rubber band keeps stretching," Assistant Sheriff Rocky Hewitt, in charge 
of jail operations, said. "As administrators, we are worried. I am looking over 
people's shoulders to make sure they don't make a mistake. They don't want to 
make a mistake, but overcrowding creates more of a chance of error than ever 
before." 
</P>
<P>
All Orange County sheriff's deputies are required to start their careers with a 
stint at the jail. It usually lasts two years but can be shorter or longer 
depending on the staffing on patrol units, where jail deputies go next. 
</P>
<P>
Officials consider it good preparation for dealing with criminal suspects on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Jail duty is the toughest job any law enforcement officer can have," Hewitt 
believes. 
</P>
<P>
California jails in all but three counties are run by a sheriff's department. 
In Orange County, deputies get two weeks of jail training in addition to the 
normal 24 weeks of police academy instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Jail deputies are never armed because weapons only present a temptation to 
inmates, who routinely outnumber their keepers. Maintaining order instead 
relies on a deputy's intelligence and experience. 
</P>
<P>
"They learn that communication skill, that sixth sense," Sgt. Jim Estep said 
recently as he and three young deputies talked about their jail experience. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneyes for inmates say that the command presence of deputies can 
sometimes cross over into mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
In June, U.S. District Judge William P. Gray responded to complaints filed by 
the American Civil Liberties Union in behalf of inmates who charged that they 
had been subjected to "verbal and psychological abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Gray told sheriff's officials to make sure deputies refrained from any abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"The court is fully aware that 'psychological abuse' is not a one-way street 
and that sheriff's deputies are subjected to verbal abuse that tempts them 
sorely to respond in kind," Gray wrote the county counsel. "Nonetheless, 
sheriff's deputies must maintain their professional demeanor at all times, and 
any deputy that is unable to do so must be disciplined or removed." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, ACLU lawyers complained that inmates are not given enough 
access to legal materials and law libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the hard-nosed, insensitive treatment of prisoners as objects 
rather than human beings," the lawyer's wrote, "virtually every prisoner feels 
they have a complaint against their jailers." 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials say, however, that they have followed the judge's order, and 
that the Orange County jails are among the best run in the nation.

UC NURSES APPROVE PAY RAISE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Registered nurses at UCI Medical Center in Orange will receive a 3% raise 
retroactive to Nov. 1 and another 3% raise May 1 under a statewide contract 
approved this week by about 7,200 nurses working for University of California 
hospitals and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The previous contract for the nurses expired Nov. 1 but was extended during 
negotiations between the university and the California Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year contract allows for wages to be renegotiated after one year. 
</P>
<P>
All UC nurses work under the same basic contract, but each hospital and clinic 
has a separate pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
Differing pay rates have long been a point of contention for UCI nurses, who 
for several years have sought to earn the same pay as other nurses in the 
state. The starting pay for nurses at UC San Francisco Medical Center, for 
instance, is more than 20% greater than for nurses at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
When contract talks stalled late in October, UCI nurses held an impromptu 
one-day sickout to protest pay offers. The job action reportedly was the only 
one statewide during the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
The sickout, by an undisclosed number of nurses, forced the hospital to close 
its trauma center for about 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, UCI Medical Center nurses will also receive extra pay 
for working evening and night shifts and nurses with specialized training will 
earn an extra $100 a month. TOM McQUEENEY

CITY VOTES TO SURVEY ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM TORTOLANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city, seeking to bolster its legal standing in efforts to regulate adult 
businesses such as bookstores and "peep shows," will hire a consultant to study 
the impact of such businesses. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the council approved an agreement with UC Irvine researchers Richard 
McCleary and James Meeker to assess the effect that the businesses have on 
property values, crime and nuisances such as noise. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 in favor of the proposal, with Councilman J. Tilman 
Williams dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the consultants are to study adult businesses not located in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The completed reports are expected by Feb. 15, and the consultants will be paid 
$20,350. 
</P>
<P>
Williams objected to the cost, arguing that better enforcement of zoning laws 
would be cheaper and more effective. "If we already know the solution, why are 
we going to spend $20,000 to $25,000 of taxpayers' money on this?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager George L. Tindall said that zoning enforcement wasn't a complete 
solution, and that the survey was needed to support the city's contention that 
adult businesses should be treated differently from other commercial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for us to have an ordinance that provides a separation, we have to 
justify that separation," Tindall said. "They'll take the data to study the 
impact of adult uses on adjacent areas that hopefully meet the standards of the 
Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove's "spacing" ordinance, which attempts to keep such businesses a 
certain distance from each other and away from residential areas, has been 
struck down by courts, Tindall said. 
</P>
<P>
The other choice is to designate a certain area of the city for adult 
businesses. The city has seven adult bookstores and peep shows on Garden Grove 
Boulevard, most of them between Magnolia Street and Beach Boulevard. JIM

ANTI-FUR ACTIVISTS STAGE PLAZA PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Followed by security guards, about 50 animal rights activists marched through 
South Coast Plaza on Friday afternoon and presented Robinson's department store 
the head of a mink for being what one protester described as "the cruelist 
retailer of the year." 
</P>
<P>
During a short speech in the store's fur section, Ava Park, founder of Orange 
County People for Animals, conveyed the organization's award -- the skin and 
head of a mink spattered with red paint -- to a Robinson's manager. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not free to torture your pet, abuse your wife, beat your children," 
Park told the gathering. "You shouldn't be allowed to mistreat animals. We'll 
be out here every year until there are no more furs sold in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
She predicted that the fur industry would be dead in 20 years and called 
Robinson's "the cruelist retailer of the year." Department store officials 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The award capped more than three hours of peaceful protest along Bristol Street 
in front of the shopping center, where demonstrators carried signs, saying "Fur 
Is Dead," "End Animal Agony Now," and "Wearing Fur Is a Sign of Ignorance and 
Indifference." 
</P>
<P>
Ravey Blumfield, 22, a protester, said he hoped the march would discourage 
potential fur buyers by emphasizing "the cruelty that goes on behind the 
glamour." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty stupid that animals should die so that some rich people 
can impress their friends at a dinner party," Blumfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Many people, including some of Robinson's sales staff, applauded the activists 
for the march. 
</P>
<P>
But others grumbled, saying the protesters were too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"I got really livid," said one shopper who asked not to be identified. "They 
try and attack my privilege as a consumer, and try and intimidate me into 
believing in their cause. I know that we live in a free country and that 
freedom of speech is important to all of us, but they were stepping over the 
line." JON NALICK

CURBSIDE CONTAINER TAMPERING ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has outlawed tampering with curbside recycling containers 
after residents complained that scavengers have been going through trash and 
taking bottles, cans and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new ordinance, passed unanimously this week, those caught tampering 
with the trash can be liable for civil damages. 
</P>
<P>
A state law passed in 1989 gave councils the authority to enforce such an 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"Just this morning, I saw this person going through my neighbor's trash, and it 
bothered me," Mayor Norman Eckenrode told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the recycling program is used to defray the cost of trash 
collection. Since the recycling program was launched in June, 1,477 tons have 
been recycled at a value of $61,168. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said that residents had complained that scavengers who go 
through their trash are violating their privacy. In addition, Placentia 
Disposal has complained that scavengers' vehicles have at times blocked trash 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a lot of people go through trash because they choose to," said 
Councilwoman Maria Moreno. "I think it's one step away from being homeless. 
Still, they could be looking for credit card receipts." TED JOHNSON

NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDING VALUATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with home-building, non-residential construction is taking a beating in 
Orange County. The value of commercial (i.e., non-residential) building permits 
during the first nine months of 1990 is down 19% compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has been hit harder than its neighbors, among whom San Diego is 
faring worst, with a 10% decline (and two, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties, have increases over last year's comparable period). Statewide, 
valuations are down just 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The only real bright spot in Orange County non-residential building is with 
stores, where there has been a 24% increase in permit values. All other 
categories have dropped, in a couple of cases by half. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how things stand after nine months:

SENIOR CITIZEN APARTMENT COMPLEX APPROVED BY PLACENTIA CITY COUNCIL

<P>
The City Council has approved the development of a 122-unit senior citizen 
apartment complex that had been delayed for months after neighbors objected to 
increased traffic and noise from the project. 
</P>
<P>
The complex, to be located on a 2.7-acre site on the north side of Carlson Lane 
and the east side of Bradford Avenue, was approved unanimously this week after 
the developers, Huntington Properties of Huntington Beach, agreed to construct 
an eight-foot fence around much of the site to reduce noise and ensure privacy. 
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to make sure trash bins are not placed in back of someone's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council amended its development standards for the project to allow 
fewer parking spaces and less open space than what has been required. Some 
council members said that it fulfills a demand for more senior citizen housing 
in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"There's certainly a need for this in this community," said Councilman John O. 
Tynes.

HOME BUILDERS NOW MORE CAUTIOUS THAN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT '91

No kidding! 
</P>
<P>
Home builders in California have changed their attitude and now are "cautious" 
instead of "optimistic" when viewing prospects for 1991, according to the 
California Building Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The trade group says it discovered this switch in a survey conducted earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey also found that while not all areas of the state are 
hurting (the San Joaquin and Central valley markets are described as moderate 
to hot), the coastal urban markets are "most affected by the production and 
sales downturn."

Mortgage Brokers: With more and more people crossing banks and S&amp;Ls off 
their lists when they go shopping for mortgage loans, the state's mortgage 
brokers have come into their own. 
</P>
<P>
The brokers generally don't provide funding; they put borrowers and willing 
lenders together. And mortgage brokers now are responsible for a majority of 
the residential loan originations in the state. 
</P>
<P>
So now they've formed an association -- the California Assn. of Mortgage 
Brokers. One of the founding chapters is in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide group is headquartered in San Diego.

MERCHANTS SET SALE IN UNCERTAIN WATERS OF HOLIDAY SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: EXPECTATIONS ARE LOW, BUT SOME STORE OWNERS IN DOWNTOWN BUSINESS 
DISTRICTS ARE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE TURNOUT. 
</P>

For many, the words shopping and mall go together like Dasher and Donner. But 
as Orange County shoppers rang in the first official day of the Christmas 
shopping season Friday, some shunned the hustle-bustle of big malls for the 
county's handful of downtown business districts. 
</P>
<P>
And like retailers across the nation, an informal survey of local downtown 
merchants on Friday found an uneasy mood about the holiday shopping season amid 
concerns about the economy and the turmoil in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Many downtown merchants reported sparse business, and some seemed more resigned 
than others to the idea of unspectacular holiday sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one who says, que sera, sera," said Charlene Rogers, manager of Exclusive 
Antiques in downtown Orange. "It's slow, but we'll survive with the flow of 
traffic we have." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Stevens, manager of the J.E. Dawson men's clothier in Laguna Beach, said, 
"It's slow everywhere." He said early seasonal discounting by major department 
stores has added to the woes of smaller retailers already hurt by a sluggish 
national economy. "The department stores have inundated the public with sale, 
sale, sale at the malls, and that has hurt us here locally." 
</P>
<P>
But some shoppers said they were by passing department store discounts for a 
more relaxed, small-town type of shopping experience. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Davalos, a 28-year-old teacher from Cerritos, was inspecting the dolls at 
Exclusive Antiques in Orange on Friday afternoon. She said she doesn't like the 
crowds at malls. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the quaintness of this area, the old-town feel," she said. "Malls are 
so boxed-in, with piped-in music. They're so stale." 
</P>
<P>
Local retailers said they'd been expecting a slow start to the holiday shopping 
season because of the economy. Light morning traffic seemed to confirm the 
gloomy predictions, but the crowds grew at some major shopping malls as the day 
wore on. By early evening, motorists were lined up at the Bristol Street exit 
ramp on the San Diego Freeway, near South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Mall reported heavy traffic by the end of the day as well. But 
traffic remained moderate at MainPlace mall in Santa Ana and light at Fashion 
Island in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of slow sales, merchants in downtown Orange said Friday's 
increased foot traffic was a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was a little more than I expected," said Dorothy Casada, owner of 
Dorothy &amp; Friends Antiques, as she wrapped a harvest-colored pillow. "But 
we're probably not any busier than last year." 
</P>
<P>
It's not for lack of trying. Some merchants in downtown Orange have begun 
offering free refreshments to weekend shoppers and plan to keep it up until the 
holiday season ends. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Zalay, an owner of Antique Place, said shoppers are buying less and 
buying differently. "People are buying fewer frills and knickknacks," Zalay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Along Santa Ana's 4th Street, groups of predominantly Latino shoppers crowded 
the sidewalks of the old but renovated shopping district Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Some came to stock up on Christmas presents or gifts to take to their native 
Mexico or Central America for the holidays. Others appeared to be more 
interested in just watching the active street life. 
</P>
<P>
John Garcia, manager of Perfect Shoes, said sales are off this year because of 
the uncertain economy. "We don't expect Christmas to be like last year," Garcia 
said. "People are holding back. They seemed to be holding onto their money." 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Beach's main business district, Chantilly By The Sea seemed to be 
attracting the biggest crowds on an unseasonably warm November day. But what 
the shop sells -- ice cream -- isn't meant for under the Yuletide tree. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach retailers said sales were slow and the most crowded stores 
appeared to be restaurants and snack shops. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more people are putting things on hold and coming back," said Jane 
Huston, a clerk at Hobie Sports, a surf and ski shop. "People are taking more 
time to decide what they want to buy." 
</P>
<P>
Those shoppers interviewed walking around town said they were there for the 
beach and to browse, not to buy. Some observers said people seemed to be 
carrying fewer shopping bags than in years past. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers "know stuff is going to be on sale after Christmas," said Tori Taylor, 
store manager at Hobie Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Gregory Crouch and Chris Woodyard contributed to this 
story.

BRITAIN'S BLUE AEROPLANES GET OFF THE GROUND AT LAST; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE 8-YEAR-OLD BAND HAS MOVED BEYOND ITS U.S. CULT FOLLOWING TO BECOME 
THE DARLING OF ALTERNATIVE RADIO STATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Gerard Langley, the founder of and chief songwriter for the Blue Aeroplanes, 
said he finds a lot of current music "pretty boring." But he believes things 
are changing. 
</P>
<P>
The Aeroplanes, who play Bogart's in Long Beach tonight, are Englishmen who 
conjure up the likes of Bob Dylan, the Sisters of Mercy and Dire Straits, even 
traces of British folk rock a la Fairport Convention. With three guitarists -- 
Rodney Allen, Angelo Bruschini and 18-year-old whiz Alex Lee -- the band is 
able to provide multiple layers of texture. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing this kind of music all along," said Langley, whose 
distinctive sung/spoken vocals are another of the band's trademarks. "But 
people in England were more into novelty and noise, until recently, and now 
what we do has suddenly become acceptable. I really think it's a case of us 
having waited around long enough to become fashionable." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with the release of "Swagger," the 8-year-old band's first album for a 
major label, the Aeroplanes have finally moved beyond their cult following in 
the United States and are becoming the darlings of college radio and other 
alternative stations. The album was produced by Gil Norton, who did the Pixies' 
breakthrough, "Doolittle." 
</P>
<P>
R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, a fan of the band since 1985, has been an ally, 
contributing vocals to one track on "Swagger" and requesting that the 
Aeroplanes open for R.E.M. during its British tour. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Aeroplanes started out as a vehicle for Langley's poetry, which he 
would read to the accompaniment of his brother John's drums and his and 
Bruschini's guitars. Soon, though, he found that poetry "was a limited forum" 
and started placing more emphasis on the music. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 musicians came and went over the years before things stabilized with 
the current lineup, which still finds John Langley on drums and also includes 
bassist Andy McCreeth and free-form dancer Wojtek Dmochowski. 
</P>
<P>
"This lineup wasn't necessarily intended to last a long time," Gerard Langley 
said. "But it became a proper band very quickly. In the previous lineups, 
everyone was always a bit undecided about whether he wanted to be in a band or 
whether he wanted to have a proper job." 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the Aeroplanes' second American tour this year (the first was 
with the Church), Langley said he's finding that the group is adaptable to any 
size venue. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sets go from loud, thrashy stuff to quiet acoustic stuff to things that 
build and swell," he said. "That sort of thing seems to be rare in rock music 
at the moment, but it's something that's quite natural to us. We're the sort of 
band that can tour in smoky rock 'n' roll clubs or large venues, then turn 
around and quite comfortably play in an art gallery." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Aeroplanes and the Jazz Butcher play tonight at 9:30 at Bogart's, 
6288 Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach. Tickets: $13.50. Information: (213) 
594-8975.

SAN DIEGO JAZZ SCENE HAS GROWING PAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Diego's jazz club scene has matured, but not without growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years alone, clubs such as the Bella Via, Our Place, Vic's and 
Diego's Loft have closed or discontinued jazz. But venues such as Croce's, the 
Horton Grand Hotel and All That Jazz in Rancho Bernardo emerged to take their 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Other jazz spots, such as the Catamaran and Chuck's Steakhouse, switched from 
traditional, straight-ahead jazz to light-contemporary jazz to lure larger 
crowds. And thus began the great debate between the light jazzers and the 
traditional purists. 
</P>
<P>
Light, or "contemporary," jazz was popularized by KIFM (98.1) radio during the 
1980s. You don't need a lot of patience or musical education to appreciate its 
simple, predictable melodies, which are seldom interrupted by improvisation. By 
contrast, spontaneous improvisation is the common characteristic of such 
traditional jazz forms as Big Band music or the small-group be-bop originated 
by players such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker during the 1940s. This 
essential difference has left two camps of fans and musicians at odds. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people take exception to the fact that they call that music jazz," said 
Tony Sidotti, a disc jockey on KSDS-FM (88.3) who also books straight-ahead 
jazz in local clubs. "However, I do feel that the end result of KIFM's music is 
more positive than negative. You've seen some of that in the last year, with 
(light jazz players such as) David Benoit and Lee Ritenour doing straight-ahead 
jazz albums." 
</P>
<P>
The KIFM-sponsored Lites Out Jazz club circuit now features jazz at the 
Catamaran, Humphrey's, Anthony's Harborside and other venues six nights a week. 
In some clubs, light jazz preempted other forms of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The Catamaran in Pacific Beach and Chuck's Steakhouse (not on KIFM's circuit) 
in La Jolla, for example, were straight-ahead venues that went light. 
</P>
<P>
"For some 20 years, we were sort of a (straight-ahead) jazz club," said George 
Harrington, general manager at the Catamaran for six years. "When I got to town 
in 1985, I met Art Good," who pioneered light jazz on KIFM. "We went over to 
Humphrey's one night to hear light jazz, and the place was packed. We decided 
to go with it at the Catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no conscious decision to use contemporary jazz over straight-ahead. 
It was just something that was happening in 1985, and it looked like a good way 
to fill the room on Wednesday nights. It was a winner from Day One. The room 
seats 350, and it has been full the last three Wednesdays." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington doubts he will ever go back to straight-ahead jazz. He doesn't think 
the light jazz and rock fans who now flock to the hotel's Cannibal Bar on 
different nights would have much use for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Lites Out Jazz is winning, unfortunately," said bassist Kevin Hennessy, who 
plays a variety of jazz with several local bands. "I love to play 
straight-ahead jazz, but I never get calls for it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some clubs have kept their traditional jazz, and persistence sometimes 
allows them to build loyal followings. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent as much as $10,000 a month subsidizing our jazz, but now it pretty 
much breaks even," said Ingrid Croce, who features local straight-ahead jazz 
groups twice a day, seven days a week at Croce's, the downtown restaurant and 
bar she owns. 
</P>
<P>
One debate between fans of the two musics has centered on whether KIFM and 
contemporary jazz can help bring new listeners to other forms of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the popularity of light jazz help KSDS and straight-ahead jazz?" said 
Tony Sisti, programming director at KSDS. "I don't know. The sense I get is 
KIFM brings listeners to KIFM. Our audience doesn't tolerate much contemporary 
jazz. A guy called in today while we were playing a Chuck Mangione song and 
said, 'Do us a favor. No more Chuck Mangione.' We play a little fusion or 
contemporary jazz, but we're very selective. We don't play Kenny G., but we 
would play something like the Yellowjackets and Michael Brecker." 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Weissberg, who prefers traditional jazz to the light jazz he presents 
during the summer Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay series, nonetheless thinks 
KIFM deserves some credit. 
</P>
<P>
"They play a lot of music that doesn't get much radio play anywhere else. They 
have more artists and songs on their list than Q-106, B-100, KGB or even 91X. 
In terms of taking chances, no one in commercial radio takes chances, which 
leaves it to college or nonprofit radio to play people like Jelly Roll Morton 
or Miles Davis." 
</P>
<P>
A healthy trend from all this is the blurring of borders among varieties of 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
KSDS plays the top contemporary and traditional jazz albums of the week on its 
"Friday Night Countdown" program. 
</P>
<P>
Elario's, the La Jolla club that for years featured only veterans of 
straight-ahead jazz, is branching out, even trying to lure KIFM's audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Straight-ahead jazz is a very, very tough art form to make money in," said Rob 
Hagey, who books Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
Since Hagey began coordinating the talent last spring, Elario's has expanded 
its lineup to include not only established, legendary straight-ahead players 
such as Art Farmer, Benny Carter and Kenny Burrell, but also rising 
straight-ahead musicians such as Christopher Hollyday and Marcus Roberts; 
cutting-edge jazz musicians, including Sun Ra and Bill Frisell, and even KIFM 
favorites such as Tim Eyermann. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if KIFM's audience comes into the club to hear talent they recognize, 
they might come back to hear a straight-ahead band and like it.

ENVIRONMENT: A TOP ARCHITECT SAYS WE MUST BUILD NONTOXIC HOMES FOR OUR OWN -- 
AND THE PLANET'S -- GOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It started with the best of intentions. In the housing boom after World War II, 
homes were air-conditioned for comfort, closing the windows in the process. 
After the energy crisis of the 1970s, houses were made energy-efficient, 
producing a new array of insulations, paints, sealants, caulks and adhesives to 
do the job. 
</P>
<P>
American houses were becoming as snug as a submarine. 
</P>
<P>
They were also becoming polluted. Even poisonous. The new synthetic building 
products, dispensing a toxic soup of chemicals into airtight buildings, have 
created a new problem -- the "sick building syndrome" -- that can threaten the 
health of its occupants. 
</P>
<P>
The prescription, say environmentally conscious architects and builders, is to 
go back to nature and natural building products. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandpa really knew how to build houses -- he didn't use all these 
sophisticated, man-made materials that pollute the environment," said Jerry 
Miller, owner of Environmental Projects -- a 20-year-old architecture and 
building firm in Laguna Beach. "Grandpa used wood and stone and concrete and 
glass." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bierman-Lytle, a nationally renowned environmental architect, lamented: 
"We are not very civilized in the way we use the planet. We are petroleum 
fiends when it comes to building materials. We have to start changing the way 
we build and the way we consume." 
</P>
<P>
His Masters Corp., headquartered in a concrete-block warehouse in New Canaan, 
Conn., builds custom houses with such features as nontoxic, low-toxic and 
natural building materials; energy-efficient heating and cooling; air filter 
systems designed to remove pollutants, and an overall computer management 
system that makes the traditional thermostat look prehistoric. 
</P>
<P>
And, having spent the past few years scouting Europe for manufacturers of 
natural building products, Bierman-Lytle has assembled a comprehensive 
assortment under one roof. He recently opened Environmental Outfitters, a 
resource sales center that sells more than 2,000 products, including 
petrochemical-free paint, insulation from seawater minerals, untreated wood 
products and stains made with citrus peel, linseed oil and berries. 
</P>
<P>
The growing movement toward designing "healthy homes" is long overdue, said Bob 
Berkebile, chairman of the American Institute of Architects' new environmental 
committee. "The Environmental Protection Agency research lab has identified 
60,000 chemicals that we are exposed to all the time and don't react to very 
favorably. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just now starting to look at the toxic soup we have created," he said. 
"Eventually, we're going to have to rethink all the building materials and 
building systems we use." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Bierman-Lytle's clients fall into two groups: those who want -- and 
can afford -- to make an environmental statement (natural products can add as 
much as 35% to the construction costs of a new house), and those suffering from 
such an array of chemical sensitivities that one allergist has described them 
as the "canaries in the coal mine." 
</P>
<P>
But Bierman-Lytle sees a bright future for healthy houses, despite the 
obstacles of higher costs and an entrenched housing industry, where change 
occurs slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be a gigantic public demand for environmental standards in 
houses," he said. "It's already happening. A year ago, we were getting 25 to 30 
telephone inquiries a week about healthy buildings. Now we're getting around 
150 calls a week, and a lot of media attention." 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Miller's Southern California clients are requesting 
natural materials for their homes, the builder/designer said. "People are 
becoming more educated about the health hazards of products such as 
petroleum-based paints, particle board and formaldehyde," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Particle board, commonly used to make cabinets, "is put together with 
formaldehyde-based resins that release known carcinogens into the air," Miller 
explained. Paints, he added, are only 10% substance -- "the rest is carrier 
that we breathe as it evaporates into the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Bierman-Lytle: "The production rate of synthetic chemicals is truly 
awesome. There are 1,000 new products on the market every year. Most of them 
are petroleum-derived, and we have found that a lot of them produce indoor 
pollution." 
</P>
<P>
Like a chemist-detective, he said he looks for radon, biogenic particles, 
organic particles and vapors, water and environmental tobacco smoke. 
Bierman-Lytle cited some of the materials he uses: natural linoleum from 
Scotland, 100% cotton carpeting in soft pastels from Germany, cement and 
seawater roofing slate from Belgium, formaldehyde-free boards from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the danger of the myriad chemicals introduced to homes since 
Grandpa built his 60 years ago, Miller said, modern structures "practically 
have to be hermetically sealed to meet today's strict standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Building codes require that windows and doors cannot leak air under any 
condition," Miller said. "Airborne chemicals and second-hand smoke just get 
trapped." 
</P>
<P>
"Sick building syndrome" is less of a problem here than in other areas of the 
country, because Southern Californians are not as reliant on heating and 
air-conditioning systems. "We open our windows a lot," Miller pointed out. 
"People who live in cold or humid climates are stuck in airtight boxes much of 
the year." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the good ol' days, houses were simultaneously better insulated and 
better ventilated. "The walls were thicker, but they leaked a little air," 
Miller said. "Houses could breathe." 
</P>
<P>
Bierman-Lytle has been an environmental pioneer since he arrived at Yale 
Architecture School in 1975 with the desire to build energy-efficient houses 
that didn't look like engineering labs. 
</P>
<P>
"The solar houses of that period had a lot of panels on the roof and dripping, 
humid tanks inside," he said. "They just didn't take off." 
</P>
<P>
He began designing houses that produced their own energy instead of draining it 
from the earth. Working with two other students, he got permission to depart 
from the regular program and build his first passive solar house. 
</P>
<P>
His building, a towering New England farmhouse with an expansive glass front, 
silvered wood siding and small-paned windows, was featured in Architectural 
Digest as exemplifying how architects could marry solar technology with 
beautiful design. "That," he said, "was exactly what we wanted people to think 
about our work." 
</P>
<P>
He left Yale with his Masters Corporation business already going, but it wasn't 
until the mid '80s that he began to realize that his elegant solar houses were 
also toxic. 
</P>
<P>
He is a builder as well as designer, and he was increasingly bothered by 
coughing and sneezing when he was finishing a floor or painting cabinets. 
Installing fiberglass made his eyes itch. 
</P>
<P>
"In the building trade, this is considered part of the business, but we started 
to ask questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also paid attention to a little-heralded 1984 report for the Department of 
Energy, which stated that indoor air pollution was produced, in part, by such 
building materials as carpeting, particle board and paints. That was "the first 
indication that we were working with toxic products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During a six-week teaching stint in Germany in 1985, he met the "green" 
movement. "My students introduced me to manufacturers of paints and finishes 
that didn't contain formaldehyde and solvents. They were producing products we 
didn't have. It's an alternative movement, tucked away in small places in 
Germany, Belgium and Scandinavia." 
</P>
<P>
The trip was pivotal for Bierman-Lytle. He imported the products, convincing 
clients that, despite higher costs, they were better. In addition to 
environmentally pure houses, he was building a reputation. "A safe house can 
look like anything -- it can be Egyptian, it can be Colonial, it can be a 
farmhouse," he said. "This differentiates it from the solar movement." 
</P>
<P>
His environmental litmus test is threefold: 
</P>
<P>
Is the house a health hazard to the occupant, the producer or the installer? 
</P>
<P>
Is it a renewable resource? 
</P>
<P>
Is the waste biodegradable? 
</P>
<P>
Having established himself as an upscale builder, he hopes to apply the 
research to the houses in the moderate price range. Already, he has been doing 
some consulting work on large-scale projects. 
</P>
<P>
He is co-writing a book, "Home Safe Home," and predicts that environmental 
health will be the cutting-edge issue of the '90s, pointing out that real 
estate transactions already include questions about radon and asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans like building homes," he said. "We do it quickly on a large scale, 
but we are doing it badly in terms of health and energy efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
Just how gigantic the public appetite for healthier houses will be in the '90s 
is up for debate, but nobody denies that the "green building" movement is 
developing momentum in the counterculture of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to think globally: I am developing a database of green products, green 
techniques and green people in the building world," said Terry Kennedy of 
Venice, a longtime builder and environmental consultant who has launched a 
monthly newsletter, "Green Building News." 
</P>
<P>
Based on months of research on building issues, he predicts a wave of 
"resource-conservation practices." 
</P>
<P>
"There are little creative centers all over," he said. "(Green) products have 
been out, and people have been thinking about this for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
And at Eco-Home, a Los Feliz demonstration home and resource center for 
ecological living in the city, director Julia Russell reports getting "more and 
more inquiries from people looking for architects with a background in 
ecological design and construction." 
</P>
<P>
"People seem increasingly concerned about the quality of their living space," 
she said. "Not just aesthetically, but in terms of health." 
</P>
<P>
But the National Assn. of Home Builders, whose members turn out about a million 
single-family houses a year, isn't predicting any environmental face lift for 
the 11,000 products that go into a typical house. 
</P>
<P>
For one reason, "healthy houses" are too expensive, said Donald F. Luebs, who, 
as technical director of the NAHB National Research Center, has an overview of 
the entire range of building technologies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true, we are using finite (building) resources, in the broadest sense," 
he said. "If you say 'carpet,' if you say 'kitchen flooring,' siding on the 
house, everywhere you look there are plastics and forms of petrochemicals. In 
most cases, the natural materials that they copy are vastly more expensive 
nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that indoor air quality is a problem, and I think the 
concern with it will continue to grow. The whole science of the air quality 
issue is really low on the learning curve, as far as these chemicals go. We may 
have to do away with some. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't take petrochemicals out of our lives -- they are inherent in our 
standard of living. We are not on the breakthrough of any drastic changes. 
Things don't change fast in the building industry." 
</P>
<P>
Miller agreed that the cost of an all-natural home would be prohibitive for 
most people. "Only the upper echelon can afford to build custom homes," he 
said. "I can't approach large-scale developers, because they have so many 
problems just putting together a relatively inexpensive home." 
</P>
<P>
However, he hopes that as people become educated about indoor air pollution, 
more and more homeowners will demand safe, natural materials -- thereby 
resulting in the mass production of such products as formaldehyde-free wood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a matter of economy of scale," Miller said. "If seaweed insulation 
and natural-wood cabinetry were widely used, they would be more affordable for 
the population at large."

THE JUICY DETAILS OF AN EXOTIC LOVE AFFAIR

<P>
There's a little stand on the plaza at the end of Olvera Street in downtown Los 
Angeles that sells mangoes on a stick. 
</P>
<P>
The owner sells all kinds of other fruit, too -- really great fruit like fresh 
pineapple and plates of assorted melon slices -- but he won me as a lifelong 
customer with the mango on a stick. 
</P>
<P>
I usually eat myself into shock when I go to Olvera Street, pounding down 
gallons of tomatillo salsa with maybe a side trip to Philippe's for a beef dip 
and two lemonades, but I always leave room for the mango on a stick, even if I 
have to eat it on the train back to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Mangoes are surely the world's juiciest fruit, and they provide enough sucrose 
to make you forswear Snickers bars for eternity. And you don't nibble them. You 
chomp them down lustily. If you do it right, there should be a fine mist of 
mango juice radiating around your face. You can get compulsive about it. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a juicier, sweeter life if only people could walk out their back 
door and find that the Mango Fairy had left them a bumper crop. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Jessica Leaf, the Mango Fairy. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Leaf doesn't limit her magic only to mangoes. She owns a business in 
Vista called the Exotica Seed Company and Rare Fruit Nursery and she can sell 
you not only mangoes, but a tropical fruit that she says tastes like chocolate 
mousse. 
</P>
<P>
She can also sell you the fruit that made up the entire contents of that El 
Stupendo fruit basket you won in that lambada contest in Cancun. Guavas, 
papayas, pineapples, passion fruit, figs, kiwis, Asian pears, Satsuma 
tangerines, litchi -- the kind of succulent chow you have fed to you in 
lagoon-side cabanas by the Laker Girls. 
</P>
<P>
But Leaf doesn't just sell you the fruit. She also sells you the attached tree 
or bush or other parent plant so that you can take it home and produce your own 
bumper crop of exotic fruit in your back yard, atrium or balcony. Because the 
best news of all is that you don't have to shell out for an exhausting week at 
Club Med to get this stuff. In Orange County, we have enough different 
microclimates to grow anything from Andean papayas to -- yes! -- mangoes. 
</P>
<P>
Leaf, who has been in the exotic fruit business for 50 years, said she has a 
"big customer base" in Orange County, partly as a result of a hankering many 
members of the Asian community get for the tropical fruit of their homelands. 
Elsewhere in the county, said Leaf, exotic fruit as a back-yard crop is not as 
well-known. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people don't know that they can grow them," Leaf said. "Also, there's 
a whole body of ornamentals that people use in landscaping but they don't use 
(exotic fruits) because unless they've traveled and seen them, they don't think 
they can grow here." 
</P>
<P>
But, she said, you can grow a sapote plant about as easily as you can cultivate 
a lemon tree. It's one of her most popular plants, she says, and she has no 
trouble working up enthusiasm for it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beach communities where you don't have a frost problem, there's a whole 
wonderful world of sapotes you can have," she said. "The only thing is, you 
don't want to grow them over a sidewalk, because they produce a tremendous 
amount of fruit and you don't want it dropping on the sidewalk." 
</P>
<P>
(This sounds like a manifestation of the Falling Mango Effect. I observed it -- 
smelled it, actually -- after driving into a huge grove of mangoes on Kauai in 
July, when the fruit had ripened and many had dropped from the tree. Split 
mangoes in tropical weather start fermenting almost instantly and the result is 
an olfactory nightmare.) 
</P>
<P>
The sapotes come in several varieties, said Leaf. The white ones have "a kind 
of peach-like custard flavor." The black ones taste like "chocolate mousse in a 
cup." 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't sound appealing, you can go for various varieties of pineapple, 
some 25 different kinds of bananas (one is known by the name ice cream, another 
is called Java blue, and there are others, like the Iho Lena and the Raja Puri, 
that make you want to start flying west instantly), almost the same number of 
different figs and guavas, several kinds of papayas (including the babaco 
papaya that grows in the Andes), Surinam cherries, kiwis, mulberries, star 
fruit, purple passion fruit and -- yes! -- mangoes. 
</P>
<P>
But let's say you're not the exotic type. Or let's say you've just returned 
from your yearly three-week Gaugin-a-thon in Tahiti and if you look at another 
passion fruit you're going to need tropical-strength Pepto-Bismol in the large 
economy size. An apple, though, sounds like just the thing. Leaf can sell you 
more than 10 varieties, including my pick for the apple hall of fame, the 
Arkansas Black. 
</P>
<P>
Leaf sells the fruit in 1- and 5-gallon specimen boxes and you can buy, for 
instance, a young babaco papaya plant for about $15 and wait a few months for 
the fruit or you can have a more mature one, already bearing fruit, for $50 to 
$75, said Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on whether you want instant fruit or if you want to wait a bit," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
These plants, said Leaf, don't have to be hovered over like hothouse orchids. 
Mangoes, for example, "do well in containers. They're slow growing and they're 
great patio plants for cold areas. When it gets too cold outside, you can wheel 
them inside. They're beautiful trees and they will grow in the same conditions 
avocados will grow." 
</P>
<P>
This will be good news to people who live in the north-central part of the 
county, where avocados have been grown in large quantities. And, naturally, 
it's great news to us mango fans. Now, if we can find a way to get them to grow 
prepeeled and on a stick -- we can call it the Olvera Mango -- I'll die happy.

<TEXT>
<P>
The holiday season usually is the busiest time of the year in America's 
kitchens. It's also the time most kitchen drains get clogged and garbage 
disposal systems need fixing. 
</P>
<P>
Here are four tips from Roto-Rooter Corp. to avoid problems: 
</P>
<P>
Don't put banana peels, carrots, celery or other hard-to-grind fibrous waste 
into your garbage disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Always run water for 20 seconds before and after using the unit, and never 
start it with a full load of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Never try to sharpen disposal blades by putting in items such as broken glass, 
marbles or bones, which can damage the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid putting any grease down drains. It builds up a coating on pipes, which 
leads to serious clogs. Put grease into a container and place with the trash.

Restoration is a process for healing injuries to an aging home. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it involves the possibility of serious injury to the one doing the 
work. It's risky operating power tools, disturbing certain building materials, 
handling chemicals required in routine restoration activities, or simply 
walking around the debris indigenous to a job site. 
</P>
<P>
So, before tackling another project, take heed of these potential hazards: 
</P>

Ladders -- Each year about 100,000 Americans are injured in falls from ladders, 
according to the National Safety Council. It's smart to know these basic rules 
of the rungs: 
</P>
<P>
Always use the right ladder for the job. Never lean a stepladder against a wall 
for use as a straight ladder. Never use an extension ladder as a plank between 
two stepladders. 
</P>
<P>
Never use the top of a ladder as a step. 
</P>
<P>
Never use aluminum or wet wooden ladders in areas where live electrical wires 
are present. 
</P>
<P>
For a complete review of ladder safety, write for "Five Rules for Ladder 
Safety" from the National Safety Council, 444 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 
60601. 
</P>
<P>
Power tools -- Above all, study the voluminous safety and operating notes 
provided with most new tools. Though not great literature, reading this 
material is time wisely invested. Spend some time memorizing operating 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Apply common sense. Always wear safety glasses. Use tools with grounded plugs. 
Always unplug a device if planning to change blades or bits. Never remove 
fences or guards supplied by the manufacturer. Never wear loose clothing that 
may become entangled with equipment. Use only sharp blades or bits with your 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, don't act casually once some mastery with the tool is gained. 
The moment safety is neglected is the moment injuries can occur. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous materials -- Breaking into the fabric of an old home can be just like 
opening Pandora's box. Go slowly and make sure two very unfriendly substances 
aren't disturbed: asbestos and lead. Asbestos can be found throughout an old 
structure: wall and pipe insulation; vinyl floor tiles; patching compounds; 
furnace castings; textured paints and roofing and siding materials. 
</P>
<P>
According to published advice from the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
best way to deal with asbestos-based materials is not to disturb them. If 
removal is unavoidable, call a licensed professional for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Lead, once a common ingredient in paint, is another troublesome material. There 
is no good way to remove it other than with a chemical paint stripper. Scraping 
will create a fine, dangerous powder. When burned, the lead atomizes and can be 
inhaled. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the nearest EPA regional office. 
</P>
<P>
Another hazard nearly every renovator faces is dealing with chemical strippers, 
paints, varnishes and solvents. All of these products may contain materials 
that are known or are potential carcinogens -- cancer-producing agents. Perhaps 
of greatest concern are strippers that contain methylene chloride, the active 
ingredient that breaks down old paint and varnish film but is brutal on the 
body. Fumes can be inhaled or it can be absorbed through the skin. Used in a 
closed room, it has the power to render one unconscious because it limits the 
body's ability to carry oxygen. Extreme exposure can cause death. 
</P>
<P>
When using these products, always read instructions on the can before opening. 
Generally, try to work in an area with adequate ventilation and to avoid direct 
contact between the material and the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Always wear neoprene gloves (rubber and latex are useless) when using remover 
or cleaning paintbrushes. Immediately wash off material with soap and water if 
it splashes on the skin. Limit exposure times and always quit work if feeling 
light-headed or dizzy. Keep containers tightly sealed and stored away from any 
heat source.

MULTIFAMILY HOME FUTURES

<TEXT>
<P>
If anything is to save the county home-building market, it will be multifamily 
housing -- townhouses, condos and the like. After nine months, the most recent 
period for which information is available, multifamily permits are holding 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
This year's January-September total, buoyed by a 79% leap from August to 
September, is running 10% ahead of 1989's comparable figure. That modest gain 
is a bright spot in an Orange County building market that is 25% behind 1988 
and even more behind 1987 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to 1989, 13 cities had increases during the first nine months of 1990 
-- most notably Irvine, Tustin and South County unincorporated areas. Anaheim 
leads the list of the decliners (there were 10) compared to last year, with 825 
fewer such permits. And five cities have issued no permits this year as well as 
last (at least during the January-September period). 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the cities stack up, listed from the largest increase to the largest 
decrease in permits issued:

THINKING ABOUT GOING UNBEATEN IN THE NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GARBER, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one dares to hope a Major League baseball team will go 162-0. The National 
Hockey and National Basketball League teams understand there is no chance for a 
perfect season. But football is a different beast. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the schedule, because we have a week between games to gather 
ourselves, it can be done," New York Giants center Bart Oates says. "Going 
undefeated isn't something you think about during the off-season, but as it 
evolves ... well, everybody knows what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"You go 10 weeks without losing, and it becomes something you want to protect. 
Believe me, it is a huge motivation. Guys have been reluctant to talk about it 
publicly because they're afraid we'll jinx ourselves. But it's there. It 
becomes a dominant part of your thought process." 
</P>
<P>
After beating Detroit 20-0 Sunday to move to 10-0, Oates said the Giants were 
motivated less to defeat the Lions than to stay unbeaten. The San Francisco 
49ers entered their game with Tampa Bay needing a victory to tie the NFL record 
of 18 consecutive victories, but after their 31-7 dusting of the Buccaneers, 
49ers tight end Brent Jones said, "We didn't go into the game thinking we 
needed to keep a streak alive. We wanted to win to stay undefeated." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants and 49ers are the 13th and 14th teams in league history to start a 
season 10-0. The Giants haven't lost since a Jan. 7 playoff game last season, 
when the Los Angeles Rams' Flipper Anderson disappeared into the west tunnel at 
Giants Stadium with the winning touchdown in overtime. The 49ers haven't lost 
since Nov. 19, 1989, when Green Bay beat them 21-17 at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Barring a tie, one of these teams will lose Monday, Dec. 3, when the Giants and 
49ers meet at Candlestick Park. That's assuming the two teams scrape past their 
divisional archrivals Sunday, which is no safe bet. The Giants travel to 
Philadelphia to face the Eagles, who have won four in a row. The 49ers meet the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The odds against going undefeated are so long the sports books in Las Vegas 
don't even offer the bet at the beginning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the parity in the league, the odds are astronomical. It would be a 
big, big price," says Fred White of Leroy's Sports Book, one of 19 legal books 
in Nevada. "Since they face each other, it comes down a bit now. If I had to 
book the odds now, I'd use somewhere between 250- and 300-to-1." 
</P>
<P>
Since the league schedule expanded to 16 games in 1978, no team has gone 16-0 
over the regular season. A total of 336 teams have had the chance, and the 1985 
Chicago Bears came closest. They were 12-0 when they lost to the Miami Dolphins 
38-24 Dec. 2, 1985 at the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was much more important to the Miami Dolphins for some historical 
sake to prevent some other team from going undefeated than it ever meant to 
us," former Chicago and Yale safety Gary Fencik says. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins were protecting the reputation of their 1972 team, a Don 
Shula-coached team that won all 14 of its regular-season games, then swept 
through the playoffs to go 17-0 -- the only perfect record in 70 NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning," Giants safety Dave Duerson says, "is an attitude. So is losing. They 
are both contagious." 
</P>
<P>
As a former Chicago Bear, Duerson ought to know. He is one of the few, if any, 
men in NFL history -- the accounting is sketchy -- to play for two teams that 
began a season 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
There are several factors the Giants and 49ers have been able to overcome in 
their drive to 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, both teams have been able to rise above injuries because of 
exceptional roster depth. The Giants lost Carl Banks, Mark Collins, Odessa 
Turner and Jumbo Elliott for at least four weeks each and countered 
successfully with Johnie Cooks, Reyna Thompson, Stephen Baker and Bob Kratch. 
In a similar vein, the talent of quarterback Joe Montana and wide receiver 
Jerry Rice has obscured the 49ers' inability to run the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants and 49ers also have been able to overcome, for the most part, 
week-to-week inconsistency. Of course, the Giants had to scramble to beat 
Phoenix Oct. 21, but they have only trailed significantly in two games. The 
49ers have come from behind in six games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a confidence that builds and builds," Oates says. "Regardless of what you 
do, you know you're going to win the ballgame. We've always had that 
consistency in the defense, but now you see it on offense and special teams." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have to play all those teams at the same time," Hall of Fame 
quarterback Bob Griese says of the Dolphins' streak. "Spread them out and give 
them to us one at a time, and we could beat every one of them. It just so 
happens that we did." 
</P>
<P>
With Shula providing a strong weekly focus, the 1972 Dolphins managed to 
obliterate the New England Patriots 52-0, then come back with a grueling 28-24 
victory over the New York Jets for their ninth and 10th victories. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see us getting too excited from week to week," Giants nose tackle Erik 
Howard says. "And that's good. We're kind of like the offense. We ball-control 
it. Nothing too flashy, just solid. We just keep rolling along." 
</P>
<P>
Shula wonders if the media attention that has swirled around the Giants and 
49ers will affect on-field play. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure now, everything is highlighted a lot more," Shula says. "TV and 
radio and print media all want to get into your huddle to find out as much as 
they can about your team. You're just bombarded, and when things are going well 
you have a tendency to get caught up in that thing, thinking they're going to 
continue to go well." 
</P>
<P>
Balancing that external pressure is the internal pressure players feel to 
maintain a perfect record. 
</P>
<P>
"All the eyes of the league are on you," the Giants' Howard says. "That 
motivates you." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even six games short of a perfect regular season, 49ers safety Ronnie 
Lott discounts the possibility. "Each team now has an athlete who can dominate 
the game," he says. "That guy could have the most unbelievable game and you 
could lose just because of one athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Giants Coach Bill Parcells voiced a similar sentiment after beating Detroit. "I 
don't think we'll go undefeated, he said. "I honestly believe that, but I may 
be the only guy in the locker room who feels that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked real hard to get in position to make a run, but people think it's 
automatic. I don't think our team is a dominant team by any stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Howard smiles. He has heard this sort of thing from Parcells before. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not dominant," Howard says, "but we're undefeated. If it keeps going 
that way, what's the difference?"

SPECIALTY UNITS KEEPING CAPITALS ABOVE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROERT FACHET, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At equal strength, the Washington Capitals have been outscored 62-47 in their 
first 24 games. That is the stuff of which last-place finishes are made, but 
the Capitals have avoided such a fate because of their remarkable special teams 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty-killing, always a Capitals asset, has improved with the addition of 
Dave Tippett, to the extent that Washington leads the NHL, stopping opponents' 
power plays 87.5 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Far more surprising is the power play, which has a 26.8 percent success rate. 
That ranked second to the 27.1 of Calgary, which played Los Angeles last night. 
</P>
<P>
"Decline the penalty" has long been a taunt of Capital Centre critics, as just 
three times in 16 previous seasons have the Capitals ranked in the upper half 
of NHL power plays. But there have been no complaints this year; in home games, 
Washington has scored 19 extra-man goals in 52 chances, a 36.5 percent clip. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans have been good," said center Dale Hunter, who has four power-play 
goals. "It's not like the days when Larry Murphy would always hear the booing. 
That puts pressure on you to do things you shouldn't be doing." 
</P>
<P>
To hear the players and Coach Terry Murray talk, the rise of the power play is 
based on the simple factors of hard work and execution. "There's no magic," 
Murray said. "The point men are shooting the puck and the forwards are getting 
in front at the right time to do some damage. We've spent a lot of time on it, 
right from the third day of training camp, and we've talked about it a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of execution. For every situation, there's an option and the 
players are doing their jobs very well, Certainly, our special-teams play has 
carried us a great amount of the distance. Even-strength situations have been a 
tough grind as far as scoring goals." 
</P>
<P>
It was felt that the power play would be a problem too, with the absence of 
Dino Ciccarelli and the departure of Geoff Courtnall and Scott Stevens. They 
totaled 26 of the 70 goals for a power-play unit that was 19th at 17 percent 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Others have more than filled the gap, as 11 players already have connected. The 
top man is John Druce, who has six. It is hard to believe that he had scored 
only one extra-man goal until he went wild with eight in last season's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Hatcher and Calle Johansson have been outstanding at the points, firing 
testing shots while the forwards are distracting the goaltender by creating 
traffic in front. Memory recalls too many times when Stevens and others 
unloaded while the goalie had an unobstructed view of the puck. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's 5-3 victory over Toronto, the Capitals converted three of four 
power plays, in each case needing less than a minute to score. On the first 
goal of the game, both Druce and Hunter had sticks in the air trying to deflect 
Hatcher's 40-foot drive; Druce redirected the puck past goalie Jeff Reese. 
</P>
<P>
"We're maybe a little more patient this year," Johansson said. "The forwards 
are going to the net when we're shooting the puck, instead of when we're 
passing it around. And we're shooting when somebody's in front, instead of when 
nobody's there. 
</P>
<P>
"Our forwards are working pretty well down low. Last year we got in and (the 
other team) shot the puck right out. Now our forwards are all over the 
defensemen, not letting them clear the zone." 
</P>
<P>
"We started to click from the first game," Hunter said. "The guys have been 
working hard on it. We don't have as much talent as Calgary and we don't have 
any Mario (Lemieux) or (Wayne) Gretzky. But working hard makes up for that. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten confidence in what we're doing and that sort of thing balloons." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter and Druce have taken some physical beatings while hanging in front of 
the net, but opponents have not been able to clear them out without winding up 
in the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can create some traffic in front, all the point men have to do is just 
put the puck on net," Druce said. "That way, we can try to deflect it and hang 
in there for rebounds. They don't have to blast it."
