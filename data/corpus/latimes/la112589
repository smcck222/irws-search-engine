SEWAGE SPILLS MAR LAGUNA'S IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE: THE CITY'S PRISTINE REPUTATION HAS BEEN MUDDIED, MANY FEAR, BY THE 
THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF WASTE THAT HAVE POLLUTED THE OCEAN AFTER SEWER SYSTEM 
BREAKDOWNS IN RECENT YEARS.

<P>
Some call Laguna Beach the Monte Carlo of the California Riviera, a resort city 
that prides itself on progressive thought, a cast of colorful characters and a 
village-like atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
For many Laguna residents, in fact, it is a constant source of pride that their 
community seems so out of step with the relative blandness of surrounding 
Orange County. In a fast-growing area where development often emphasizes tract 
homes and malls, Laguna Beach has always managed to maintain its quirkiness and 
its bucolic setting. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite its efforts to preserve its pristine image, Laguna today is finding 
its reputation tainted by the very problems that it has tried so hard to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
And more often than local residents like to admit, the problems involve a 
series of sewage spills that have dumped thousands of gallons of raw waste on 
the scenic beaches of this south county playground. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the spills have been caused by breakdowns in the city's sewer system. 
There have been more than a dozen spills in the last two years, many of them 
requiring temporary closure of some of Laguna's most popular beaches, according 
to city records. 
</P>
<P>
City officials recently agreed to spend $300,000 to install a telemetry system 
that will immediately alert officials of power failures at the 23 sewage 
pumping stations. They say most of the spills have been the result of power 
outages. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't know what else we can do about (the sewage problem) except 
what we are already doing," said Mayor Robert F. Gentry. "It's a real concern 
of ours. I don't care as much about our reputation as I do about the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the causes, the specter of raw sewage spilled across the white sands 
of Laguna Beach has residents upset and businessmen worried that the 
multimillion-dollar tourist trade could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"In the future, people are going to look at coastal cities and decide where 
they are going to spend their time based on what's left of the environment," 
says Evan David, who owns a local design business. "They've all got 7-Elevens 
and yogurt shops but they don't all have sewage." 
</P>
<P>
While some city officials maintain that too much has been made of the spills, 
others see it as a serious threat to the special reputation that Laguna Beach 
has acquired over the years as a city with sincere concerns about people and 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
It is Laguna, after all, that played host to a migration of hippies and flower 
children 20 years ago and has gained a worldwide reputation for its art 
festivals, vistas and tolerance of non-traditional life styles. And it is here, 
residents boast, that Hare Krishnas, conservative Republicans and homosexuals 
live side by side in harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Life styles aside, all seem to agree that something must be done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous," said one resident, who would identify himself only as a city 
employee. "Laguna Beach is one of the richest cities in the world, and we have 
a sewer spill every week." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I have a film on me when I get out of the water," added Laguna 
Beach chiropractor Garrett Andersen. "One of my friends got ill and got the 
runs after a spill." 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen fear the frequent spills have already begun to scare away the 
tourists. At stake, they say, are about 3 million visitors a year and millions 
of tourist dollars. "It's terrible for business. People come flocking down here 
to the beach with their stuff and they leave cursing," says Mick Rasley, who 
owns a silversmith shop on South Coast Highway. "They could stay and walk 
(around) the shops but they're so mad, they leave." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a palm tree frond fell on a power line and shut off 
electricity at one pumping station. Fortunately, only 100 gallons of sewage 
overflowed and officials were able to stop it before it reached the water, said 
Terry Brandt, city director of municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
But they haven't always been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
In January, spills from pipes crossing beneath Aliso Creek dumped 170,000 
gallons of sewage into the surf. In March, 300,000 gallons made its way to the 
surf. In June, more than 900,000 gallons hit the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there's the smell. 
</P>
<P>
"It smells like rotten eggs," said Scott Young, 30, another resident, 
describing the beach after one spill. "I'm afraid to go in the water after one 
because I don't want to get hepatitis or something." 
</P>
<P>
According to county health officials, water contaminated with sewage can cause 
stomach problems. They post the contaminated sections of beach with 
red-and-white signs when it is not safe to swim. 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers "hassle us but we say, it's purely your choice," said Mike Dwinell, a 
lifeguard at Main Beach. "This is what you can get if you go in there. It's an 
inconvenience but I wonder, where do these people think (waste) all goes?" 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Ryan, managing director of the local Chamber of Commerce, is one who 
says too much is being made of the spills. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem to discourage people from coming down here because the spills 
were made out to be more than they really were," she said. "I think it would 
take a lot more than that to tarnish the city's image." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sewage has been the topic of more than one bad joke lately. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell when the sewage is out there because the birds stay on the beach 
and won't go in the water," stockbroker Art Sonce said.

PAT HYLAND; EX-HUGHES AIRCRAFT HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aerospace industry executive Lawrence A. (Pat) Hyland, who headed Hughes 
Aircraft Co. for nearly a quarter of a century, died Friday of a heart attack 
at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland, 92, retired from the Los Angeles-based company in 1984, but he had 
remained active in the firm's affairs, serving as chairman emeritus and coming 
to his office at headquarters several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Hyland was one of the giants of our industry," said Malcolm R. Currie, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Hughes. "His vision and leadership were 
an inspiration to us all, and he will be sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
Known as a vigorous, practical man with what one friend called "immense common 
sense," Hyland is credited with leading Hughes to a pre-eminent position as a 
supplier of defense electronics and communications satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Although he lacked formal college training, Hyland nevertheless was an 
inventor, holding early patents in aircraft communications, direction finding 
and radar. As a radio engineer at the Naval Research Laboratory in 1932, he 
demonstrated the reflection of radio waves from aircraft -- credited as a basic 
discovery in the development of modern radar. 
</P>
<P>
For his work, he was awarded the U.S. Navy Distinguished Public Service Medal 
in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Nova Scotia, he came to the United States at age 2, graduated from high 
school in Melrose, Mass., in 1915, served in the Army during World War I, and 
became a naturalized citizen in 1919. He was a chief radioman in the U.S. Navy 
from 1920 to 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland formed Radio Research Co. of Washington and headed the firm for five 
years before the company merged with Bendix Corp. in 1937. He worked for Bendix 
for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland joined Hughes as vice president and general manager in 1954, serving for 
24 years in those posts before becoming president of the company after the 
death of Howard Hughes in April, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
In his years at Hughes, Hyland was active in helping guide defense policy, 
serving on the advisory committee of the Argonne National Nuclear Laboratory, 
for example. He was also chairman of the Central Intelligence Agency's 
strategic advisory committee for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland, who received an honorary doctorate in engineering in 1954 from Lawrence 
Institute of Technology in Southfield, Mich., also served as a trustee of 
Harvey Mudd College and the California Museum of Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his interest in quarter horse racing, Hyland served as a director or 
officer of several quarter horse associations. In 1981, the Pacific Coast 
Quarter Horse Racing Assn. honored him as horseman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland is survived by his widow, Muriel, and a daughter, Ginger. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service was tentatively scheduled for Tuesday at Westwood Methodist 
Church in Los Angeles.

SPACE: 'THE PLANETS' EXPRESSED AWE AND MYTHOLOGY; WHERE IS THE SYMPHONY TO 
ACCOMPANY US INTO THE FUTURE?

By TONY TAYLOR, Tony Taylor is a member of the technical staff at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena that navigated Voyager through the solar 
system. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gustav Holst began writing "The Planets" in 1914. Its first performance, five 
years later, was a symphonic celebration of planets Mercury through Neptune 
(Pluto wasn't discovered until 1930). The music is beautiful and grand -- but 
something is lacking. Despite its variety, there is no human adventure. The 
planets, in those days, were still "gods" -- remote, aloof in a separate, 
self-contained universe, hermetically sealed from human interaction or 
contamination. The solar system was a very large and inaccessible place for 
mortals. 
</P>
<P>
Now another piece of music has played out; the last note of Voyager's Neptune 
encounter fades into the vacuum as the spacecraft departs our solar system, to 
be succeeded in the public mind by the discordance of the Bay Area earthquake 
and Eastern European upheavals. But we come not to bury Voyager; rather to 
praise. The brief encounter with Neptune was not an ending but a prelude to a 
larger quest and a longer symphony. 
</P>
<P>
After Voyager, the gods no longer reign. The planets belong to humankind. 
</P>
<P>
The outer planets and their satellites were but tiny, pretty baubles in our 
skies before Voyager's flight to Neptune and beyond. Now they are worlds in 
their own right, concrete and beautiful in their gargantuan presence. 
</P>
<P>
Gustav Holst was born too early. How was he to know the adventure of the 
planets and man's place among them? There was no way then to experience, even 
vicariously through the eyes of a Voyager, the pastoral solitude of 
interplanetary cruising; the rolling, thundering crescendo of planetary 
encounter. 
</P>
<P>
I imagine him looking over our shoulders, following Voyager across the sky. 
NASA's Goldstone antenna, a white leviathan in the center of an empty desert 
stage, glows in a fading twilight, hard bright stars overhead, the silence of 
the horizon dropping away into pink-gray distance. Why is it that this sight 
and silence seems so much like music? Gustav, are you listening? Can you hear 
the slow-motion turning against the sky? 
</P>
<P>
It's time for a new musical genius to bring us a modern symphony of adventure 
among the planets, of man's place among the gods. Let us hear the chaos of 
departure from Earth's surly bonds, the basso profundo of planetary encounter. 
It's time for that symphony, and I hope someone will write it, because it is 
the beginning of a story of human drama of Wagnerian proportion. It will help 
to tell us where we are and where we're going. 
</P>
<P>
And where is that? "To the supermarket," some will say. "My feet are firmly 
planted on Earth, and I'm going to work, I'm going home, I'm going to the 
hospital to visit a friend. I need to tend my garden." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy activities, but our children, or perhaps our grandchildren, are going to 
live in space. The urge to explore and expand is inborn. We are going, sooner 
or later, because we have no choice. Cast aside any debates about manned versus 
unmanned space exploration. They are irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
As a species, we will begin by colonizing the solar system. We will break 
ourselves -- bodies and spirits -- on new shores, and we will regroup and 
plunge again, groping for dry land. Careers will be spent, lives lost in the 
quest. Music will help us mend, and drive us forward again. 
</P>
<P>
Many will not share our enthusiasm -- will not want to assume the hardships of 
pioneering. They are the equivalent of the Europeans who stayed behind, 
concerned with the problems of the Old World while explorers looked to the new. 
</P>
<P>
Let them be. Very few will be able to go, anyhow. We will need their help, a 
large home base for support while we explore and settle, until we are 
independent. And what will explorers do for our homeland, our mother Earth at 
that time? Probably the same thing that the United States of America did for 
England in 1776. Children have no responsibility to their parents; only to the 
children that follow. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager represents the beginning of a magic age. Its goodby to Neptune is our 
hello to the solar system. The journey will begin with small steps: footprints 
on Mars, new ones on the moon. Every step will be hard-fought, but eventually 
we will inhabit most of the solar neighborhood. At that point, we'll begin to 
get restless again -- we'll turn up our music and consider how to follow 
Voyager on a questing note, a trip to the stars.

BUSH PROMOTES A CANARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, with a veto, removed American support of the United Nations 
Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) from the foreign aid budget in the 
groundless belief that some of the dollars might find their way into coercive 
abortion programs in China. It is a regrettable extension of his decision to 
perpetuate the population policy of former President Ronald Reagan by seeking 
to impose restrictions on the use of abortion in poor foreign nations that are 
far more stringent than the standards in the United States. Worse, the action 
perpetuates canards about a successful, effective and principled U.N. program 
at a time when world population growth is at a crisis level. 
</P>
<P>
In the legislation vetoed by the President, $15 million of $220 million for 
population programs was to go to the UNFPA. Under a carefully crafted 
bipartisan amendment, none of the U.S. contribution would go to UNFPA's work in 
China. That was to avoid even the appearance of giving support to the Chinese 
population program, which is under fire for allegedly including coercive 
abortion and sterilization. Never mind that there is no evidence that UNFPA in 
any way aided or abetted the controversial elements of the Chinese program. 
Never mind that the new UNFPA-China agreement reinforces that separation. And 
never mind that there would be no better way to discourage abusive programs 
than to enhance contraceptive campaigns, a main thrust of UNFPA. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the United States stands alone on this issue. All of the other 
major nations, led by Japan and including the Soviet Union, have stepped in to 
make up the declining American funding. The UNFPA, once dependent on the United 
States for 25% of its support, now spends even more with no U.S. support. But 
the missing dollars have hurt. Some of the replacement money received is not 
readily convertible. And the absence of U.S. leadership and cooperation serves 
to weaken the effort. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush leads the world's richest, most powerful nation, a nation that 
has gained effective control of its own population. But his nation is part of a 
world whose population is out of control. There were 1.6 billion people 90 
years ago. There are 5.2 billion now. And there will be 6 billion by the end of 
the century. A quarter of those now living are hungry, and even more are 
malnourished. It is a situation that calls for vigorous leadership and more, 
not less, funds for effective world programs. Everywhere. Not least in China.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S SLIVER OF DAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-one years ago, Milos Jakes was among the small band of hard-line 
Czechoslovakian Communists who hid in the Soviet Union's embassy in Prague as 
Red Army tanks rolled into the city to crush the liberalization movement headed 
by Alexander Dubcek. Jakes and other party reactionaries soon emerged to 
endorse the invasion by Soviet and other Warsaw Pact armies, to take power and 
to begin a purge of the reformers. Dubcek in turn became a nonperson, exiled to 
a menial forest service job in Bratislava under close secret police scrutiny. 
This week, after eight tumultuous days of demonstrations across Czechoslovakia, 
Dubcek is again being hailed by hundreds of thousands in Prague, while Jakes 
and others of the infamous generation of 1968 appear to be on their way out. 
</P>
<P>
It is a remarkable turnaround for a people that, so often betrayed and 
disappointed, had sunk into an understandable political passivity, and for a 
leadership that confidently believed it could ride out the storm of political 
change howling across Eastern Europe. On Friday of last week the regime ordered 
its police to brutally suppress a demonstration by 50,000 or so students. 
Within days it was forced to apologize for its use of excessive force. Within a 
few days more it found itself confronting 300,000 or more protesters, this time 
from all walks of life. Czechs had learned, as Filipinos, South Koreans, Poles 
and East Germans had learned, that there is a time to be afraid no longer. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations of Jakes and other members of the Communist Party Politburo 
and secretariat end a chapter; they do not close the book on repressive rule. 
Karel Urbanek, the new party leader, comes from the very Politburo that just 
resigned. How much of a reformer he will prove to be remains to be shown. 
Czechoslovakia, like East Germany even after the stunning changes it has 
experienced, is still for now a one-party state, lacking an uncontrolled press, 
guaranteed civil liberties and other vital hallmarks of a free society. Much, 
much more is yet to be done. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a clear sense now that a beginning has been made, that change has 
become an irresistible force. In his talk in Wenceslas Square yesterday, Dubcek 
asked, "If there once was light, why should there be darkness again?" The 
horizon begins to show the faint glow of a new dawn. Czechoslovakia's long 
night of darkness may at last be ending.

SCHOOLCHILDREN'S OBSESSION WITH EXPENSIVE BRAND-NAME CLOTHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' fascinating and distressing coverage of "Children Who Dress to 
Excess" includes this quotation, "Advertising at its best is making people feel 
that without their product, you're a loser. Kids are very sensitive to that." 
</P>
<P>
Are you sure that wasn't a misquote? Shouldn't it have read "Advertising at its 
worst. . . ."? 
</P>
<P>
The same ad agency president goes on to explain that advertisers are aware that 
kids are the most emotionally vulnerable and if you can convince them that 
they'll be a "dork" if they don't splurge on your overpriced product, they'll 
buy it. 
</P>
<P>
How immoral can one get to spend millions of dollars undermining the 
self-confidence and feeling of self-worth of all the millions of kids who can't 
afford expensive "designer" junk, and convincing them that they are "dorks" and 
"losers." 
</P>
<P>
I think we have here a new and very vicious form of child abuse.

CONGRESS VOTES ITSELF A HEFTY PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think I understand why the man in the street is upset over the pay raises for 
congressmen and senators. The average workingman in this country obviously 
thinks that a salary of more than $80,000 is already more than enough for the 
rank-and-file leaders of our country. It's the Ralph Naders and other respected 
architects of popular opinion who confuse me. 
</P>
<P>
A workingman may not readily realize that a lawmaker who is already making four 
times as much as he does could easily go into the private sector and earn well 
over $200,000 per year. But I would expect Nader and his associates to grasp 
that apparently elusive point. 
</P>
<P>
The reality of the situation is really quite simple: 
</P>
<P>
* If our government is going to work effectively, we must have capable leaders. 
</P>
<P>
* Capable leaders are now, as always, at a premium in our country as they are 
in all other countries. 
</P>
<P>
* If we don't pay our leaders enough money to live at a level that bears some 
semblance to the station that their education and accomplishments entitle them, 
we subject them to the harshest of temptations. If we don't pay them enough to 
live well by the standards of their peers, there are plenty of very wealthy and 
unprincipled people who will see to it that our leaders do have access to those 
levels -- for a price. 
</P>
<P>
* Senators and congressmen make speeches. If they make those speeches to the 
right groups of people, they are well paid for their time and elocution. These 
payments are called "honorariums." It requires no great imagination to see that 
a company that, for several years, has paid a congressman $5,000 plus expenses 
for a 40-minute speech, might expect a more sympathetic attitude from that 
congressman regarding any legislation that may benefit said company. 
</P>
<P>
* If we keep paying our House and Senate leaders at twice the going rate for a 
competent machinist and one-quarter or less of the going rate for leaders in 
private industry, we will ultimately be left with but three categories of 
leaders. Those who are already wealthy, those who are poor but honest and those 
who are, to some degree or another, beholden to the private interests that pay

CONGRESS VOTES ITSELF A HEFTY PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again the Congress has taken up the issue of a pay raise for its members. 
This time they have the pay raise linked to ethics reform. Wouldn't it be nice 
to have elected representatives who do not feel that doing the ethical thing 
requires a reward. 
</P>
<P>
I will not vote for any member who votes himself a raise or sets up a way for 
members to get a raise without them having to vote on the raise. Many people in 
government deserve and should get a raise, but Congress is not among the group. 
Let's put people in office who deserve our trust.

UNDERTAXING THE WEALTHY

Why don't we adopt Kuttner's call to increase taxes on the "small minority of 
(wealthiest) Americans" to balance the federal budget and to pay "for some of 
the (unspecified) public needs that have been shortchanged during the past 
decade." By exercising majority rule, we can enrich ourselves. There is no 
limit to what we can buy! But whether this will please or upset the 
"opinion-leader class" is not as clear.

UNDERTAXING THE WEALTHY

I believe Kuttner is looking at the wrong end of the stick. Instead of 
increasing taxes, we should be looking at spending less. He talks of restoring 
spending for education and research. I believe the proper function of a 
government is protection of its citizenry's life and property, period. Any 
other function should be handled by the private sector. I have yet to see any 
function performed by the government done in as efficient a manner as by the 
private sector, and that even allows for a profit to the owners. If we start 
trimming the waste in government, we might even be able to cut taxes again. 
</P>
<P>
Kuttner forgets that "the rich" are those who provide jobs, thereby generating 
payroll and income taxes; provide products, thereby generating sales taxes; 
develop property, thereby generating higher property taxes, and out of their 
profits, endow universities, museums, hospitals, etc. Most rich only become 
rich by risking their money and by hard work. 
</P>
<P>
I believe one of the main reasons the Japanese economy is stronger than ours is 
that they don't spend much money making weapons and maintaining armies. We're 
spending our tax money to protect them militarily and at the same time, we put 
ourselves in an economic disadvantage in dealing with the Japanese. Maybe we 
should charge them a fee for protecting them from the Chinese and the Russians 
and thereby balance our budget.

SOCKERS HELP SOMEONE ELSE OUT OF SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY COVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers ran into another team desperate for a victory on Friday night, and 
they paid dearly for it. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's Greg Ion took a pass off the boards from Dale Mitchell and scored 
with 26 seconds left, giving the the Comets a 4-3 victory and snapping their 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Sockers' second loss in three nights to a team in dire need of a 
victory. Wednesday, the Wichita Wings snapped a three-game losing streak by 
defeating them, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a game for us to take," Sockers defender Kevin Crow said, "and we 
didn't pull it out. Give them credit for sticking with it, but that game was 
for the taking." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Sockers (4-4) appeared to have the game in hand late in the fourth 
quarter. First-year forward Rod Castro gave them a 3-2 lead with his eighth 
goal and second of the game 7:03 into the fourth quarter. But Kansas City 
caught the Sockers on two counter-attacks, and Jan Goossens and Ion scored 
goals within 3:03 of each other, giving the Comets (4-4) their first victory 
since Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Achieved in front of 13,390 at Kemper Arena, it was paramount to the Comets, 
who play their next four games on the road, including next Tuesday at the San 
Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe we deserved to win," Sockers Coach Ron Newman said. "It could 
have gone either way. It certainly was a game we didn't deserve to lose. I just 
thought Lady Luck jumped out of the seats and landed right in (Comet Coach) 
Dave Clements' lap." 
</P>
<P>
Of Ion's game-winner, Newman said, "It was a nothing ball, really, and he 
barely reached it and got a toe on it, and it landed in the net. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of goal you dream about." 
</P>
<P>
Ion made it come true after Mitchell played the ball off the boards and in 
front of Sockers goalkeeper Victor Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
"What Mitchell did for me was attract my man (Jim Gabarra)," Ion said, "and I 
shouted for him to play it off the boards, and it was just far enough in front 
of me to get a toe on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this will get us going again. A game like this tends to do that. All of 
a sudden, it picks you up, and it gives you confidence in a lot of things 
instead of second-guessing yourself all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers had a 5:30 wake-up call this morning in order to return home for 
tonight's 7:35 game against the Baltimore Blast at the Sports Arena. It will be 
the first meeting between the two teams since the Sockers defeated Baltimore in 
the MISL Championship Series last spring. . . . Kansas City visits the Sockers 
on Tuesday night. . . . Former Charger Coach Al Saunders, now the receivers 
coach for the Kansas City Chiefs, attended Friday night's game.

SDSU'S NEXT GOAL: BEAT RANKED TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: AND DAMAGING THE CHAMPIONSHIP PLANS OF RIVAL BRIGHAM YOUNG 
TONIGHT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY SWEET.

Maybe you listened to it on the radio. Maybe you just heard a final score from 
someone last Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Miami 42, San Diego State 6. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are that your reaction was along the lines of, "Hmmmmm. Not as bad as I 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't Al Luginbill's reaction. No sir. And the San Diego State coach says 
it will be an improved team that takes the field at 7 tonight to put the 
finishing touches on a fairly successful season against Brigham Young in San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we'll play with a lot more effort and a lot more intensity than we 
showed last week," Luginbill said. "In the first 10 minutes, that's as bad as 
we've played since the Fullerton game (a 41-41 tie). Some of our young men 
didn't think we should be there. We've had a few discussions about that this 
week." 
</P>
<P>
But Luginbill thinks the experience against a nationally ranked team will give 
the Aztecs (6-4-1, 4-2) some confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We failed to rise to the occasion last week," Luginbill said. "We didn't go 
into Miami in the right frame of mind. We got wrapped up in who we were playing 
rather than how, and that was a major mistake." 
</P>
<P>
BYU (9-2, 6-1) is ranked No. 16 in the coaches' poll and No. 21 by the writers. 
The Cougars need one victory to clinch their 13th Western Athletic Conference 
championship -- their first WAC title since 1985, when they shared it with Air 
Force. The last time BYU won it outright was 1984, when it finished 8-0 (13-0 
overall) en route to the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
With a victory tonight, BYU would earn its eighth trip to the Holiday Bowl. A 
loss would leave Air Force and Hawaii in the race. 
</P>
<P>
For SDSU, a victory would mean that Luginbill and his team can enjoy their 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate to go through the whole off-season with the memory of what happened 
last weekend," Luginbill said. "That would gnaw on you." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU has won five of its past six games, causing those connected with the 
program to feel Aztec football fortunes are on the rise. Which should make BYU 
wary. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'd like to have done is beaten Hawaii and have it done," BYU Coach 
LaVell Edwards said. "But we're in control of our own destiny, which is what 
you want." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since 1986 that BYU has been in such a position this 
late in the season. But before you pencil BYU in to play in the Holiday Bowl 
against Penn State -- one of the teams expected to be officially invited today 
in a noon press conference -- consider this: SDSU has defeated BYU in two 
consecutive games in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. The Aztecs won, 10-3 in 
1986 and 27-15 last year. The 1986 game was for the WAC championship; last 
year's knocked BYU out of the running for the WAC title. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Aztecs have made a habit of defeating the Cougars lately is that 
they simply don't like them. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, SDSU players were upset after the game, claiming BYU players had 
directed racial slurs at them. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, SDSU players were unhappy after a 38-21 loss at Brigham Young 
because BYU didn't stop the game or make a public address announcement when 
quarterback Todd Santos broke the NCAA all-time passing record. 
</P>
<P>
Those thoughts are in the minds of several players, particularly the 20 SDSU 
seniors who will be playing their final college game. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here, I really respected BYU," senior wide receiver Monty 
Gilbreath said. "I don't respect them nearly as much now. I respect them as far 
as talent, but not the way they carry themselves and play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, they didn't acknowledge Santos' record. I thought a class 
program would have acknowledged it. And last year there were racial slurs and 
bad-mouthing. I don't think that's the way you play football, especially when 
you're a winning organization." 
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, as well as the fact that the road to the Holiday Bowl 
usually leads through BYU, the game with the Cougars is annually one of the 
biggest of the year -- even if SDSU is going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the season, you look at the schedule, and Brigham Young is 
probably the biggest game you'll play," Gilbreath said. "We played a nationally 
ranked team in Miami last week, but I'd put BYU up ahead because of the 
rivalry, the emotion and the excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Miami was a new thing for us, playing a (highly) ranked team, but in four 
years I've grown to dislike BYU very much." 
</P>
<P>
As so many BYU teams in the past, this year's is led by its quarterback. For 
the 10th week, Ty Detmer is leading the NCAA either in total offense or pass 
efficiency. This week, his pass-efficiency rating is 175.5, and he is second in 
the nation in total offensive yards at 372.3. He has accounted for at least one 
touchdown in each of BYU's last 13 games. Just a sophomore, Detmer already has 
42 touchdown passes. He also needs just 90 yards tonight to move ahead of 
Utah's Scott Mitchell for the NCAA passing record for a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he was going to be good, but we're really pleased with his 
pass-efficiency ranking," Edwards said. "He's been consistent. I think he's in 
the same category with (past BYU quarterbacks). He's got the awareness of (Jim) 
McMahon, he's got good instincts, a good arm and a good ability to avoid the 
rush." 
</P>
<P>
Said Luginbill: "The key for us will be whether we can slow them down. They 
catch the ball extremely well. They don't run as well as past BYU teams, but 
what BYU has done is put points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
BYU is averaging 39.6 points a game and allowing 26.5. In the last three games, 
BYU has averaged 53 points a game. The Cougars defeated Utah last week, 70-31, 
as Detmer completed 18 of 22 passes for 358 yards and four touchdowns.

HE HAS NO ROOM FOR ERROR; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: CHIP BANKS IS PLAYING WELL FOR THE COLTS, BUT THE FORMER CHARGER 
ALSO IS JUST ONE FAILED DRUG TEST AWAY FROM BANISHMENT BY THE NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The docudrama that Chip Banks' life has become gets played out every day at a 
barnlike training complex located on the drab flatlands that make up the 
outskirts of downtown Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
This is where the Colts practice. And this is where they watch and wait to see 
or hear what will become of the troubled 30-year-old left outside linebacker 
they took in trade from the Chargers Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say that I don't think about it," says Duane Bickett, the Colts' Pro 
Bowl right outside linebacker who was a teammate of Banks at USC. "Every 
morning, when I walk into the locker room, and I don't see Chip, I say, 'Shoot, 
I hope nothing's happened.' 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I mean? It might be that he just hasn't come in yet or whatever. 
But it's always there." 
</P>
<P>
Banks, you see, is one random urinalysis away from being the next Dexter 
Manley. One more positive drug test, and Banks, like the Redskins' Manley, will 
be banned for life by the NFL from doing what he does best. 
</P>
<P>
And the odds are stacked, like a short-yardage defense, against him. Statistics 
show that more than 50% of cocaine abusers who have undergone rehabilitative 
therapy end up backsliding into the dark world of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't revert," Banks tells himself every day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible to stay clean," he tells himself. "It's not impossible." 
</P>
<P>
But, he adds in the next measured breath, "it's also possible for me to mess up 
next week. You flip a coin every day." 
</P>
<P>
The drug experts emphasize that addiction is a disease. Curing the disease is 
more than just a matter of willpower. "Just Say No" is fine if you haven't made 
cocaine a habit. "Just Pray No" is more realistic once the demon has gotten 
inside you. 
</P>
<P>
"People have come back from lower ditches and gutters than me to lead clean and 
sober lives," Banks says. "All things can be accomplished with the grace of 
God." 
</P>
<P>
Only God knows why he blessed Banks with the size, strength and speed that made 
Banks graceful enough on the field to become an All-American, the third player 
selected in the 1982 draft, a four-time Pro Bowl participant and a man who has 
started all 90 of the NFL games in which he has played. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is sculptured," says Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer of Banks, who is 
6-feet-4, 245 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
It is one day after the Colts have beaten the Jets and six days before they 
will face the Chargers, Banks' former teammates. Meyer -- wearing a pressed 
blazer, and a wide-striped, button-down shirt, with matching tie -- sits behind 
a huge desk, shuffles a stack of papers, leans forward and makes a confession. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm too soft," he says. "I'm prejudiced. I like football players." 
</P>
<P>
So much so that between the time the Patriots fired him as their coach in 1984 
and the Colts hired him in 1986, Meyer served as a player agent. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Meyer took a similar chance with former Patriot running back Tony 
Collins. Collins subsequently failed an NFL drug test and wound up in a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer knows the same thing could happen to Banks, which is part of the reason 
he chats privately in his office with Banks at least once a week. 
</P>
<P>
Banks lives in a hotel room near the Colts complex. And he continues to receive 
ongoing outpatient drug therapy in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Banks also talks on the phone regularly with David Katz, the San Diego-based 
therapist who guided Banks through the rigorous 90-day rehabilitation program 
at the Rancho L'Abri institute in Dulzura, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Banks says Katz, 39, has been free of drugs and alcohol for several years and 
calls him "a living miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Banks left San Diego against Katz's wishes. "Chip knows how I feel about it," 
he says. "But his dedication to recovery was on line, or else I wouldn't have 
let him go." 
</P>
<P>
Katz was an ironworker in San Diego until he became "extremely addicted" to 
drugs and alcohol 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"How low did it get for me?" he asks, repeating the question. "It got to a 
point where I was having seizures on a daily basis, neurological deterioration, 
and my liver was giving out." 
</P>
<P>
Katz says his wife took their three children and "went east." He hasn't seen 
them since and doesn't know where they are. Before he sought professional help, 
he was sleeping in the homes of various people at night and collecting money 
for drug peddlers by day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a former football player," he says. "So I was kind of big. I was like a 
henchman." 
</P>
<P>
When Katz finally tried to get into a downtown San Diego detoxification center, 
it was full. So he waited three days and slept in the garbage dumpster outside 
the building. "That's pretty low," he says matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
From detox, Katz moved onto a seven-day program and then into a long-term rehab 
that took seven months. For the next 18 months after that, he lived next door 
to the rehab center. 
</P>
<P>
He says he has been drug and alcohol free for six years and working as a 
therapist for the past four. 
</P>
<P>
It was Katz who helped convince the NFL to reinstate Banks before the trade 
deadline. It was not an easy sell. 
</P>
<P>
Between February 1988 and last June, Banks, who grew up in Augusta, Ga., was 
arrested four times in Atlanta on cocaine and marijuana possession charges. On 
Oct. 11, an Atlanta judge sentenced him to five years probation for a cocaine 
possession conviction. The sentence is running concurrently with a five-year 
probation for a March marijuana conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a storied past," Meyer says. Hence, the private chats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not naive enough to think we have all the answers," Meyer says "We just 
take it day to day. Hour to hour." 
</P>
<P>
In their meetings, Meyer asks questions. "Painful questions," he says. And 
Banks weighs his responses. The subjects they discuss have very little to do 
with football. 
</P>
<P>
"Chip knows the tremendous ramifications if he falls out of line," Meyer says. 
"All you have to do is look at Dexter Manley." 
</P>
<P>
Manley's banishment over the weekend hit Banks' teammates hard. "We thought 
Tony Collins was going to make the team," Bickett says. "It's not like we 
haven't seen this before." 
</P>
<P>
Manley's banishment hit Banks harder. "It was like it was almost me who did 
it," he says. "It really upset me that a guy with his talent would jeopardize 
his whole career." 
</P>
<P>
But talking about recovery, he says, "is easier said than done." 
</P>
<P>
"And every time something like that (Manley) happens again, it will hit Chip 
the same way," Katz says. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer and Steve Ortmayer, the director of football operations who effected the 
trade from the Chargers' end, have been friends since Ortmayer's days as an 
assistant coach at Colorado in the late '60s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Saint Coach Jim Mora was Meyer's defensive coordinator at New England. Mora's 
son is the Chargers' secondary coach. 
</P>
<P>
Because of connections like these, certain NFL teams talk to certain other NFL 
teams on a regular basis. Dallas is another team the Chargers communicate with 
more than others. In fact, the Cowboys originally wanted Banks more than the 
Colts did. 
</P>
<P>
But a deal fell through when Katz convinced Banks he shouldn't leave San Diego 
and the outpatient treatment he could receive there. 
</P>
<P>
Then Charger owner Alex Spanos offered to re-sign Banks if Banks would be 
willing to sit out the 1989 season. Banks accused Spanos of "stringing him 
along." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ortmayer had continued talking to Meyer about Banks. The Colts 
needed a linebacker because of the knee injury suffered by starter O'Brien 
Alston. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first reaction when Steve brought up Chip Banks' name was like everyone 
else's: 'Hell no,' " Meyer says. "You keep your hands off guys like that. And I 
conveyed that feeling to Jim Irsay (Colts' general manager)." 
</P>
<P>
Time passed, and the Colts' need at linebacker became more glaring. As the 
trade deadline neared, the Chargers' asking price for Banks came down. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer went to tackle Chris Hinton and running back Eric Dickerson, both of whom 
had played in Pro Bowls with Banks, and made inquiries. And he double-checked 
with Bickett, who told him: "If you can, get him over here." 
</P>
<P>
Following marathon negotiations between Irsay and Ortmayer, the Colts agreed to 
take Banks in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 1990 draft. That 
selection could become a third or second-rounder depending upon how well Banks 
does the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
If he backslides, the Chargers still get the fourth-rounder. The Colts are 
paying Banks $250,000 this year and will pay him $275,000 if he plays for them 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers announced the trade on Tuesday, Oct. 17. Banks, who hadn't played 
a down since December of 1987, was practicing with the Colts the next day. 
</P>
<P>
He started in Indianapolis' 23-12 upset of the Bengals in Cincinnati that 
Sunday. On the Bengals' second play from scrimmage, he hurried Boomer Esiason 
into an incompletion. He was on the field for 49 snaps and finished with three 
solo tackles, three assists and four quarterback pressures. Meyer awarded him a 
game ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, the guy has not lost anything," says Rick Venturi, who coaches the 
Colts' linebackers. "He can still burst and accelerate." And he has benefitted 
from a defensive scheme similar to the one he played in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
In five games, Banks has totaled 23 tackles, one sack, five quarterback 
pressures and one interception. He has played through a wrenched back and a 
pinched nerve. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the Chargers Sunday, he says, will be "fun." 
</P>
<P>
Charger tackle James FitzPatrick, who also played at USC, says playing against 
Banks will be "bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
The temptation is to say that Indianapolis is a good place for Banks because 
there are fewer distractions here than in California or Atlanta. And, Venturi 
says, "nobody lives in this league other than in seven-day cycles." 
</P>
<P>
But while the coaches work their way through 18-hour days, players are free 
after practice. Indianapolis has alcohol. Indianapolis has parties. 
Indianapolis has drugs just like every other city. 
</P>
<P>
Bickett walked into a nightclub not long ago, and the first person he noticed 
was Banks. "He was drinking soda water," Bickett says. "He wasn't raising hell, 
and he left early. It wasn't like I was checking up on him." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't like Bickett was unhappy to see Banks in control of himself 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Katz says he wants Banks back in San Diego after the season to continue 
treatment. Banks, who has never tested positive for drugs in season, has 
already gone through more than one therapist in Indianapolis. "Chip had a 
problem with trusting," Katz says. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer says he hopes Banks finds a permanent place to live in Indianapolis. But, 
he says, "I don't know if I know Chip Banks." 
</P>
<P>
Banks says he might go back to Atlanta, 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think too many people are inside Chip Banks," Meyer adds. "And that's 
fine. There's nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
Unless the demons are still in there plotting a way to transform Banks back 
into the babbling addict who walked away from a $4.7 million, five-year 
contract offer from the Chargers in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Banks says that years ago an uncle told him: " 'As long as you are still 
breathing, you can be knocked down but not knocked out.' " 
</P>
<P>
That same uncle told Banks: "Don't ever count your opponent out." 
</P>
<P>
The day Chip Banks does will be the day he begins to die. His opponent is not 
the Chargers or any other NFL team. His opponent is an insidious disease for 
which there is no known cure.

AZTECS FIND SOME HOPE IN FIRST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAHAINA, Hawaii 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If awards were presented to the masters of understatement, then San Diego State 
basketball Coach Jim Brandenburg would be winner of an Oscar, an Emmy, a Tony 
and a Pulitzer in one. 
</P>
<P>
No need to count the ballots. Nobody acts or says it better. 
</P>
<P>
In that light, his assessment of his team's season-opening 66-58 loss to 
Villanova in the first round of the Maui tournament Friday at the Lahaina Civic 
Center was almost a ringing endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"Truthfully, I was not that discouraged," Brandenburg said. "If we take this 
game in stride, take the rest of the games in this tournament in stride and 
keep getting better, we can be a good basketball team in a month." 
</P>
<P>
Don't make those Final Four reservations yet. But this was not a bad start for 
a team that features eight new players, six of them community college 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of those new players, center Marty Dow, that gave Brandenburg 
several reasons to be "not that discouraged" 
</P>
<P>
Dow, a 7-foot-1 junior, scored a game-high 15 points and had six rebounds. And 
he did it playing against Villanova's Tom Greis, who at 7-3 and 240 pounds, is 
as big a player as he is likely to face this season. Even more encouraging was 
that Dow, a transfer from Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M, missed the first two 
weeks of practice because of bulging discs in his lower back and has only been 
practicing for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"He played OK," was as much as Brandenburg would allow. "It's always dangerous 
to make assumptions after one game. But I feel more encouragement than 
discouragement at this point." 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Aztecs into the consolation bracket, where they will play 
Lefty Driesell-coached James Madison today at 1:30 p.m. PST. The Dukes allowed 
North Carolina to score the final 10 points in losing, 80-79, on King Rice's 
15-foot bank shot as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
While the play of Dow and the relative closeness of the score were encouraging, 
it still left Brandenburg with several concerns, starting with his two point 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
Neither senior Rodney Jones nor his backup, Arthur Massey, distinguished 
himself as they combined for seven turnovers and no assists. Jones scored four 
points, made three turnovers and managed to foul out while playing only 26 
minutes. Massey, a junior transfer from Alvin (Tex.) Community College, had 
four points and made four turnovers in 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But they were not alone. The Aztecs committed 19 turnovers to Villanova's 15. 
And that was with guard Michael Best, who last year led the team with 96, 
making only two. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the turnovers were by forwards Shawn Jamison (five) and Michael Hudson 
(four). Both are junior transfers from Pratt (Kan.) Community College. 
</P>
<P>
But all was not bad for Jamison. He scored 14 points and demonstrated with a 
pair of rim-rattling dunks that he could team with Dow to give the Aztecs a 
strong inside game. 
</P>
<P>
Now they need to find someone to take up the load from the outside. Best would 
be a most likely candidate, but he is still working to come back from surgery, 
to remove pins in his knee, that kept out of practice for three weeks. During 
that time, Best said, his weight reached 240, 25 more than his playing weight. 
</P>
<P>
Best said he is down to 225, but that was before the game, which was played in 
a gymnasium cooled only by fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hot," Best said. "I probably lost 10 pounds' playing." 
</P>
<P>
The extra weight appears to have most adversely affected his shooting (three 
for 11), but it didn't bother his rebounding; he had a game-high eight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say we played good, but we played in spurts," Best said. "The 
new guys are trying to do a lot. Hopefully, this game got the butterflies out." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs started strong, opening a 10-5 lead in the first 5:11. But after 
they took their biggest lead at 24-17 with 6:25 left in the first half, the 
Wildcats rallied. Villanova scored 14 of the next 16 points over the next five 
minutes to take a 31-26 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That one big run ended up being the difference in the ballgame," Brandenburg 
said. "We did not execute well offensively. It was our struggling and 
frustration offensively that made the difference in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs did score the final four points of the first half and the first 
three of the second to take their last lead, 33-31. The Wildcats went ahead for 
good, 37-35, with 18:00 to play, but the Aztecs stayed close most of the rest 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU was within 55-51 with 4:50 remaining, but the Wildcats scored six in a row 
to take their biggest lead at 61-51 with 2:05 left. The Aztecs, meanwhile, were 
going without a point over 3:13. 
</P>
<P>
The difference, Brandenburg said, might have been Villanova's switch to 
two-three match-up zone defense that put pressure on SDSU's guards and all but 
eliminated their outside game. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs shot three of nine from three-point range. Fifteen of their 22 field 
goals came within three feet of the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some athletes, but we need is some smart pills," Brandenburg said.

MANLEY'S LIFETIME BAN IS MESSAGE TO YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why does a gifted athlete such as Dexter Manley give it all up for drugs? One 
of the great talents of professional football, who admitted he was illiterate 
and sought help to improve himself, he commanded a fine salary, did local 
television work and had a solid future once his playing days were over. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a lesson to be learned from this sad ending to the career of Dexter 
Manley, maybe, just maybe, the youth of America will take heed and listen and 
learn -- Don't Do Drugs.

VERMEIL'S ASSESSMENT OF USC IS ALL WET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Vermeil has lost it! After Notre Dame piled up 266 yards and four 
touchdowns on the ground against USC's vaunted "NFL-type defensive players," 
Vermeil says USC is No. 1. This is based on USC's victories against powerhouses 
Stanford, Oregon State and Arizona, no doubt. Why bother to play the games?

USC TOUCHDOWN CONJURES UP BITTER MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why can't USC win the big games? 
</P>
<P>
1. No discipline. When Notre Dame has a dumb, stupid penalty, Lou Holtz pulls 
the player and chews his butt on the sidelines. Why doesn't Larry (Smith) do 
the same? 
</P>
<P>
2. No replacement for the quarterback. When will USC have a Nelson-Beathard 
combo again? In baseball, pitchers are recognized as having bad days requiring 
relief. Why not with USC football?

AZTECS STARTING TO EARN EVERYBODY'S SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Al Luginbill has done a fantastic job of turning around the basic 
approach to major college football at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
So what does The Times choose to write two days before the Aztecs' big game at 
Miami? The story dwells on 23 players who are gone! Next to it, there is a 
second story about Scott Barrick, telling how well he's doing (at Palomar 
College) since he quit. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wrong with either story, per se, but wouldn't it be far more logical to 
focus on the game and the many positives of the new Aztec football program? 
Could it be that this continuing emphasis on the negative is one of the reasons 
that crowds have been much smaller than deserved for Aztec football this year? 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill has insisted that he and the team must "earn" support from the fans. 
I think they've done that in rather impressive fashion in a remarkably short 
span of time. Maybe a bit more positive and generous coverage would hasten the 
fans' return. By now, the Aztecs have earned it!

In 1969, to Dickerson. In 1987, to Affholter. In 1989, to Wellman. Three times 
Bruin fans have endured "judgment calls" in the corner of a Coliseum end zone, 
which decided the outcome of games to the benefit of USC. Is instant replay in 
college football what it would take for UCLA to get a call against USC?

USC TOUCHDOWN CONJURES UP BITTER MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC has developed the tradition of a famous 12th man on their football field. 
He's a zebra, an official who comes to the Trojans' aid with a helping hand. 
Saturday he gave them a touchdown on an out-of-bounds pass. Two years ago he 
did the same thing. Twice in the past he helped them win two other UCLA games 
with phony pass interference calls against Terry Donahue teams. 
</P>
<P>
He did the same thing against Tommy Prothro's teams. He did it against 
Michigan, on a fumble, where the Trojan went into the end zone without the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, USC has a football tradition, "Win it anyway we can." But the tradition 
I'm proud of is, "You may be a Trojan for life, but you're a Bruin forever."

MILLER PROPELS PACERS PAST CELTICS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't hold your breath waiting for the Indiana Pacers to fold. They probably 
are better than you think. 
</P>
<P>
Former UCLA star Reggie Miller scored 19 of his 30 points in the second half 
Friday night and Indiana rallied for a 118-111 victory over the Boston Celtics 
at the Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Celtics' first home loss after six victories. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers improved to 6-3 with their second victory of the season over the 
Celtics and moved into first place in the Central Division. When the Pacers won 
their sixth game last season, they had already lost 23. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-23 Pacers of 1988 fired George Irvine and brought in Dick Versace, an 
assistant coach with the Detroit Pistons. There was some improvement, if not 
great success, right away. 
</P>
<P>
After learning that injuries would prevent 7-foot center Steve Stipanovich from 
playing again, Versace went about building a team. It went largely unnoticed 
when the Pacers were 11-8 in their final 19 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
The pet project for Versace is the development of Miller. The 6-7 guard always 
could shoot with the best, but the rest of his game was suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody paid any attention when Versace said in training camp said that the NBA 
was going to see an improved Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a player improve so dramatically," Versace said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here, Reggie had a kind of foolish game. He took all those long 
three-point shots at the wrong time, trying to make hero shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He has worked as hard as anyone to improve his game. He is one of our keys. 
</P>
<P>
"We are basically a new team after the trades last season that brought in 
Detlef Schrempf, LaSalle Thompson and Randy Wittman. And it's a new Reggie 
Miller." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, the Pacers' leading scorer with a 24-point average, was seven for 13 
from the field, including two for two on three-pointers. He had seven rebounds 
and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics' Larry Bird missed 10 consecutive shots in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 121, Orlando 94 -- The Magic had to go to Phoenix to face a team that 
had lost two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of injured Kevin Johnson, Jeff Hornacek took over as playmaker 
for the Suns. They built a 58-37 halftime advantage, then increased it to 
102-58 after three quarters. Hornacek had 22 points, 15 assists and 12 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 122, Seattle 109 -- In winning their fourth in a row, the Nuggets forced 
23 turnovers and turned them into 35 points at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Fat Lever scored 20 of his 24 points in the second half for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
It also was the Nuggets' ninth consecutive victory at home over Seattle, which 
hasn't won in McNichols Arena since Nov. 30, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 101, Cleveland 82 -- Isiah Thomas set a club record with 11 assists in 
the first quarter as the Pistons won easily at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Cavaliers are missing their two outstanding big men, Larry Nance 
and Brad Daugherty, because of injuries, they had won five in a row since guard 
Mark Price came off the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers made six turnovers in the first quarter and the Pistons built a 
35-25 lead. They soon extended it to 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished with 16 assists. Teammate Joe Dumars had 19 of his 31 points in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 125, New Jersey 99 -- Clyde Drexler scored six of his 28 points as the 
Trail Blazers opened the second half with an 18-2 run at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Trail Blazers' fourth consecutive victory; the Nets have lost six in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 121, Washington 108 -- The Bullets built a 17-point lead in the 
second quarter at Philadelphia, but Charles Barkley and Hersey Hawkins brought 
the 76ers back. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had 32 points and 15 rebounds and Hawkins scored 14 of his 24 points in 
the third quarter as the 76ers built a 36-14 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 85, Charlotte 81 -- The Rockets' Akeem Olajuwon scored 21 points in the 
first half at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 103, Miami 87 -- The Hawks' Dominique Wilkins scored 15 of his 35 
points in the first quarter at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 99, Minnesota 89 -- Former Laker Tony Campbell scored 24 points at 
Dallas, but he couldn't prevent the expansion Timberwolves from becoming the 
league's first 10-game loser. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Blackman had 23 points for the Mavericks. DAN HAFNER

DEFENSE SHOWS UP ONCE AGAIN AND THOUSAND OAKS SURGES TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A quarterfinal finish is not good enough for Thousand Oaks High. That's why, 
when it's time to handle the burden, it's difficult for the Lancers to put it 
in any better hands than its defense. 
</P>
<P>
This, after all, is a Thousand Oaks unit that when given an inch takes several 
yards. Mostly backward and usually with extreme prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has been a major part of our success all year," Thousand Oaks 
Coach Bob Richards said after the Lancers defeated Leuzinger, 18-13, Friday 
night at Leuzinger to advance to the semifinals of the Southern Section 
Division II playoffs. "It came down to white-knuckle time. We had a goal. Our 
defense, the mantle was put on them. And I can't think of a better place to put 
it." 
</P>
<P>
After fullback Chris Foster scored the go-ahead touchdown on a one-yard dive 
with 2:25 left, the Thousand Oaks defense held the Olympians. Leuzinger 
(8-3-1), which tied for second in the Bay League but advanced to the playoffs 
as the league's third-place team, got one first down after taking the ball at 
its 47, but cornerback Jim Magallanes intercepted a pass inside the 15-yard 
line on the game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (11-0-1), the division's top-seeded team, plays Muir, a 28-0 
winner Friday over San Marcos, next week with a berth in the championship game 
at stake. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, there was Leuzinger, a banged-up but spirited team that 
extended Thousand Oaks until the end. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympians had taken a 13-6 lead into the fourth quarter. Foster's first 
touchdown -- another one-yarder -- brought the Lancers to within one point at 
the start of fourth quarter, but the extra-point attempt was wide right. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lancers regained possession, they were forced to punt from their 35 
with 6:33 remaining. Jason Ybarra's punt deflected off the hands of Leuzinger 
return man Donal Byrd and the loose ball was recovered by Thousand Oaks' Greg 
Buchanan on the 29. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sprinting the whole way down," Buchanan said, "and when he dropped it, I 
just jumped on it." 
</P>
<P>
Easy enough. The ensuing score, however, was not to be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-yard mini-drive took nine plays, including a 20-yard dash by Steve 
Rudisill on third and 17 at the 24. Finally, on fourth and one -- and after two 
previous tries from the one -- Foster banged into the end zone over right 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man," Foster said when asked to recall his second touchdown and 13th of the 
season. "They had the whole defense on the line and it was a dog fight. I think 
everybody knew that was the game-decider right there. I just put my head down 
and gave it all the leg drive." 
</P>
<P>
For Leuzinger quarterback Zac Odom, who led the Olympians back from a 6-3 
halftime deficit, it seemed an especially bitter defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out and did the best we can," he said. "It wasn't good enough on this 
night. At the end of the game, they wanted it more." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers' only score of the first half came on a 44-yard pass from Scott 
Peterson to running back Mike Lindsay. Odom, who also plays defensive back, 
seemed ready to intercept the pass, but Lindsay wrestled the ball away in the 
right flat. He turned upfield, picked up a crushing block by Magallanes, and 
sprinted into the end zone. With 2:21 left in the first quarter, the Lancers 
led, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra's point-after attempt was blocked by Charlie Gonzalez, who also had two 
sacks of Peterson in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympians took possession of the ensuing kickoff at their own 26-yard line 
and in 12 plays moved into kicker Angel Andrade's range. His 31-yard field goal 
with 7:47 left in the half trimmed Thousand Oaks' lead to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers twice intercepted Odom passes in the first half -- one by David 
Watts, his second of the season, and another by Rudisill, his third. Save the 
field-goal drive, Thousand Oaks contained Leuzinger's ground game as well, 
limiting the Olympians to 42 rushing yards and 92 total. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks moved the ball well, but was unable to capitalize early. Lindsay 
rushed 12 times for 85 yards in the first half and Foster mustered 22 in five 
and finished with 24 in eight. Lindsay finished with 107 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks appeared lackluster at times. It was penalized only once in the 
first half for five yards and converted only two of five third-down 
opportunities into first downs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being outplayed in the first half, Leuzinger dominated the first part 
of the second. Courtney Overton returned the half's opening kickoff 95 yards 
for a touchdown that gave the Olympians their first lead, 10-6, and Andrade 
added a 35-yard field goal with 3:41 remaining in the third quarter for a 13-6 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The morale, Rudisill said, "wasn't too good. We didn't come out here to play 
football." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, however, the defense was there again. And the offense was just 
good enough.

CANYON SLICES WEDGE OUT OF WESTLAKE DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In terms of football history, the play goes back to when leather helmets were 
in vogue, face masks were for wimps and padding was for guys who'd prefer to 
sit in an armchair. 
</P>
<P>
In Canyon High's football repertoire, though, this particular play is as 
state-of-the-art as a stealth bomber. And there's nothing secret, or 
particularly subtle, about it. 
</P>
<P>
It's called The Wedge, and Canyon center Lenny Grimaldo has the cleat marks on 
his caboose to show how often the Cowboys run it. For the uninitiated, it's 
usually referred to as a quarterback sneak, or keeper, right up the middle of, 
ta da, Grimaldo's backside. 
</P>
<P>
"The wedge is the heart of our offense," he said. "We really like to use it to 
stick it in there." 
</P>
<P>
"There", of course, being the end zone. Canyon scored on the keeper play twice 
in its Southern Section Division II playoff game at Thousand Oaks High on 
Friday night, sticking it to Westlake, 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon plays Santa Barbara in the semifinals next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After Westlake (5-6-1) scored on quarterback Todd Preston's bootleg to tie the 
game, 14-14, in the third quarter, Canyon quarterback Tim Beidle scored on a 
six-yard keeper to give the Cowboys the lead for keeps with 2:35 left in the 
period. Beidle scored in the first half on the same play from two yards. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, however, never rolled over, despite being regarded as a lopsided 
underdog. After Beidle's second scoring run, the Warriors drove to the Canyon 
11-yard line early in the fourth quarter and threatened to tie the score again. 
</P>
<P>
On second and 10, Preston rolled to his left and, with several Canyon defenders 
in pursuit, tried to get the ball to receiver Seamus Gibbons in the back of the 
end zone. Instead, the pass was intercepted by defensive back Howard Diggins 
for a touchback with 10:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the middle of my zone, and I just came over to help out," Diggins 
said. "I had to move a little, but he really threw it right to me." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake held off Canyon (8-3-1) again, though, when tailback Chris Peery -- 
who gained 120 yards in 18 carries and scored twice -- could not field a Beidle 
pitch at the Westlake 30 with 5:12 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Canyon defense, which limited Preston to just 148 yards on 14-of-35 
passing, again stiffened. On fourth down at the Canyon 32, Preston was pressed 
into the dirt by Canyon's Vince Nevieux for the Cowboys' fifth sack. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's last chance also ended like the majority of its other scoring 
opportunities. With 2:16 remaining, Preston moved his team to the Canyon nine, 
but his fourth-down pass to Dave Monheim left the Warriors a yard shy of the 
first down with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"We pulled together," Diggins said. "We had some ups and downs, but when it 
mattered, we played a little football today." 
</P>
<P>
With the Westlake passing attack stagnating in the first half -- Preston 
completed only one of his first eight attempts -- the Warriors went to the 
trick-play bag to take a 7-0 lead with 3:57 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After a holding penalty pushed Westlake back to first and goal at the Canyon 
16, Preston lobbed a lateral to running back Luke Crawford, who rolled right 
and passed to tight end Monheim. Monheim reached up with his left hand and 
pulled down the ball from a forest of hands that included those of Canyon 
defenders Diggins and Clint Beauer. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford was in the right place a few seconds later when he recovered a fumble 
by Canyon kick-return man Jason Brenner at the Canyon 29. Westlake, however, 
was turned away when Tony Terani missed a 33-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Canyon defense snapped out of its funk in the second quarter, pressuring 
Preston numerous times and forcing early throws. Preston, who was sacked three 
times by linebacker Brad Weaver in the first half, completed three of 12 
attempts for 50 yards before the intermission, all to Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
With Canyon using its zone to hold down Preston, Westlake running back 
Demetrius Wynn was called upon to deliver, and he did, finishing with 147 yards 
in 13 carries. Keep in mind that Wynn, in 11 previous games, gained only 109 
yards in 32 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"They were dropping eight guys back (in the defensive secondary)," Westlake 
Coach Jim Benkert said. "So we tried to run the ball and had pretty good 
success. Then, in the third quarter, they changed on us and took away the run." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon tied it, 7-7, on a textbook drive in the second quarter. Using fullback 
David McDivitt, who gained 30 yards in two carries in the drive, Canyon scored 
with 7:36 left in the half on Peery's eight-yard blast up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys moved ahead, 14-7, on the first of Beidle's two keepers with 1:20 
remaining in the half. Beidle completed passes of 26 and 22 yards to key the 
drive.

SMALL ROLE PLAYS SIZABLE PART IN NOTRE DAME WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it appeared that Notre Dame High's playoff game at San Marino would 
be no Small affair, Knight tailback Errol Small made a cameo appearance and 
helped lead his team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Small, who sprained his right ankle in last week's win over Righetti, showed up 
just in time to help Notre Dame kill the clock and preserve a 17-7 victory over 
San Marino on Friday night in a Southern Section Division VII second-round 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will meet Serra, a 32-25 winner over Arroyo Grande, next Saturday in 
a semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great to contribute," said Small, who didn't carry the ball until the 
final period but finished with 35 yards in eight carries when the Knights 
needed him the most. "If my ankle was broken, I still would've been in there. 
It's money time." 
</P>
<P>
And Small cashed in. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (11-1) was nursing its tenuous lead and had not made a first down 
the entire second half when Small, who played at his usual defensive back 
position, made his first appearance on offense. 
</P>
<P>
He got the Knights their initial second-half first down on an eight-yard run, 
then rambled five yards two plays later for another first down. 
</P>
<P>
Small's carries helped eat up some valuable time, and Notre Dame needed all of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of fourth-quarter interceptions by John Sandoval didn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights were sitting on a comfortable 17-0 lead at intermission but were 
slapped awake on the opening kickoff of the third quarter when San Marino's 
Craig Mohaghegh recovered an onside kick at the Notre Dame 36. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Alfonso Montoya slipped Tim Elliott's tackle and bolted 36 
yards to a touchdown. Craig Chamberlain added the kick, and, suddenly, the 
Knights' lead was trimmed to 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's offense went stale, and didn't convert a first down until Small's 
run midway through the final period. 
</P>
<P>
The Knight defense, however, did the job, intercepting three passes in all and 
holding defending division champion San Marino (8-3) to 48 yards rushing and 
163 yards overall. The Titans made only eight first downs -- just two in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Knight defense, which had held eight previous opponents to a touchdown or 
less, was at it again, limiting San Marino to 24 yards passing and 16 yards 
rushing in the first two periods. 
</P>
<P>
Although Small did not carry the ball in the first half, the Notre Dame offense 
did not miss him. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights broke through on their second possession, marching 54 yards in 
seven plays for a touchdown. Quarterback Greg Andrachick sneaked over from the 
one for the score, and Chris Afarian added the extra point to give Notre Dame a 
7-0 lead with 26 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights added another touchdown in the second quarter when Stefano 
Malieitulua scored on a two-yard touchdown run to cap a short 41-yard drive. 
Afarian added the kick for a 14-0 lead with 5:13 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Afarian booted a 22-yard field goal to give the Knights a 17-0 lead with 1:47 
remaining before half.

NORTHRIDGE: THE SHOCK OF A THREE-YEAR STARTER QUITTING IS BUFFERED BY THE 
EMERGENCE OF A TALENTED SOPHOMORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In many ways, the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team that opens the 
season tonight at home against St. Thomas College (Minn.) will resemble last 
season's. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the Matadors' five starters return and Northridge will continue to run 
its up-tempo, two-forward, three-guard offense. 
</P>
<P>
But there will be one big difference in the Matadors' makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Six-foot, eight-inch, 250-pound Todd Bowser will be missing. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser, a three-year starter from Montclair Prep who averaged 11.0 points and 
6.4 rebounds a game last season, quit the team this semester, citing 
differences with Coach Pete Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
And although Bowser's exodus weakened the Matadors' depth on the front line, it 
has given forward Kendell McDaniels an opportunity to start and possibly shine. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels, a sophomore from Chatsworth High, was used sparingly by Cassidy in 
the first half of last season, but his playing time increased when Northridge 
shifted into California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play, and he led the Matadors 
in rebounding in three of their last four games. 
</P>
<P>
"Kendell really came on for us last year," Cassidy said. "He was a very 
pleasant surprise. Once he got to know the system and understand our offense, 
he became an effective player." 
</P>
<P>
After averaging 20 points and 10 rebounds a game as a senior at Chatsworth, 
McDaniels averaged 5.1 points and 3.8 rebounds while playing an average of 13 
minutes a game. As McDaniels' playing time increases, however, so should his 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm expecting good things out of Kendell," Cassidy said. "He has good leaping 
ability and he has a nice turnaround jump shot in the key. He can put the ball 
in the hole and we'll need him to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (16-11, 7-7 in CCAA play last season), also will need McDaniels to 
excel in the blue-collar departments of rebounding and defense, areas in which 
he can improve the most, according to Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's getting tougher and tougher in the middle," Cassidy said, "and he's 
improving on defense. But he has to learn to stop committing the silly fouls. 
He has to stop the reach-in fouls." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels (6-4) will be part of a starting five that includes Kris Brodowski 
(6-6) at the other forward position, and guards Jemarl Baker (6-2), Derrick 
Gathers (6-3), and Eugene Humphrey (6-0). 
</P>
<P>
Gathers was the Matadors' leading scorer (16.9 average) and rebounder (7.0) 
last season, and he tied for second in assists (3.2) with Baker, who is coming 
back from arthroscopic knee surgery. Brodowski averaged 5.9 points and 5.1 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey is a transfer from Cerritos College, last season's state junior 
college champion. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Sandy Brown and Andre Henry, and swingman Erik Cooper give Cassidy an 
abundance of quickness in his reserves. The quickness probably will be needed 
to compensate for a lack of height. 
</P>
<P>
"We're quicker on the perimeter this year," Cassidy said. "So we'll extend our 
defense out some. We'll try to take advantage of our quickness by increasing 
the defensive pressure and picking up the tempo a little on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot of questions about our depth. I'd like us to be 10-deep and 
I'm not sure if we are." 
</P>
<P>
After starting the season tonight against St. Thomas, a Division III school 
from St. Paul, Northridge will play host to Cal Lutheran on Tuesday night 
before going on the road against Division I teams Weber State on Friday and 
Utah State on Saturday.

<P>
St. Mary's, a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I school, had little 
trouble beating Division II Cal State Northridge, 71-56, in a nonconference 
women's basketball game Friday in Moraga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's, the defending West Coast Conference champion, built a 24-point 
halftime lead and increased the margin to more than 30 points in the second 
half. The Gaels outrebounded Northridge, 50-34. 
</P>
<P>
Cheree Tappin scored 18 and Pia Paivio added 15 for St. Mary's. Anja Bordt 
scored 11 points and had 13 assists for the Gaels. 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Olson and Julie Arlotto, with 14 points each, were the only Northridge 
players to reach double figures. Arlotto led Northridge with eight rebounds.

DAVE DISTEL: MORE WESSELMANS WOULD BRING HAPPY DAYS TO LUGINBILL, AZTECS 
</P>

<P>
You meet John Wesselman on the street, and you think he must be related to the 
Cunningham family of Happy Days days. Freckled. Sandy hair. Wide eyes. You look 
around for The Fonz. 
</P>
<P>
However, you see Wesselman in the San Diego State University football locker 
room after a game and you think the guy was in a street fight . . . and won. 
</P>
<P>
What we have here, in essence, is a baby-faced assassin. 
</P>
<P>
What we also have here is the prototype of the kind of football player around 
whom Coach Al Luginbill hopes to build a program of national consequence. 
</P>
<P>
"John Wesselman," said Luginbill, "is the epitome of what a San Diego State 
football player should be." 
</P>
<P>
The incredible thing is that I am not even sure what position the guy plays. 
After watching SDSU against Miami last Saturday, I came away wondering how many 
players had been assigned No. 39. They seemed to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, it was he rather than they. 
</P>
<P>
Wesselman is listed on the depth chart as a nickel back, but that certainly 
undervalues him. If you happen to be at the stadium for tonight's game with 
Brigham Young, the only thing I can suggest is that you find Wesselman by 
looking for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys," Luginbill said, "find a million reasons not to be there. He finds 
a million reasons to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Wesselman is neither particularly big (6-2, 210) nor fast, but he gets it done 
with a combination of work ethic and instinct. The former particularly appeals 
to Luginbill, but the latter is what makes it work. 
</P>
<P>
"He has natural ability," Luginbill said, "and he plays to it." 
</P>
<P>
Others of varying degrees of ability have abandoned the San Diego State program 
because Luginbill is a particularly demanding coach, but Luginbill's approach 
played into Wesselman's wheelhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Tough? Disciplined? 
</P>
<P>
That's Wesselman. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been like that since I started playing football," he said, "even back 
when I was playing Pop Warner. I've always had very demanding coaches." 
</P>
<P>
He developed his idea of defense while playing at West Torrance High School, 
where he was Bay League back of the year in football, a basketball player who 
once scored 32 points in a game and a two-time league champion in the 110-meter 
high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense was called The Swarm," he said. "We had to have 11 guys on the 
ball after every play or we had to run laps." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Wesselman has become sort of a one-man swarm . . . or at least 
the King Bee. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the way Luginbill wants it with all of his players. He preaches 
playing hard. It seems a cliche, but wanting a team to play hard and getting a 
team to play hard are not the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason why a player such as Wesselman is so valuable. 
</P>
<P>
"I would use him as an example of what we want here in terms of football 
players," Luginbill said. "He's a leader, but not by voice. He understands what 
the offense is trying to do and he understands what the defense is trying to 
do. In that sense, he's like a coach on the field." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wesselman does not seem to think all this is so demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a big change though," he said. "Coach Luginbill is a lot more 
disciplined. He demands a lot more of you on and off the field." 
</P>
<P>
Off the field? 
</P>
<P>
"In studies," Wesselman said, "and conducting yourself in public. If something 
happens to us, like we go out get into a fight, it ends up on the front page. 
He wants to protect the image of San Diego State football." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Luginbill wants his tough guys to be gentlemen. There's only 
one place he wants them to be tough. 
</P>
<P>
"On the field," Wesselman said, "you have to go 100% every play. If you don't, 
he'll get on you." 
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made. SDSU is 6-4-1 going into the season finale against BYU. 
For Wesselman, it is a career finale . . . at least as a college player. 
</P>
<P>
"There are, what, 28 teams in the National Football League," Luginbill said. 
"There's a place for John on one of them. He'll be playing someplace on Sunday 
afternoons." 
</P>
<P>
John Wesselman is the kind of guy who will make someone make room for him. You 
name it, and he'll do it. Special teams? He's on all of them at SDSU because 
they can't keep him off. He won't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
In style of play and attitude, there's a guy he resembles more than anyone from 
Happy Days. That would be Hank Bauer, who parlayed toughness and intensity into 
a rather nice professional career hereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
That's it. 
</P>
<P>
John Wesselman is a Hank Bauer with hair.

3-A QUARTERFINAL; 
</P>
<P>
MIRA MESA'S BIG PLAY BEATS CHULA VISTA, AVENGES EARLIER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The play is called "One-88 down." This time, 52 seconds into the fourth 
quarter, Mira Mesa running back Wayne Pittman covered 52 yards with it and 
scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After that, all host Chula Vista (10-1-1) could do Friday night in this 
quarterfinal playoff game was keep telling each other "Talk it up, talk it up." 
But from Chula Vista's standpoint, there wasn't much to talk about. Mira Mesa 
(9-3) had this football game well under control. The result was a 27-10 victory 
and a date next week with the winner of tonight's Morse-San Dieguito game. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes before Pittman's run, Chula Vista had driven 62 yards in six 
plays and scored its only touchdown of the game on a 36-yard pass play from 
Derek Chapman to receiver Brandon Gregg. Suddenly, there was life on Chula 
Vista's sideline. And then, quick as Pittman could run 52 yards through a big 
hole in the line, there wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
This run allowed Mira Mesa Coach Brad Griffith to breathe a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure made us feel more at ease," he said. "The guy is a heck of a 
ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
Pittman finished with 90 yards in 10 carries. Chula Vista's line had been 
stubborn before he finally broke free. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really just thinking about picking up a few yards, because they had 
stopped it all night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between this game and the team's first meeting -- a 14-0 Chula 
Vista victory -- was that Mira Mesa didn't allow Chapman and his offense to 
control the clock. Chapman finished a respectable 16 of 32 for 209 yards, but 
he spent most of the night throwing with hands in his face. 
</P>
<P>
"When we played them last time we didn't have any film on them," Griffith said. 
"We just didn't really know what they did in certain situations." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista stumbled through the first half, scoring its only points on a 
22-yard field goal by Art Castro. Even that was a compromise, though, because 
Chula Vista had taken over at the Mira Mesa four following defensive back Fred 
Tayco's recovery of Mira Mesa quarterback J.J. Rowlett's fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, Chula Vista's half consisted of two things. It watched as Mira 
Mesa put together two touchdown drives of 27 and 63 yards. It stopped as Mira 
Mesa's defense stuffed Chapman every time he had opportunity to get his team 
back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Rowlett scored on a one-yard keeper to open the scoring with 9:13 remaining in 
the first quarter and give Mira Mesa a 7-0 lead. The Marauders had taken over 
at the Chula Vista 27 after a Chapman pass glanced off the fingers of Hicks and 
into the hands of linebacker Dan Brislin. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, Mira Mesa increased its lead to 14-0 when running back 
Don Elder (21 carries, 76 yards) went three yards over the right side.

POINT LOMA PUTS AWAY PATRIOTS IN OVERTIME

For all of the wild plays, all of the six touchdown passes during regulation -- 
only one shorter than 20 yards -- the clincher to Friday's Point Loma-Orange 
Glen San Diego Section 3-A quarterfinal at Mesa College was a simple 10-yard 
pass during overtime. That and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma quarterback Danny White completed the pass to Marlon Manassa, and 
when Point Loma's Brett Callan intercepted a Daren Wilkinson pass two plays 
later, the game was over. Finally. 
</P>
<P>
The final score technically was 28-28, but Point Loma scored three touchdowns 
to Orange Glen's one during the California tiebreaker overtime to move Point 
Loma (8-4) into the section semifinals against the winner of tonight's Rancho 
Buena Vista-Southwest game. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma needed just two overtime touchdowns, but Callan ran 99 jubilant 
yards with his interception to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
This was after each team scored on its first overtime possession. Orange Glen 
took the ball first and scored on its second play. Wilkinson handed off to Noel 
Toloumu, who turned around and passed to Wilkinson in the end zone. David 
Napier made the conversion kick. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma scored in more dramatic fashion. White passed 14 yards to J.J. 
Stokes on fourth and 14. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen forced the overtime by scoring 15 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 28-13, Wilkinson passed 25 yards to Chris Ybarra with 3:59 left to 
make it 28-20. A minute and a half later, Orange Glen's Gabriel Munoz recovered 
John Faulkner's fumble at the Point Loma 35. Four players later, Ryan 
Strathearn bowled over from the two. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen then tied the game when Toloumu caught Wilkinson's pass for the 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Point Loma nearly came back to win in regulation. White passed 16 
yards to Stokes and 33 yards to Callan on the Pointers' first two plays to give 
Point Loma first and 10 on the Orange Glen 15 with 16 seconds left. But Bob 
Simoneau missed a 33-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Strathearn's two-yard run to tie the game was the shortest touchdown play in a 
wild game. 
</P>
<P>
White had touchdown passes of 80, 59 and 19 yards to Stokes, and Manassa went 
55 yards for a touchdown on a fake reverse. Meanwhile, Orange Glen's Wilkinson 
passed 30 yards to Toloumu, 40 yards to 5-foot-8, 130-pound sophomore Kris 
Plash and 25 yards to Ybarra. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen led at the half, 13-7.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CONDO OWNER FACES DEADLINE ON TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: At the beginning of the year I owned two condos; one was a personal 
residence, the other was a rental. I sold my residence, and when my rental 
became vacant at about the same time, I moved into it. I spent the next few 
months making repairs and upgrades to the rental condo and have been living 
there since as a matter of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
I plan eventually to do a tax-deferred exchange with this condo. But I want to 
know whether my ability to treat this condo as investment property is in 
jeopardy if I continue to live here. Do I have to continue actively seeking a 
tenant? What if I just start treating the rental as my residence and roll my 
gain from the sale of the first condo into it? -- W. L. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your situation is getting complicated and, according to our advisers, 
the longer you continue living where you are, the greater the likelihood of 
your losing virtually every tax advantage available to you. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, you may not simply decide that your rental condo is your 
replacement residence and defer your gain from the sale by saying that your 
investment in the rental is the rollover of your profits from the sale of your 
residence condo. You already owned the rental condo; you haven't reinvested 
your sale proceeds at all. Further, it seems your intent from the outset was to 
treat this unit as an investment property. (If you had intended all along to 
treat the second condo as a residence, and had rented it only temporarily 
before moving into it, the IRS does allow you to consider it a replacement 
residence. However, you would have had to purchase it no more than two years 
before selling your other residence.) 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the situation, you have two years from the closing of escrow on the 
sale of your first residence to move into a replacement home that is of equal 
or greater value than the home you sold. The clock is ticking, and once time 
runs out you stand to be taxed on whatever gain you realized from the sale of 
the condo. 
</P>
<P>
If you continue living in your rental condo, it is possible that the IRS will 
determine that it is no longer a rental property. If your rental unit loses its 
status as an investment you will lose the chance to participate in a 
tax-deferred exchange with it. And that would be both unwise and unfortunate 
for you, especially if you expect to realize a big profit from the sale of the 
rental condo. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds as if it's time for you to get moving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rolling Over a Pension Fund 
</P>
<P>
Q: I will be quitting my job soon and will be receiving several thousand shares 
of company stock as my pension distribution. I intend to sell the shares and 
roll over the proceeds into some mutual funds. But exactly how much can I roll 
over in this manner? Would it be the value of the stock on the distribution 
date, or the actual net proceeds that I receive from the sale of the shares? 
Also, may I pay the brokerage fees from my own funds and roll over the gross 
proceeds from the sale? -- A. J. M. 
</P>
<P>
A: First of all, we're assuming that you intend to roll over the proceeds from 
your stock sale into an individual retirement account that will invest in 
mutual funds. Unless this is your intention, your proceeds will be taxable. And 
you have just 60 days to open the IRA account after selling the shares. 
</P>
<P>
The law allows you to roll over the entire proceeds from the stock sale into a 
tax-sheltered IRA, even if the stock appreciates between the time you receive 
it and finally sell it. So you may shelter the appreciation as well as the 
principal. If the stock should decline in value between the time you receive it 
and sell it, you are allowed to open an IRA in an amount equal to the value of 
the shares on the day you received them. The law also allows you to pay the 
brokerage fees from your own pocket so the full amount of the pension can be 
put into a tax-sheltered account. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRA Rules May Mean Distribution 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am age 70 1/2 and taking mandatory distributions from my individual 
retirement accounts. But I have a big problem with one of my 12 accounts. Last 
April, this account matured and I put the funds into a 182-day time deposit. 
When the deposit matured in October, I put the entire proceeds, which amounted 
to $9,500 including interest from the 182-day investment, into an 18-month IRA 
account at the same bank. Now the bank tells me that they will report this 
$9,500 as a distribution to me this year. I have already taken the distribution 
I want for this year and have made plans for my distribution in 1990. What can 
I do? The bank's handling of this does not seem right. I did not withdraw any 
of the money. -- T. D. 
</P>
<P>
A: On the surface, your arguments seem plausible. However, you haven't told us 
one very crucial bit of information. And according to our advisers, this may be 
the key issue in the bank's determination. 
</P>
<P>
What name did you use when you purchased the 182-day time deposit? Was it your 
own name, or the name of your IRA trust? If you used your own name, then the 
bank's determination is correct. You are allowed to withdraw funds from your 
IRA, but they must be reinvested in an IRA within 60 days to avoid the move 
being considered a withdrawal. You exceeded the limit by investing the funds in 
a 182-day account. 
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, your taxing experience points out how carefully we all 
must pay attention to the regulations governing individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the 182-day time deposit was made in the name of your IRA, then you 
should ask your bank for a further explanation for their determination. Our 
advisers cannot think of any reason why your moves should have triggered their 
conclusion. Will you let us know how this sorts out? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife's Sale of Stock to Husband Is Taxable 
</P>
<P>
Q: I plan on selling some shares of stock to my husband. I purchased some of 
these shares before our marriage 10 years ago, and some I purchased or acquired 
through stock splits during our marriage. What are the tax consequences of this 
transaction between husband and wife? -- M. J. W. 
</P>
<P>
A: If you're selling the shares to your husband at a profit, the consequences 
are the same as they would be if you sold to anyone else: You will have a 
reportable gain that is subject to taxation. However, if you're selling at a 
loss, you cannot claim it as a tax deduction because you are selling to a 
member of your family. 
</P>
<P>
We're not trying to be rude, but our advisers do wonder why you are bothering 
to sell the shares. Perhaps you might consider making them a gift, or even 
exchanging assets of equal value if you are trying to even up your pre- and 
post-marital holdings.

<P>
The stock market pushed ahead in light trading Friday, resuming the rally that 
it began before the Thanksgiving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.77 to 2,675.55, bringing its 
gain for the week to 22.89 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 931 up, 447 down and 522 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 86.29 million shares, down from 
145.73 million Wednesday and the lightest total since 68.87 million were traded 
on July 3 -- another session squeezed in between a weekend and a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
103.11 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments rose 1 3/8 to 37 7/8 in active trading. The stock rallied 
sharply this week after news surfaced that the company has been awarded a 
patent in Japan for integrated circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 1/8 at 41 1/2; 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 1/4 at 56 3/8; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 
1/4 at 43 3/4, and McDonald's, up 1/4 at 32 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air, traded on the American Stock Exchange, jumped 1 1/8 to 13. Pilots 
and flight attendants ended their strikes against the company's Eastern 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Precious-metals stocks were mostly higher as the price of gold extended its 
recent rally and hit its highest levels in nearly a year at around $419 an 
ounce. Homestake Mining added 1 1/8 to 19 3/8 and ASA Ltd. 1 to 57 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices edged higher on London's Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 1.9 points, 
or 0.09%, to close at 2,222.4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks zoomed to a record close on scattered buying, greased along in 
late trading by foreign speculators buying shares in the key Nikkei index. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-share Nikkei index rose 197.55 points, or 0.54%, to close at 36,484.47, 
its third consecutive closing record.

Bonds Edge Up on Interest Rate News 
</P>
<P>
Most bond prices finished slightly higher Friday in thin trading in an 
abbreviated session, although corporate bonds and some short-term government 
securities declined. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond edged up 1/16 point, or about 62 
cents for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield was unchanged from late 
Wednesday at 7.87%. 
</P>
<P>
The market was closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving Day holiday, and many 
traders also took Friday off. Friday's trading wound down in the early 
afternoon, ending several hours before the usual close of bond dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices initially were supported by positive follow-through 
from Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve signaled it was lowering interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank injected reserves into the financial system Wednesday by 
making short-term purchases of securities from dealers. Making funds available 
to the financial system takes pressure off interest rates. Falling interest 
rates, in turn, boost bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
But after the initial advance Friday, analysts said bond prices lost some 
strength when the Fed unexpectedly reversed course and drained some reserves 
from the system. 
</P>
<P>
That action was reflected in a rise in the federal funds rate, the interest on 
overnight loans between banks, to 8.25% from 8.125% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues were unchanged to 1/32 point lower, intermediate maturities 
rose 1/32 point to 1/8 point and long-term issues were unchanged to 1/16 point 
higher, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, edged up 0.26 to 1,197.87. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials declined. Moody's investment grade corporate 
bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds 
with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.60 to 338.61. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 7.75% as the discount 
remained stable at 7.51%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.67% as the 
discount edged up 1 basis point to 7.30%. Yields on one-year bills increased to 
7.58% as the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.08%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity.

Pork Futures Rise; Grain Prices Fall 
</P>
<P>
Changes in Eastern Europe continued to support pork futures prices Friday on 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government bought 280,000 pounds of pork bellies Wednesday to ship to 
Poland as part of a food-aid package and a recent Yugoslavian purchase of 
150,000 metric tons of bellies has stirred hopes for more sales of U.S. pork to 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Stronger cash markets also boosted the pork markets and the cattle futures 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle settled 0.07 cent to 0.50 cent higher, with the contract for 
delivery in December at 76.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.05 cent to 
0.42 cent higher, with November at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.33 
cent to 0.87 cent higher, with December at 51.12 cents a pound, and frozen pork 
bellies were 0.50 cent to 1.52 cents higher, with February at 64.77 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade, 
depressed by weakness in the soybean and soybean oil markets.

EL TORO RALLIES TO OUST VILLA PARK 
</P>

<P>
On its first series Friday night, El Toro High School moved quickly down the 
field against Villa Park. The Chargers' passing clicked and their running 
picked up one sizable gain after another. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro drove 68 yards in seven plays to score on a 21-yard run by Bo Haley 
with 8 minutes 46 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the great drought. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 24:56, El Toro couldn't score. And the second-seeded Chargers 
seemed headed for an upsetting loss to Villa Park in a Southern Section 
Division III second-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
But a 21-point, fourth-quarter rally helped El Toro pull out a 28-14 victory 
before 4,000 at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (11-1) advances to play Mission Viejo, a 34-6 winner over Dominguez, in 
the semifinals Saturday. Villa Park ends its season 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried until the gun sounded," El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said. "Villa 
Park played us hard. We were out of sync and it was because of the way they 
played us." 
</P>
<P>
After taking that 7-0 early lead, it all when downhill quickly for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of the Chargers' next possession, quarterback Steve Stenstrom 
threw a screen pass into the mitts of Villa Park linebacker Craig Moresco, who 
went 37 yards untouched for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park took a 14-7 lead after quarterback Jason Martian ran three yards 
around left end on a third-and-goal play. Martian appeared trapped by defensive 
back Mike Miller, but fooled him with a quick move to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
The score was set up by a bad snap on a punt that gave Villa Park a first down 
at the El Toro 20. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "You make your own breaks and we didn't make any." 
</P>
<P>
Well, at least not for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The problems continued in the third quarter. Running back Danny Maestas was 
stopped at the one-yard line on a fourth and goal, ending El Toro's only 
possession in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park was having its own troubles. The Spartans couldn't move the ball 
either and as the fourth quarter started they still led, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro finally tied the score on its first drive of the fourth quarter. 
Maestas scooted five yards around left end for the touchdown with 7:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
Then it all fell apart for Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Bladow, who gained 89 yards in 12 carries, fumbled the ensuing kickoff and 
Brian Haas recovered for El Toro at the Villa Park 24. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Oakman, who gained 145 yards in 17 carries, score on the first play as 
El Toro took the lead for good. Maestas then added a 14-yard touchdown run with 
2:46 left. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they run and pass, it's hard to stop both," said Villa Park Coach Pat 
Mahoney, whose team held El Toro in check for an awful long time. 
</P>
<P>
"After that first-quarter touchdown we didn't have much going for us for 2 1/2 
quarters," Johnson said. "It was scary."

SUNNY HILLS RUNS PAST TUSTIN FOR SPOT IN SEMIFINALS

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunny Hills High School Coach Tim Devaney was rather somber Friday after the 
Lancers' 21-0 victory over Tustin. It was hard to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Lancers had dominated the Tillers in front of 4,000 at Tustin 
High School. They had run up and down the field with little interference from 
the Tustin defense. And with the victory, Sunny Hills reached the semifinals of 
the Southern Section Division VI football playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
So why wasn't this guy smiling? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be happy later," Devaney said. "We were very apprehensive about this 
game. The way Tustin plays the run was very scary." 
</P>
<P>
So much for fear. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (12-0), the top-seeded team in Division VI, did as they pleased for 
much of the game. They gained 307 yards rushing and had two running backs rush 
for more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
About the only problems Sunny Hills had was inside the the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"My defensive coordinator said we would need 28 points to win this game," 
Devaney said. "But he says that every week." 
</P>
<P>
From the Lancers' first play, it was apparent they would have little trouble 
running against the Tillers (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Brian Pizula burst over right tackle for a 28-yard gain. Kenny Overby 
followed with a 23-yard gain on the next play and Sunny Hills was off and 
running. 
</P>
<P>
"Tustin is probably the most fundamentally sound team we've played all season," 
said Devaney, whose team will play Corona del Mar Friday in the semifinals. "So 
we felt pretty good about things after our first drive." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers went 80 yards without attempting even one pass on the drive. 
Pizula, who had 126 yards in 21 carries, finished it off with a one-yard run on 
fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers were far from perfect, though. Twice they were stopped inside the 
10. 
</P>
<P>
On its second possession, Sunny Hills got as far as the two-yard line, but 
Overby was stopped for no gain on fourth down. In the fourth quarter, the 
Lancers got to the eight, but Matt Young's 25-yard field goal attempt was 
blocked by Che Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the Lancers were perfect. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Sunny Hills led, 21-0. Overby, who had 124 yards in 19 carries, 
scored twice in the second quarter on one-yard runs. The second touchdown came 
after Steve Choe recovered a Ron Goods fumble at the Tustin 18. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers had only 56 yards in total offense at halftime, most of which came 
on their first drive. 
</P>
<P>
A 32-yard pass completion from quarterback Andy Borza to Frank Mercuri gave the 
Tillers the ball at the Lancer 27. However, Sunny Hills held and David Basurto 
missed a 42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers' only scoring chance came in the second half. They drove to the 
Lancer four, but Borza was sacked by Pizula on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills limited the Tillers to only 43 yards rushing in the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Lancers' fifth shutout of the season and their second in the 
playoffs. Sunny Hills defeated Kennedy, 28-0, in its first-round game.

JULIAN SURPASSES AIR BATTLE AS LA QUINTA WINS

La Quinta and Newport Harbor high school's quarterbacks combined for more than 
400 yards passing in their second-round Division VI playoff game Friday in 
front of 2,200 at Bolsa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Trent Julian's 18-yard breakaway run for a touchdown with about a 
minute to play that decided the outcome, a 23-16 victory for La Quinta. The 
Aztecs (8-4) will play La Mirada, a 14-0 winner over Western, in the semifinals 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta went into the fourth quarter leading, 16-9, and had mounted a drive 
from its 37 to the Newport Harbor 26, but Newport Harbor's Ryan Abby 
intercepted a pass by Richard Weaver and returned it 40 yards. That set up 
Stephen Scheck's six-yard touchdown pass to Matt White. Josh Klein's 
point-after tied the score, 16-16, with just under 3 1/2 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta then took possession on its 31 and took eight plays to get into the 
end zone. One key to the drive was a Newport Harbor's penalty. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta had a third and two at the Newport Harbor 44, but a five-yard penalty 
against Newport Harbor gave La Quinta the first down. On the next play, Weaver 
hit Wes Kollar for a 26-yard reception. And two plays later, Julian cut up the 
middle for the 18-yard touchdown and the game. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor had one last chance with possession at its 32 and less than a 
minute to play, but Scheck threw two incomplete passes, and was sacked on third 
down. His completion to Todd Farley on fourth and 15 was short of the first 
down as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Julian, who has been playing on a knee that has damaged cartilage and will 
require surgery after the season, rushed for 93 yards and two touchdowns in 19 
carries. He also caught five passes for 47 yards. Weaver completed 17 of 30 
passes for 219 yards and an interception; Newport Harbor's Scheck completed 19 
of 31 passes for 187 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor took the lead early. Ken Osako blocked Justin Sagoin's punt at 
the Sailor 35 and six plays later Todd Farley (16 carries, 48 yards) scored on 
a one-yard run. La Quinta tied the score, 6-6, on a six-play, 73-yard drive 
capped by Weaver's six-yard keeper for a touchdown. Weaver also completed a 
44-yard pass to Jason Cherms (5 receptions, 91 yards) in the drive. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta scored in the second quarter on Julian's two-yard run to cap an 
80-yard drive, and Matt Logan added a 23-yard field goal to start the second 
half. Newport Harbor's Klein kicked a 27-yard field goal before the Sailors 
tied the score on White's touchdown reception.

Mission Viejo High School made some big plays and stopped one big running back 
to roll to a 34-6 quarterfinal victory over Dominguez in a Southern Section 
Division II playoff game at Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
But even though Mission Viejo did score on two spectacular pass plays, the 
story of this game was rather mundane. Dave Clark, Mission Viejo's offensive 
line coach, cut to the heart of the matter when he said, "This game was won in 
the trenches." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo dominated both sides of the line, opening up huge holes for 
running backs Mark Gaw and Ryan Darke, each of whom gained more than 100 yards, 
and giving quarterback Tim Snowden plenty of time to throw long. 
</P>
<P>
Even more impressive was the Mission Viejo defense, which held Dominguez's 
massive 6-foot-4, 240-pound fullback, Bruce Walker, to just 39 yards on nine 
carries. Consider that 25 of those yards came on a carry late in the game; 
consider also that Walker came into the game considered one of California's top 
prospects, having gained more than 1,300 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then consider Walker's words. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best defense I've played against all year," he said. "They were 
blowing our line away. They were a lot bigger and a lot stronger than anyone 
else we've played." 
</P>
<P>
Especially for Walker, Mission Viejo employed a new defense that featured an 
extra lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a great player, we were obviously worried about what he could do," 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
But Walker was never a factor. Dominguez's only score came on an 87-yard pass 
from quarterback Anthony Young to Deon Johnson early in the second quarter. The 
conversion kick failed, which meant Dominguez trailed, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo had a 21-6 halftime lead and had almost totally shut down 
Dominguez (8-4). The Dons, predominantly a running team, gained only nine yards 
rushing in the first half. Walker was held to four yards on four carries. 
</P>
<P>
Darke and Gaw would each score again in the second half, Gaw on a 13-yard run 
in the third quarter and Darke on a two-yard run in the fourth that was set up 
by Gaw's 83-yard scamper. 
</P>
<P>
Though Walker came into the game with the bigger name, not to mention body, it 
was Gaw and Darke who got the big yards. Gaw rushed for 164 yards on just 12 
carries, Darke for 102 on 12. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden completed six of 13 passes for 157 yards and the two touchdowns.

Laguna Hills High School's bid to advance to the Southern Section Division VIII 
semifinals came up two yards short Friday night against Agoura at Irvine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura held on to a 14-7 victory in front of 1,000 by stopping Laguna Hills' 
Darrin Chapman at the two-yard line following a 23-yard pass from Mark Wells 
with no time remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (9-3), the third-place team from the Frontier League, will play Orange 
Friday in the semifinals. Laguna Hills, which upset top-seed Yucaipa last week, 
finishes 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Wells competed four of eight passes for 54 yards on the final drive, which 
began at the Laguna Hills five with 1:22 left. An interference penalty with 
seven seconds left gave the Hawks the ball on the Agoura 35. On the following 
play, the Chargers were called for holding, which put the ball on the 25 with 
no time left. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman then caught Wells' pass at the five, but was tackled by Todd Cribari. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, who hadn't completed a pass until the fourth quarter, finished six of 16 
for 63 yards and was intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura halfback Dave Caramanis scored on a two-yard run in the fourth quarter 
to break a 7-7 tie. Caramanis set up his score with runs of 23 and 20 yards on 
the 70-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, who scored the Hawks' touchdown on a 37-yard run in the third quarter, 
had 73 yards in 14 carries.

The storm hovering over Central California that has kept San Diego cloudy and 
cool this week is expected to arrive Saturday night, bringing with it a chance 
of rain, a National Weather Service forecaster said. 
</P>
<P>
The rain should last through Sunday morning, forecaster Wally Cegiel said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just getting the tail end of a storm from up north," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the weather should remain cloudy and cool. Cegiel said there is a 
30% chance of rain, but he is expecting only small amounts to fall. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime temperatures for the beaches should stay around 63 to 67 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Highs for coastal regions will be 63 to 68 degrees, falling to 54 to 59 
overnight. The inland valleys will reach 64 to 72 degrees and drop to 46 to 54.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PETITION DRIVE TARGETS RESIDENTIAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Azusa First, a group of residents opposed to construction of 67 multifamily 
units on land next to the Azusa Greens Country Club, has begun a petition drive 
that could force the City Council to repeal decisions allowing the project or 
put the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
At its Nov. 6 meeting, the council voted to change the zoning on the 8.4-acre 
parcel from water conservation to multifamily residential. It also amended the 
General Plan and approved the design and tentative tract map proposed by D 
&amp; D development and developer Johnny Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
If the group is able to gather 1,413 signatures of registered voters by Dec. 6, 
the council would have to either repeal the decisions or put them on the April 
ballot.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 BOYS HELD IN VANDALISM AT SCHOOL IN 
PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two boys were in custody Friday on suspicion of causing at least $67,000 in 
damage in a vandalism spree at a public elementary school in Palmdale, the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Among the vandalized equipment were 15 IBM computer terminals and a computer 
mainframe that sustained $47,000 in damage when an automatic fire-extinguishing 
system was activated, sending fire-retardant foam into classrooms, officials 
said. Other damage included pried-open doors and ripped screens. 
</P>
<P>
The boys, 12 and 15, were being detained at the sheriff's Antelope Valley 
station on suspicion of felony vandalism, Lt. Dave Collin said. The boys, who 
are not students at the school, were noticed nearby shortly after deputies 
discovered the damage at Sumac Elementary School, in the 4000 block of East 
Avenue P-8, authorities said.

PACS FUND OVER 50% OF BENTLEY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Carol Bentley has collected more than half of her campaign 
contributions for her state Senate race from political action committees, 
according to a financial disclosure form filed by the El Cajon Republican on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $118,328 in cash and contributions that Bentley has raised this year, 
the form shows, $61,550 -- or 52% -- came from PACs, or registered 
special-interest lobbying groups. But, as of last Saturday, less than three 
weeks before the Dec. 5 special election, Bentley had only $7,353 in cash on 
hand, the form shows. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure forms, which show all campaign contributions and expenditures 
made from Oct. 22 to Nov. 18, were due at the San Diego County registrar's 
office on Friday. But Bentley's opponent, Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San 
Diego), failed to meet the deadline. According to the registrar's office, she 
will be charged $10 for each day she is late. It wasn't known why Killea missed 
the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers had wondered whether the recent actions of San Diego's 
Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher might prompt a surge in donations for Killea 
and Bentley. On Nov. 15, Maher barred Killea from receiving Communion because 
of her pro-choice stand on abortion, putting the spotlight on Killea, who 
appeared on the CBS This Morning and Donahue shows this week. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Krause, a spokeswoman for the Killea campaign, said Friday that as a 
result of the publicity surrounding Maher's action, "there has been an increase 
in last-minute contributions. We've been inundated with lots of small 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
David Lewis, Bentley's campaign consultant, said Bentley's fund raising has 
"remained strong throughout. We've seen no decline." The disclosure forms filed 
Friday, he pointed out, include only three days after Maher's directive. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley, whose campaign slogan calls her a "real Republican," received 
significant contributions from the building and construction industry, her 
disclosure form shows. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 38 PACs that donated to Bentley's campaign represented builders or 
building suppliers, such as the Timber Assn. of California. When added to the 
contributions from private construction and lumber companies, these gifts made 
up nearly 15% of Bentley's funds to date -- $17,300. 
</P>
<P>
Another, less influential group made a visible, though not very lucrative, 
showing in Bentley's behalf: foot doctors. Of the 19 doctors who made private 
contributions to her campaign, 14 were podiatrists who gave an average of $143 
each. They were joined by the Downtown San Diego Podiatry Group, which gave 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
"They supported her in her Assembly race, and they're continuing to support her 
now," said Lewis, adding that he doesn't know whether Bentley has sponsored any 
legislation that might affect podiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $86,460 Bentley's campaign spent from Oct. 22 to Nov. 18, more than 59% 
-- $51,272 -- was spent on campaign literature and advertising. Another $8,566 
-- nearly 10% -- was spent on surveys and fund raising.

TRIAL TO FOCUS ON TAX VALUE OF RACEHORSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nestled deep in the blue-ribbon horse country of southern Ventura County, 
wrapped softly in a late-morning haze, the ranch of millionaire developer David 
H. Murdock is a quiet bustle of activity. 
</P>
<P>
Under a cool canopy spread by towering oaks, expensive Arabian stallions trot 
lazily across a pasture. A sleek mare circles a hot-walker machine, cooling 
down after a run. Inside a carefully maintained brick barn, a blue-jeaned young 
woman sweeps her way past the stalls of top-quality fillies and geldings. 
</P>
<P>
Sprawled over 1,500 acres in the wealthy Lake Sherwood area just south of 
Thousand Oaks, the ranch -- called Ventura Farms and home to 200 Arabians -- 
has produced national champions of the United States, Canada and Brazil. In a 
slick booklet, the ranch advertises itself as "one of the most significant 
Arabian breeding farms in the world today." 
</P>
<P>
But as his horses peacefully graze, Murdock's lawyers are busily preparing for 
a court battle Monday with Ventura County that is being closely watched by 
racehorse breeders statewide. At issue is how much the county can tax such 
horses -- a question that owners claim could have a major impact on the future 
of racehorse breeding in Ventura and other counties. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves conflicting interpretations of a 1971 state law that gives 
tax breaks to owners of five racing breeds: Arabians, appaloosas, 
thoroughbreds, Standardbreds and quarter horses. The statute was intended to 
help build up California's horse-racing industry, boosting race-track betting 
and putting more money in state tax coffers. 
</P>
<P>
The county assessor's office contends that to qualify for the tax break, a 
horse must be entered in races, be registered with the state as a racehorse and 
its ranch include a training track and race trainer. Otherwise, horses are 
subject to taxation at 1% of market value, the same rate as boats, airplanes or 
other personal property. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed last year, however, Murdock argued that a horse should be 
classified as a racer if it is merely eligible to race or produces a foal 
eligible to race, said Richard Craigo, one of his attorneys. Murdock claimed 
that his stock, even if some hadn't actually raced, were still racehorses under 
the law, qualifying them for a far lower flat tax rate of $200 to $1,000 a 
head, Craigo said. 
</P>
<P>
For breeders with as much stock as Murdock, the difference in tax rates could 
mean saving tens of thousands of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
If Murdock wins his lawsuit in Ventura County Superior Court, the county may 
ultimately have to give back up to $500,000 in taxes already paid by Murdock 
from 1981 through 1986, said County Assessor Jerry Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford acknowledged that Ventura evidently is the only county in California 
that still taxes some horses as personal property, a policy that some breeders 
claim may encourage other counties to apply the higher tax rate to racehorses, 
driving some owners out of the state and hurting state race-track tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes years to develop a good racing string. If you're going to be taxed as 
though they're not for racing, it's going to be very expensive to keep horses 
in California," said Michael Sypolt, treasurer of the Arabian Racing Assn. of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 65,000 Arabians in California and 24,000 owners," he said. "This case 
could be very important." 
</P>
<P>
But Sanford dismissed that argument, saying that breeders who are in compliance 
with the state racehorse law have nothing to fear from the tax man -- in 
Ventura or elsewhere -- since they will receive a racehorse exemption. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute can be traced to 1985, when then-Assessor Jack Waterman conducted a 
routine audit of horse ranches, including Murdock's, Sanford said. The audit 
came at a time when such ranches were proliferating in Ventura and racehorse 
prices were escalating rapidly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although in previous years most Ventura horses had so little value that county 
tax appraisers largely ignored them, Sanford said, the 1985 audit revealed "$30 
million to $40 million worth of value out there," and the county decided to 
step up collection of taxes on ranch stock. 
</P>
<P>
Many horse owners, Sanford said, were shocked when their new tax bills arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"One horse I think we had appraised for $13 million. And a week later, the 
horse died. I'm not sure if the owners showed the horse the bill or not," he 
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, Sanford said, were caught in "kind of a Catch-22," because 
they were assessing some racehorses at a time when their prices had reached 
all-time highs, some zooming up 500% in a single year. But the following year, 
prices plunged as a speculative boom in Arabians slowed sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Craigo criticized the county's position as "a little selfish," 
charging that if its tax policies do drive breeders away, the county may be 
fattening its own tax coffers in the short term at the expense of long-term 
state revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford said that at the time his office began applying the personal property 
rates to horses, many of Murdock's animals didn't qualify for the racehorse 
exemption. Since then, however, Murdock has built a race-training track, 
registered some of his horses as racers and put more of his stock into races. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, county officials reappraised Ventura Farms and in July agreed to 
lower Murdock's assessment for the 1987-88 and 1988-89 fiscal years, to $1.6 
million from $25.2 million, Sanford said. The cut meant the county had to give 
back $237,000 in taxes already paid by Murdock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford said that although the $500,000 in tax money at stake in the lawsuit is 
a tiny percentage of the $400 million the county annually generates in tax 
revenue, it is still a significant sum that is split between local schools, 
county government and special districts. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Zimmerman, another attorney for Murdock, said the developer is pursuing 
his expensive litigation with the county not to save money but to prove that 
his reading of the state racehorse law is correct, and to help other breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"This case only applies to Murdock, but it probably has ramifications 
throughout the state," Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Murdock can afford the taxes, but a lot of other people have smaller 
operations and the tax can be a significant extra burden for them," he said.

Police are looking for witnesses to the hit-and-run death of a 19-year-old San 
Diego man who was struck and killed by an unidentified driver late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Lemoe Tauanuu was found in the 8300 block of Skyline Drive by 
police at 9:10 p.m., police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim was lying in the road when he was struck. Authorities 
did not know how Tauanuu came to be in the road. Other drivers avoided the 
victim before he was hit by the third, who did not stop, traffic investigator 
Oscar Johnson said.

TRAILER HITS CAR HEAD-ON ON FREEWAY, KILLING 2, INJURING 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A trailer broke loose from a truck, crossed a freeway center divider and plowed 
head-on into a car in Simi Valley on Friday, killing the car's driver and a 
10-year-old boy and injuring two other boys in the car, authorities said. 
Traffic was backed up for miles after authorities closed all freeway lanes in 
both directions. 
</P>
<P>
Another man suffered minor injuries when he swerved to avoid the trailer and 
his car went over the side of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The victims' names were not immediately available. The four occupants of the 
first car, a Cadillac, were believed to be members of the same family, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old boy was pronounced dead at the scene of the fiery crash that 
occurred about 3:20 p.m. on the eastbound side of the Simi Valley Freeway near 
the Erringer Road off-ramp, Simi Valley Police Lt. Bob Robbins said. The male 
driver died on arrival at Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, a nursing supervisor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the boys, about 8 years old, was in extremely critical condition at the 
hospital Friday evening, the nursing supervisor said. The fourth boy, thought 
to be about 15 years old, was in serious condition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said the flatbed trailer, loaded with couches, chairs and other heavy 
objects, crossed the center divider and collided with the eastbound Cadillac, 
which burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Toyota truck that was towing the trailer was not injured, 
Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
All eastbound lanes were closed until about 7:40 p.m. Westbound lanes were 
reopened about an hour after the crash.

AN EXPERT OFFERS LEONARD SOME ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard hasn't asked for it, but Carlos Palomino has nonetheless 
offered some advice on how Leonard should go about fighting Roberto Duran in 
Las Vegas on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard probably figures he doesn't need advice, since in their best-forgotten 
rematch of 1980, Leonard was handling Duran so easily, the Panamanian quit in 
the middle of the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
Palomino and many others in boxing see Duran as a man on a mission, grateful 
for the chance at age 37 to atone for that mistake. 
</P>
<P>
When Palomino, once a welterweight champion, lost a lopsided 10-round decision 
to Duran in New York in 1979, Duran was 27 and had just abandoned the 
lightweight division for the welterweights. 
</P>
<P>
The secret for beating Duran in his prime, Palomino said, was surviving his 
heart, not his punch. He presumes the same is true now. 
</P>
<P>
"I found Duran to have average punching power," Palomino said the other day. 
"He was a devastating puncher at lightweight, but never at welterweight or 
middleweight. Really, Armando Muniz hit me harder than Duran. Now, Duran hits 
you just hard enough to get your attention. The key is to make him respect you 
early in the fight. If you don't do that, he'll try to walk right through you. 
"And he's tough to hit squarely, because he gives you so many angles, so many 
feints. He's in and out on you a lot, very hard to figure out. 
</P>
<P>
"If he comes in under 160 pounds, that will tell you something. If he does, 
I'll predict he'll stop Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, Leonard seemed very slow against Tommy Hearns -- not in a hand-speed 
sense, but in how long it took him to recover when he was off-balance. I like 
Duran to win the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Footnote: Duran-Leonard III is at 162 pounds. Three months ago, Duran looked as 
if he were close to 190. On Wednesday, Duran's people claimed he weighed 160. 
</P>
<P>
During the early and middle rounds of his bout with Orlin Norris in Santa 
Monica Tuesday night, Tony Tubbs looked as though he were a few rounds away 
from wrapping up a career. 
</P>
<P>
But the quick, agile heavyweight, who once held the World Boxing Assn. 
championship, proved that a seemingly fat heavyweight can still be in decent 
physical condition. Tubbs was surprisingly strong during the last three rounds 
of the 12-round fight, winning a close decision to end Norris' 19-bout winning 
streak and take the North American Boxing Federation title. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you wondered why the much taller, 233-pound Tubbs struggled for so long 
against the undersized, 205 3/4-pound Norris. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his career, Tubbs has been an enigma. He is athletic, a hard hitter 
when he wants to be and, all too infrequently, an impressive fighter. For 
example, Tubbs was angered by what he claimed was a Norris head butt, and for 
about 15 seconds, fought with almost Tyson-like fury. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the name: Nana Konadu. 
</P>
<P>
The recent super-flyweight championship bout in Mexico City between Mexican 
champion Gilberto Roman and Konadu, of Ghana, had an unexpected result. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, considered one of boxing's most capable champions, was defending his 
title for the 13th time. But Konadu, a huge underdog, knocked Roman down five 
times. A Mexico City headline read: "The Lion of Africa Devours Roman." 
</P>
<P>
Forum matchmaker Antonio Curtis wants to match Konadu against Paul Gonzales in 
February. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman, training for his Jan. 15 bout in Atlantic City, N.J., with 
Gerry Cooney, has finally checked into a fat farm -- well, a remote island, 
anyway. It seems George weighed about 260 pounds for a recent exhibition, and a 
publicist for Foreman said the fighter has gone to a Caribbean island "to run 
hills and eat raw fish" until Dec. 2, when he will arrive in Las Vegas to hype 
the Cooney fight. . . . Top Rank, Bob Arum's promotion firm, said the third 
bout between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran on Dec. 7 in a 16,000-seat 
arena at Las Vegas' new Mirage Hotel should sell out by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Goose Boxing's Tuesday show at the Country Club in Reseda, its last of the 
year, features the main-event debuts for unbeaten brothers Gabe and Rafael 
Ruelas. It will also be the debut of Gabe (17-0) at junior lightweight and of 
Rafael (11-0) at featherweight. Their manager, Dan Goossen, said Team Ruelas 
will jump up in class, beginning in January. . . . On SportsChannel Monday: 
junior-welterweights Vinny Pazienza vs. Eddie Van Kirk. . . . On ESPN next 
Friday: middleweights Nigel Benn vs. Jose Quinones. Wednesday's scheduled World 
Boxing Assn. welterweight title match in London between champion Mike McCallum 
and Michael Watson was canceled Friday, after Watson suffered a broken nose 
while sparring. . . . Australian super-featherweight Jeff Fenech improved to 
24-0 by scoring a unanimous decision over Mexican Mario Martinez Friday in 
Melbourne.

JAZZMAN MOODY ENJOYS AN UPBEAT RIFF, BOTH IN CAREER AND AT HOME; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Searching for a sour note in the life of jazzman James Moody, circa 1989, is 
about as fruitful as listening for a clinker in his playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet and Lovely," his new album, is riding high, recently entering 
Billboard's jazz chart at No. 15 while resting at No. 1 in The Gavin Report and 
No. 2 in Radio &amp; Records. 
</P>
<P>
Moody the newlywed seems blissful. The album is dedicated to his wife, Linda, 
the reason behind his move from Jersey City to San Diego earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters all over the world are after the masterful sax and flute player. He 
chalked up impressive flight time this fall, playing Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, 
France, Italy and Germany. During his travels, he sends his wife a dozen roses 
every Monday, along with frequent Faxes, like one with "I Love You" written in 
longhand 100 times. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing remotely bothering the man is the attire required in the Philip 
Morris Super Band he's been touring with, joining jazz heavies like Ray Brown, 
Herb Ellis and Harry (Sweets) Edison with the backing of the tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
Moody prefers the loose-fitting designer threads he buys in New York or Beverly 
Hills, and the thought of being buttoned into the mandatory tuxedo makes him 
cringe. 
</P>
<P>
In town recently during a break between the European and Far Eastern legs of 
the Philip Morris tour, San Diego's newest resident jazz master talked about 
his life and music. 
</P>
<P>
That he is happier than ever is readily apparent to fellow musicians, such 
longtime friends as trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, who gave Moody his first job in 
1947, in Gillespie's big band. 
</P>
<P>
"They say I sound better and look better. It's all because of you honey," Moody 
said, smiling at his wife in the living room of the townhouse they share. A 
graceful glass sculpture of Moody and Gillespie playing together rests on the 
coffee table. Otherwise, there aren't much memorabilia: sculptures given to him 
and Gillespie in Lagos and Nigeria for their contribution to jazz, and an album 
of photos from the Moodys' honeymoon, including a pose with friends Bill Cosby 
and Sidney Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Moody and Gillespie have become close friends, playing together 
occasionally, calling or writing each other often. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think of Dizzy in the early times, I think about how much I loved his 
playing, even though I didn't know what he was doing," Moody said. "I dug him, 
but I had no relationship with him like now. We've been on the road, done 
things together. I feel close to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Diz said things years ago, and now, a light goes on, and I realize, that's 
what he meant!" 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie was the best man at the Moodys' wedding, and he plays on two of his 
own tunes on Moody's new album: "Con Alma" and "Get the Booty" as well as 
lending a raspy voice with Moody on "Get the Booty," a light-hearted scat duo. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike peers who also cut their chops on be-bop, Moody doesn't believe 
electronics are inherently evil. On his last two albums, synthesizers have 
provided subtle backup. 
</P>
<P>
"I constantly want to grow in music and spirit," Moody said, adding that people 
who readily embrace the newest technologies, should also accept "the musician 
who doesn't want to stay in the same groove as when he came up." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the nod to technology, the synthesized sounds don't dilute Moody's 
forceful work. He still blows a be-bop storm on alto and tenor saxes and flute, 
stretches for high register squeals and squeaks on the horns or lays back with 
the smooth, breathy sound he applies so well to ballads. 
</P>
<P>
After more than 40 years in jazz, Moody still practices daily. Mornings, he 
plays flute while Linda gets ready for her job as a real estate agent. 
Afternoons, he works out on the saxes. 
</P>
<P>
In the never-ending search for new sounds, Moody is about to experiment with 
his horns for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a new mouthpiece. I want a bigger sound. This happened because 
I'm playing with younger guys in the Philip Morris band, and I hear their 
sound, guys like Ralph Moore on tenor and Gary Smylan on baritone. I need a 
different reed, too." 
</P>
<P>
Other young musicians have impressed him, like the vocal sextet Take Six. 
</P>
<P>
"They knocked me out. I must have bought nine or 10 copies of their album just 
to give to people." 
</P>
<P>
Among his favorite younger sax players are Harold Land, Michael Brecker and Joe 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's history has by now been documented in countless articles: his many 
projects with Gillespie, albums as a leader beginning in 1948 ("James Moody and 
His Bop Men" on Blue Note), his successful late-'50s battle with alcohol, 
working with Las Vegas casino bands in the '70s and his return to full-time 
serious jazz in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his older work has been reissued on CDs, but Moody isn't too 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not me any more. It has the old sound. First, you know your alphabet, 
but not how to spell. Later, you know the alphabet and how to spell, and you 
want to make as many hip words as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Moody is best known to many fans for his 1949 solo on "I'm in the Mood for 
Love," recorded in Stockholm. The improvisation became the tune called "Moody's 
Mood for Love," with lyrics by singer Eddie Jefferson. Sung by King Pleasure, 
the song was a hit in 1952, and has been recorded several times since, 
including versions by Aretha Franklin and George Benson. Moody usually sings it 
himself in club dates. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz fans who hope Moody's move to San Diego might mean more local appearances 
will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like playing at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets called constantly for favors," said his wife, who handles some of his 
business affairs. "But he gets his two weeks in at Elario's, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Moody won't play Elario's until next year, but you might see him in the 
audience when he's in town. He stopped in recently to catch old friends Cedar 
Walton and Billy Higgins, and he planned to hear local flutist Holly Hofmann at 
the Horton Grand Hotel downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Every so often, someone asks Moody, 64, about telling his story for a book. 
"I'm not interested," he said. "I think we all have interesting lives."

FACES: A STRENUOUS WEEKEND

<P>
Can Brian Kerwin survive this weekend? It's still up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, the actor will have prepared two Thanksgiving dinners, finished 
memorizing his lines for the one-man "A Poster of the Cosmos" (for the Dec. 11 
"Because We Care" AIDS holiday benefit at the Taper), and put in eight 3 
1/2-hour performances of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" at the Doolittle -- 
one on Tuesday, two on Wednesday, two on Friday, two on Saturday and one on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first rehearsal, I just shook," says Kerwin, who's Nick to John 
Lithgow and Glenda Jackson's George and Martha. 
</P>
<P>
"For 3 1/2 hours, I'm either being berated or berating someone else. It's also 
a progressive situation of drunkenness. I walk in the door already loosened up 
and go downhill from there. By the second show, I really do feel hung-over, a 
little woozy. I went to a doctor once who said, 'Your body doesn't know you're 
faking up there.' It's true." 
</P>
<P>
"Cosmos" offers its own Angst. 
</P>
<P>
"Lanford Wilson wrote it to be done at AIDS benefits," Kerwin says of the 
25-minute monologue, a man's statement to the police after the death of his 
AIDS-stricken lover. Although he had been introduced to the piece some time ago 
by director David Galligan, the call to do it for this benefit came out of the 
blue -- and right in the middle of his Doolittle run. "I said, 'Sure, I've got 
all the time in the world.' " 
</P>
<P>
If he survives his theater commitments, the actor can relax and look forward to 
"Challenger," ABC's upcoming three-hour TV-movie about the 1986 shuttle 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there was a lot of sadness," he says of his experience playing 
pilot Mike Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't play that tragedy. For them, there was no foreboding. Our movie 
ends with the countdown, the engines starting -- and the astronauts' faces 
beaming as they go into outer space." JANICE ARKATOV

FACES: SLAP-HAPPY KIND OF GUY

Did you, actor Larry Romano, repeatedly slap the face of pop sensation Madonna 
last Oct. 28? 
</P>
<P>
Romano is guilty as charged, and this offense is documented in "Oh, Father," 
the Platinum One's newest video. He portrays Madonna's whiskey-breath boyfriend 
in the clip. 
</P>
<P>
"It took about 10 or 11 takes," says the 25-year-old actor, who was most 
recently seen in Sly Stallone's latest flop "Lock Up." 
</P>
<P>
"It took awhile," Romano says, his voice big with the cadence of the Bronx. "I 
didn't want to (really whack her), but she told me to, so I ended up doing it 
anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna had spotted Romano in the Stallone film, then again in Interview 
magazine and mentioned her interest to a mutual friend. When word got back to 
Romano that the Material Girl had expressed admiration, he jumped into his game 
plan. All-around player Romano, who is currently working on a screenplay that's 
been optioned, also composes the occasional tune. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me get in touch with her because I've got a song," Romano told the friend 
they shared. 
</P>

FACES: PLAUSIBLE POLITICAL PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY JENEL SMITH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Tom Skerritt was approached to play the lead in HBO's "Red King, White 
Knight," he was intrigued "because the script smacked of newsworthiness." 
</P>
<P>
That assessment of the glasnost-era spy thriller proved increasingly true, 
Skerritt notes, as the project moved through production in politically-tense 
Hungary last spring and toward its debut date tonight. With the destabilizing 
Eastern Bloc as a background, "Red King" centers on a hypothetical plot to 
assassinate Mikhail Gorbachev by anti-reformists -- a concept, Skerritt says, 
that the film team thought of as all-too-plausible. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about that, but not with any great concern about giving anyone 
ideas, because it's already within the realm of possibility anyway," says the 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
Skerritt says with a laugh that he did no research for his role as a burned-out 
ex-CIA man destined to meet his ex-KGB adversary (Max von Sydow). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do any of that kind of stuff," says the veteran actor, whose 
rough-hewn features have long been familiar to the public via such films as 
"MASH," "The Turning Point," "Alien" and "Top Gun" in addition to numerous TV 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
A type-B presence in a type-A profession, the Detroit native frequently comes 
up with such statements as "There's no big secret to movie acting" and "When 
I'm not working, I really don't think about the business." He prefers to stay 
out of Hollywood, in the quiet surroundings of the Seattle home he shares with 
his wife, Susan, and their 11-year-old foster son. 
</P>
<P>
Skerritt's easygoing attitude extends to his other current role as Sally 
Field's husband in "Steel Magnolias." Working with five leading ladies 
successfully is just a matter of "knowing when to keep your mouth shut," he 
says with a soft chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Just what does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well, I was the man, you know," he replies. "They tried to include me, but 
they had a lot to say to each other."

STAGE WIRE: L.A.'S 'STANDUP TRAGEDY' HEATS HARTFORD, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No Los Angeles show has ever put out more heat than "Standup Tragedy" did at 
the Mark Taper Forum last summer, Bill Cain's study of a rookie teacher trying 
to "turn around" the kids in a bursting-with-trouble boys' school. Cain's play 
had started at the Taper -- specifically, in Taper, Too's 1988 new play 
festival -- but it would clearly have a life elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, this week "Standup Tragedy" turned up at the Hartford Stage, again 
directed by Ron Link. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the reviewers loved the show, but everybody felt the heat. Malcolm L. 
Johnson of the Hartford Courant thought that the script bopped around between 
being imaginative and being banal. But Johnson had nothing but praise for 
Link's "driving, dancing, high-volume production." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Viagas in the New Haven Register thought that Cain had shattered 
"Blackboard Jungle" cliche "by showing how one person really can't make a 
difference" when the actual purpose of a system is to hold its subjects down. 
As for Link's production, Viagas described it in a single word: "Wham!" 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Herald's Arthur Friedman thought that Cain's script bogged down in 
the second act. Nonetheless, the play "speaks powerfully to its theme: the low 
odds of survival in the inner city's 'ecology of evil' and the risk that must 
be taken to increase those odds." 
</P>
<P>
Mel Gussow of the New York Times: "A kaleidoscopic portrait of education in 
extremis, written with an immediacy that makes it seem as if it were faxed from 
the front lines." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR. Broadway continues to set box office records -- the 
wrong kind. The new top ticket price for "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" will be 
$60. 
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES. Playwright Harold Pinter, in Theater Week Magazine: "We've been told 
in England that we have been a free country and a democracy for so long, a lot 
of people still believe that this must be the case."

'COLUMBO' RETURNS AND SAMMY DAVIS LEADS SUNDAY'S 'HOLLYWOOD CHRISTMAS PARADE' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Falk, Sammy Davis Jr., Walter Cronkite and winners and losers from the 
1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul strut their stuff on the small screen as the long 
holiday weekend winds down. 
</P>
<P>
Falk returns, trench coat and all, tonight at 9 on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42) as America's favorite rumpled detective in the season premiere of 
"Columbo." Falk will reappear periodically this season in rotation with Burt 
Reynolds, Jaclyn Smith and Telly Savalas in the "ABC Saturday Mystery." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, local viewers can avoid the traffic snarls by staying home and 
watching the 58th annual "Hollywood Christmas Parade" at 6 p.m. on Channel 5. 
Sammy Davis Jr. is this year's grand marshal. Bob Eubanks and Leeza Gibbons 
will host the live telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night at 9, CBS (Channels 2 and 8) looks back at "Fifty Years of 
Television," with clips and highlights from the small screen's first half 
century. Walter Cronkite, Carl Reiner, Jane Seymour and Kermit the Frog serve 
as emcees for this stroll down memory lane. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday at 9 p.m., the Disney Channel offers a series of compelling 
memories from the last Summer Games in Bud Greenspan's documentary, "Seoul '88: 
16 Days of Glory." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's deft ability to capture the moving human stories behind the 
magnificent accomplishments of such athletes as Christa Rothenburger, Vladimir 
Salnikov, Louise Ritter and Calvin Smith put to shame the commercial-saturated 
and superficial live network Olympic coverage to which Americans are 
accustomed.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television producer Norman Lear, saying he has been called atheist, secular 
humanist and Christian-hater by leaders of the religious right, sounded 
anything but that in a speech Monday before the American Academy of Religion's 
annual convention in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Lear has incurred such wrath because nine years ago he founded People for the 
American Way, a civil libertarian lobby that attacked the political views of 
televangelists and opposed anti-evolutionists, most recently in California, in 
attempts to gain an entree for creationist views in public school science 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
But in his Anaheim talk, Lear said he had "a deep concern about the unhealthy 
reticence that exists today to (discuss) ultimate meanings and spiritual life 
in the media, in the social arena and especially in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
He appealed to university-level educators and seminary professors to join 
broad-based efforts by a range of educational and religious groups to persuade 
textbook publishers to end what People for the American Way called "an 
appalling neglect and misinformation about religion" in school books. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court rulings have affirmed the legality of teaching about 
religion and religious history in public schools even as justices prohibited, 
on church-state separation grounds, the introduction of devotions, prayers or 
teaching designed to inculcate religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Lear said, "among secularists, the aversion toward discussing moral values 
-- let alone religion -- can reach absurd extremes." In a culture "dedicated to 
consumerism and obsessed with material well-being, it should not be surprising 
that the life of the spirit atrophies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lear credited the "rank and file" of the religious right for focusing attention 
on moral and spiritual values. "But (that) crusade goes awry when it insists 
that the only valid spiritual or moral values are fundamentalist Christian 
ones, and that the secular laws of government ought to embody such sectarian 
beliefs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
DATES 
</P>
<P>
An American Indian worship service and "meal of thanks" will be held Sunday 
starting at 2:30 p.m. in Norwalk at the Native American United Methodist 
Church. The event is sponsored by Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, Nazarene, 
Presbyterian, United Methodist and United Church of Christ representatives of 
an ecumenical ministry called the Gathering Table. 
</P>
<P>
Father Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, superior general of the worldwide Jesuit order of 
priests, will visit Loyola Marymount University Friday, addressing the campus 
community and others in an 8 p.m. talk at the Sacred Heart Chapel. The Dutch 
native is making his first trip to California as head of the Society of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
House Majority Whip William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) will be the featured speaker 
Sunday at the 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. Men's Day services at Second Baptist Church of 
Los Angeles. JOHN DART

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: GIFTED CLASSES NOT FOR SNOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. Joyce Brothers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Our 8-year-old daughter is an exceptionally gifted child and 
the authorities at her school suggest that she be transferred to a different 
class for especially bright youngsters. They feel that she'd do better and, 
eventually, be happier in this class designed for the gifted. She resents this 
suggestion and says she doesn't like having to be away from her friends. My 
wife isn't really in favor of the move either because she's afraid it will turn 
our child into a snob. -- P.R. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR P.R.: This is a decision that obviously needs thought. However, I suspect 
that your daughter would adjust and make new friends quickly. Research shows 
that children in gifted classes are usually well-rounded in social skills and 
don't become "snobs" if their parents don't contribute to the feeling that 
their children are special and better than other children. In other words, if a 
child becomes a snob, it's the fault of the parents, rather than the school. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Barbara Kerr, the associate director of the Belin National 
Center for Gifted Education at the University of Iowa, very bright children who 
are forced to remain in a regular classroom throughout their education are more 
likely to become contemptuous of people of average intelligence than those in 
special schools or special classes. They tend to become impatient and think 
that other kids really aren't trying. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My husband threatens to disown our 19-year-old son because 
he wants to drop out of college to travel and "see the world." My husband wants 
him to follow his career in medicine, and our son says he'd rather "die than be 
a doctor." What can I do to heal these wounds between father and son? I don't 
think it's right to cut the boy off with nothing. -- J.V.T. 
</P>
<P>
Dear J.V.T.: Your husband is being unfair in demanding that this boy follow in 
his profession. Your son has a right to make his own choices and he should be 
encouraged to develop his own potential. Parents who view their youngsters only 
as an extension of themselves and who try to relive their lives through them 
are doing their offspring a great injustice. This kind of parental selfishness 
produces rebellion or complacency and, later, resentment in the child. 
</P>
<P>
College isn't right for every youngster. Your son might profit from taking a 
year off from studies. It might help him to go to work. This might teach him 
how the real world functions and after a while, he might begin to realize the 
benefits of studying and furthering his education. 
</P>
<P>
I believe it would be helpful if you could talk with your husband about his 
expectations for his son and stress that the boy needs to be respected and 
loved as a separate individual. Also, it would be beneficial if you could 
encourage your son to talk with faculty members or advisers at his school.

BOB GREENE: WHAT'S IN A NAME -- AND A DECADE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An editor for one of those trend-setting, Manhattan-based glossy women's 
magazines called with a question: 
</P>
<P>
What did I think would be a good name for the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
I thought I might have misunderstood. "The '90s haven't even started yet," I 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that," she said. "But we are asking several people to come up with a 
name for it." 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of a name?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything you want to name it," she said. "Sort of like the 'Me Decade,' but 
for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
"No one even has any idea what's going to happen in the '90s," I said. "Usually 
people wait until a decade is over -- or at least until it's been around for a 
few years -- to give it a name." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but we want to get this into our January, 1990 issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
I began to understand. In this hurry-up world of intense media competition, no 
one wants to be last -- or even second -- to hit the airwaves or the public 
prints with a concept. Granted, no one has any idea what the '90s will be like, 
but if you wait until 1998 or 1999 to name the decade, you're going to be 
standing at the end of a very long line. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to the real point here: if you think of the '90s as a person, 
you've got to feel a little sorry for the poor guy. Born into a world he never 
made, he's facing disadvantages that the decades preceding him could not have 
even imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Most decades are allowed to be born, to feel their way around for a couple of 
years, to develop a personality, to mature and then to fade peacefully away. 
The '90s, though, are going to have to hit the ground running. As a matter of 
fact -- thinking again of the '90s as a person -- this poor baby has been 
forced to sprint full speed while he is still in the womb. I think it was 1987, 
maybe 1988, when magazines started heralding "the end of the '80s." The decade 
was over, or so we were told, even though the calendar indicated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Part of this was based on societal trends; the pundits had decided that greed 
and ruthless acquisitiveness, which they associated with the '80s, were going 
out of fashion -- a questionable assertion at best, but one from which the deep 
thinkers extrapolated the idea that not only was greed dead, but so was the 
whole decade. Thus, for the last couple of years, we seem to have been living 
in the '90s -- or so you would believe if you keep up with the popular press. 
</P>
<P>
Any new performer, politician, or "personality" who comes along is referred to 
as "the (pick your noun) of the '90s." No matter that we're not there yet. The 
most obvious example is Arsenio Hall, who has been called "the talk-show host 
of the '90s" so many times that he would have every right to dread the stroke 
of midnight this New Year's Eve. Having been credited with conquering the '90s 
before the decade is even a day old, Hall has nothing to gain and everything to 
lose when the first day of 1990 actually rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
The same with the Oakland A's ("the baseball team of the '90s"), Michelle 
Pfeiffer ("the actress of the '90s"), Infiniti ("the car of the '90s") and all 
of the other people, places and things who have, before the fact, been chosen 
to epitomize the decade. They are all part of an era that has become so 
impatient with today that tomorrow must be willed into existence well in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
Save your true compassion, though, for the '90s itself. Thinking of the decade 
once more as a person, the poor, puzzled fellow is going to arrive right on 
schedule -- only to be greeted by a nation that will gaze upon him and think, 
"You again?" The '90s have been with us in spirit for so many months now that 
when the decade actually shows up, much of the country will be bored with it 
without knowing precisely why. 
</P>
<P>
But back to the magazine editor from Manhattan, and her request for a name for 
the '90s. She did not seem interested in hearing reasons why it makes no sense 
to name a decade before the decade starts; she seemed interested in getting a 
name for it. Just doing her job. 
</P>
<P>
"All right," I said. "The '90s is the last decade of the century, right?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then how about something along the lines of 'Get Us Out of Here'?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Get Us Out of Here Decade'?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a thought," I said. Happy New Year, everybody.

PLANT OF THE WEEK: DIOSPYROS KAKI ORIENTAL OR JAPANESE PERSIMMON; 
</P>
<P>
DECIDUOUS ORNAMENTAL FRUIT TREES

<P>
It is a sad and frustrating truth that most fruit trees are unattractively 
utilitarian, while the really beautiful trees -- even those belonging to fruit 
families, such as flowering peach and plum -- have nothing worth eating. 
</P>
<P>
One of the prettiest exceptions is the persimmon. Reaching about 30 feet in 
height if left unchecked, persimmons are handsome enough in full leaf, but they 
really pay off in fall and winter: After the leaves drop, the deep, glowing 
orange fruit shines like jewels; when the fruit is gone, the tree's naked 
branches are exposed in all their spreading glory. This is a great tree for 
kids to climb. 
</P>
<P>
The leaves are large and leathery, not the best for close-up viewing, so a 
persimmon tree should be planted far enough from a patio to show off its 
structure and fruit without focusing too much attention on the individual 
leaves. The overall effect in autumn, though, when the leaves turn orange, 
yellow or purple, deserves a second look from any distance. 
</P>
<P>
The two most common Oriental persimmons are Fuyu and Hachiya, both readily 
available in supermarkets. Fuyu is a flattened globe with firm flesh that is 
sweet even when underripe; Hachiya is shaped more like a big teardrop or acorn; 
if eaten before it turns mushy-ripe, this fruit will pucker your mouth with its 
astringency. 
</P>
<P>
Hachiya fruit should be picked before it turns soft and should be allowed to 
ripen indoors. Available to home gardeners but rarely found in stores is the 
Chocolate persimmon, with brown-flecked, very sweet fruit. All ripe persimmons 
are delicious when dried or pureed and used in sauces, puddings, cakes and 
muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Persimmons are native to only two areas of the planet -- China and the eastern 
United States -- but since the Japanese have developed most of the cultivars we 
now enjoy, the Chinese trees are sometimes called Japanese. All persimmons, 
including Diospyros virginiana, the American native, are related to the ebony 
trees of India and Ceylon (Diospyros ebenum). 
</P>
<P>
Persimmons are quite adaptable to most Southern California climates (except 
possibly near the ocean). They can stand drought or swamp conditions, need very 
little fertilizer and tolerate plenty of heat (they do need a consistent water 
supply to avoid premature fruit drop). Unlike many fruit trees, they don't 
require diligent annual pruning; crossed or damaged branches should be removed 
for the tree's health, and careful top pruning can keep a persimmon to a 
suburban-size 12-foot height. If that's still too big -- espalier it. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to plant deciduous fruit trees. If local nurseries are out of 
stock, persimmons can be ordered from Harmony Farm Supply, P.O. Box 451, 
Graton, Calif. 95444 (catalogue $2) or Fowler Nurseries, 525 Fowler Road, 
Newcastle, Calif. 95658 (catalogue $2; price list free). JUDITH SIMS

TAIWANESE BOY IS STILL JUST A 'VALLEY KID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RIP RENSE, Rense is a Sherman Oaks free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time, perhaps, when the idea of an "average Valley kid" conjured 
images of blond bangs, skateboards, two-car garages, Brady Bunch parents, 
station wagons. And Paul Lin certainly lives up to some of the popular notions 
about children who live in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Paul has a skateboard. His vocabulary is sprinkled with an occasional rad and 
cool. He has a Lakers world championship banner on his bedroom wall, collects 
baseball cards ("My best is a Jose Canseco '87 Topps," he says), and plays 
Nintendo video games whenever possible. His family settled in the San Fernando 
Valley for the same reason many families do -- because it seemed safer, quieter 
and friendlier than the big city. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this fifth-grader at El Oro Way School in Granada Hills has the same 
kinds of aspirations that "average Valley kids" have always had, like playing 
guitar "or one of those keyboards that you play like a guitar" and someday 
going to "U!-C!-L!-A!" as he puts it. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul Lin was born in Taiwan and hangs out with kids who came from India, 
Mexico, Egypt and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," the 10-year-old said, "the kids in my class come from many 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
Paul lives in a modest two-bedroom Granada Hills apartment with his 15-year-old 
brother, Frank, and his mother, Elizabeth. His father, a successful mining 
engineer, remains in Taiwan and supports his wife and children by long 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the most all-American way for a family to function. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult, but we are lucky," said Elizabeth Lin, in halting English. 
"My husband can afford to support us and to come to visit several times a year. 
But the children are most important, so we are making this sacrifice for them, 
so they can get a good education here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was for the sake of the children's education that the Lins decided 
to endure this difficult international arrangement. Education in her native 
country, Elizabeth Lin explained, is very good, but there are problems. It is 
very strict, and competition to enter Taiwan's few universities is tough. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think the education in Taiwan is sometimes too strict and might give 
the children problems," she said. "They study so much and have so much stress. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, there are many more universities here than in Taiwan, so students have a 
greater chance of going to one. In Taiwan, the competition is very strong, 
because there are many students and only a few universities. In some cases, 
students who do not get into university are so destroyed by that they commit 
suicide. Sometimes even before they take the entrance examination." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Lin spoke from the living room of the family apartment on a hot 
afternoon. The walls were liberally decorated with oil paintings done by family 
members. One, a triptych seascape, featured a panel by Paul, one by his mother 
and one by brother Frank. Paul sat nearby, listening and eyeing a much-used 
Nintendo video game sitting idle on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, children grow up in a free way," his mother said. "And they have enough 
time to play basketball, to do exercise, so their physical condition is very 
good. In Taiwan, this is not as true. 
</P>
<P>
"But also here, I sometimes think the education is too easy, maybe too much in 
the opposite direction." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Lin had to push and encourage her kids in their first few years here, 
she said, because there is so much freedom in public schools that students have 
a tendency to take advantage of their new-found free time. Now, since Frank and 
Paul are older and more adjusted, she is trying to minimize the "pushing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"One year ago, I had to push them and help them, but right now I don't push 
them and let them grow up in a more natural way. Now it is time for them to 
learn responsibility for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
And how well have they learned responsibility? Pretty well, evidently. If 
anything is not quite typical about Paul Lin, Valley kid, it is how 
spectacularly he has managed to adjust in such a short time. Arriving here as a 
6-year-old first-grader (at El Oro Way Elementary), unable to utter so much as 
an A, B or C, he has since: 
</P>
<P>
Skipped third grade. 
</P>
<P>
Become an in-class tutor for other students. 
</P>
<P>
Completed a sixth-grade level reading program and fifth-grade level math 
program while still in fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Developed into an avid reader, mostly of Hardy Boys books (" 'Case Files Number 
23' is my favorite," he notes.) 
</P>
<P>
Lately taken to dreaming of a career as an astronomer. 
</P>
<P>
Paul's success, and brother Frank's (who is earning a solid B average at Robert 
Frost Junior High in Granada Hills), flies in the face of a major American 
stereotype: children growing up in day-care centers, with absentee, uncaring or 
overworked parents, and kids attending schools that do little more than 
baby-sit. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Paul's mother has been a primary factor in his achievements. But 
there were two other sources of help that were invaluable to Paul: a private 
English tutor hired to teach once a week for 18 months, and Virginia Hatfield, 
Paul's third-grade teacher at El Oro Way. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to say that Mrs. Hatfield helped me a lot," said Paul, in serious 
tones. "When I first arrived, I didn't speak any English at all! I would sit in 
the back of the room and just keep on listening to the teacher. That was the 
first grade. Then I'd keep on understanding a little more. One day I went to 
school, and I just had this feeling suddenly that I was going to be able to 
accomplish something, after I learned English. I mean, I just had this feeling 
that I could . . . make it. Everything just went real well from there, and when 
I got into the third grade, Mrs. Hatfield really gave me work that challenged 
me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield, a 31-year teaching veteran who retired in June, was teaching a 
combined third- and fourth-grade class when Paul became her pupil. She was 
instrumental in allowing him to skip third grade -- something she said does not 
happen often. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield, who over the years adjusted her teaching style and techniques to 
accommodate students from many different countries, worked with rather than 
against Paul's cultural heritage, seeking to turn what could be a liability 
into an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul is exceptionally interested in history and geography, and with his 
background being Chinese, I had him contribute information about his customs 
and the language," she said. "If we had new students in the school learning 
English, he was used as a tutor. He was really proud of that. He's just the 
neatest kid." 
</P>
<P>
With Paul's academic improvement came a marked social change -- something his 
mother found very interesting, if non-traditional. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the year, he was more shy and quiet, eager to be a good 
citizen," Hatfield recalled. "As the year went on, I saw him change -- you 
might say, become more Americanized. He was more talkative, but I thought that 
was good. Not to the point where he disturbed other students -- just all-boy." 
</P>
<P>
The Americanization of Paul Lin has proved to be both a source of pride and 
some problems, as far as his mother is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased with his progress," said Elizabeth Lin. "But sometimes there is a 
little problem with Paul and Frank, because they do not want to do things in a 
Chinese way. Not really. Sometimes they watch TV too much, and they see 
programs where children get mad at their parents and argue. I think it is good 
for children to talk to their parents, and to say what they are feeling, but 
also I think they must show respect. So sometimes I think they get the wrong 
idea from TV, and sometimes this bothers me a little bit. But I have to 
compromise, too, because we are not in Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
A typical scene in the Lin home finds the kids in the bedroom, doing homework 
while listening to Depeche Mode, while their mother makes dinner in the living 
room, listening to calmer music. The boys also make plenty of time for video 
games and for reading. Both are avid readers, although their mother wishes they 
would read "less fiction." 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, both brothers plan to go to college. Hatfield sees Paul as 
"staying on his present course of hard work and great interest in his studies. 
I don't see him being distracted by his peers in the way that some students 
are." Probably his greatest problem will be what it already has been: coping 
with imperfection. Being dissatisfied with anything less than an A grade is a 
very common Taiwanese attitude, Elizabeth Lin said, and therefore one of Paul's 
biggest problems. During his first two years in school, in fact, not earning an 
A on a test was so frustrating to him that it sometimes produced a tear or two. 
But Paul has since come to understand that "doing your best," as he says, "is 
what counts the most." 
</P>
<P>
"And this year," he said, almost too eagerly, "I get to do sixth-grade math and 
sixth-grade English." 
</P>
<P>
And that is, quite simply, the story of how one boy from Taiwan became an 
average Valley kid. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, right," said Paul Lin, laughing. "Totally awesome! Totally radical, 
dude!"

POLICE OFFICER HOPES RACEHORSE WILL BECOME THE NEXT CITATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He named the horse "Club Dev," after the Devonshire Division of the Los Angeles 
Police Department, but Officer Tom Culotta says there's nothing slow about the 
2-year-old thoroughbred that he and his wife plan to enter in races at 
Hollywood Park next month. 
</P>
<P>
The couple and a professional trainer have put the horse under a rigorous 
conditioning routine, preparing her for the big day when the gates open for her 
first real race at the end of the park's fall-winter meeting in December. 
</P>
<P>
It will also be a big day for Culotta and his fellow officers from the 
Devonshire station in Northridge, who have been waiting for months to see Club 
Dev race. The horse's name is in honor of the many Devonshire Division officers 
who followed Culotta's fascination with horse-racing since he began training 
another of his six horses for the races about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But that horse, Christopher Jones, suffered a leg injury just before she was 
scheduled to race last year, so Culotta decided to try his luck with Club Dev. 
Anticipation is running particularly high because Club Dev had to be withdrawn 
from a race this month when she came down with an infection. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been guys that have discussed whether we should rent a bus and drink 
mint juleps and watch the horse run for the rose," Culotta said. "I've had guys 
tell me they wouldn't put down more than two bucks, and I've had others say 
they'll check their pensions." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not they put any money on the horse, the officers will be rooting 
for Club Dev with the same enthusiasm as big-time betters, Culotta said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't let Club Dev run alone." said Sgt. Tom Wade, Culotta's supervisor and 
the head of the Devonshire station's anti-gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a neat thing to do," said Capt. Mark Stevens, commander of the 
Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
The division's Club Dev monicker originated about eight years ago with a group 
of Devonshire officers who were trying to name a campaign to raise funds for 
athletic facilities at the station, said Sgt. David Johnson. Since then, the 
Devonshire division has become known throughout the department as Club Dev, 
partly because of its modern exercise equipment but mostly because officers 
considered it slow-paced, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Johnson said, "That is sort of a myth. It's not unusual for officers to 
handle 20 radio calls a night. Maybe at one time that might have been true, but 
with the city growing like it is, this is no longer a nice, quiet division." 
</P>
<P>
Culotta said he got the idea for raising a racehorse after he and his wife, 
Zoe, moved to Acton six years ago and started attending auctions for show 
horses, which Zoe used to ride as a youngster. But the more they got into the 
search, the more they became interested in racehorses, eventually buying a 
thoroughbred mare for about $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
They bred the mare with a stallion and raised the foal as a racer, saving the 
expense of buying a trained racehorse, which typically costs between $50,000 
and $60,000, Culotta said. 
</P>
<P>
They managed to get around the prohibitive expense of training a racehorse by 
finding a licensed trainer -- Ian Jory -- who agreed to prepare Club Dev for 
racing in exchange for Zoe Culotta providing free care for other horses at 
Hollywood Park, Culotta said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other requirements, horses must have a licensed trainer before they can 
work out at Hollywood Park and enter the races, park spokesman Craig Peterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for my wife and her knowledge, and the assistance of Ian Jory, I 
could not afford to be here," Culotta said. Jory is in England and could not be 
reached for comment this week. 
</P>
<P>
And if Club Dev fails? "We have small children" with whom the couple would like 
to spend more time, he said. "If she's not successful, we will curtail our 
breeding activities until the children are older." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, losing is the last thing on Culotta's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"She's definitely an eye-catcher at the track," he said. "We think she has 
everything it takes to be a racehorse."

EXPANDING HORIZONS FOR DISABLED STUDENTS

Victor, who is 9 years old and mentally retarded, isn't very attentive in 
class. "Usually he just sits a lot and doesn't do much," said Jane Spicka, who 
works as a teaching assistant at the Fred S. Lull Special Education Center in 
Encino. "Sometimes he can be very violent, kicking and hitting other kids." 
</P>
<P>
But Victor found some peace early this month during a class hike in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. He spent the hour gazing at pine trees, laughing at ducks in 
a pond and holding the hand of his new friend Max, a fourth-grader from Emelita 
Street Elementary School in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea Victor would be so absorbed," Spicka said. "It's a thrill to see 
this reaction." It's also a thrill for the volunteers who lead the nature 
walks. "The students absorb so much more than we'd ever think," said Rosanne 
Sachson, who supervises hikes for special-needs students twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
Sachson is one of 90 volunteer docents for the William O. Douglas Outdoor 
Classroom, a nonprofit environmental organization that offers school programs 
for students throughout Los Angeles and special activities for the physically 
and developmentally disabled. The organization, which owns three acres of land 
in the 300-acre Franklin Canyon area, is financed by public grants and private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
The group also sponsors free hikes, bird-watching tours and geology classes. 
</P>
<P>
Sachson led her group of eight students along a wooded path to a redwood tree. 
While the students sat on logs, she passed around rocks, arrowheads and 
rattlesnake tails. Later, she took the students to the edge of pond and gave 
them pellets to feed three ducks that came waddling onto the shore. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Bateman, who teaches a class of autistic students, said almost all of 
the Lull students are from low-income, inner-city families. Many of them, 
including an autistic girl named Hripsik, cannot speak. 
</P>
<P>
"You know they're getting something out of this," she said, while Hripsik ran 
toward the ducks with a big smile on her face. "Hripsik isn't going to go home 
and say, 'Mom, I saw a pine cone.' But it's opening her mind a little. At least 
she's seeing something other than asphalt."

8-YEAR-OLD LEARNS JOY OF INVENTING; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STUDENT USED LESSONS IN CREATIVE THINKING TO DESIGN A 
'PUDDLE-DETECTING CANE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ARLINGTON, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a wet and windy night when 8-year-old Lillian Lukas had her brainstorm. 
She was out walking with her mother when she noticed a blind person having 
trouble avoiding puddles on the sidewalk. That observation was the beginning of 
what eventually became a prize-winning invention: the "Puddle Detecting Cane." 
</P>
<P>
Her invention was good enough to win Invent-America's nationally sponsored 
competition, and the prototype of her Puddle Detecting Cane is in the 
Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
But just how do you make a puddle-detecting cane? Lillian turned to her dad for 
help. Scott Lukas is a doctor with a strong background in electronics, and he 
got Lillian started with a kit designed to help children understand the basics 
of electronic circuitry. He taught her how to solder and helped with some of 
the sawing and drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian hit on the idea of embedding two electrical contacts in the base of a 
wooden cane. When immersed in water, the contacts complete a circuit, which 
sends a signal up to a buzzer and warns the blind person of a puddle. 
</P>
<P>
Among other entries in the national contest, Lillian's cane competed against a 
motorized wheelchair ramp, a disposable frying pan, musical rain gear and a 
beeper that keeps tabs on wandering toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study released by the Department of Education reports that in math and 
science, children in the United States are lagging behind their counterparts in 
Canada, Great Britain, Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
But don't let the second-graders at the Dallin School in Arlington, Mass., hear 
you say that. That's where Lillian was attending when she developed her 
invention. Thanks to her teacher, Karen Doliber, Lillian got an early start in 
creative thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Doliber uses study guides and information from Invent-America, a national 
educational program that encourages children to think creatively. 
</P>
<P>
"This program really helps the children with their thinking skills," Doliber 
said as she set out a variety of antique tools on a low table for the students 
to examine. There is an ice chipper, a shoe stretcher, a stove-top toaster and 
a portable scale. As the students try to guess the original function of each 
tool, they're learning to analyze, question and think creatively. "Hopefully 
they will take these skills into everyday life, in other problems they will 
have to solve," Doliber said. 
</P>
<P>
She encourages her second-graders to be inventors, too, and in the process 
they're learning a lot more than just creative thinking. "If we start a nation 
of children at a very young age feeling they can make a difference, and they 
develop thinking skills, we may rekindle that spirit of inventing in America," 
Doliber said. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian acknowledges her teacher as the one who got her started inventing. "She 
helped me to keep on trying different ideas -- like if this one didn't work, 
try another one and just add something," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Success in the national contest has resulted in a shelf full of trophies and 
medals. "I won a state and a school award, and then I went to Washington 
because I won the regional," Lillian said. "And I got a trophy for that, and I 
got a gold medal for the national." She even met President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But all the recognition wasn't why she designed the puddle-detecting cane. "I 
just built this to help the blind people. . . . I just want to give the parts 
to the blind schools, and they can make theirs themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Lillian and her father continue to work on improved versions of the cane. 
They're developing a sensor that will work on a folding cane. And they've added 
an additional beeper that goes off if the cane is dropped, to aid in locating 
the cane. 
</P>
<P>
With the contests over, Lillian is back to being just a regular kid, playing 
with her little sister, practicing her violin and working on projects with her

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hard-line Czechoslovak regime cracked under the weight of mass public 
dissent Friday after one of the most extraordinary days in the country's 
postwar history. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day that saw the downfall of repressive Communist leader Milos Jakes 
and the rise of an obscure Politburo member, Karel Urbanek, 48. 
</P>
<P>
Urbanek's appointment as party general secretary followed the mass resignation 
of both the Communist Party's 13-member ruling Politburo and 14 department 
heads who collectively make up the party's Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the day of an emotional reappearance in the capital by Alexander 
Dubcek, the long-disgraced architect of the 1968 "Prague Spring" reform 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
The roar from the 300,000 Czechoslovaks that greeted the former Communist Party 
leader as he emerged onto a fifth-floor balcony overlooking the city's main 
Wenceslas Square seemed to unleash emotions held tight since Soviet and Warsaw 
Pact tanks crushed Dubcek's liberal experiment and the Kremlin installed 
hard-liners 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And it was a day that saw members of the fledgling opposition group Civic Forum 
interrupt their news conference with word that Jakes had resigned. They 
embraced, broke open champagne and listened to their leading spokesman, 
playwright Vaclav Havel, raise his glass and toast, "Long live a free 
Czechoslovakia!" 
</P>
<P>
Friday's developments in Czechoslovakia represent the latest in a series of 
stunning political changes in the Warsaw Pact nations of Eastern Europe -- 
beginning in Poland and Hungary before sweeping through East Germany and 
Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to losing the party leadership, Jakes was thrown out of the 
Politburo and also lost his job as head of the party secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Five other prominent hard-liners were also demoted out of the Politburo, 
including party ideologue Jan Fojtik. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting on the Central Committee seating, secretariat member Zdenek Horeni 
told reporters that the committee declared that a strategy of democratization 
and restructuring is irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
He said the committee also invited organizations from outside the ruling party 
to join in a dialogue to find a political solution to the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee also urged swift action on new laws liberalizing the 
rights of assembly and association and greater press freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
Horeni said that details of this new policy will be fleshed out at a another 
Central Committee meeting to be convened before mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not a total victory for the reformists. Prague party boss Miroslav 
Stepan, the man generally viewed as responsible for last week's police 
crackdown on a student demonstration, kept his post in the Politurbo, while 
reform-minded members including Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec lost their 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believed that Friday's shake-up would not be the end of 
changes in the ruling hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
"Round 2 is coming," said one Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec, the man most analysts believed would succeed Jakes as party secretary, 
resigned both from the Politburo and the prime minister's post. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party Central Committee was meeting into the early 
hours this morning to nominate and elect replacements for a new Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
As news of the Politburo's resignations spread, a party atmosphere swept the 
capital's central area. 
</P>
<P>
People gathered around television sets in storefront windows, smiling, cheering 
and congratulating each other. Car horns honked, and trams rang their bells. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a party. We will be here all night," Andrea Swarc, a Prague 
housewife, said. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Urbanek, a trained economist and former head of the party in the 
Czech republic, came as a surprise. He was mentioned only in passing among 
those awaiting the possible succession to Jakes and was described by one 
political analyst as an ambiguous figure. 
</P>
<P>
"He's someone who at times came out against dissident groups, but not as 
vociferously as others," this analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat here described Urbanek as "benign." 
</P>
<P>
Urbanek's immediate task will be to steer the Communist Party through its 
present crisis and to prepare for negotiations with the opposition -- talks 
that could lead to the diminution of the party's monopoly of power and the 
rebirth of political pluralism in Czechoslovakia. Opposition figures say they 
are determined to remove the constitutional provision that guarantees the 
leading role of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Urbanek's appointment to lead the party was seen as significant for two 
reasons: First, his relative obscurity leaves him untouched by the failure of 
the party's senior leadership -- those in charge during the recent years of 
repression and ineffectual performance as well as during the past week's 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say the population would see him as responsible for something," a 
Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Urbanek can be more easily accepted by the conservative Central 
Committee, even though he has shown tinges of reformism. 
</P>
<P>
Together the Politburo, where Urbanek has served since October, 1988, and the 
Secretariat are the two entities that constitute the country's power center. 
</P>
<P>
"We have failed to justly assess the processes taking place in Poland, Hungary 
and especially in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and their 
influence on our society," Jakes was reported by the Czechoslovak news agency 
CTK as telling the Central Committee in a brutally candid speech before 
resigning. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the political changes in Czechoslovakia have occurred with breathtaking 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
It was only 10 months ago that playwright Havel was arrested for attempting to 
place flowers at the place on Wenceslas Square where Czechoslovak student Jan 
Palach burned himself to death in 1969 to protest the Soviet invasion of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The anniversary of Palach's death has long been a rallying point for the 
opposition movement. This year the demonstrations surrounding the memorial 
observances lasted for five days and were brutally suppressed by police. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the capital was a sea of anti-government graffiti and wall posters, 
many of them supporting a general strike planned for Monday. One major reason 
for Friday's emergency Central Committee meeting and the change in political 
leadership was an attempt to undermine the general strike. 
</P>
<P>
Urbanek has virtually no public profile in the country. In recent times he has 
been in charge of monitoring political reforms and their effect on party 
function, not a job usually considered a power base in the party. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Urbanek has headed a commission dealing with "cadre policy," 
a post dealing with promotions and recruitment matters, both areas that affect 
the future shape of the party membership. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the Politburo's resignation came as leaders of the Civic Forum 
appeared in what has become the opposition's regular evening briefing for the 
international media. As Havel and Vaclav Maly shared microphones with Dubcek -- 
who was explaining that he still believes "socialism is reformable" -- Havel's 
brother Ivan scurried onto the stage and whispered in Vaclav's ear. 
</P>
<P>
After Dubcek finished his answer, through which Havel leaned forward in evident 
tension, the news was announced by an opposition journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, Dubcek, Maly and a student leader jumped to their feet and embraced on 
the stage as cheers broke out from supporters in the crowd. Someone hurried 
forward with a bottle of champagne and glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"Long live a free Czechoslovakia!" shouted Havel, his glass lifted high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mass execution," said a Czechoslovak journalist, grinning and shaking 
his head in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no special illusion about gentlemen who will replace those who have 
just resigned," Havel cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
These men, he said, "were the men who organized a coup and . . . the occupation 
of our country. As long as these people do not return to the Central Committee, 
it means the door has opened and we can take the steps to begin the life of a 
democratic Czechoslovakia."

ARMY MAY BEAR BRUNT OF BUDGET CUTS, CHENEY HINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, providing the first public signal of the Bush 
Administration's priorities in an age of shrinking defense budgets, said Friday 
that the United States must preserve its naval supremacy and modernize its 
strategic nuclear weapons. Implicitly, that could put the burden of budget 
cutting primarily on the Army. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that the role of U.S. ground forces in Europe is "up for grabs," 
Cheney suggested in an interview with The Times that the task of maintaining 
ground forces on the continent could be left to the NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
He called his comments "a reflection of the strategic situation: We are the 
major maritime power, just like the Soviets are a major land-based power." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's remarks came a day after President Bush, in an interview with a group 
of foreign reporters, said the United States will consider reducing its troop 
strength abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a rapidity of change around the world . . . " Bush said. "I'm not 
suggesting that forevermore we'll have the same level of troops anywhere -- 
standing army, Europe, Korea, anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Bush added that the United States is "certainly . . . not going to take 
unilateral action" in withdrawing troops or equipment from the soil of such 
longstanding allies. The transcript of the interview was released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who also stressed that the United States would not act unilaterally in 
revising the NATO balance, said one possible future for NATO would give 
Washington's North Atlantic allies the principal role in defending European 
soil, while the United States would boost naval and air forces in the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"Should the U.S., as some have suggested, take on a role that emphasizes more 
heavily the U.S. obligation in the naval area and in air supremacy and places a 
greater emphasis with our allies in terms of the ground combat role in Europe?" 
posed Cheney. "All of those issues it seems to me are up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
At a later point in the interview, he said: "The U.S. is now and will want to 
continue to be the pre-eminent naval power in the world," even as cuts are made 
in the overall defense budget. In addition, he said that "we're going to want 
to preserve our strategic nuclear capability," adding finally that the 
preservation of adequate conventional forces would be another demand. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's views are consistent with those of many lawmakers and defense 
analysts, who have said that as budgets shrink and the Soviet military threat 
to Western Europe diminishes, the United States may plot a return to an 
American reliance on highly mobile naval forces, which are useful in Third 
World brush fires, and on nuclear systems, which are relatively inexpensive to 
build and operate. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, analysts have widely predicted that the United States would 
scale back the large and costly land armies it has maintained in Europe since 
the onset of the Cold War -- the same prospect raised by the President. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary's comments came as the Pentagon entered a third week of 
what he called a "fascinating" period of budget review. The contingency plans 
ordered by Cheney on Nov. 13 anticipate as much as $200 billion being cut from 
the Pentagon's budget blueprint for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
By ordering the sweeping budget review, Cheney said Friday he hopes he can 
convince his former colleagues on Capitol Hill that he should have the key role 
in shaping the future of U.S. military forces. 
</P>
<P>
After the Thanksgiving break, Cheney -- dressed in a sport shirt and sweater -- 
met with leaders of the military services for the third day on Friday to 
discuss what changes they would make if the Pentagon were to continue the 
budgetary slide of the last five years. One senior Pentagon official present at 
those deliberations said that they have become a "straight, sober assessment" 
of military needs in a time of fiscal retrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
They have also become the forum in which some of the nation's most fundamental 
assumptions have been opened to question. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, has warned 
Cheney and others in those meetings that in accepting future cuts, American 
leaders must define the point at which the United States would relinquish its 
superpower status, according to one participant. 
</P>
<P>
While Cheney appeared to concede Powell's point, he suggested that dire 
foreboding is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an irreducible minimum of defense capability that the United States 
is going to require, no matter what happens in the Soviet Union," Cheney said. 
"We are a superpower, and we're always going to want to have the capacity to 
deploy military force to safeguard American interests and to preserve our 
capacity to influence events in the world." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Cheney cautioned that he is "still a great skeptic" 
on the future of Soviet reform efforts. In directing the preparation of the new 
budget, he conceded that he has relented to congressional and public pressure 
in hopes that the concessions would secure him a principal role in shaping the 
new military order. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think vigilance is the order of the day," Cheney said. "I still think 
we have to be very cautious about assuming that Mr. (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev will 
be successful, or assuming that his successors will be more like him than like 
conventional Soviet leaders -- Brezhnev, Khrushchev, Stalin, etc." 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the low-key Cheney made headlines and staked his position as one 
the Bush Administration's most hawkish voices on Soviet issues when he 
predicted that Gorbachev would fail in his reform efforts and be ousted. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Cheney made clear that his own views on Gorbachev's prospects would 
be clearly expressed in the defense budgets he will send to Congress in the 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get a fundamental shift in Soviet policy, we have to make sure that we 
have protected our (research and development) base," Cheney said. Calling U.S. 
technological advantages over the Soviet Union "absolutely crucial," Cheney 
added: "You've got to structure your investment strategy accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
That strategy may become most evident in the Pentagon's future budget requests 
for the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as "Star Wars." The 
program has been kept in a separate budget account, and contingency plans for 
deep cuts have not been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that "no part of the budget is exempt" from cuts, but he added that 
the "Star Wars" program must continue to investigate a wide range of defensive 
technologies at least until 1994, when the President is scheduled to make a 
decision on whether to deploy a missile shield. 
</P>
<P>
On another high-technology program that has drawn fire from congressional 
critics, Cheney signaled support for the Air Force's planned purchase of 132 
B-2 intercontinental bombers -- at $500 million apiece. But he cautioned that 
Congress has ordered the Pentagon to review the purchase in an effort to reduce 
the cost of the program, and that Defense Department analysts are complying. 
</P>
<P>
While those priorities are likely to draw controversy on Capitol Hill, Cheney 
said he hopes that his realism in facing budget pressures will win him the 
confidence of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we simply say, 'heck no, we're not willing to get a dime out of the defense 
budget,' you lose your credibility with the Congress and with the public," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the way I like to operate," said Cheney, who has won high marks 
from lawmakers for his pragmatic approach to dealing with them. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's willingness to deal with Congress on that footing, as well as his 
desire to review the division of labor within the NATO alliance, is expected to 
win him wide support from defense experts on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a mistake for NATO not to look at increased specializations as we 
come down to lower levels," said Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. "We should not try to do everything." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Cheney called Congress "a major player" in the forthcoming debate 
over the relationship between U.S. forces and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said lawmakers "probably" will be the principal obstacle 
to his efforts to recast the U.S. armed forces into a smaller military force 
that remains as ready to fight as it is today. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a temptation . . . for Congress not to adopt a coherent overall 
strategy of how you spread fewer dollars across significant requirements," he 
said. "Rather there will be those in Congress who will make decisions based 
upon interests back in their district. 
</P>
<P>
"If Congress makes the decisions primarily upon their impact back home rather 
than what our strategic requirements might be, then we're going to end up with 
less capable forces," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
That is a lesson that Cheney, a former Wyoming congressman, has already 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
In his first budget submission, he tried to cancel a Marine aircraft program 
called the tilt-rotor Osprey. The move drew an army of lobbyists and lawmakers 
whose districts stood to benefit from the program, and they succeeded in 
keeping the program alive -- at least for another year. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope we would now shift the debate to what it should have been and 
what it never has been: 'What do we need for national security?' " said Rep. 
Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But, Schroeder added, those larger considerations often are squeezed out by 
congressional concerns over more immediate issues -- for example, job losses 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense bills become public works bills," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That reality has not changed, noted Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a senior 
member of the House Appropriations Committee. "Members who have weapons 
systems, major suppliers in their districts can feel immediate job losses," he 
said. "Despite all the rhetoric, we're not really prepared for economic 
conversion." 
</P>
<P>
And in spite of Cheney's efforts, some members of Congress, including even some 
in Bush's party, made it clear that they are not about to relinquish the last 
word on the shape of the defense budget to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very surprised if this (the budget cutting proposal) is anything more 
than an exercise," Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M) said.

REIGNING ENTREPRENEUR IS SUDDENLY A HUD TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN and JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brentwood multimillionaire A. Bruce Rozet was having a hard time understanding 
why so many officials in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
were saying such nasty things about him. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 20 years, Rozet's firm has done large amounts of business with HUD. 
But now, the agency was attacking the company, threatening to foreclose on two 
large substandard housing projects in California and banning the firm from 
doing new business with HUD for one year in Oklahoma and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm honest. I'm doing the legal thing," Rozet said in an interview, sitting in 
his new Santa Monica office, well-tanned and just back from Europe. "Suddenly," 
he added, "we find ourselves on the receiving end of a lot of noise." 
</P>
<P>
While criminal investigators and congressional committees look into theft and 
political influence at HUD, the troubled housing agency, trying to right 
itself, has homed in on targets of its own -- entrepreneurs who have traded in 
HUD housing. No one has felt HUD's heat more than Rozet and the Associated 
Financial Corp. of which he is chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In Rozet, 61, HUD is taking on perhaps the most prominent and knowledgeable 
entrepreneur in the field. With nearly two decades of experience, he is viewed 
as an expert on low-cost housing by leading lawmakers, including Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.). Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has singled out Associated 
Financial for its low-cost housing expertise. 
</P>
<P>
AFC owns or manages 45,000 units in about 350 housing projects for the poor. 
Its portfolio is worth an estimated $1 billion, making it one of the largest 
private owners of HUD-subsidized and HUD-regulated property. 
</P>
<P>
Things Get Worse 
</P>
<P>
The bad publicity for Rozet started in June when HUD Secretary Jack Kemp toured 
Tyler House, an AFC project of 321 units in Washington, and proclaimed the 
conditions to be "scandalous." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, things have only gotten worse. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, HUD issued one of its most far-reaching sanctions against the firm. 
It barred AFC for a year from buying or taking over management of any 
additional apartments in Washington and adjoining counties. HUD took the action 
after inspectors found leaking sewage and no hot water at the 190-unit Sursum 
Corda Village in Washington and accused the firm of misusing funds intended for 
building upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Charles Ming, the top HUD official in Oklahoma, had taken similar 
action, barring an AFC subsidiary from doing new business there for a year. HUD 
seized three of AFC's six projects in Oklahoma, calling them crime-ridden slums 
and citing default on mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Robert J. De Monte, HUD's Western regional director, has begun 
foreclosure proceedings on Geneva Towers, a 573-unit project in San Francisco 
in which AFC has an interest. Among the problems at the 20-story twin towers, 
besides graffiti and drug dealing, were dozens of fire code violations, 
corrected only after the city brought suit last year. Elevators rarely work, 
causing tenants to kick doors and walls in frustration, further contributing to 
the project's run-down condition, according to the building manager. 
</P>
<P>
De Monte also has requested authority from Washington to seize another AFC 
project, Ujima Village, in Willowbrook, just south of Watts. Besides being more 
than $2 million in default on its mortgage, Ujima chronically suffers from 
broken stairs, falling plaster, leaking roofs and unkempt grounds, according to 
HUD inspectors. Inspection reports note that tenants regularly endure long 
delays before repairs are made or worn out household appliances are replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Keating, HUD general counsel, said Kemp is investigating why privately 
owned projects are having such troubles, and he has created a Troubled Project 
Task Force that will tackle the most obvious cases first. Four AFC projects -- 
two in Washington and two in Oklahoma -- are "at the very top of the task force 
list," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why some (of AFC's) projects are run very capably and some aren't, we do not 
know, but Jack Kemp's view is that housing for poor persons should not be 
Beirut after the bombings," Keating said. "The hot water (at Sursum Corda) was 
broken for five months and not repaired. You can't blame that on drug dealers. 
. . . And Tyler House is an absolute wreck." 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials say they considered but rejected the most severe action they 
could take against AFC -- permanently barring the firm from doing business with 
the agency. HUD is not equipped to assume management of AFC's projects, and 
agency officials say that many are running well. 
</P>
<P>
"Some properties that are managed by AFC are operating efficiently and 
effectively," De Monte said in an interview. "For HUD to take extreme actions 
that would jeopardize those properties would not be smart." Rather, he said, he 
prefers "the water-torture technique," taking action against troubled projects 
one by one. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, Rozet maintained that AFC's problem projects are isolated. He 
vowed to fight the action against AFC in Washington, and charged that it is 
"clearly a continuation of the harassment of us, in keeping with Jack Kemp's 
pronouncement that he is going to make it difficult for us to do business." 
</P>
<P>
Rozet places the blame for problems at projects such as Geneva Towers on 
partners over whom he had no control. At other troubled projects, such as Tyler 
House, Rozet said, HUD has refused to fund renovations. 
</P>
<P>
He said the HUD money that might have gone toward upkeep at needy projects went 
instead to political friends of the previous HUD administration run by Samuel 
R. Pierce Jr. And, Rozet said, many of the projects deteriorated after the 
onslaught of crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
He insists that his one overriding goal is to provide decent housing for poor 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect," Rozet said, "I am on De Monte's side. . . . Bob doesn't understand 
where I'm coming from. Maybe someday he will." 
</P>
<P>
AFC's rough handling by HUD under Kemp contrasts sharply with the treatment it 
received during the previous eight years. During that time, AFC and its 
subsidiaries bought up hundreds of HUD projects and gained millions in HUD 
subsidies though grants, low-interest loans and forgiven debts. 
</P>
<P>
In those years, Rozet's prestige grew. He was frequently called to testify in 
Congress as a housing expert, and "is from my experience one of the few most 
knowledgeable people about public policy (affecting housing for the poor)," 
said Donald Campbell, chief staff member on the Senate housing subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Jackson tapped him for his California presidential campaign committee 
last year and Rozet proved an effective fund-raiser in Jackson's bid for the 
Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet's prestige also extends to his own back yard. Mayor Bradley, speaking at 
gatherings in April and May, urged corporate leaders to finance badly needed 
low-cost housing. AFC was one of two firms the mayor said could put together 
such deals, according to a banker who attended. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley made the recommendation after a visit from former City Councilman David 
Cunningham. Cunningham, senior vice president of a firm owned by Stephen D. 
Moses, a long-time associate of Rozet's, told The Times that he and Moses asked 
Bradley to encourage corporate investors to put money into low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the mayor said Bradley does not know Rozet but had been 
informed that AFC could help local corporations invest in housing for the poor, 
an issue in which Bradley has been taking increasing interest. 
</P>
<P>
Past Troubles 
</P>
<P>
Despite plaudits from elected officials and the problems with HUD that have 
surfaced only recently, Rozet's past is not trouble-free. The HUD inspector 
general paid particular attention to his firms in the late 1970s and early 
'80s. At the time, agents were trying to decipher what they believed was an 
effort by syndicators of HUD property to profit by flipping and trading housing 
projects among one another. The agents drew up a wall-sized chart with the 
names of people and companies involved in HUD property sales. At the top was 
Rozet. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was part of a major scheme," said a top investigator, who has 
since left the agency and spoke on condition that he not be identified. "They 
were slick. They were well-heeled. They were well-protected. We could never 
prove it (any fraud against HUD)." 
</P>
<P>
AFC lawyer Donald Spiegelman bristles at the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't an iota of fact," he said in an interview. "That some guy making 
$20,000 a year with the imagination of an ant wants to make a charge is of no 
interest to me. . . . What's he doing for housing, sitting there behind his 
badge throwing darts?" 
</P>
<P>
Spiegelman maintains that as Congress continues to investigate HUD, the agency 
is trying to shift blame away from itself and onto private owners such as those 
in AFC "because they're rich and they're landlords." 
</P>
<P>
As Rozet tells it, he fills a niche. Few businessmen get involved in his 
specialty -- privately owned but HUD subsidized and regulated housing projects, 
many of them troubled. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody would like to step up to do this," Rozet said, "we would be 
delighted to see it. We are not trying to be exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
The business of Associated Financial Corp. is varied. One enterprise is to buy 
housing projects through syndication. The firm finds investors and forms 
limited partnerships that buy the projects as tax shelters. Tax laws allow 
investors to put money into housing for the poor and take full tax credits, 
meaning off-the-top reductions of taxes owed. 
</P>
<P>
AFC also acts as a consultant in structuring deals for other syndicators. 
Additionally, the AFC subsidiary, Housing Resources Management, is property 
manager of about 100 HUD projects. 
</P>
<P>
Risky Investment 
</P>
<P>
In statements to prospective investors, AFC says the return in tax savings can 
be high, 18.5% or more of an investment under current law. But the investment 
is risky. Investors face fat tax bills if HUD steps in and forecloses, either 
because of nonpayment of mortgages or failure to maintain proper upkeep. AFC 
recently disclosed in a prospectus to investors that one in 10 of its 
partnerships had fallen into bankruptcy or run into other difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
For its services, the firm charges hefty fees. A General Accounting Office 
report on fees charged by 19 firms involved in syndication of HUD property said 
that AFC takes 33% of the money it collects from investors when pooling funds 
to purchase a project -- more than all but one of the companies surveyed and 
above the 26.5% average fee charged by syndicators. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp has proposed some controls on the profits reaped by syndicators. As the 
law stands, HUD has no method of regulating the profit margins of private 
operators who deal in HUD property. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a place for profit-making owners," De Monte said, noting that 
nonprofit entities have run many a HUD project into the ground. "Profit is not 
a dirty word. But you have to pay more attention to how they make their profits 
and how significant their profits are." 
</P>
<P>
Rozet first became involved in low-income housing in 1972 when he formed a 
company, Income Equities Fund, in Los Angeles. In 1977, he ran afoul of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC sued, alleging that Income Equities 
made false statements to investors in its housing syndication deals. Rozet 
settled the suit by admitting no wrongdoing, but agreeing to abide by a 
lifetime ban on acting as a securities broker-dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet re-emerged in the 1980s. And despite Reagan Administration cuts in the 
housing budget and changes in tax law that forced many syndicators out of 
low-income housing, Rozet fared well. In 1987, he bought a home in Brentwood. 
Valued at upward of $5 million, the house has a remote-controlled back-yard 
waterfall and a master bedroom that takes up an entire floor. In its July 
issue, Los Angeles Magazine featured the home, calling it the epitome of 
interior designer Waldo Fernandez's work. At the family's request, a source at 
the magazine said, the article did not mention Rozet's line of work. 
</P>
<P>
The early and mid-1980s were especially bullish for Associated Financial and 
its affiliates. "Rozet hired a huge group of agents, even in Alaska, to comb 
the country and find housing projects" to buy, a former employee said. 
</P>
<P>
Buying up projects, sometimes dozens at a time, the Southern California 
entrepreneurs convinced HUD officials that the investment capital they 
commanded would mean improved living conditions for the thousands of tenants 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are very smart and very creative and very aggressive. Working 
within a federal bureaucracy that doesn't have the same expertise, generally 
they win," said Thomas Demery, assistant secretary for housing from 1986 to 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Without AFC, Demery said, HUD would have been forced to take over the projects 
and that would have been costly. So the agency agreed to the deals, often 
committing itself to increased rents and management fees, or loans. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative is to let these things go down the drain," Demery said. "They 
would come to HUD and say, 'You may not like this deal, but it is a deal that 
is better than the alternative,' and they were right." 
</P>
<P>
One of AFC's main investor finders was Charles Bazarian, 51. Bazarian, a 
one-time nightclub owner, got into the HUD housing business after a 1978 
federal insurance fraud conviction in his adopted hometown of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet met Bazarian through Rozet's associate, Stephen Moses. Moses had been in 
Oklahoma buying projects when a HUD official introduced him to Bazarian, Moses 
said. At the time, Moses said, he was not aware of Bazarian's criminal record 
and assumed he was a legitimate businessman, given the introduction from HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Bazarian's relationship with the Californians soon blossomed. He traversed the 
country locating financially troubled housing projects that Rozet's firm could 
buy. In the process, he gained wide access to top HUD officials. The HUD 
inspector general suspected that Bazarian's access was too good, and opened an 
investigation to determine whether he improperly influenced HUD officials. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation ended in 1982 with no charges. But with his reputation 
tarnished, Bazarian gave up working as a finder. But he soon found a more 
lucrative line. In 1983, he created a loan brokerage firm, CB Financial Corp., 
and began loaning money to real estate syndicators to finance acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
AFC was one of Bazarian's main clients, obtaining as much as $40 million in 
loans, Sigmund Kohnen, president of CB Financial from 1983 until 1986 and a 
former lawyer for Rozet, told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Bazarian's empire was on shaky ground, and his firm collapsed in 1987 with $133 
million in debt, according to its bankruptcy in Oklahoma City. Bazarian's 
troubles have not ended. In September, he pleaded guilty to federal charges of 
skimming $97,000 from two HUD projects in Oklahoma -- including one that is in 
AFC's inventory. AFC was not accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Pleaded Guilty 
</P>
<P>
Bazarian also pleaded guilty to fraud in obtaining $9 million in loans from two 
Orange County thrifts -- Consolidated Savings Banks and American Diversified 
Savings Bank. As collateral, the charges said, he used promissory notes from an 
AFC subsidiary. In pleading guilty, he admitted knowing that the notes were 
"virtually worthless." Again, AFC was not accused of complicity. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the guy enough to know that he was involved in doing some things, but 
we never gave him false paper," Rozet said. 
</P>
<P>
That AFC was associated with Bazarian is not a fact widely known among 
officials who call upon Rozet for his advice in the field of low-cost housing 
for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Cranston, for one, explained: "We don't have any way of checking up on 
everybody who comes in." Cranston and Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) are 
carrying legislation that Cranston described as the Senate's main HUD reform 
package this year. Rozet served on a committee that recommended the contents of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has been the main beneficiary of AFC's campaign donations. Rozet and 
Deane Earl Ross, who each own one-third of AFC, raised almost $20,000 for 
Cranston's 1986 reelection campaign. Rozet and Ross gave another $10,000 to one 
of Cranston's political action committees last year. Others associated with 
AFC, including Louis A. Cicalese, a Philadelphia lawyer who owns the remaining 
third of AFC, have given lesser amounts to Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
"I have supported Alan Cranston for 20 years," Rozet said. Cranston has been 
open to his suggestions, Rozet added. "What is important is to have input into 
the legislative process." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Rozet was especially active in Washington in 1986, when 
Congress took on tax reform. The tax code revision eliminated many deductions, 
including one that allowed write-offs for investments in housing for low-income 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet worked hard for the alternative -- housing tax credits. HUD leadership, 
tenants' advocates and elected officials in both parties support the concept of 
housing tax credits. One of the few tax shelters left, housing tax credits 
ensure that investors will continue to pump money into low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
The law creating housing tax credits is due to expire in 1990. Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) are 
carrying widely supported legislation to extend the housing tax credits 
indefinitely. Rozet served on the committee appointed by Mitchell and Danforth 
that issued a report in January recommending the shape of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Syndication was easier under the old tax code, when wealthy investors could 
reap 100% return on their money over the life of the investment. But while the 
tax law revision ended the high-flying days for AFC, and many HUD syndicators, 
AFC retains a portfolio of 350 projects. One way it can profit is to sell the 
properties. And that is what AFC is trying to do with Ujima Village, the 
troubled project south of Watts. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale goes through, Ujima will have gone full circle, from nonprofit 
ownership to for-profit ownership and back again. 
</P>
<P>
Like many projects now held by AFC, Ujima's construction was sponsored by a 
nonprofit corporation intent on housing the poor. HUD insured the mortgage. The 
townhouse development opened with great fanfare in 1973. As envisioned, 
low-income people would be living there in safe, suburban-like surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, however, the nonprofit corporation had fallen $2 million 
behind in its mortgage. In 1982, Ujima became one of a block of 66 projects, 
all in rough neighborhoods or in financial trouble, that were bought by Stephen 
D. Moses, the housing investor who recently served as the go-between for AFC 
and Mayor Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"It needed normal renovations that weren't being done . . . but it was not a 
horrible environment," Moses recalled. Moses planned to use the proceeds from 
syndication to upgrade the project. But in 1984, Moses sold Ujima to another 
HUD syndicator, who in turn sold it to AFC in 1985. Shortly afterward, AFC's 
subsidiary, Housing Resources, took over the daily management. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, as ownership changed hands, HUD records show that conditions in 
the project deteriorated. Previously, Ujima was "really nice," recalled one 
tenant leader. But the 300-unit complex began sliding into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
To help pay for much-needed upkeep, HUD granted several rent hikes. But while 
rent for a one-bedroom apartment went from $270 monthly to $408 between 1984 
and 1987, HUD inspectors on annual visits to Ujima rated its maintenance 
"unsatisfactory" in 1986, 1987 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the run-down condition of the buildings, HUD called for repairs to 
deteriorating carports, driveways and yards where barren patches of dirt had 
replaced swings sets and grass. 
</P>
<P>
"The owners have not made a capital contribution in three years to meet the 
financial and physical needs of the project," Benjamin F. Bobo, HUD's manager 
in Los Angeles, wrote earlier this year in his foreclosure recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet and Moses say much of the deterioration occurred after crack cocaine 
dealers overwhelmed the project and AFC was forced to pour available resources 
into security. In addition, previous management companies had put off routine 
maintenance, creating problems that he inherited, Rozet said. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet said he doubts HUD will foreclose on the project and, for all its tough 
talk, the agency has limited leverage. In order to seize Ujima, HUD by law must 
produce more rental subsidy money. The well for such subsidies is dry, says 
regional HUD director De Monte. 
</P>
<P>
As HUD officials in Washington conduct a closed-door debate on whether to 
foreclose on Ujima Village, AFC has proposed another in several plans over the 
years to upgrade the project and save it from government seizure, all requiring 
major federal bailouts. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet is now asking HUD to forgive an $800,000 debt. AFC also wants HUD to 
support its application for a rehabilitation loan of $2 million from the state 
of California. If HUD forgives the debt and AFC gets the loan, the firm will 
sell Ujima to a nonprofit corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet is convinced that HUD will come around to his view. In the end, he 
predicted: "Ujima will in fact be a banner project and you and I can go to the 
ribbon-cutting. . . . It will be an example of what can be done in 
South-Central to curing (drug) trafficking."

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in four decades of residential segregation with no 
exceptions, the South African government on Friday declared four tracts of land 
legally open to people of all races. 
</P>
<P>
Among the areas is Cape Town's historic District 6, which has stood mostly 
vacant and weed-covered since a vibrant, mixed-race community of 60,000 was 
forcibly evicted 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving people an option," Planning Minister Hernus Kriel said in 
announcing the decision. Kriel called the creation of some integrated 
residential areas "part of the solution" to South Africa's racial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will be proof of the government's serious attempt to normalize a 
lot of situations in our country," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the government of President Frederik W. de Klerk has said it 
remains committed to racially separate neighborhoods for those who want them, 
so only a few areas are likely to be opened by the Free Settlement Areas Act, 
passed by Parliament earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1950 Group Areas Act, a legal pillar of apartheid, neighborhoods are 
strictly divided into white, black, mixed-race and Indian. The free settlement 
act added a non-racial, or "open areas," category and established a government 
board to do the choosing with presidential approval. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal opponents of the government criticized the move as a half-measure that 
will cause more problems than it solves in a country with a severe housing 
shortage for the 26-million-member black majority and a housing surplus for the 
5-million-member white minority. 
</P>
<P>
"While welcoming any move away from racially zoned areas, we cannot admit to 
being ecstatic," said Cas Coovadia of ACTSTOP, a group formed to stop black 
evictions from white areas. "Opening up pockets of land, surrounded by 
(segregated) areas, only exacerbates an already critical situation." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative white opponents of the government, who advocate a return to strict 
apartheid, called the government's move "disgraceful." A week earlier, De Klerk 
enraged right-wing whites by declaring South Africa's remaining segregated 
beaches open to all races and promising to do away with a law that allows 
municipalities to segregate their recreation halls, parks and other public 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible that a white government can overrule or push their fellow whites 
into such a bad position," said Gideon Fourie, spokesman for the town council 
of Boksburg, an industrial community near Johannesburg. The council is ruled by 
the Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
One of the areas ordered open was Boksburg's Windmill Park, where fewer than 50 
of 270 residential plots have been developed. The Boksburg council tried to 
drive away 10 Indian residents of Windmill Park earlier this year by cutting 
off their water. 
</P>
<P>
Also opened was Warwick Avenue Triangle, in the Indian Ocean port city of 
Durban, where a poverty-stricken squatter community of about 500 Indian and 
mixed-race families now live, and Countryview, an undeveloped area north of 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The government has called the Free Settlement Act one of the most important 
social and economic reforms. So far the Free Settlement Board has rejected 
seven applications for open areas and is considering 25 others. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid groups say the law is a weak attempt to appease government 
critics while maintaining the essence of residential apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
They also point out that the new law has several loopholes. It makes no 
provision, for example, for open public schools, which remain segregated by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
And the voting status of residents of open areas remains questionable. 
Race-based voter rolls deny the black majority a say in national affairs, while 
whites, Indians and mixed-race Coloreds elect separate chambers of Parliament. 
Because there is no "open" chamber of Parliament, whites, Indians and Coloreds 
moving into an open area might be forced to forfeit their right to vote for 
national representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Settlement Board has not yet acted on the most sensitive whites-only 
urban areas, such as Hillbrow and Mayfair in Johannesburg and Woodstock in Cape 
Town, where tens of thousands of blacks now live illegally. The government has 
not been able to enforce residential segregation in these so-called "gray 
areas" because of insufficient housing in black townships. 
</P>
<P>
The once densely populated working-class neighborhood known as District 6, a 
220-acre area in the shadow of downtown Cape Town, was bulldozed between 1966 
and 1969 when the government declared it a white residential area. The scarred 
tract became a symbol of the government's policy of forcible removal, and 
developers were unwilling to rebuild it. All that remains there today are 
several churches and a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum of Southern Africa, which has offered to finance 
redevelopment of District 6 if it were opened to all races, said in a statement 
from Cape Town on Friday that the government's decision confirmed a willingness 
"to heed the cry to end racial discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
But the firm said it will not proceed with development plans until the 
government agrees to reopen more neighborhoods. Company Chairman Ian Sims 
declared as unacceptable "the belief that one small section can be opened to 
all races while surrounded by segregated areas. Open areas must be the rule, 
rather than the exception."

East German secret agents posing as refugees have infiltrated West Germany in 
recent weeks, taking cover in the massive influx of East Germans to the West, a 
West German magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
A West German federal court on Nov. 15 charged one East German national with 
espionage after his arrival in West Germany via Czechoslovakia, the magazine 
Bunte said. 
</P>
<P>
Bunte quoted federal police as saying the East German, who has confessed to 
being a spy, swam across the Danube River -- which forms part of the border 
between Czechoslovakia and Austria -- together with six other East German 
intelligence agents. 
</P>
<P>
West German authorities believe East German secret police took advantage of the 
mass exodus of East Germans, who sometimes had to leave all of their 
identification papers behind, and sent numerous spies to West Germany posing as 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Bunte said the agent, whose identity was not revealed, entered West Germany 
using a false identity card.

EAST GERMANY'S LEADER MOVES -- BUT CANNOT HIDE HIS ELITIST PAST

<P>
When Communist Party leader Egon Krenz invited a television team into his 
bungalow in the Pankow district of the capital, he and his wife, Erika, 
emphasized the down-to-earth nature of their modest, six-room home. 
</P>
<P>
But during the program they admitted they had moved into Pankow, an ordinary 
neighborhood, only the day before -- and did not point out they had moved from 
the elite, guarded suburb of Wandlitz, a fancy retreat for senior Communist 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview, Erika Krenz acknowledged they had lived in Wandlitz, 
where deposed leader Erich Honecker also lives, and added, "We would have 
stayed in Wandlitz if we'd always wanted to be surrounded by guards, but that 
was no life." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it must have seemed like a pretty good life for the many years the Krenzes 
lived in Wandlitz luxury before they suddenly moved earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Wandlitz has now become something of a dirty name, and East German TV, after 
being refused admission to the compound, entered this week to show East Germans 
how their leaders lived. 
</P>
<P>
The camera zoomed over a heated swimming pool with a solarium, Western-made 
washing machines and various exotic fruits on shelves -- all items unavailable 
to more than 90% of East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
And the camera crew surprised 77-year-old Kurt Hager, who was fired as 
Politburo ideology chief in the massive shake-up last month, as he took a walk. 
Obviously startled, he said, "It's a rare event to meet any outsiders in 
Wandlitz." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why Communist leaders resided in luxury while many workers lived in 
depressing slums, he answered defensively: "I was never convinced that it was 
necessary for us to live here and nowhere else. But we had to bend to the 
orders of the party." 
</P>
<P>
The party has claimed that its leaders needed the protection of what Hager 
called an "internment camp" for their security after the bloody 1956 uprising 
against Communist rule in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent days, the Communist leaders seem to be attacking their own: The 
fact that on Thursday, Honecker was singled out for investigation is a sign, 
diplomatic observers here say, that the members of the old regime will be 
discredited and disgraced, as were the Stalinists under Soviet reformist 
successors. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Communist leaders, in addition to badly managing the economy, have 
lived well while their countrymen subsisted frugally, suffering their lot in 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their luxury homes, they were chauffeured around in imported 
Volvo limousines while others waited a dozen years for a small Trabant car; 
they shopped at special stores laden with foreign goods not available to other 
East Germans, and they took special vacations at villas and fine hotels by the 
Baltic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the Communist Party has singled out a main scapegoat: former 
Politburo member Guenter Mittag, who was responsible for the overall economy. 
Mittag is a ready victim, as is Honecker. But others will be blamed -- not only 
in the capital but also in provincial towns. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz has tried to distance himself from popular backlash against Communist 
leaders. But observers say that it is apparent to all is that for years, Krenz 
was Honecker's chief henchman -- and that that is why he succeeded Honecker. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, Krenz was overseer of the state security apparatus, the feared 
and hated Stasi, whose thugs terrorized East Germans with midnight knocks on 
the door and repressive blacklists. 
</P>
<P>
It is Krenz who is associated in the minds of ordinary East Germans with the 
rigged local elections last May. And it was Krenz who backed the bloody 
Communist repression in Beijing last June. 
</P>
<P>
So when Krenz says that the Communist Party congress next month will "put the 
whole truth on the table," the chief victim of that truth-telling may well be 
Egon Krenz.

JAPAN TURNS TO EUROPE, OKS $150-MILLION LOAN FOR POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a modest departure from its traditional pattern of distributing foreign aid, 
Japan announced Friday that it will contribute a $150-million loan to a 
multinational plan aimed at stabilizing the Polish economy. 
</P>
<P>
The loan is Japan's first firm commitment to providing economic assistance for 
Eastern Europe since Poland, Hungary and other Communist countries in the 
region began a recent wave of political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan rivals the United States as the world's leading donor of foreign 
aid -- with a budget of about $10 billion a year -- it places priority on 
assisting the developing nations of Asia, a region where it casts itself in a 
strategic role. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tokyo government sees the success of economic reforms in Eastern Europe 
as "indispensable for stabilization of the European situation and of East-West 
relations in general, with important consequences on the stability in the 
Asia-Pacific region as well," Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama said. 
</P>
<P>
The loan to Poland, offered through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund 
(OECF), will be part of a larger package of loans and grants offered by the 
United States and other industrialized nations in response to a Polish plea for 
an infusion of $1 billion to build hard-currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The United States will contribute a $200-million grant to Poland, while West 
Germany has pledged $200 million in loans, according to Foreign Ministry 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's contribution was unveiled simultaneously in Tokyo and Brussels as part 
of a larger package of Japanese measures aimed at assisting both Poland and 
Hungary, such as extending conventional credits through the Japan Export-Import 
Bank and providing emergency food aid and technical cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 24 industrialized nations are meeting in Brussels, 
deliberating on ways to aid Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Final terms of Japan's $150-million loan have yet to be worked out, and its 
payment will be made only on the condition that Poland and the International 
Monetary Fund work out an agreement for a structural adjustment plan, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The loan will be yen-denominated but "untied," meaning it will not be 
restricted to the financing of commodity imports from Japan, said Kenzo Oshima, 
director of the Foreign Ministry's aid policy division. He said the interest 
rate is likely to be slightly less than 3% with a payback period of 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Japan first pledged to contribute toward an economic package for Poland and 
Hungary in July, during the economic summit of industrialized nations in Paris, 
but has been slow to disclose details amid reports of bureaucratic infighting 
over the appropriate level of aid. 
</P>
<P>
In principle, Japan does not regard Poland or Hungary as suitable recipients 
under its Official Development Assistance guidelines because the per capita 
income in those countries is relatively high -- slightly less than $2,000 a 
year for Poland in 1987, the most recent year for which World Bank figures are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Japan is reluctantly following the lead of the United States in 
joining the economic assistance program rather than significantly redefining 
its priorities in foreign aid. Japan is offering Poland a loan instead of a 
grant, which would not require repayment, because officials deemed this a more 
"appropriate" gesture, Oshima said. 
</P>
<P>
"It cannot be denied -- that part of the world (Eastern Europe) is remote," 
Oshima said. "It is not something like China or Korea to Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu reportedly plans to visit Eastern Europe in 
January, shortly before he is expected to dissolve the lower house of 
Parliament and call a general election. Some pundits speculate that Kaifu hopes 
to use such a trip to boost the popularity of his new administration by playing 
the role of statesman. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no indications, however, that Kaifu made any personal efforts 
to advocate an economic package for Poland or Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The only precedent for Japan's dispersing foreign aid in Eastern Europe, Oshima 
said, was an OECF loan to Bulgaria in 1975 for 4.8 billion yen -- worth about 
$34.3 million at today's exchange rates but of considerably less value at that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, meanwhile, has been beset by Poland's inability to repay its foreign 
debt since the 1970s. Oshima estimated Poland is in as much as $1 billion in 
arrears to the Japan Export-Import Bank and to private Japanese creditors. As 
part of the new package, the Japanese government hopes to resume coverage under 
international export and investment insurance programs, for which Poland was 
disqualified in 1981.

Dutch police have raided a large drug laboratory in the southern Netherlands, 
seizing 4.7 gallons of amphetamine oil and arresting four people, a spokesman 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The oil, used to make amphetamine powder, could have produced illegal drugs 
with a street value of about $300,000, the spokesman said.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA -- A LOOK BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1946 
</P>
<P>
May -- The Communist rise to power in Czechoslovakia begins with elections. The 
party wins 114 of 300 seats in Parliament and dominates the resulting coalition 
government. 
</P>
<P>
1948 
</P>
<P>
May -- Popular sentiment turns against the party, but before scheduled 
elections, the Communist leadership reorganizes the government in an effective 
Communist revolution that established a repressive Stalinist system. 
</P>
<P>
1968 
</P>
<P>
January -- Alexander Dubcek is appointed Communist Party leader amid growing 
anti-Soviet sentiment as a result of alleged economic exploitation. He is known 
as a bold reformer. 
</P>
<P>
April to June -- Dubcek prods the party to adopt a program to restore a measure 
of democracy but runs afoul of Moscow. Dubcek is then asked to abandon his 
"Prague Spring" reforms, but refuses. 
</P>
<P>
August -- Soviet troops, with token units from other Warsaw Pact countries, 
enter the country on the night of Aug. 20-21 and effectively crush the reform 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
1969 
</P>
<P>
April -- Dubcek is replaced by Gustav Husak. 
</P>
<P>
1970 
</P>
<P>
June -- Dubcek is expelled from the party and goes on to live in virtual 
seclusion in his native Bratislava, working as a low-level employee of the 
state forestry services. 
</P>
<P>
1987 
</P>
<P>
Spring -- With the rise to power in the Soviet Union of President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, and his declaration of economic and political reforms, Husak 
grudgingly accepts the need for some changes at home. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dubcek cautiously returns to the public eye. He appears on Hungarian 
television, accusing former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev of deceiving him 
before the 1968 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
December -- Husak retires as party chief and is succeeded by Milos Jakes. Jakes 
is seen as a bureaucrat and party functionary whose speeches and personality 
make little or no public impact. It was Jakes, however, who presided over the 
purge of about 500,000 rank-and-file party members, including Dubcek, after the 
1968 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
1988 
</P>
<P>
Jakes refuses dialogue with a growing number of independent political groups, 
although signs of discontent grow as the whirlwind reforms in East Europe blow 
across Czechoslovakia's borders.

Lithuania has taken another step toward breaking away from the Soviet Union by 
setting up a commission to study how to restore its statehood, local 
journalists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The "Parliamentary Commission to Achieve Lithuanian Independence" was formed at 
a meeting of the republic's Parliament on Thursday, the journalists said by 
telephone from Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. 
</P>
<P>
The move defied Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has said that 
secession by republics, although permitted by the Soviet constitution, is 
politically out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in Lithuania about independence as a goal," a correspondent 
with Radio Vilnius said. "The question is how to achieve it." 
</P>
<P>
The commission was charged with preparing a parliamentary program to determine 
how best to restore the independent statehood Lithuania enjoyed from 1918 to 
1940.

DIPLOMACY: MAZOWIECKI CONFERS WITH SOVIET LEADER IN MOSCOW. BOTH SIDES PROMISE 
TO CONTINUE GOOD RELATIONS.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, reiterating the Kremlin's acceptance of 
freely elected governments in Eastern Europe, told Poland's non-Communist prime 
minister Friday that Moscow wishes him and Solidarity success in transforming 
the Polish political and economic system. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people may consider it strange that I want to wish you success, but, in 
fact, I do wish you success -- luck," Gorbachev told Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, a veteran of Poland's Solidarity union movement. "I think that no 
less do we want the government, the nation, the nation close to us to be 
successful and the government to rule successfully." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist to head an East Bloc regime in more than 40 
years, assured Gorbachev in reply that the Soviet Union could continue to count 
on Poland as an ally in the Warsaw Pact and in the Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance, or Comecon, the Communist trading bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes that are taking place in our country do not alter the 
international obligations of Poland, and nobody should see a threat in them," 
Mazowiecki said, according to the Polish news agency PAP. "On the contrary, 
they contribute to the stability of Europe and strengthen us as a reliable and 
solid partner." 
</P>
<P>
As precise as a minuet, the careful statements reflected Poland's transition 
from a political, military and economic vassal of the Soviet Union into a state 
whose sovereignty is fully recognized but whose nationalism, often headstrong 
and reckless in the past, is being expressed with a new understanding of the 
international order. 
</P>
<P>
Against the background of the dramatic and rapid developments across most of 
Eastern Europe, Gorbachev's remarks to Mazowiecki took on even greater 
significance in setting forth the relationship that the Soviet Union hopes to 
develop not just with Poland but also with Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and 
possibly Czechoslovakia as their leaderships change. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have different views. Our experience of life differs, as do our 
philosophies and political orientations," Gorbachev told the new Polish prime 
minister, according to a report by the official Soviet news agency Tass. "But 
the realization of the most important fact that the Soviet Union and Poland are 
both interested in good neighborly relations creates a basis for mutual 
understanding on a broad range of issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Respecting the choice by the Polish people on the course of their development, 
the Soviet side is very open for close interaction with the new Polish 
leadership as well as all Polish political forces, public and religious 
figures, trade unions and other democratic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Such interaction, with respect for the sovereignty of both countries, their 
national dignity and independence, will further promote the successful solution 
of complex tasks." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, outlining what may become the new basis of ties among the socialist 
countries of Eastern Europe, spoke of the similar problems that countries as 
diverse as Poland, the Soviet Union and the region's smaller nations experience 
as they reform their political, economic and social systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, our ideas on how to solve the problems differ in many respects, but 
this is a stimulus rather than an obstacle for fruitful contacts," Gorbachev 
said. He again stressed Moscow's commitment to the freedom of each socialist 
party to chart its own course, even while continuing a dialogue with other 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
As both men made clear, the most sensitive issue remains the question of German 
reunification -- how, where and at what cost? 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that the major changes now occurring in Eastern Europe 
and across the Continent as a whole should be organically combined with the 
preservation of stability, because any disruption could throw Europe back many 
years," Gorbachev warned. 
</P>
<P>
Key leaders in the West have declared that they will not take advantage of the 
developments in Eastern Europe to revive the old confrontation. But Gorbachev 
and Mazowiecki expressed continuing concern in a communique, warning about an 
apparent urge among many Germans to reunite East and West Germany and change 
Europe's postwar borders. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Mazowiecki discussed the broad changes under way in Eastern 
Europe -- particularly the dramatic developments in East Germany -- as well as 
the Soviet-American summit meeting off Malta next weekend, when discussion of 
Eastern Europe is expected to figure significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, a devout Roman Catholic who spent more than a year in prison for 
his support of the Solidarity movement, also spoke to Gorbachev about Pope John 
Paul II, an old friend from his days as editor of a Catholic weekly in Poland. 
Mazowiecki had been to Rome to see the Pope recently. 
</P>
<P>
On his first visit to the Soviet Union as prime minister, Mazowiecki felt the 
two-hour session had gone very well, the Polish government spokeswoman, 
Malgorzata Niezabitowska, said. "The (prime minister) is very, very satisfied 
with these talks," she added. "They were very, very open, broad and friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is "very interested in and knows a lot about Poland," she quoted 
Mazowiecki as saying, "and he approaches the country with understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader had told Mazowiecki that the philosophy of "new political 
thinking," which has become the basis for Moscow's foreign policy, also made it 
possible to deal with longstanding problems in Soviet-Polish relations. 
</P>
<P>
"History cannot be remade. But lessons can and should be learned from it to 
preclude the repetition of things that marred relations between our peoples in 
the past and to cherish and multiply all the valuable things that unite them," 
Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mazowiecki raised the painful issue of the World War II massacre of Polish 
officers in the Katyn forest near the Byelorussian city of Smolensk. 
</P>
<P>
"For Poles, the Katyn crime remains a wound that has not healed," Mazowiecki 
said at a Kremlin dinner in his honor. "We want to close all difficult chapters 
of history. This is not only a matter for our alliance, but for a real 
reconciliation of our peoples -- something that is necessary for us and for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,300 Polish officers were killed at Katyn. Moscow has maintained 
that they were slaughtered by German troops in 1941, but most Poles believe -- 
as do Western historians -- that the Soviet secret police murdered them in 
1940. A joint Polish-Soviet commission has been studying the question for more 
than two years, but has yet to issue its final report.

Police on Friday found a time bomb in luggage taken from a Saudi Airlines jumbo 
jet with 248 people aboard. Only a loose wire stopped it from exploding over 
the Arabian Sea, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have recovered a bomb in a bag which was not tagged," said an officer of 
the paramilitary Karachi Airport Security Force, who identified himself only as 
Ashraf. 
</P>
<P>
A security force commander said the bomb would have destroyed the terminal of 
Karachi's airport in addition to the plane had it gone off after the jet landed 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Only a loose battery wire prevented it from blowing up Thursday evening as the 
plane was heading from Islamabad, Pakistan, to the Saudi city of Riyadh, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A taxi driver in Islamabad had delivered an envelope containing a note 
threatening to destroy the plane unless authorities paid $1.5 million, they 
said. The aircraft then was ordered to land at Karachi, where security 
officials found the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they questioned all passengers and crew members but had not made 
any arrests. They refused to say if they had any suspects or whether any group 
had claimed responsibility.

Eastern Airlines' striking ground workers vowed in Miami to stay on the picket 
line despite a decision by the carrier's pilots and flight attendants to end 
their 8 1/2-month sympathy strike. The airline, meanwhile, said there are no 
jobs for the pilots and flight attendants who have ended their walkout. 
Eastern's attorneys asked U.S. District Judge James L. King to determine the 
status of all employees: those hired during the strike, union members who 
crossed picket lines and returning strikers. A leader of the machinists said 
the union was preparing to step up its strike campaign to take advantage of 
Eastern's precarious financial situation and what the union claims is a 
maintenance shortage.

A woman trying to stop a confrontation in Canton between her son and four men 
over an alleged drug deal was shot and killed in the house where she cared for 
10 foster children, police said. The children, whose ages ranged from 9 months 
to 16 years, were not injured; most were sleeping during the 2 a.m. shooting. 
The woman's son and a man with whom he was arguing were wounded, authorities 
said. Moses Williams, 36, will be charged in the death of Elsie Jackson, 59, 
who was shot in the chest when she tried to persuade Williams to leave her 
house, police said. Her son, Darryl Ross, 25, was in guarded condition at 
Aultman Hospital. The foster children were placed in other foster homes.

A City Council session called Friday to mark the second anniversary of Mayor 
Harold Washington's death was scratched when only about a dozen of the city's 
50 aldermen showed up. 
</P>
<P>
Although some attributed the low turnout to continued divisions on the council, 
most called it a question of scheduling and said the city's first black mayor 
would be honored Monday instead. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard M. Daley's press secretary, Avis LaVelle, said notice was too 
short. The gathering was announced by Alderman Robert Shaw on Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not some sinister plot," LaVelle said. "It's a reality of the holiday 
season. Many people had longstanding vacation plans or arranged to take today 
off."

FEDERAL SAFETY AGENCY INTENSIFIES VEHICLE INVESTIGATIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal safety agency has upgraded investigations into reports of front-end 
failures in certain General Motors pickup trucks, seat belt failures in some 
Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds and power-seat fires in certain Ford 
Tauruses and Thunderbirds. 
</P>
<P>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also said it was 
intensifying two separate investigations into possible defects in the anti-lock 
braking systems of 1985 through 1987 BMWs and 1988 and 1989 Jaguar XJ-6s. 
</P>
<P>
All five investigations were upgraded to the second highest of three levels and 
could ultimately lead to recalls of the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it had 668 complaints from owners of 1987 through 1989 General 
Motors C and K pickups of lower ball-joint failure, which can affect steering. 
</P>
<P>
The NHTSA said it had 58 complaints of short circuits in the power seats of 
1987 and 1988 Tauruses and Thunderbirds. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said 1984 through 1986 Camaros and Firebirds were being checked 
because of 136 complaints of seat belt-buckle failures. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 185,000 BMWs could be involved if a recall is ordered to correct a 
brake-system flaw. 
</P>
<P>
The NHTSA said it had 56 complaints from Jaguar owners who reported electrical 
failures that made their cars' brakes much harder to apply.

More than 40,000 Slinky animal pull toys have been recalled because paint used 
on them may contain too much lead, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also says 234,000 clown dolls are being recalled because they pose a 
choking hazard. The dolls, manufactured by Omaha-based Oriental Trading Co. and 
sold through mail order catalogues as the "Dress Up Clown" or "Funny Clown," 
were recalled because they have small parts that present a choking risk to 
young children.

Eileen Souza received a letter from the Massachusetts Department of Mental 
Retardation a few months ago informing her that her 22-year-old daughter, 
Elizabeth, would soon have to leave Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown. 
</P>
<P>
The commonwealth was $721 million in debt, the letter explained, and it could 
no longer afford to educate and treat Souza's blind and mute daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not capable of giving her the quality of treatment she was getting from 
the state," said Souza, the widowed mother of seven grown children. "After all 
the state had invested for the past four years, now it's being undone because 
of the budget cuts." 
</P>
<P>
Souza was lucky, at least for the time being: She found a place for her 
daughter in another state program, although it may be threatened by yet another 
wave of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Souza and her daughter are among the earliest victims of an economic crisis in 
a state whose prosperity in the 1980s, after a period of hard times, earned the 
designation of "Massachusetts miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout New England, in fact, jobs are disappearing and real estate markets 
are softening. This region depends heavily on high technology, particularly the 
defense and computer industries, and those sectors are slumping. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to consider New England as a country," said David Wyss, an 
economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., "New England would be in 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
Conditions are not exactly desperate here. Jobless rates and per-capita income 
levels are still nearly the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts' October unemployment rate was about 4%, considerably better than 
the national rate of 5.3%. But it is also a long way from the 2.9% that 
Massachusetts boasted as recently as May of last year. 
</P>
<P>
It has proved enough to throw the state's high-performance budget into a spin 
and to send the popularity of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis tumbling practically off 
the charts. Dukakis took credit for the prosperity during his unsuccessful 
presidential campaign last year and is now widely held responsible for the 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
During the state's boom years of 1980 to 1987, state revenues increased by 8% 
to 16% a year, and Dukakis and the Democratic Legislature used the windfall to 
engineer a vast expansion of social services. By 1989, according to state 
officials, about 40% of the state's $12.4-billion budget was spent for social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The good times began unraveling in 1988, when tax revenues rose by only 2.1% 
from the previous year, compared to the 6.8% estimated by state tax assessors. 
And in 1989, revenues rose only 6.6%, short of the 10.9% estimated at the 
beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Budget estimating is a very imprecise science," explained Betsy C. 
Houghteling, spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. "There 
was no way to anticipate. Literally, we opened people's (tax) returns expecting 
to find checks, and there was no money. People were wanting refunds. It was 
astounding." 
</P>
<P>
The empty envelopes left the state facing a $721-million deficit in the 1990 
fiscal year, which ends next June 30. As recently as Nov. 18, the Massachusetts 
House of Representatives passed a $308-million package of spending cuts and 
endorsed another $60 million in savings measures sought by Dukakis, cutting the 
deficit almost in half. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislation was silent on revenue. Dukakis, who had announced that he would 
not seek another term as governor next year, also sought new taxes. But state 
House leaders said they would begin working on a tax package only after the 
state Senate approved the spending cuts and the governor signed them into law. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to raise taxes prompted Moody's Investors Service to reduce 
Massachusetts' credit rating from "A" to "Baa1," dropping the state into a tie 
with Louisiana for the nation's lowest-rated bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Such a distinction, in addition to hurting the state's pride, makes the 
commonwealth's bonds more difficult to sell and will drive up the cost of 
borrowing because investors will demand higher interest rates on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the lowered credit rating, Moody's stated: "The magnitude of the 
projected deficit is made all the more onerous by the apparent lack of 
consensus on how to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
"A major tax increase was proposed at the beginning of the year and was soundly 
rejected by the Legislature, which expressed a preference for expenditure 
reductions to achieve budget balance. As the enacted budget was significantly 
trimmed by the Legislature and later by gubernatorial veto, the prospects of 
eliminating the potential deficit through further cuts alone seems remote." 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis' political opponents charged that he deliberately concealed the extent 
of the state's budget crisis during his 1988 presidential campaign, lest it 
damage him politically. The governor and his staff roundly deny the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Mindy Lubber, Dukakis' press secretary, said state officials did not hide or 
alter state revenue figures during Dukakis' failed presidential bid. The 
numbers should not have come as a great surprise, she said, because officials 
published revised estimates as soon as they became aware of them. 
</P>
<P>
"People are angry that Dukakis didn't win and are taking out their anger in a 
number of ways," Lubber said. "We had gotten used to the sky being the limit. 
It's a shock to many people to see such a radical slowdown to such good 
programs. Nobody likes good programs taken away from them." 
</P>
<P>
Human Services Secretary Philip W. Johnston said it was time for the state's 
leaders to raise the taxes to pay for the necessary services. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough already," he said. "On with the show. Most reasonable people know there 
has to be a tax package." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who served in the state Legislature from 1975 to 1983, said he 
understood the political pressures against increasing taxes. But vital services 
are at stake now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that most people in Massachusetts don't want to see us cut vital 
services for the most needy people we serve," Johnston said last month in 
announcing $42 million in cuts in programs run by his department. "And if there 
is any way to avoid doing it, I will find it." 
</P>
<P>
Those cuts came on top of $345 million in previous reductions, and Johnston is 
still seeking to cut another $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in his office, which is filled with photos of Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Johnston 
conceded that the cuts had "a major impact on poor and disabled people." 
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear that I was opposed to doing this," he said. "I know from the 
response I've received that the average person in this state is concerned about 
destroying all we've built up." 
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 students at the University of Massachusetts have protested higher 
tuition and fees and reduced student aid. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that we're creating a situation where poor and minority students, 
and others who need the help most, are not going to go to school," said Charles 
F. Desmond, vice chancellor for student affairs at the Boston campus of the 
University of Massachusetts. "Since minority people don't have access to the 
political system, they are disproportionately affected by these downturns." 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect remains chancy for a tax increase to maintain existing social 
services or to restore those that have been cut. The entire state House of 
Representatives, which has blocked new taxes so far, is up for reelection.

RACING: THE CASE INVOLVES CONFLICTING VIEWS OF A STATE LAW GIVING BREAKS TO 
OWNERS OF FIVE RACING BREEDS. OWNERS SAYS THE DECISION COULD HAVE A MAJOR

<P>
Nestled deep in the blue-ribbon horse country of southern Ventura County and 
wrapped softly in a late-morning haze, the ranch of millionaire developer David 
H. Murdock is a quiet bustle of activity. 
</P>
<P>
Under a cool canopy spread by towering oaks, expensive Arabian stallions trot 
lazily across a pasture. A sleek mare circles a hot-walker machine, cooling 
down after a run. Inside a carefully maintained brick barn, a blue-jeaned young 
woman sweeps her way past the stalls of top-quality fillies and geldings. 
</P>
<P>
Sprawled over 1,500 acres in the wealthy Lake Sherwood area just south of 
Thousand Oaks, the ranch -- called Ventura Farms and home to 200 Arabians -- 
has produced national champions of the United States, Canada and Brazil. In a 
slick booklet, the ranch advertises itself as "one of the most significant 
Arabian breeding farms in the world today." 
</P>
<P>
But as his horses peacefully graze, Murdock's lawyers are busily preparing for 
a court battle Monday with Ventura County that is being closely watched by 
racehorse breeders across California. At issue is how much the county can tax 
such horses -- a question that owners claim could have a major impact on the 
future of racehorse breeding in Ventura and other counties. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves conflicting interpretations of a 1971 state law that gives 
tax breaks to owners of five racing breeds: Arabians, Appaloosas, 
Thoroughbreds, Standardbreds and quarter horses. The statute was intended to 
help build up California's horse racing industry, boosting race track betting 
and putting more money in state tax coffers. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County assessor's office contends that to qualify for the tax 
break, a horse must be entered in races and be registered with the state as a 
racehorse and that its ranch include a training track and race trainer. 
Otherwise, horses are subject to taxation at 1% of market value, the same rate 
as boats, airplanes or other personal property. 
</P>
<P>
But in a lawsuit filed last year, Murdock argued that a horse should be 
classified as a racer if it is merely eligible to race or produces a foal 
eligible to race, said Richard Craigo, one of his attorneys. Murdock claimed 
that his stock, even if some of the animals had not actually been in races, 
were still racehorses under the law, qualifying them for a far lower flat tax 
rate of $200 to $1,000 a head, Craigo said. 
</P>
<P>
For breeders with as much stock as Murdock, the difference in tax rates can 
mean a savings of tens of thousands of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
If the county loses, it may ultimately have to rebate up to $500,000 in taxes 
already paid by Murdock from 1981 through 1986, Assessor Jerry Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford acknowledged that Ventura is evidently the only county in California 
that still taxes some horses as personal property, a policy that some breeders 
claim may encourage other counties to apply the higher tax rate to racehorses 
and drive some owners out of state, thereby hurting race track-tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes years to develop a good racing string. If you're going to be taxed as 
though they're not for racing, it's going to be very expensive to keep horses 
in California," said Michael Sypolt, treasurer of the Arabian Racing Assn. of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 65,000 Arabians in California and 24,000 owners. This case could be 
very important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanford dismissed the argument, saying breeders who are in compliance with 
the state race horse law have nothing to fear from the tax man -- in Ventura or 
elsewhere -- because they will receive a racehorse exemption. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute can be traced to 1985, when then-Assessor Jack Waterman conducted a 
routine audit of horse ranches, including Murdock's, Sanford said. Although in 
previous years most Ventura horses had so little value that county tax 
appraisers largely ignored them, he said, the 1985 audit revealed "$30 million 
to $40 million worth of value out there," and the county decided to step up 
collection of taxes on ranch stock. 
</P>
<P>
Many horse owners, recalled Sanford, were shocked when their new tax bills 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"One horse I think we had appraised for $13 million. And a week later, the 
horse died. I'm not sure if the owners showed the horse the bill or not," he 
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, Sanford said, were caught in "kind of a Catch-22" because 
they were assessing some racehorses at a time when their prices had reached 
all-time highs, some zooming 500% in a single year. But the following year, 
prices plunged as a speculative boom in Arabians slowed sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Craigo criticized the county's position as "a little selfish," 
charging that if its tax policies drive breeders away, the county may be 
fattening its own tax coffers in the short term at the expense of long-term 
state revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford said that at the time his office began applying the personal property 
rates to horses, many of Murdock's animals did not qualify for the racehorse 
exemption. Since then, however, Murdock has built a race-training track, 
registered some of his horses as racers and put more of his stock into races. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, county officials re-appraised Ventura Farms and in July agreed to 
lower Murdock's assessment for the 1987-88 and 1988-89 fiscal years to $1.6 
million from $25.2 million, Sanford said. The cut meant the county had to give 
back $237,000 in taxes already paid by Murdock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Zimmermann, another attorney for Murdock, said the developer is pursuing 
his expensive litigation with the county not to save money but to prove that 
his reading of the state racehorse law is correct and to help other breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"Murdock can afford the taxes, but a lot of other people have smaller 
operations, and the tax can be a significant extra burden for them," he said.

Fighting Irish Republican Army guerrillas has cost the government $3.5 billion 
over the past 20 years, Justice Minister Ray Burke said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that the high security costs will be maintained "because of the 
duty of the government to do everything in its power to protect all of the 
people of this island from the men of violence." 
</P>
<P>
In a direct message to IRA guerrillas, who have spent 20 years trying to oust 
Britain from Northern Ireland, he said: "Stop and stop now. Surely you must 
realize you cannot win militarily."

PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER THREE WEEKS ON THE BENCH, CHICAGO BEAR QUARTERBACK GETS A 
START AGAINST THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Tomczak has been looking to the future and thinking about the past in the 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
As he goes back into the starting lineup Sunday against the Redskins after 
spending three weeks on the bench, he likes to talk about where the San 
Francisco 49ers were a year ago at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"They were 6-5 and they wound up winning the Super Bowl, so I think we're in 
the same position as they were a year ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It just so happens the 49ers beat the Redskins, 37-21, in the 12th game to 
start their turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's the Chicago Bears' turn to take a crack at starting a comeback against 
the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
They have managed to struggle to a 6-5 start, too. 
</P>
<P>
There's one difference, though. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, 49ers Coach Bill Walsh finally gave the baton to Joe Montana after 
alternating him with Steve Young much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coach Mike Ditka of the Bears is calling on Tomczak after benching 
him for Jim Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak, of course, has yet to prove he's another Joe Montana -- or even 
another Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year free agent from Ohio State has had his moments. 
</P>
<P>
One of them came just last week when Ditka put him in for Harbaugh with 4:43 
left in the game and the Bears trailing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
All he did was throw three touchdown passes in 2 minutes, 41 seconds to give 
the Bears a 31-29 lead with 1:46 left. The defense couldn't hold it and the 
Bears lost, 32-31. 
</P>
<P>
But that performance earned him another shot at the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"I was completely unconscious," Tomczak said. "Every spiral seemed so tight I 
didn't realize I was throwing it. The smile on my face grew and grew, to show 
the confidence growing." 
</P>
<P>
The problem for Tomczak is that he's only had moments in his career. He's never 
been able to do it week in and week out. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his trademark is being screamed at by Ditka on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak's ego was so shattered in his dealings with Ditka that he even went to 
a psychiatrist a year ago to learn how to cope with it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy playing three years and getting bitched at all the time," he 
said last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak said he learned to use self-hypnosis 30 minutes a day. 
</P>
<P>
"It might sound weird or hokey, but it works," he said. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Tomczak is not eager to talk about needing a psychiatrist to live 
with Ditka. He said "not all of it" was about Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak said when he was benched three weeks ago, he complained to Ditka about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I talked to Mike a few times, voicing my concern that I didn't 
think a replacement was needed, but I'm a player and he's the head coach. I 
respected his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with the talks we had," Tomczak said. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka also said he has no problems getting along with Tomczak, forgetting the 
days when he used to grab him by the jersey on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why you'd even ask that question (about getting along with 
Tomczak). That's why I won't answer it because it's a silly question. Why 
wouldn't I get along with him? I get along with everybody. Mike and I have 
always gotten along well when he was starting and when he wasn't. Mike's an 
excellent young man. I've got great respect and admiration for him. It's not a 
matter of getting along with people or liking or disliking. We have to try to 
do what we think is best for 47 men," Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
During the first four years of his career, Tomczak was mostly the fill-in for 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Since McMahon was often injured, he wound up playing a lot even though the job 
was never his. He was even the starter in the Bears' only playoff victory since 
their Super Bowl championship at the end of the 1985 season -- the "Fog Bowl" 
against the Philadelphia Eagles last New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak suffered a shoulder injury in that game and Ditka went back to McMahon 
the next week against the 49ers in the National Football Conference title game 
with the Super Bowl berth on the line. He said McMahon was the healthier of the 
two although he obviously hoped McMahon had some of the old magic left. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out he had nothing left up his sleeve. The Bears were whipped, 28-3, 
and Ditka decided the McMahon era was over. The Bears swapped him to the San 
Diego Chargers during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
The Tomczak era was supposed to start this year. It lasted only eight games, 
then he was back on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very humbling profession," Tomczak said. "I don't let my ego get in 
the way of what I'm trying to do. I knew an opportunity would come sooner or 
later. Before you experience the highest mountain, you have to experience the 
lowest valleys." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback, of course, isn't the Bears' only problem. They're simply not the 
team they were four years ago or maybe even a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the quarterback gets the blame if things don't go right. The next eight 
days could make or break Tomczak's season and maybe his career. After playing 
Washington Sunday, the Bears go to Minnesota next week. If they win both, 
they'll be no worse than tied for first place in their division and Tomczak 
will get the plaudits. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't, he'll be getting the heat. 
</P>
<P>
One of his best games was against the Redskins at RFK last November when he 
completed 15 of 26 passes for 229 yards and a touchdown in a 34-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
In that game, he looked as if he could be the team's quarterback of the future. 
Instead, he finds himself struggling with Harbaugh for the job. He also finds 
himself reminded that no free-agent quarterback has ever taken a team to the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"In Chicago, the quarterback position has been very interchangeable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This may be Tomczak's shot to become the Chicago quarterback.

LIKE OLD TIMES: SMITH'S TEAM BEATS DRIESELL'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LAHAINA, Hawaii 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a familiar scene played about 6,000 miles from the usual stage. Close 
game. Last-second shot. And Dean Smith's team beats Lefty Driesell's -- again. 
</P>
<P>
King Rice's driving scoop shot off the backboard at the buzzer capped a 10-0 
final-minute run for No. 7 North Carolina Friday night in an 80-79 victory over 
James Madison in the opening round of the Maui tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the 42nd between teams coached by Smith and Driesell, and Smith 
leads, 32-10. The rivalry started in 1968 and has continued as Driesell moved 
from Davidson to Maryland to James Madison. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels made a long jump shot, two three-pointers and Rice's miracle shot 
in the final minute while the Dukes were missing the front end of three 
one-and-one free-throw opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had the ballgame won if we made those free throws," Driesell 
said. "They made two tough three-pointers, and I thought that last shot was 
going over the backboard." 
</P>
<P>
Rice had an explanation for the extra zip on the shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit by two or three guys on that shot and that's why it went off the 
glass so hard," the junior point guard said. 
</P>
<P>
James Madison, led 79-70, with 1:15 left on a free throw by Fess Irvin. That 
was the Dukes' last point as North Carolina, suspect from the perimeter 
throughout the game, became a team that which made some long jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
James Madison appeared off the hook when William Davis stole a long pass with 
four seconds to play after Steve Hood had missed a free throw with eight 
seconds left. Davis stepped on the sideline, however, and the Tar Heels got the 
ball to Rice, who ducked under one player and got the shot off with defensive 
players all around him. 
</P>
<P>
"We work on that situation all the time in practice, being down with the ball," 
Rice said. "That may not have been the shot we wanted, but it was the one we 
got." 
</P>
<P>
Driesell and Smith shook hands in the media room and Driesell told his longtime 
rival to "win it all." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Smith was lucky, as Driesell often describes him good-naturedly, 
he replied: "Yeah, he's lucky. But he's won an awful lot of close ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
And one more against Lefty.

MELVIN DURSLAG: GRANDDAD GETTING BOWLED OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way life measures up in matters postseason, Michigan or Ohio State or 
Illinois will be matched against USC in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, which produces an inordinate amount of cash to televise the game, exhales 
deeply. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, heaven," it says. "But for this blessing, it could have been 
Washington State and Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to cutthroat New Year's Day football, now featuring seven games, 
the network doing the Rose Bowl is made to perspire, no longer sitting atop an 
automatic hit. 
</P>
<P>
Faded elegance, the Rose Bowl rarely offers the prime game, meaning those who 
promote it, or televise it, must hope, at least, for principals with wide 
followings. 
</P>
<P>
On the West Coast, that would be USC and UCLA. In the Big Ten, it would be 
Michigan and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
But competition in the leagues has so deteriorated that the Rose Bowl, locked 
in with the two, is beginning to lose the carbonation that has given fizz to 
its match for so long. 
</P>
<P>
Normally today, you write off half the teams, or more, in each conference at 
the start of the season. And, by the end, you are looking pretty much at the 
same colors, mostly belonging to USC and UCLA on one side and Michigan and Ohio 
State on the other. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, USC will have graced the scene three years in a row. And an audit 
discloses that over the last 20 years, the visiting force has been Michigan or 
Ohio State 16 times. 
</P>
<P>
The monotony suggests a period in Texas in which all the bit shooters drove 
Cadillacs. You never asked a man what kind of car he bought. You merely 
inquired, "What color?" 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl bills itself as the Granddaddy of Them All, a tribute more to its 
age than its impact. It sells out, almost unfailingly, and its financial health 
is good. 
</P>
<P>
But all too often on the New Year's card, it is the tap dancer supplementing 
the headline act. In vaudeville, Fink's Mules warmed up audiences as the Rose 
Bowl does today. 
</P>
<P>
Little old ladies in Pasadena don't like it. Over gin the other day, one was 
heard to grumble: "We are being upstaged by something called the Federal 
Express Orange Bowl. What the hell is the Federal Express Orange Bowl?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure it isn't pony express?" another asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Pony express may be sponsoring a game in Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
Operating the only major postseason game that is totally committed to two 
conferences, the Rose Bowl shuts itself off from teams that may be interesting 
that particular season. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't have to enter the dogfight," the Rose Bowl explains. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it doesn't. And, sidestepping the dogfight, it has wound up in the 
water closet, with TV ratings that have slipped and with such contempt 
developed by competitors for the Granddaddy of Them All that they have dared 
take it on, head to head, on the air. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, who would have been so audacious, so consummately brassy as to 
overlap the Rose Bowl? Would some hillbilly try to win a singing contest from 
Pavarotti? 
</P>
<P>
"Look," you say gingerly to Pasadena. "Maybe the time has come to forget the 
lock-in and start thinking about the dogfight. Rose Bowl money can lick a lot 
of dogs." 
</P>
<P>
"We cherish our relationship with the Big Ten and Pacific 10," Pasadena lashes 
back. "It has stood since 1947." 
</P>
<P>
"A newspaper we remember stood since 1903," Pasadena is reminded. "It isn't 
with us anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"But our two conferences have stature and they have character," Pasadena 
responds. "They embody everything that is good in institutions of learning." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you selling learning or football?" you reply. "This is show business. And 
the same teams coming in every year are getting to be a yawn. Do you know what 
killed the six-day bike race? Its act never changed. And the same thing one day 
will kill Old Faithful at Yellowstone." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena used to be more inventive. Offering its first bowl game in 1902, it 
shut it down as bad theater when Michigan creamed Stanford, 49-0. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know what Pasadena came up with the next year? A polo match. That seemed 
a good idea, inasmuch as no team, up to that point, had lost 49-0 in polo. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena then tried an ostrich race, followed by a race between a camel and an 
elephant. It also came on with a tug of war, which, today, might be called the 
John Hancock Tug of War. And, by 1916, it was ready again for football. 
</P>
<P>
In postseason play, the Rose Bowl is sitting in on a high-stakes poker game. To 
succeed, folks there must produce more than a fund of happy recollections on 
how the pot used to be theirs.

HARRICK VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS OPPONENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Harrick begins his second season as UCLA basketball coach tonight against 
an old friend and a familiar foe, but not necessarily against a friendly foe. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara Coach Carroll Williams, Harrick's West Coast Athletic Conference 
nemesis when Harrick coached at Pepperdine, will provide the opposition at 
Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
What can be expected from the Broncos, who were 20-11 last season and reached 
the final game of the WCAC tournament for the third consecutive year? 
</P>
<P>
"They just slug it out -- knock you down and put an elbow into you," Harrick 
said. "(They) walk it up the floor and pound it inside. (They're) slow and 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
"And they foul you every time down and hope (the officials) only call half of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who enters his 20th season at Santa Clara with 305 victories, learned 
the style, Harrick said, as an assistant under former coach Dick Garibaldi. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way they've always played," Harrick said. "They had big, strong, 
slow guys and they were just the most physical teams. The old Santa Clara-San 
Francisco games were blood baths." 
</P>
<P>
While Harrick was at Pepperdine, his teams were 12-7 against Santa Clara, but 
the Waves rarely enjoyed their visits to Santa Clara's Toso Pavilion, where 
they were 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara was less successful on the road -- including a 1-8 record at 
Pepperdine during Harrick's tenure -- but five years ago, the Broncos upset 
UCLA, 68-60, at Pauley Pavilion as Harold Keeling and the late Nick Vanos 
combined for 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
It is still Santa Clara's only victory over UCLA in 12 games since 1959. And 
Harrick was there. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in here and just spanked the Bruins," Harrick said of Williams. "I 
mean spanked 'em and ran a clinic. I scouted the game from press row, and he 
ran a clinic, pal, on how to run the flex and take what the defense gives you." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick and the Bruins hope to do the spanking tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has lost only one of its last 36 home openers. Brigham Young beat the 
Bruins in 1981, ending a string of 28 victories. . . . Another Bruin team will 
make its debut tonight, on KMPC radio: play-by-play announcer Paul Olden and 
analyst Ann Meyers. . . . Santa Clara's Jeffty Connelly, a 6-foot-5 forward who 
averaged 11.9 points and 5.6 rebounds last season, played at USC as a freshman 
with Tom Lewis, Bo Kimble and Hank Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
While he was at Pepperdine, Jim Harrick recruited Santa Clara's 7-1, 285-pound 
center, Ron Reis, out of Monta Vista High in Cupertino. "He's pretty agile," 
Harrick said. "He's not very hostile, but he's mobile." Reis' father, Ron, was 
a reserve center for the Cincinnati teams that won NCAA championships in 1961 
and '62. 
</P>
<P>
Darrick Martin has responded well to the challenge of replacing Pooh Richardson 
as the Bruins' point guard, Harrick said. "He's the kind of guy who makes you 
sleep a little better at night, knowing you've got him for three years," 
Harrick said. . . . Besides Martin, UCLA's starting lineup will include 
forwards Don MacLean and Trevor Wilson, center Kevin Walker and guard Gerald 
Madkins. 
</P>
<P>
In two exhibition games, UCLA freshman reserve forward Tracy Murray attempted 
28 shots in 38 minutes. "If you notice, he's always in position to score," 
Harrick said. "He's always open. He's like Reggie Miller. Miller was always 
open, no matter where he was on the floor -- 35 feet (out), 30 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick, on his decision to redshirt 6-11 freshman Rodney Odom: "I wanted him 
to play both forward and center and, fundamentally, he's a little away from 
doing that. If he's going to play center and defend guys like (Stanford's) Adam 
Keefe -- there's no way. He told me I'd regret it, and I hope I do. That will 
mean he's really good." . . . UCLA will play Pacific-10 Conference games next 
week at Washington and Washington State.

Dexter Manley, former Washington Redskins defensive end, probably will not 
appeal his drug-related lifetime suspension by the NFL in court, his attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, 30, was banished from the league last week for a third violation of the 
NFL's drug abuse policy. There was speculation that Manley would fight the 
suspension in court, either by claiming that the drug test was faulty or by 
questioning the authority of the commissioner or the rule itself. 
</P>
<P>
Manley instead is leaning toward complying with the suspension and seeking 
reinstatement in one year, a provision of the league's policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that he has never really indicated to me that he was thinking in terms 
of taking the league to court," said Bob Woolf, Manley's attorney.

Nathalie Bouvier of France won a World Cup women's giant slalom Friday after a 
jury overruled a protest that claimed she had missed a gate on her first run. 
</P>
<P>
The jury talked with the gatekeeper and reviewed the videotape, then declared 
Bouvier the leader over Diann Roffe of the United States with a time of 1 
minutes 8.37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Roffe, 22, giant slalom gold medalist in the 1985 World Championships, finished 
her first run on the artificial surface in 1:09.06 as light snow fell. 
</P>
<P>
In the second run, Bouvier was timed in 1:07.60 for a total of 2:15.97. Roffe's 
1:08.14 gave her a total of 2:17.20, placing her ahead of Austria's Anita 
Wachter, who was third in 2:17.51. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked hard and I'm a year older," Roffe said. "I feel I'm finally ready 
to be a force." 
</P>
<P>
Wachter moved into second place in the World Cup overall standings with 40 
points, one behind West German Michaela Gerg, who finished sixth Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Vreni Schneider, coming off the best season in the history of the 
sport, fell on her first run but said she will be ready for today's slalom. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow is another day and I hope to do better," she said. "It is just one 
race. The snow was no problem. I had trouble with my inside ski." 
</P>
<P>
The race, held on Willy's Run, was the second in the four-day World Cup event 
for about 130 skiers from 18 countries.

Jockey Julie Krone was thrown from her horse and kicked during a race at the 
Meadowlands when her mount stopped abruptly, track officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Krone, the all-time leading rider at the Meadowlands, was rushed to Hackensack 
Medical Center and was being treated for a broken left arm, a nursing 
supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Meadowlands spokeswoman Ellen Harvey said video tapes reviewed by track 
officials showed that Krone's horse, My Rolin, was spooked by a shadow and 
stopped short. Krone appeared to have been kicked at least once by My Rolin and 
was probably kicked by the trailing horse as well, Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Krone agreed to accept a 15-day suspension and $500 fine 
imposed by track stewards in September after a fight between Krone and another 
jockey. Krone had been appealing the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Stewards tacked on an extra five days and $100 fine to Krone's suspension for 
lodging a frivolous complaint, the raceway said. 
</P>
<P>
Krone is required by the suspension to be out of action between Dec. 4 and Dec. 
23, the last race of the season, track officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Krone's suspension stemmed from a fight on the track with jockey Joe Bravo on 
Sept. 23. She was suspended and fined for unsportsmanlike conduct and misuse of 
the whip.

Ralph Norwood, a rookie tackle for the Atlanta Falcons, was killed in an 
automobile accident Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood's car was found near a shopping mall eight miles south of the Falcon 
training complex in Suwanee, Ga. According to police, Norwood's car crossed 
into the oncoming lane, went 40 feet down a slight embankment and slammed into 
a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Roger DeWitt said Norwood, 23, was alone in the car. He apparently died of 
massive head and chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-7, 285-pound Norwood saw action in all 11 Atlanta games this season, 
starting once when veteran Mike Kenn was sidelined because of an injury. 
Norwood, a New Orleans native, is survived by his parents, three sisters, two 
brothers and a daughter, 2.

FOR EASTERN, PILOTS' RETURN IS NON-EVENT; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE COMPANY IS ADDING FLIGHTS BUT ITS PROBLEMS AREN'T OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the pilots of Eastern Airlines joined with the carrier's machinists and 
went on strike last March, the impact was enormous. 
</P>
<P>
Without crews in the cockpits, any hope that Eastern could maintain something 
close to its normal flight schedule was dashed. The crippled airline was put 
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy less than a week after the walkout began. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Eastern's pilots have called off their strike, the impact is 
almost nil. For, while it is true that members of the striking Air Line Pilots 
Assn. (ALPA) have voted to put away their picket signs, Eastern doesn't need 
them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
A slimmed-down Eastern has all the pilots that it needs and its corporate 
strategy is well in place. Neither Wednesday's end to the pilots strike nor 
Thursday's conclusion to the flight attendants strike is likely to change the 
course of Eastern Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said it employed 3,500 pilots when the strike began. It currently 
has 1,850 on the payroll. Of those, just under 900 are original Eastern pilots 
who either never joined the strike or have crossed the picket lines since 
March. The rest are newly hired pilots. Eastern said it currently has a list of 
about 100 pilots who had struck and are awaiting a call to return. 
</P>
<P>
"The strike ceased to affect our ability to operate a long time ago," Karen 
Ceremsak, an Eastern spokeswoman, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Opinions vary on who came out ahead in the 264-day strike. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a victory for management," said John W. Mattis, an airline analyst with 
Shearson Lehman Hutton, a New York brokerage firm. "It (now) gives the company 
total flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
When the strike came, Eastern's daily schedule dropped from 1,050 flights to 
practically zero. Since then, it has slowly increased its activity. It now has 
780 flights a day and has told the bankruptcy court that it expects to reach 
about 900 flights by early in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But the head of Eastern's striking pilots, Charles (Chip) Stokes, said Friday 
that it was a hollow victory for the Miami-based airline. 
</P>
<P>
"It is Pyrrhic victory at best," he said in an interview. "The long, bitter 
battle cannot be called a win for Eastern management. Its creditors, its 
employees and its customers will all feel the effects of (Eastern parent) Texas 
Air Corp.'s scorched earth policy for many years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Stokes said he did not know how long the pilots who stayed with the strike will 
continue to receive $2,400-a-month payments from special assessments of ALPA 
members nationwide. He said the payments would continue for at least 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has benefited in some ways from the long walkout. For one thing, it 
hired its new pilots and flight attendants at much lower salaries than it was 
paying its veterans. For instance, pilots with top seniority earn just over 
$70,000 a year, while the newly hired pilots are making about one-third that 
amount. And Eastern is paying its newly hired flight attendants about half of 
the $2,300 a month that veteran flight attendants earn. (By law, new hires 
cannot be laid off to make way for returning strikers.) Moreover, the 
machinists' work is being contracted out at about one-third of what it cost to 
pay the machinists who went out strike. 
</P>
<P>
The higher productivity that the airline is getting from its employees, coupled 
with the lower wages it is paying, has resulted in a much lower cost structure 
than before and one of lowest in the industry. Only non-union Continental 
Airlines and the newly founded carriers, America West Airlines and Midway 
Airlines, have lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
And as result of this improvement, Eastern executives predict that the carrier 
will make a profit next year. If so, it would be the first time since 
deregulation a decade ago that it ended up in the black. 
</P>
<P>
But Eastern clearly has a long way to go before it is profitable. It had a net 
loss of $569.7 million on revenue of $1 billion in the first nine months of 
this year. This compares to a net loss of $233.7 million on revenue of $3 
billion in the like period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The airline also must satisfy its creditors with its business plan and 
resulting repayment schedule so that it can emerge from Chapter 11, which it 
has said it expects to do early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said in its original plan that it would dispose of $1.8 billion in 
assets. So far, among other things, it has sold its highly profitable 
Northeastern shuttle to hotel magnate Donald J. Trump for $365 million and is 
negotiating with American Airlines to sell its South American routes, which 
analysts say are worth $300 million to $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone thinks that Eastern is out of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Glabkowsky, a professor of business at the University of Miami who 
specializes in Eastern, said that despite its return to its near-strike 
operations and despite its predictions of future profitability, the airline 
will not survive. 
</P>
<P>
He said Eastern is still losing $2 million daily. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Eastern expects to earn a profit from operations soon, Glabkowsky 
said, its interest payments -- as much as $300 million a year on its 
$2.4-billion debt -- will still drag it into the red. And while it is true that 
such payments are temporarily suspended until it is out of Chapter 11, the 
interest is "piling up." 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone believes that Eastern is going to become profitable," Glabkowsky 
said, "I've got a bridge I want to sell them." 
</P>
<P>
The professor said all that is keeping Eastern afloat right now is its ability 
to lure passengers with discount fares. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on flights to Nassau, where Glabkowsky often travels on business, 
Eastern offers a round-trip discount fare of $64, nearly half the fare charged 
by its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the airline flew with average loads of 63%, a percentage point 
higher than it predicted in its reorganization plan. But those numbers would 
not hold up after a price hike. 
</P>
<P>
"If Eastern raises its fares in an effort to begin making some money, travelers 
will stop torturing their schedules to fly Eastern," Glabkowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Eastern is losing so much money that its profits from the sale of the 
shuttle have already been spent on operations, and if it sells the South 
American routes, "that money will be gone in six months." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, Eastern's suppliers of such things as fuel and food 
catering services extend it very little credit. 
</P>
<P>
"People want cash on the barrel head from Eastern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, disagreements between unions and airlines have come down to the 
strike deadline and then it generally has been the pilots who actually walk 
out. That was because they were the ones who could quickly bring an airline to 
its knees. Because of their clout, the pilots tended to lead the pack. Usually, 
within a few weeks, the unions would have made their point and the strike would 
be settled. But the most recent walkout against Eastern was actually more a 
vendetta against an individual than a typical union action. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern unions have described the action as a fight to the death against 
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern and its parent, Texas Air Corp., whom they 
called a trade union wrecker because of his actions in breaking the pilots 
union at Continental Airlines, the other Texas Air subsidiary. "This was a 
total union war against the union-busting devil incarnate," said one observer. 
</P>
<P>
Whether a rift will now develop between the unions because the pilots and the 
flight attendants have voted to end their strikes remains to be seen. A rift 
between pilots at United who staged a 1985 walkout and those who crossed the 
picket lines has still not been reconciled. Even in the cockpit, crew members 
often do not talk to each other.

TURMOIL IN EAST BLOC, DOMESTIC JITTERS SEND GOLD TO HIGH FOR '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Gold prices, responding to political upheaval in Eastern Europe and signs of 
economic uncertainty, are soaring. But experts are split on whether the rise 
can be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the precious metal, after languishing for much of the past two 
years, hit its 1989 high on Friday. It has risen about $59 an ounce since Sept. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
The November futures contract for the precious metal rose $7.90 to close at 
$418.90 an ounce after heavy trading on the New York Commodity Exchange. The 
price eclipsed the previous 1989 high of $413.40, set Jan. 3, for the spot 
contract on the Comex. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against all major currencies in slow trading 
Friday, settling at an 11-month low against the West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
Gold is seen as a financial hedge in times of political turmoil or economic 
uneasiness. Many analysts say continuing uncertainty in Eastern Europe -- 
Czechoslovakia's entire leadership resigned Friday -- accelerated a 3-month 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
Some market observers say concerns about the dollar, falling interest rates and 
predictions of higher inflation are contributing factors to the rise. They 
predict that gold prices will continue to rise over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
However, other analysts, including Charles Clough, chief investment strategist 
at Merrill Lynch, say gold prices were simply due for a cyclical rebound and 
say the surge will soon end unless more serious inflationary pressures build. 
Gold bottomed out at $354.75 an ounce in mid-September, significantly below the 
last peak in December, 1987, when the price hit $500 an ounce. "It (gold) has 
been a pretty unattractive investment for awhile and it didn't take much to 
rally it," Clough said. "It's been down for nine years and it appeared that it 
would not go down any further." 
</P>
<P>
Clough said the Federal Reserve's recent decision to ease the money supply is 
not a harbinger of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong possibility that the rise could be related . . . to all the 
turmoil in Eastern Europe and Soviet Union," Clough said. 
</P>
<P>
However, David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, 
said declining interest rates are a major factor in the gold market. Falling 
interest rates are weakening the international value of the dollar, generating 
new interest in gold. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, the events in Eastern Europe contribute, but are a minor 
factor (in the gold market)," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europeans want the kind of political change that will allow the 
restructuring of their economies and will enable them to increase their 
purchasing power, said Norman Mains, research director at the brokerage of 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors are buying gold because they expect Eastern Europe to consume a 
larger share of Europe's goods and services, boosting inflation, said Mains, 
who predicts a further $15 rise in gold prices by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
"Demand creates inflation," he said. "If inflation goes up in Europe, it will 
be translated into a worldwide phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of major economic restructuring in the Soviet Union are fueling much of 
the drive toward gold, said Edmund Serfaty, vice president and portfolio 
manager of the San Antonio-based United Services Gold Fund, a mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
Serfaty said many investors believe that the Soviet Union, a major supplier of 
gold to world markets, may place quantities of the precious metal in a reserve 
to back its beleaguered currency, which has "little credibility" in world 
markets. Such a move, by keeping future supplies of gold off the market, would 
make the metal more valuable, Serfaty said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that there is a single reason for the rise," he said. "It's 
rising for a combination of reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Serfaty said gold could reach $500 by mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
Silver rallied in reaction to gold's surge. The December contract at the New 
York Commodity Exchange rose 7.4 cents to $5.874 an ounce, and traders say it 
may soon breach the $6 barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum also surged, closing up $7.70 an ounce at $538.70. Barry Stuppler, 
president of the Encino-based Gold &amp; Silver Financial Group, said mined 
levels of platinum were low and predicted a steady increase in the price for 
the commodity. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar slipped to 1.8040 West German marks in Europe on Friday, down from 
1.8157 late Thursday and the lowest level since it stood at 1.7955 marks on 
Jan. 5. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.8010 marks, down from 1.8162 marks 
late Wednesday. The domestic market was closed Thursday.

'TIS THE SEASON TO SHOP, BUT IT'S OFF TO SLOW START; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: SHOPPERS FLOCKED TO STORES ON THE TRADITIONAL FIRST DAY OF CHRISTMAS 
SHOPPING. BUT SALES IN THE SOUTHLAND WERE CALLED DISAPPOINTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
America pushed aside the turkey and trimmings Friday and instead nibbled on the 
Christmas merchandise in the nation's shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Although thousands of shoppers flocked to the stores, many retailers and 
consumers found the turnout -- and appetite for buying -- somewhat light for a 
day that often is the busiest of the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet start," said Leonard Barron, a salesman at J. R. Jonathan's shoe 
store in the Sherman Oaks Galleria, at midday. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Rad, manager of Petite Sophisticate women's clothing store in the Glendale 
Galleria, said: "Before, money was no object. Now they (shoppers) are watching 
what they're spending." 
</P>
<P>
The disappointing sales at many stores throughout the Southland and the rest of 
the nation squared with the predictions of a number of retail industry experts. 
Among other things, analysts have said that shoppers may be getting worried 
about signs of a softening economy and bored with the merchandise retailers are 
offering this year. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Norton, a contractor from Burbank, is a case in point. Taking a break 
from shopping at the Glendale Galleria, Norton said he expects to spend about 
15% less than last year on gifts for his friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit just doesn't seem to be here," Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
His family's Christmas is "going to be nice but it's going to be less. I'm not 
going to buy the big-ticket items." 
</P>
<P>
"All year, it's sale, sale, sale," Norton added. "Who wants to go to another 
sale?" 
</P>
<P>
All the same, the retailers generating the most enthusiasm among customers 
seemed to be relying heavily on sharp markdowns -- a practice that once was 
limited mainly to the days immediately after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the markdowns stemmed from turmoil in the retailing industry that has 
brought such major companies as Campeau Corp. and L. J. Hooker Corp. to their 
knees. In Manhattan, for example, shoppers mobbed the flagship store of B. 
Altman, an old-line chain that, with the exception of one store, is being 
liquidated by Hooker to pay creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Customers waited outside in wintry temperatures for up to an hour for their 
turn inside. Barbara Haskett, a B. Altman spokeswoman, said frantic shoppers 
"were running up the down escalator to get upstairs, so we had to turn both 
escalators off temporarily. It was absolutely overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Two shoppers at Limited Express in Santa Ana -- Pat Almeida of Santa Ana and 
her daughter, Kristi Bowin -- found discounts of 40% on merchandise with prices 
already slashed in half. "We bought five pieces -- a skirt, a jumper, a top, a 
coat-sweater, a pair of pants -- and three sets of earrings -- all for $117," 
said Bowin. "Everything was on sale." 
</P>
<P>
Those specialty shops with genuine bargains, in fact, seemed to find no 
shortage of customers. At L. A. Eyeworks at South Coast Plaza, customers began 
lining up at 8:30 a.m. -- 30 minutes before the eyeglass store opened -- to 
take advantage of the annual sale that brought discounts as high as 70% and 
eyeglass frames for as little as $10. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the shopping at South Coast and in at least two 
other top Orange County malls, Newport Center/Fashion Island and Westminster 
Mall, didn't get busy until late in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Several shoppers at the University Towne Centre mall in San Diego, where the 
economy is heavily influenced by military spending, expressed concern over 
proposed defense budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Fisher, who works at defense contractor McDonnell Douglas in San Diego, 
said: "We'll spend pretty much as we always do, although we may stay within our 
budget more. We won't be as extravagant." 
</P>
<P>
Bus driver Joe Anderson, shopping at San Diego's downtown Horton Plaza, said he 
is cutting back on his Christmas spending. "The rent's going up, the gas and 
electricity rates are going up. Things are much too expensive here." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he is going to offer his children a choice between a Christmas 
present and "a crisp $10 bill." 
</P>
<P>
His prediction: "They'll take the bill." 
</P>
<P>
In some of the less-successful malls in the immediate Los Angeles area, the 
going was particularly slow for the day after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
At the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw mall, plenty of empty tables were available in 
the food court at noon. The biggest crowd was at the line to take pictures with 
the mall's Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those in line said they didn't intend to do much shopping, but that 
they had the day off and it seemed the best time to get pictures of their 
children with Santa. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Hills Mall in Culver City was so quiet in the morning that you could 
slide Santa down any aisle in the three-story plaza and not clip too many 
shoppers on the tote bag. Regardless of the "sale" signs that bristled in most 
stores, the watchword at the recently renovated mall was "quiet." 
</P>
<P>
With few customers, service at the mall was good, particularly at the small 
shops strung between anchor stores May Co., The Broadway and J. C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., four clerks circled a single shopper at Kay Jewelers. See's 
Candies: two workers, no shoppers. Personal Touch: two workers, one shopper. 
Sunglass Hut: two clerks, one shopper. The Gap: seven clerks, 15 shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's empty, very empty," said Michelle Adams of Los Angeles, a regular Fox 
Hills shopper. Adams clutched an armful of shopping bags as she wandered 
through the quiet mall. "I've been shopping since September, while I have the 
money. I'm here today because May Co. is having a big sale." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from trying to attract shoppers with price cuts, retailers also tried to 
provide some extra conveniences. Target stores, for example, opened at 7 a.m. 
and many others began business at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Hulac of Sherman Oaks was one of the early birds. By 6:45 a.m., Hulac 
already was posted in front of the Woodland Hills Target store waiting for the 
glass doors to slide open so she could get a jump on the traditional 
day-after-Thanksgiving crush of shoppers. She was surprised that the crush 
never came. 
</P>
<P>
"We went right up to the checkout stand" without waiting, Hulac said, after 
finishing about 2 1/4 hours of shopping. "It was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the overall trend appeared to be one of disappointing sales for 
retailers, there were some hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m., the big Houston Galleria shopping mall was packed. At the Omni, a 
downtown shopping mall in Miami with mostly business and tourist customers, 
Jordan Marsh's general manager, Joe Mazloom, reported that "business has been 
very good. People seem to be shopping much earlier this year." 
</P>
<P>
There were even signs of hope for retailers in the San Francisco Bay area, 
where merchants expressed optimism that the Christmas season would revive sales 
that have been sluggish since the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Near the epicenter of the temblor in Santa Cruz, retailers whose shops were 
destroyed in the quake opened for business in hastily erected tents near the 
downtown Pacific Garden Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected to be back in business for the holiday season," said April 
Shen, owner of the Shen Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Halladie Plaza, on the corner of Market and Powell streets and the heart of San 
Francisco tourism, was buzzing with action Friday morning. Shoppers formed 
lines that snaked around for nearly two blocks to ride the famous trolley cars. 
Food, T-shirt and jewelry vendors lined Powell street, as Christmas music 
blared from speakers. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan, throngs of eager shoppers moved more quickly on foot than the 
city's cabs and buses, caught in the gridlocked start of New York's annual 
Christmas season rush. With nearly five inches of Thanksgiving snow, the first 
on that holiday in more than half a century, there was no shortage of people in 
the Christmas shopping spirit. 
</P>
<P>
At Bloomingdale's -- the crown jewel of the otherwise crumbling Campeau 
retailing empire -- shoppers from as far away as England and Kansas have 
flocked to the city's flagship store. They bought up, among other things, such 
novelty items as a plastic foam brick wall for people to bang against their 
head, a "primal scream" golf ball and the $25 worry doll, a pliable pillow that 
dispenses prerecorded messages to make you feel better about mounting bills.

BANKS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW FED'S MOVE AND CUT PRIME RATE 
</P>

Major banks are expected to cut their prime lending rate from 10.5% to 10% next 
week following a further easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve this 
week, according to financial analysts. 
</P>
<P>
With the rates commercial banks pay for deposits and certificates of deposit 
coming down as a result of this and earlier Fed actions, analysts were sure 
banks would soon lower their prime lending rate. 
</P>
<P>
The rates charged by banks on most business loans and a growing share of 
consumer loans, such as home equity loans, are tied to the prime. 
</P>
<P>
"Money market conditions clearly warrant a downward adjustment in the prime," 
said William Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc. "Prime rate cuts will be universal by the middle of next week," 
he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
F. Ward McCarthy of Stone &amp; McCarthy, a Princeton, N.J., consulting firm 
specializing in money market analysis, agreed with Sullivan's assessment. "My 
guess is that you probably will see some prime rate cuts by the middle of next 
week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the latest Fed move, major banks are paying more than 2 percentage points 
less to acquire funds by issuing large CDs than they are receiving when they 
lend at the prime rate. 
</P>
<P>
There were widespread expectations of a prime reduction when the Fed dropped 
the federal funds rate from 8.75% to 8.5% two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It is typical in a falling-rate environment for the spread between the prime 
and the cost of funds to widen," explained McCarthy, because a wider spread 
boosts bank profits. "I think the banks will continue that kind of foot 
dragging" since their profits have been squeezed by a variety of factors, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, McCarthy said, many banks need to raise new capital to meet more 
stringent requirements being imposed by the Fed and other bank regulators. One 
way to do that is to raise profits and hold the extra money as retained 
earnings rather than paying it out as dividends. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed surprised most investors and analysts Wednesday by aggressively adding 
cash to the banking system at a time when the federal funds rate, the interest 
rate financial institutions charge each other for overnight loans, was at 
8.435%, already below the 8.5% level widely assumed to be the central bank's 
target. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day Wednesday, the key federal funds rate, the level of which 
influences most other short-term rates set by market forces, was down to 
8.125%, and most analysts decided that the Fed had eased policy another notch.

European Takeover Plans: The European Community Commission said it plans to 
propose new measures early next year to make corporate takeovers in the 
12-nation trade bloc easier. The commission said in a statement that takeover 
bids faced formidable legal obstacles in many member countries, but such 
roadblocks could be overcome by new measures and the application of current EC 
legislation. The commission said it wants, among other things, to strengthen 
the voting rights of shareholders and force bidders to outline their plans to 
target companies and their employees.

THOUSANDS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST SALES OF FURS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: SOUTHLAND SHOPS ARE AMONG THE TARGETS OF ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUPS 
MARCHING IN 91 CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

<P>
Carrying coats streaked with red paint and coffins filled with fur, several 
thousand animal rights activists marched in 91 cities throughout the country in 
the fourth annual "Fur-Free Friday" to protest the killing of animals for 
apparel. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 demonstrators were led down New York's posh Fifth Avenue by 
game-show host Bob Barker, chanting "Fur is Murder" and "Don't Buy Fur." A 
smaller march targeted Beverly Hills furriers, and South Coast Plaza in Costa 
Mesa was the site of another peaceful demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Barker, who resigned as host of the Miss USA pageant because winners were given 
furs as a part of their award, criticized the nation's fur farms as "animal 
concentration camps." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Buckler, executive director of the Fur Farm Animal Welfare Coalition, 
called the charge a "spurious allegation" and said "animals raised on American 
fur farms receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
About 75 demonstrators from five local animal rights groups picketed South 
Coast Plaza on Friday morning, christening the first official shopping day of 
the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest mall in the area and the biggest shopping day of the year," 
said Ava Park, founder of Orange County People for Animals. "We want people to 
realize fur is an inappropriate gift to buy for someone you love. We support 
fake fur . . . real fur is beautiful and it belongs on animals." 
</P>
<P>
Miami saw the day's only anti-fur violence. Employees of Grove Cleaners &amp; 
Furriers in the fashionable neighborhood of Coconut Grove arrived at work 
Friday morning to find red and blue paint covering the store's front windows 
and graffiti marking a nearby van. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Alfonso Zequeira, the store's owner, lashed out at the vandalism: "I 
don't think that's right. They have a right to express themselves, but I don't 
think they should vandalize the store." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida denied responsibility 
for the damage and blamed it on the furriers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, about 150 demonstrators marched down trendy Wilshire 
Boulevard, Canon and Rodeo drives protesting more than 30 furriers, including 
Nieman Marcus, I. Magnin and Bijan. 
</P>
<P>
Marchers carried tape recorders broadcasting the cries of wounded animals and 
wore bloody fur coats tangled in leg-hold traps, "the most common traps used to 
kill animals," said Dana Stuchell, national director of the animal rights group 
Trans-Species Unlimited and coordinator of Fur-Free Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Richard Westfall, watch commander of the Beverly Hills Police Department, 
said officers monitored the march, which was peaceful and orderly and didn't 
even snarl traffic. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people dressed in black marched in San Francisco's Union Square, in 
the heart of the downtown shopping district. "Fur is torture, don't buy fur," 
they chanted, picking their way through crowds of shoppers and gingerly trying 
to keep from stepping on panhandlers sprawling on the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
And in Harrisburg, Pa., where about 75 people marched, protesters filled a 
black coffin with about $10,000 worth of mink, fox and rabbit furs. The furs 
were splashed with red paint to signify blood, and a nearby sign said, "Fur is 
murder."

FREEDOM NEWSPAPERS BIDS FOR 31 SUBURBAN WEEKLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freedom Newspapers Inc., owner of the Orange County Register, is among the 
bidders for a group of suburban weekly newspapers in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties that were put up for sale last month by Media General Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The chain, Golden West Publishing Inc., includes nine papers that are part of 
South Orange County News in Mission Viejo, as well as 22 weeklies in northern 
Orange County and the San Gabriel Valley that are part of City of 
Industry-based Highlander Publications. 
</P>
<P>
Former Chicago Sun-Times publisher Robert E. Page, who sources said has 
finalized his acquisition of the Orange Coast Daily Pilot newspaper, is also 
believed to be among the bidders for the Golden West chain. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror Co., which owns The Times, is considering whether to make a bid. 
</P>
<P>
R. David Threshie, publisher of the Register, confirmed Friday that Freedom 
Newspapers had made an offer for the Golden West papers. He said it was 
premature to comment on how the publications would fit into the company's 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspapers have a combined circulation of 487,000, and nearly all of 
them are distributed free to community residents. Media General has said it 
wants to sell Golden West as a unit, but the South Orange County News 
properties -- such as the Saddleback Valley News -- are considered particularly 
attractive because they are in affluent and fast-growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
Media General Inc. of Richmond, Va., put the papers up for sale Oct. 17, 
stating that they were too remote, both geographically and strategically, from 
the company's core daily newspaper operations in the East. Media General could 
not be reached for comment on the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Redfern, chief executive of Golden West, said several companies have 
expressed interest in the papers and that there now appear to be three or four 
serious candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Redfern declined to identify the candidates, nor would he discuss what kind of 
price the papers might bring. But he said the consideration of the bids 
involved factors other than price, such as terms of the offer and antitrust 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
An acquisition of Golden West by Freedom Newspapers or Times Mirror could be 
subject to antitrust review because of the strong market presence of the 
Register and The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The interest of Freedom and Times Mirror in the weekly chain appears to be an 
extension of the fierce battle between the Register and The Times for Orange 
County readers and advertising dollars. A number of metropolitan newspapers, 
including the Chicago Sun-Times, have acquired suburban weeklies in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Media General had initially set a Nov. 17 deadline for all bids, which are 
being handled by Lee Dirks &amp; Associates, a newspaper brokerage firm in 
Birmingham, Mich. But the deadline was apparently extended to allow additional 
offers. An official at Lee Dirks declined to comment on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden West papers have annual revenues of about $15 million, and analysts 
say such publications normally sell for prices equivalent to their revenues. 
But the high level of interest could push up the price for Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Adams Communications Inc., owner of the Orange Coast Daily 
Pilot, confirmed that it was negotiating to sell the paper to Page, and a 
source said this week that the deal had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Page has not returned phone calls made to his Boston-based company, Page Media. 
</P>
<P>
Page is also believed to be pursuing the purchase of the Glendale News-Press.

DeLorean Court Order Set Aside: Lawyers for former auto maker John Z. DeLorean, 
whose Belfast-based car company went bankrupt in 1982, won a British court 
order setting aside an earlier court order against him for more than $51 
million. Judge Peter Gibson overturned a July, 1987, court order that allowed 
legal documents in the case to be served on DeLorean at his home in New Jersey, 
outside the jurisdiction of English courts. The ruling was the latest stage in 
a dispute between the liquidators of DSQ Property Co., incorporated in Northern 
Ireland and formerly called DeLorean Motor Cars Ltd., and DeLorean. Unstated 
damages had been claimed against DeLorean for alleged conspiracy, deceit and 
breach of fiduciary duty, Gibson said. In June, 1988, a judgment was entered 
against DeLorean, ordering him to pay more than $51 million. DeLorean, a former 
General Motors Co. executive, set up his plant in Belfast in 1978, employing 
more than 2,600 workers at its peak.

CIVIL WAR TURMOIL FROM EL SALVADOR SPILLS OVER TO L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATIONS: WORDS, NOT GUNS, ARE USED BY SALVADORANS LIVING HERE. WHEN 
VIOLENCE IN HOMELAND INCREASES, MORE PROTESTS AND IMMIGRATION ARE EXPECTED 
LOCALLY. 
</P>

<P>
The real battles are being fought with AK-47s and helicopter gunships in the 
mountain jungles of El Salvador and the working-class suburbs of its capital 
city. But with anywhere from 350,000 to 500,000 Salvadorans living in Southern 
California, some skirmishes from El Salvador's intensified civil war have 
inevitably spilled over into the Central American barrios of Pico-Union and 
Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Words, not guns, were the weapons of choice earlier this week when 200 
activists held a rally outside the Salvadoran Consulate near MacArthur Park, a 
few days after six Jesuit priests were assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
The consul general of El Salvador in Los Angeles, Jose Mauricio Angulo, 40, a 
cultured man wearing a pinstriped suit, stood at the window of his second-floor 
office, peeking from behind the curtains at the protesters below. 
</P>
<P>
Angulo, the owner of a cotton plantation in eastern El Salvador, said he is a 
"proud" member of the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), which 
in the past has been linked by human rights organizations to death squads. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, aware of Angulo's political affiliation, shouted a taunting 
chant up at the diplomat: 
</P>
<P>
"Arena, fascistas, asesinos de los Jesuitas!" ("Arena, fascists, assassins of 
the Jesuits!") 
</P>
<P>
The protest was one of more than a dozen organized in Southern California in 
the past two weeks after Salvadoran army troops and guerrillas of the rebel 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) battled over poor residential 
neighborhoods in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the political confrontations, the intensification of the civil war is 
likely to have lasting effects on the local Salvadoran community, the largest 
outside El Salvador. About one in 10 Salvadorans lives in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The battles in San Salvador have left thousands homeless as the Salvadoran air 
force bombed residential areas to root out guerrilla strongholds. After the 
Jesuit priests were killed last week, human rights workers began predicting a 
wave of political turmoil that could once again send thousands of people 
fleeing the country to the safety of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever there's been an increase in violence in El Salvador, we've seen a 
renewed influx of refugees," said Diane Jacoby, director of El Rescate, a Los 
Angeles refugee assistance agency. "We've argued for years that people come (to 
Southern California) because they're being pushed here. Now they're being 
pushed a lot harder." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles had a minuscule Salvadoran population before the early 1980s. 
Death-squad killings and the start of the civil war drove hundreds of thousands 
to Southern California, creating a vibrant Salvadoran community near downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jacoby said it is impossible to say how many Salvadorans will come as 
a result of the recent fighting, she said a large influx can be expected to 
have a severe impact on the community. According to refugee agencies, at least 
50% of the Salvadorans living in Los Angeles are illegal aliens and living 
below the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find more people on street corners struggling for jobs and more 
competition for the jobs that there are," Jacoby said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people waited to greet some of the first refugees who arrived 
Wednesday night at Los Angeles International Airport on TACA Flight 510. Maria, 
a 39-year-old resident of Cerritos who asked that her last name not be 
published, was looking nervously for her two nephews, Nelson, 12, and Luis, 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rescuing them," Maria said, explaining that she had paid for their airline 
tickets. "I don't want anything bad to happen to them. They're innocent. They 
don't have a thing to do with politics." 
</P>
<P>
After passing successfully through immigration and customs, Nelson and Luis 
received a warm embrace from their aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of crying, I feel happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Maria asked her nephews to say nothing about the fighting because any remark 
might endanger the life of their father, who stayed behind. But Nelson soon 
began describing how guerrillas and army soldiers battled for nine days to 
control his neighborhood in Mejicanos, a northern suburb of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"The people from the (guerrilla) movement were asking for help building 
barricades, and the army was bombing everywhere," Nelson said. "The helicopters 
went up and down; you could hear the rockets exploding. The people scattered 
like ants. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Others Salvadorans are expected to reach Los Angeles in the coming weeks after 
completing the tortuous land journey through Guatemala and Mexico. Most will 
probably pay a smuggler of immigrants to help them cross the U.S. border near 
San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
Julio, a 24-year-old exiled student activist who earlier this year was granted 
political asylum, said he and his family were making arrangements to bring his 
12-year-old brother from El Salvador along the land route. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for his papers to come through, but we might not wait that much 
longer," he said. "The risks that he might face on the journey are less than 
the risks of staying (in El Salvador)." 
</P>
<P>
While many Salvadorans were arriving in Los Angeles, one small group feared 
that they might be sent back. 
</P>
<P>
At a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center in El Centro, 
about 70 Salvadorans who had agreed to be deported changed their minds after 
hearing of the FMLN offensive and the killings of the Jesuit priests. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know what's going to happen there," said Richard Garcia, director 
of the Centro de Asuntos Migratorios, an immigrant advocacy group in San Diego. 
Garcia has been in contact with the detainees. 
</P>
<P>
"They're fearful that with the activity of the guerrillas dying down, there's 
going to be a backlash against people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the detainees threatened to go on a hunger strike if INS officials 
did not agree to halt or postpone their deportation. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials said Friday that deportations of Salvadorans had been temporarily 
stopped because of transportation problems caused by the fighting but would 
resume soon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, the small group of Salvadorans and their American 
supporters who oppose the government of Alfredo Cristiani stepped up their 
activity. They have held demonstrations almost daily since the FMLN launched 
its offensive Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Besides at least two protests outside the Salvadoran Consulate, they organized 
a rally last Saturday at MacArthur Park and a candlelight vigil Monday night at 
the Federal Building in Westwood. On Wednesday morning, they staged a mock 
funeral for the slain Jesuit priests and a sit-in in front of the downtown Los 
Angeles Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
For some Salvadorans, the protests are a chance to express their support for 
the rebel movement. At some of the rallies, protesters have hidden their faces 
with red bandannas in the style of the FMLN urban guerrilla fighters. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the struggle ever since it started 10 years ago," said one woman, 
an 80-year-old grandmother of 32 who was among the protesters outside the 
consulate. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who did not wish to be identified, said she was a trade-union 
activist in El Salvador. Here, she works as a housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be fighting until we win, because we are going to win," she said. "I 
have faith in God that we will win." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the consulate, at the receiving end of the protests, Angulo turned to a 
reporter and offered a succinct analysis of the situation. The protesters, he 
said, were merely puppets, "communists linked to an international plot to 
destabilize" El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very unpatriotic people, most of them brainwashed," said Angulo, who 
is also the brother-in-law of Roberto D'Aubuission, one of the founders of the 
Arena party. "They've been here too long. They don't know the reality of El 
Salvador any more." 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Salvadorans in Los Angeles appear, however, to believe 
that a show of any kind of political allegiance is potentially deadly, even so 
far from their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's rally outside the consulate, Luis Martinez, 39, and two of his 
friends -- all from El Salvador -- stood on the sidewalk, watching the protest 
from what he said was a safe distance half a block away. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be careful," said his friend, Juan Antonio Gonzales, 27. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he and his friends were walking through the neighborhood when 
they saw the protest, which was being covered by several television news crews. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to see what was happening," Martinez said. "But we're just here 
watching; we're not taking sides. We can't. Life is the important thing."

1 KILLED, 7 WOUNDED IN MAJOR TURF BATTLE;

A major turf battle between gangs fighting for control of a neighborhood west 
of downtown Los Angeles erupted Thursday afternoon and spilled into Friday, 
claiming one life and leaving at least seven injured, including a pregnant 
16-year-old who was shot in the abdomen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men injured Friday was listed in "significantly grave condition" at 
the Hospital of the Good Samaritan with multiple gunshot wounds , hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A second woman who was walking in the area -- described as one of the most 
dangerous in the city -- was left paralyzed from the neck down after she was 
hit by a stray bullet Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The violence was believed to be associated with a dispute between an 
established Latino gang -- the 18th Street gang -- and the more recently formed 
Crazy Riders gang, which includes large numbers of Central Americans, Los 
Angeles Police Detective Andy Cicoria said. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been one of the busiest days of my life," Cicoria said Friday. "It's 
terrible to think that this situation is going on in downtown Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"This is really bad, even for this area," Los Angeles Police Detective Terry 
Wessel said. "This is a major problem for such a short period." All the 
shootings took place within 24 hours in a two-square-mile area east of 
drug-ridden MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
The violence culminated Friday afternoon with the wounding of four youths 
identified by police as members of the Crazy Riders. The four, along with 
another Crazy Rider member, reportedly drove a black Chevrolet south off 3rd 
Street onto Witmer Street -- established 18th Street gang territory. Armed with 
baseball bats, tire irons and clubs, they turned into the parking lot behind 
the L.A. Downtown Swap Meet, where they confronted 18th Street gang members, 
Wessel said. 
</P>
<P>
Outnumbered by their rivals, the intruders jumped back into their car, which 
stalled when they tried to flee the scene. They were immediately surrounded by 
18th Street gang members who began to beat their car with bats and clubs, 
Wessel said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the suspects outside of the car produced a weapon and fired at least 
three shots into the car, striking a passenger and the driver," Wessel said. 
</P>
<P>
Managing to start the car, the five youths drove off and continued south for 
four blocks to the corner of Witmer and Wilshire Boulevard, where they collided 
head-on with another car. The occupants of that car suffered minor facial cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Owen McComb arrived at the scene almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up as they were getting out and they tried to assault me with a 
baseball bat and tire irons," McComb said. "But they didn't have a 9-millimeter 
(pistol) and I did. They dropped their bat and tire irons." 
</P>
<P>
He said four of the men in the car had suffered gunshot wounds but a fifth was 
not injured. Three of the wounded were taken to County-USC Medical Center and a 
fourth to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan. 
</P>
<P>
All of the shootings occurred in traditionally Mexican neighborhoods that have 
been giving way in recent years to an influx of Central Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Crazy Riders gang, which is about 5 years old, has grown to include at 
least 150 members, many of them from Central America, police say. By 
comparison, the 18th Street gang is at least 40 years old and has about 500 
members, police say. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting incidents began at 4:45 p.m. Thursday when 26-year-old Irma 
Rodriguez, "walking on the sidewalk and minding her own business, caught a 
stray bullet in the neck," Wessel said. That location is in territory where 
Crazy Riders graffiti is spray-painted on many walls and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, although paralyzed, was listed in stable condition Friday at the 
County-USC Medical Center. She was shopping with friends when she passed 
suspected gang members who were chasing a man several hundred feet away, Wessel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the men pulled a handgun from his waistband and fired a round at the 
fleeing man," Wessel said. "The bullet struck this lady in the neck." 
</P>
<P>
Five hours later and half a block away, a 16-year-old girl was sitting on the 
front steps of an apartment building on South Westlake Avenue with about half a 
dozen gang members. Witnesses said a car carrying four men sprayed bullets at 
the apartment before speeding away. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was struck in the stomach and left knee, Wessel said. She was taken by 
friends to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan, where she was listed in stable 
condition after stomach surgery, a hospital official said. Hospital officials 
said they hope that the surgery saved the fetus. "But it's too early to tell," 
nursing supervisor Gayle Lozyk said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials declined to identify the victim because she is a minor. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Carrasco, 42, manager of the apartment where the 16-year-old was shot, 
suffered a minor injury when a stray bullet grazed his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
In what police believe may be a related incident early Friday, an unidentified 
16-year-old Latino died a block and a half away in a shooting in which gang 
names were exchanged, Wessel said. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen youths who said they were members of the Crazy Riders stood 
around the entrance of the apartment Friday morning where the 16-year-old girl 
and Carrasco were shot. Blood still stained the steps leading up to the 
2-year-old building that was pockmarked by the stream of bullets fired from the 
passing car the night before. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the apartment said the pregnant girl was a "home girl" who 
associated with the Crazy Riders and whose sister lives in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The Crazy Riders' placa, or logo, is spray painted on the sides of buildings 
along a two-block stretch of Westlake between 7th and 9th streets. Some 
merchants and apartment managers say they have to paint over the graffiti 
almost weekly to keep it from covering their buildings. A few blocks away, 
however, the 18th Street placa is dominant. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the neighborhood and some merchants say they are fed up with the 
violence that has become commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm moving," said a woman who identified herself only as Dee Dee. She said she 
was lying in her first-floor apartment when two shots flew over her head 
Thursday night from one of the drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense," she said, her hands trembling as she took a drag 
on a cigarette. "They should make them stop hanging out here." 
</P>
<P>
While gang violence has been most prevalent after dark, some residents say they 
now fear going out during daylight as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes on almost every night, and now this," said Julia Lopez, who arrived in 
Los Angeles from Guatemala two years ago with her husband and three children. 
"It scares us very much. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to better our lives here, but it looks like this is no way to live 
because there are so many cholos (gang members)," she said.

CITY BEGINS CRACKDOWN ON HOLIDAY TRAFFIC JAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to ease traffic congestion caused by holiday shoppers, the city of 
Los Angeles on Friday deployed a helicopter, 18 tow trucks and dozens of police 
and traffic control officers to begin a crackdown on errant drivers and 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department and the city's Department of Transportation targeted 47 
downtown intersections and nearly two dozen trouble spots in the San Fernando 
Valley, West Los Angeles and Hollywood. It is the second straight year the city 
has used the special traffic control plan to try to ease the holiday crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the season, police are expected to issue hundreds of tickets to 
jaywalkers and to drivers who violate the city's "anti-gridlock" ordinance, 
which makes it illegal to be caught in an intersection when the traffic signal 
turns red. And they got started on Friday with what officials said was a higher 
than normal number of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Police said jaywalking tickets sometimes end with a warning, rather than a 
fine. The fines for "gridlock" violations begin at $50. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transportation stationed 75 traffic control officers at key 
intersections during rush hour to keep traffic flowing. Officials said they 
will "vigorously enforce" peak hour no-stopping restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The special enforcement officers have been deployed from elsewhere in the 
police and transportation departments. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the enforcement measures, traffic was moving very slowly in some parts 
of the city Friday afternoon and some downtown areas were "totally gridlocked," 
said Sgt. Jack Sommers of the Central Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports indicated that a higher-than-usual number of citations had 
been issued to drivers who violated the anti-gridlock ordinance and pedestrians 
who crossed streets in the middle of the block, Sommers said. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday traffic plan, in its second year, will remain in effect through 
late Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we saw that by targeting some of the most heavily used intersections 
in the city, we can greatly reduce traffic tie-ups throughout the city," Mayor 
Tom Bradley said. "I urge all drivers to closely follow posted parking 
restrictions and speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
"For a shopper who is trying to rush home from work to a store, or for those 
trying to get home after a long day of holiday planning, our traffic-reduction 
actions are the best gift in town," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic control officers have been directed to pay special attention to 
potential traffic problems on streets and access routes surrounding major 
shopping malls, Bradley said. In addition to using a helicopter to spot 
congestion, the Department of Transportation will use its automated 
surveillance control system to monitor traffic conditions. The system uses 
electronic sensors in the Central Business District to relay information about 
traffic volume to a central office, where operators can adjust traffic signals 
to ease flow. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be lots of people towed and lots of people ticketed if they don't 
pay attention to the signs," said Bill Bicker, Bradley's transportation 
coordinator.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVE SEEKS TO MOVE METRO RAIL TERMINUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state senator and two Los Angeles city councilmen, joined by representatives 
of San Fernando Valley homeowner and business groups, Friday announced a 
petition drive to shift the northern terminus of the Metro Rail subway westward 
from North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 7.6-mile extension plan was co-authored by state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude. Robbins and another 
petition backer, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, appeared at a news conference 
Friday in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Current plans call for Metro Rail to link downtown, where the southern end is 
under construction, to North Hollywood, with the possibility of light rail 
lines crossing the Valley westward from there. The extended subway is among 10 
options that the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is considering 
for the Valley.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUPLE'S BODIES FOUND AT BASE OF SAN PEDRO 
CLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man and a woman fell or jumped to their deaths from a rocky 150-foot cliff 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Point Fermin Park in San Pedro, police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Jerry Rilling said investigators believe the couple 
probably jumped because they had to deliberately climb over a fence to get to 
the edge of the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies, discovered shortly before noon in rocks at the base of the cliff, 
were airlifted by helicopter several hours later and examined nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Rilling said the man carried out-of-date identification with an address in 
Hawthorne and the woman carried no identification. The man was in his early 40s 
and the woman in her late 30s.

Twenty-one tons of cocaine is nothing to sneeze at. So, before police stormed 
the Sylmar warehouse that in September yielded the biggest drug bust in 
history, they turned to the best nose in town. 
</P>
<P>
It just happened to be dark and moist and attached to the snout of Dandy Vom 
Sargau, a graying, 9-year-old German shepherd who works nights for the Monrovia 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
When the dog was asked to sniff a tattered cardboard box that had been 
discovered outside the warehouse, he exploded in a snarling fury that police 
said could only mean he had detected a trace of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the officers knew that Monrovia had a great dog," said Drug Enforcement 
Administration spokesman Ralph Lochridge. "His alert on that box was a part of 
the overall probable cause that led to the search warrant." 
</P>
<P>
While another well-trained hound probably could have also followed his nose to 
the same conclusion, those who know Dandy say that his experience and 
consistency have made him top dog in the drug-sniffing department. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every San Gabriel Valley law enforcement agency -- even those with 
their own canine units -- have asked Dandy for help. He has also performed 
searches for the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, California Highway Patrol, the Postal Service, Secret Service and 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's ever made a mistake," said Jake Jahelka of Canine K-9 
Scents Inc., whose academy in Canyon Country has provided narcotics training 
for Dandy and about 50 other dogs in police departments across the western 
United States. "His heart and intensity stand way out." 
</P>
<P>
For the 85-pound shepherd, who understands commands only in German, it is all 
just one big game. 
</P>
<P>
In his youth, Dandy was trained to search for a terry-cloth towel that officers 
would lace with the scent of cocaine, heroin or marijuana. When he found the 
towel, it was his to chew on. 
</P>
<P>
Now, when he is asked to find the real thing, the dog thinks it's another 
version of hide-the-towel, says his handler, Monrovia Police Officer Rick 
Miglia. 
</P>
<P>
In his six years of duty -- which will end in January when the dog retires -- 
Dandy has played the game at least 450 times, leading to seizures of cash and 
narcotics valued at more than $1 billion, Miglia said. The Sylmar bust alone is 
expected to earn the Monrovia department $55,000 as its cut of the drug cash 
that was seized. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks it's fun," said Miglia, a 10-year veteran. "He doesn't know what 
coke or heroin or marijuana is. All he knows is that towel." 
</P>
<P>
Not that his training hasn't had its rigors. Dandy isn't allowed to eat 
anything other than the dry dog food Miglia feeds him, a rule that helped keep 
him under control when he was once asked to search a meat market. 
</P>
<P>
Sex is strictly prohibited, thus limiting distractions in the event that a 
female dog in heat should cross his path while on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in awe when I watch him work," said Monrovia Police Officer Scott Wiese, 
who handles Deister Vom Derbickelwiese, the department's other police dog. "It 
just freaks me out; he's so smart." 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1982, when Dandy was just a pup in his native West Germany, the Kiwanis 
Club of Monrovia launched a fund-raising drive to bring a canine patrol to 
their small city east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A local junkyard chipped in, a restaurant held a benefit dinner, and dozens of 
five-gallon water bottles at businesses around town were filled with the spare 
change of shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
The $20,000 raised was enough to purchase Dandy and a canine partner, Arko, who 
retired a year ago after putting the bite on a rapist. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such occasional incidents, the dogs are not vicious, their handlers 
say. They merely respond to the aggressiveness of the suspect, and then only 
when given a command to attack. 
</P>
<P>
Miglia, who takes Dandy home with him every day and will get to keep him when 
the dog retires, describes Dandy as a hard-working, well-mannered animal -- 
even if he does occasionally slobber on the windshield of their patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
"The cliche is that the handler's personality goes right down the leash to the 
dog," he said. "And it's unbelievably true."

FATAL BOAT WRECK OFF CATALINA IS MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Coast Guard searchers found more pieces of the cabin cruiser Lucky R, including 
its fuel tanks, which were intact and full, but still could not explain how the 
boat was wrecked on Thanksgiving Day, killing at least two people about 10 
miles north of Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Robert Reid, 84, and his wife, Thelma, 75, were found amid the 
splintered wreckage of the boat late Thursday afternoon. The body of the Hemet 
couple's son, Charles Reid of Long Beach, had not been found by late Friday. 
Relatives told the Coast Guard that Charles Reid, who owned the 40-year-old, 
34-foot Chris-Craft, also was aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the boat, which was normally docked at the Long Beach Marina, 
was spotted at 4:45 p.m. Thursday by the crew of the excursion boat Catalina 
Countess. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the debris that Coast Guard cutters picked up Friday were two 
15-foot pieces from the outside of the Lucky R's upper cabin, said Coast Guard 
Lt. Anthony Gentilella, commanding officer of the cutter Point Camden, one of 
two vessels that searched through the night and all day Friday for the younger 
Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Gentilella was not willing to officially list explosion as the cause of the 
wreck, but he said the two pieces, whose windows were blown out, indicate that 
a blast occurred inside the cabin and that the top of the boat was blown up and 
outward. 
</P>
<P>
There were no holes in the fuel tanks, Gentilella said, and "even the fittings 
that went up to the hull where you fill the fuel tanks were all together." 
</P>
<P>
However, there may have been other sources of fuel on the boat -- such as 
propane -- that could have caused an explosion. Pleasure boats like the Lucky R 
are powered by gasoline or diesel fuel but often have propane gas stoves in the 
galley. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has not ruled out the possibility that the boat was involved in 
a collision. However, there was little evidence to suggest that was the case. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gentilella, "Weather conditions were very good. It was daylight 
and (the boat) was not in the shipping lanes. Everything was going for them. 
That's another thing that makes it weird. If it was a large tanker that hit the 
boat, somebody would have seen it." 
</P>
<P>
But officials Friday were reluctant to speculate about the cause. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Gentilella said, Coast Guard investigators will try to piece 
together the dozens of splintered fragments that were recovered. They may seek 
the help of the Los Angeles Fire Department, he said, to analyze what look like 
small burn spots on some of the wood pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the elderly victims was wearing a life jacket, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the accident, whatever its cause, occurred not long before 
the wreckage was spotted. "One indication," said Lt. Chris Reilly, operations 
center controller at the Long Beach Coast Guard station, "is that the debris 
was in a pretty tight group. If it had happened a lot earlier, the debris would 
have been spread over a wider area." 
</P>
<P>
The search for Charles Reid will resume at dawn, said Lt. Jim Pierson, duty 
commander at the Coast Guard station in Long Beach. The ocean depth in the area 
is 2,500 feet, too deep for divers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a good chance he went down with the main body of the boat," said 
Gentilella. 
</P>
<P>
Autopsies on the elderly couple are still pending, a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office said Friday.

MARK MURPHY WINS THE WAITING GAME; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: HIS UNYIELDING STANCE ON VOCALS FORCED HIM INTO EXILE FOR A DECADE. 'IF 
YOU DON'T MAKE IT AT FIRST,' HE SAYS, 'YOU MAKE IT AT LAST.'

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Murphy has devoted a long career to singing the hippest music with the 
best musicians, and the economic consequences be damned. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the company he has kept on records: in the 1960s, Clark Terry, Dick 
Hyman, Roger Kellaway; in the '70s, David Sanborn and the Brecker Brothers; in 
the '80s, Frank Morgan, Richie Cole and the Azymuth Trio. Consider the jazzmen 
to whose instrumental works he has sung lyrics: Sonny Rollins, McCoy Tyner, 
Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Charlie Mingus, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Though he has enjoyed greater acceptance lately on his home turf, Murphy's 
uncompromising stance as a jazz singer forced him at one point into 
expatriation; he was based in London from 1963 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad time for all the boppers," he said, in a call from his San 
Francisco home. "All the undergrounders had surfaced in the late '50s and early 
'60s, then we had to scatter again and wait." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's approach to the vocal art has involved straight ballad singing, 
scatting, humming, whistling and occasional ventures into songwriting. He has 
been a chance-taker; sometimes the gambles haven't paid off, artistically or 
financially, but more often, especially during the past few years, he has ended 
ahead. If his version of "Take the A Train" involves silly quotes from "Mairzy 
Doats," it also entails wild wordless interludes that will recall for some a 
manic singer of the '40s named Leo Watson. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize," said Murphy, "that in jazz, to borrow a phrase from 
Colette, you don't make it at first, you make it at last. It's a waiting game. 
Sometimes a record will be released and it may surface months or even years 
later. It's because of the complexity of the material, or maybe the disc jockey 
just had a stomachache when he received it and didn't get around to listening 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Syracuse, N.Y., to a family of musicians, Murphy studied piano at the 
age of 7, played and sang with an older brother's dance band, began touring, 
and made his first album in 1957. An early and influential supporter was Steve 
Allen, who then had "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1960s, he was earning critical plaudits from expert observers; 
Gene Lees, then editor of Down Beat, became an ardent champion. But the decade 
of the Beatles was upon him, and Murphy found that critical approval didn't 
translate into cash. Ironically, an album he looks back on fondly as one of his 
best ever, "That's How I Love the Blues," was released just before he left for 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades he has built a commendable backlog of albums, among 
the most notable being a splendid collection of Ivan Lins songs, "Night Mood" 
(Milestone), produced in 1987 by the late Richard Bock. Next week, he will have 
two important credits: a four-day stint at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill in 
Hollywood, opening Wednesday, and a new album, "Then and Now -- Kerouac" 
(Muse). 
</P>
<P>
A belated sequel to his 1981 "Bop for Kerouac," the new release includes a 
monologue taken from "Big Sur," about driving frantically around San Francisco, 
and a passage from "On the Road" in which Kerouac recalled a jam session in 
Chicago by George Shearing. To the latter, Murphy attached an original song, 
with Bill Mays' music, to his own lyrics for "November in the Snow," its title 
inspired by the old Shearing hit "September in the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy continues to add to his stockpile of lyricized jazz works. In the new 
record are "Ask Me Now," the Thelonious Monk composition with lyrics by Ben 
Sidran, and the first-ever vocal version of Billy Strayhorn's elegiac "Blood 
Count," with words by M.E. Stillman. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever his schedule allows it, Murphy devotes time to teaching. "I have about 
a dozen students, and I do occasional clinics -- I did one recently at Berklee 
College in Boston. Next spring I may go and teach at a school in Graz, Austria, 
where Sheila Jordan has been a jazz vocal instructor." 
</P>
<P>
The Graz connection came about through a job Murphy took last year with George 
Gruntz, the Swiss composer and pianist, who toured Europe and the U.S. leading 
a large orchestra. In Hamburg, Murphy recorded an album of Gruntz's music. 
"That was a most interesting group to work with," he recalled. "Gruntz's music 
is somewhere between Gil Evans and Carla Bley. While I was over there Sheila, 
who was also with the orchestra, told me about the school." 
</P>
<P>
Indoctrinating foreign students in the art of jazz singing should be no more 
difficult than teaching Americans -- and no easier. "Sometimes," he said, "I 
simply have to say, 'Look, you are just not right for this, but if you like I 
can still help you.' Jazz can be very difficult, very taxing to the vocal 
cords. In fact, it's the hardest music to sing correctly, outside of grand 
opera. I have to drum a lot of technique into them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rough to teach people to develop an ear for music or for improvisation. 
It's better if they start out with some knowledge of an instrument like guitar 
or piano. When I'm doing a clinic, I'll take them through several choruses of a 
tune like 'Green Dolphin Street' until eventually they really are familiar with 
the song and what they can do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Presumably Murphy must also teach his pupils what he has learned the hard way: 
patience, and the realization that neither a perfectly honed talent nor a 
successful career will come easily. In his own case, he can finally say that 
Colette was right: After more than 30 years of striving, he didn't make it at 
first but has made it at last.

WANT TO RILE LIMBAUGH? COMPARE HIM TO DOWNEY OR GEORGE

Rush Limbaugh tries to distinguish himself from radio's new breed of "shock 
jocks." 
</P>
<P>
"I think talk radio has a rotten image these days because of that kind of 
stuff," he said. "It can hurt (the success of) people like me. . . . If you 
look at people who have endured in this business, they're not racist or 
vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
These days when a caller tells him, "I feel like you're more like the Morton 
Downey of radio," Limbaugh does not hang up on the man nor does he berate him. 
</P>
<P>
He counters with this logic: "Downey was known for being rude to people. Downey 
was profane. Downey was not a substantive conservative. If you think Morton 
Downey Jr. was a substantive conservative, then you don't know what one is!" 
</P>
<P>
A man waving a small American flag in each hand and calling himself Bobby Bible 
said he came to the Irvine show to "support a man that stands for decency and 
goodness, like Wally George." 
</P>
<P>
Limbaugh is not at all pleased with that comparison either. 
</P>
<P>
"Wally George is the last kind of person I want to be associated with. I want 
to be respected and taken seriously. I don't want the ultra far right, the John 
Birchers." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for all his ideology, Limbaugh mostly just wants to be loved -- and become 
an even richer Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not out to save the country," he says. "I'm out to get a large audience. 
I'm an entertainer first and a conservative second." CLAUDIA PUIG

SCHULLER'S NEW CENTER FAULTED FOR ITS SECULAR LOOK; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL'S $25-MILLION LATEST 
ADDITION DOES NOT LOOK RELIGIOUS ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Robert Schuller is just weeks away from unveiling another building in 
his Crystal Cathedral complex -- the four-story Family Life Center. A 
ribbon-cutting ceremony was held there on Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
But, already, the $25-million structure has been disparaged by some 
architectural analysts as not looking religious enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like every standard office building seen in the suburbs," said Robert 
A. Benson, associate professor of architecture at Miami University of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Only when construction is completed next year on a $5.5-million Prayer Spire at 
the Garden Grove church, said Benson, will the complex be "pushed back into the 
sphere of religion" architecturally. 
</P>
<P>
Prayer Spire 
</P>
<P>
Ground was broken two months ago for the 234-foot-high Prayer Spire, designed 
by noted architect Philip Johnson. Johnson also created the Crystal Cathedral, 
which some critics suggest looks more like a modern corporate headquarters than 
a place of worship because of its reflecting glass exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller's impact on American religious culture came under the gaze of Benson 
and other scholars at the American Academy of Religion's annual meeting in 
Anaheim early this week. The author of numerous books that reflect his 
unconventional "theology of self-esteem," Schuller and his Sunday services are 
seen by millions on his weekly television program. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, he agreed with the architectural critique. 
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose Family Life Center intentionally was designed to resemble an 
office building so that it could be leased as such in the future if the church 
ever needs money, Schuller said. When the building initially is opened in 
January, it will house a gymnasium and the offices for Schuller's television 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Well before the $20-million Crystal Cathedral was completed in 1980, Schuller 
said he talked with Johnson "about some kind of statement that could be part of 
the cathedral, that would mark it as a gathering place for the people of God." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller conceded that "the cathedral doesn't say from the outside what it is; 
it is incomplete without the spire. . . . We couldn't afford it at the time." 
</P>
<P>
The spire will house a 52-bell carillon and a chapel for which $1 million has 
already been donated. Narrow columns of polished stainless steel will cover the 
exterior. 
</P>
<P>
'Art-Deco Zigzag' 
</P>
<P>
Looking at architectural renderings of the steeple this week during a tour of 
the church, architectural historian Richard Guy Wilson of the University of 
Virginia, called the design "Art-Deco zigzag" referring to a design of the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also said that except for the cross atop the church's multistory Tower 
of Hope offices, nothing on the grounds visible from a distance identifies the 
complex as a religious center. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller founded the congregation in 1955, preaching to a small group at a 
drive-in theater. He later pioneered the drive-in church concept, and still 
addresses churchgoers both sitting inside the Crystal Cathedral and outside in 
their cars listening to the service on a short-range radio band. Two 90-foot 
doors on one side of the church open to expose the pulpit section to the 
parking area. 
</P>
<P>
More than one scholar who toured the church and attended a service last Sunday 
said he was disappointed that Schuller did not mention the slayings of six 
Jesuit priests in El Salvador last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The killings were horrible," Schuller said in an interview. "I probably should 
have said something but I had so much on my mind about what I had to cover in 
60 minutes," he said. At the same time, he added, "my messages go out to a 
television audience that hears it three weeks later. I cannot 'date' my 
message." 
</P>
<P>
Cost Questioned 
</P>
<P>
A recurring criticism over the millions spent on buildings was raised by Steve 
Shoemaker of the University of Illinois. Shoemaker said he went on two tours 
Sunday -- one at the Crystal Cathedral and one of downtown Los Angeles to view 
the plight of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wished the priorities were different," Shoemaker said, referring to the 
$25-million cost of the new Family Life Center. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller's response was that "an awful lot of (workers) have money this week 
because of the job opportunities at this building project, some of them from El 
Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller claimed that the structure will open debt-free, explaining that the 
last payment of $2.8 million, due Jan. 31, will be covered by $3.5 million in 
outstanding pledges. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, last Sunday from the pulpit and through a full-color brochure, 
the pastor urged his congregation to increase their contributions 25% during 
1990 because of the added costs of maintaining the building. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller said he draws an average of 6,000 people to his three Sunday services 
each week.

CHURCH-GROWTH ANALYST LEADS IN SURVEY OF INFLUENTIAL FIGURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most influential figure among most Protestant church leaders today is not a 
great preacher or theologian, but a veteran analyst of church-growth problems, 
according to a recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle E. Schaller, of the Yokefellow Institute in Richmond, Ind., was named most 
often (43%) by 1,497 national and regional denominational leaders in 
questionnaires answered in 1988 and early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Following Schaller in overall influence were Roman Catholic writer Henri Nouwen 
(39%), religious historian Martin E. Marty (36%), theologian Robert MacAfee 
Brown (29%) and evangelist Billy Graham (29%), said sociologist William 
McKinney of Hartford Seminary in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney said that the theological perspectives of the respondents determined 
who they named as the "most influential" writers or activists. 
</P>
<P>
Schaller was the only person mentioned in the Top 10 by theological liberals, 
moderates and conservatives. Brown, who tops the liberal list, was mentioned by 
only 6% of conservatives. Graham, who led the conservative list, was cited by 
only 3% of the liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Second to Graham in influence among theological conservatives was Christian 
psychologist-broadcaster James Dobson of the Pomona-based Focus on the Family 
Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, co-author of "American Mainline Religion" with Wade Clark Roof, said 
he sent 3,417 questionnaires to church leaders of six Protestant denominations 
and the National Council of Churches. He reported the findings at the recent 
annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what religious and secular periodicals they read most, theological 
liberals and moderates listed the ecumenical magazine Christian Century first, 
and the religious conservatives named the evangelical magazine Christianity 
Today most frequently. Second most frequently mentioned publications were the 
New York Times (liberals), Newsweek (moderates) and Reader's Digest 
(conservatives).

BOB GREENE: WHAT'S IN A NAME -- AND A DECADE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An editor for one of those trend-setting, Manhattan-based glossy women's 
magazines called with a question: 
</P>
<P>
What did I think would be a good name for the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
I thought I might have misunderstood. "The '90s haven't even started yet," I 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that," she said. "But we are asking several people to come up with a 
name for it." 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of a name?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything you want to name it," she said. "Sort of like the 'Me Decade,' but 
for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
"No one even has any idea what's going to happen in the '90s," I said. "Usually 
people wait until a decade is over -- or at least until it's been around for a 
few years -- to give it a name." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but we want to get this into our January, 1990 issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
I began to understand. In this hurry-up world of intense media competition, no 
one wants to be last -- or even second -- to hit the airwaves or the public 
prints with a concept. Granted, no one has any idea what the '90s will be like, 
but if you wait until 1998 or 1999 to name the decade, you're going to be 
standing at the end of a very long line. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to the real point here: if you think of the '90s as a person, 
you've got to feel a little sorry for the poor guy. Born into a world he never 
made, he's facing disadvantages that the decades preceding him could not have 
even imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Most decades are allowed to be born, to feel their way around for a couple of 
years, to develop a personality, to mature and then to fade peacefully away. 
The '90s, though, are going to have to hit the ground running. As a matter of 
fact -- thinking again of the '90s as a person -- this poor baby has been 
forced to sprint full speed while he is still in the womb. I think it was 1987, 
maybe 1988, when magazines started heralding "the end of the '80s." The decade 
was over, or so we were told, even though the calendar indicated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Part of this was based on societal trends; the pundits had decided that greed 
and ruthless acquisitiveness, which they associated with the '80s, were going 
out of fashion -- a questionable assertion at best, but one from which the deep 
thinkers extrapolated the idea that not only was greed dead, but so was the 
whole decade. Thus, for the last couple of years, we seem to have been living 
in the '90s -- or so you would believe if you keep up with the popular press. 
</P>
<P>
Any new performer, politician, or "personality" who comes along is referred to 
as "the (pick your noun) of the '90s." No matter that we're not there yet. The 
most obvious example is Arsenio Hall, who has been called "the talk-show host 
of the '90s" so many times that he would have every right to dread the stroke 
of midnight this New Year's Eve. Having been credited with conquering the '90s 
before the decade is even a day old, Hall has nothing to gain and everything to 
lose when the first day of 1990 actually rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
The same with the Oakland A's ("the baseball team of the '90s"), Michelle 
Pfeiffer ("the actress of the '90s"), Infiniti ("the car of the '90s") and all 
of the other people, places and things who have, before the fact, been chosen 
to epitomize the decade. They are all part of an era that has become so 
impatient with today that tomorrow must be willed into existence well in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
Save your true compassion, though, for the '90s itself. Thinking of the decade 
once more as a person, the poor, puzzled fellow is going to arrive right on 
schedule -- only to be greeted by a nation that will gaze upon him and think, 
"You again?" The '90s have been with us in spirit for so many months now that 
when the decade actually shows up, much of the country will be bored with it 
without knowing precisely why. 
</P>
<P>
But back to the magazine editor from Manhattan, and her request for a name for 
the '90s. She did not seem interested in hearing reasons why it makes no sense 
to name a decade before the decade starts; she seemed interested in getting a 
name for it. Just doing her job. 
</P>
<P>
"All right," I said. "The '90s is the last decade of the century, right?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then how about something along the lines of 'Get Us Out of Here'?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Get Us Out of Here Decade'?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a thought," I said. Happy New Year, everybody.

WESTMINSTER HIGH ATTACKS STAGGERING DROPOUT RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WESTMINSTER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask the students in Anji Clemens' third-year English class where they're from, 
and a blizzard of responses come back. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam," answers the largest group, a cluster of about half a dozen students; 
Mexicans, Ecuadoreans and other Latinos form the next largest bunch, followed 
by an array of Asians, including Japanese, Chinese and Koreans. One girl 
sitting near the back of the room is from Europe, and a few Afghanis and an 
Ethiopian round out the eclectic mix. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a majority of minorities," said Bonnie Maspero, the new principal at 
Westminster High School, a sprawling, 2,300-student campus in central 
Westminster. "This school represents what California will be like 25 years from 
now." 
</P>
<P>
But if Westminster High offers a glimpse of the future, it also suggests that 
there are formidable challenges ahead. The school already has struggled for the 
past decade to accommodate its demographic changes, in the process battling a 
decaying campus, low test scores and a staggeringly high dropout rate, one of 
the highest in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, those problems would be enough to make some school officials throw up 
their hands in defeat. But Westminster is fighting back with a rejuvenating 
dose of investment from the Huntington Beach Union High School District and a 
focused staff effort to turn the tide. 
</P>
<P>
The district has pumped $150,000 into physical improvements at the school and 
is also funding a novel pilot program to combat the high numbers of dropouts, 
the school's most troubling and persistent problem. Districts receive state 
funds based on the number of students who attend classes, so dropouts take a 
financial toll as well. 
</P>
<P>
More than 260 Westminster students dropped out last year. Another 268 left the 
school to enter alternative education programs. Most who transfer to 
alternative education end up dropping out, so officials estimate that nearly 
20% of Westminster's student body left school without diplomas last year. 
</P>
<P>
That dropout rate is twice the average for other schools in the district. At 
the low end of the scale, Edison High School, in Huntington Beach, has a 
dropout rate of 1.1%. Countywide, an estimated 7.2% of the county's students 
drop out of school, according to Orange County Department of Education 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although cautioning that its statistics are sketchy, the Education Department 
lists the high school districts in Fullerton and Anaheim as the two suffering 
from the highest dropout rates in Orange County. In the districts, dropout 
rates average 12.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Across the county, dropout rates often parallel a school's ethnic breakdown. 
Many immigrant children come from struggling families and must work to help 
support themselves. As a result, schools with large numbers of immigrants often 
have high dropout rates because children study just long enough to learn a few 
skills, then leave to work full time. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster High is no exception. Anglos make up just 46% of the student body, 
down from about 90% two decades ago. Asian students make up 25% of the school 
population, and 37% of the students who dropped out. Asians make up the largest 
group of Westminster dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
As the school's student population has changed, dropouts have soared. Officials 
say that part of the high turnover rate can be attributed to the transient 
nature of residents living in rental apartments surrounding the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last 15 years, even before we were keeping accurate numbers, we knew 
that Westminster High School had the highest dropout rate in the district," 
said Cathy McGough, the district's Alternative Education/Dropout Study 
coordinator. "They have a real problem, and it's gotten even worse in recent 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by that history, Maspero quickly set out to attack the school's dropout 
problem when she took over as principal last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"She immediately took it on as her mission," McGough said. "She came on board, 
and we dove right in." 
</P>
<P>
Some programs already were in place, but the cornerstone of the school's 
redoubled efforts is PLUS, Positive Learning Units for Students. Under PLUS, a 
new program developed by Maspero and several Westminster teachers, 50 
youngsters are enrolled in special classes where they get additional attention, 
slightly smaller classes and closer monitoring than most Westminster students. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 students -- who were identified as being "at risk," based on their 
eighth-grade attendance patterns, grades and other factors -- volunteered for 
the PLUS program, and the district agreed to give about $50,000 to test it. All 
students in the program are freshman, and most are minority students. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say they will consider PLUS a success if dropouts decline by at least 
10% this year, which would mean at least 25 students rescued from an uncertain 
future. What's more, Maspero and others note, it would mean the program paid 
for itself by boosting school revenue, which is based on students' average 
daily attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Maspero will deliver a year-end report to the district on the program's 
success, and school officials hope that more money next year will allow them to 
expand it to more students. 
</P>
<P>
Under the PLUS program, students are guaranteed a student-teacher ratio of 25 
to 1 in a school that averages more than 30 to 1. In addition, two dropout 
counselors have been hired to help students stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are handpicked for the program, and parents must agree to monitor 
their children's homework for one hour a night, four nights a week. Parents are 
also expected to attend at least three conferences with teachers during the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"A parent is an extremely powerful ingredient in a student's success," Maspero 
said. "We're saying, 'We want you (the parent) here. We expect you to be here.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
For the students, PLUS can mean a tough workload, because smaller class sizes 
make it harder to escape attention. Still, several students interviewed about 
the program endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not so many students, so the teacher helps you more," said Anh Ho, a 
ninth-grader who is enrolled in PLUS. She and her classmates were studying 
equations in science one day earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Madrigal, another ninth-grade PLUS student, said he was in the program 
because he had avoided his schoolwork in earlier grades. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in this because I'm smart and everything, but I'm lazy," he said, 
fidgeting outside his classroom. "This lets me be in a smaller class, and it 
means you get to be with the same people for three periods." 
</P>
<P>
Dropout rates are computed by measuring the number of students who do not 
attend any school for at least 45 consecutive days, so it is too early to judge 
whether Westminster's program is producing the hoped-for results. But teachers 
and students at the school, as well as administrators at the district, agree 
that the turnaround is already under way. 
</P>
<P>
Self-esteem programs are working to improve students' self-image, they say, and 
physical improvements have put a new sheen on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster High's irrigation system, which for years languished in disrepair, 
has been fixed, and green patches now are spreading across the once-brown lawn. 
Water fountains torn from their casings years ago have been replaced, and a new 
computer center is being built. 
</P>
<P>
More important, teachers say they sense a new enthusiasm from the PLUS pupils. 
With luck and hard work, they say, PLUS may transform its students just as the 
physical renovations have transformed the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are feeling success about themselves and their program," said Liz 
Haley, who has taught at Westminster High for 25 years. "We're trying to get 
these kids what they need, and so far, they seem to be getting it."

SANTA ANA TO HOST TALKS ON 18-MILE MONORAIL; 
</P>

TRANSPORTATION: FOUR CITIES WILL BE ASKED TO SUPPORT A SYSTEM LINKING ANAHEIM 
IN THE NORTH WITH JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT AND IRVINE IN THE SOUTH.

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana officials are scheduled to meet next week with leaders of surrounding 
cities to discuss plans for a futuristic, 18-mile monorail line that would run 
through the heart of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young said the meeting Thursday with the mayors of 
Irvine, Orange, Costa Mesa and Anaheim should help determine if those cities 
support the idea of an integrated, regional commuter system. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to kick off a top-level planning effort to not only have it run 
in Santa Ana but through the entire central core of Orange County," Young said. 
"Through cooperation among just five cities, we could have an 18-mile system." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cities have already hatched similar plans of their own and may 
welcome the opportunity to join Santa Ana to pursue a monorail system cutting 
through the county's busiest office and commercial districts. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officials have talked about a people mover. In Irvine, city leaders 
have gone even further, joining with a private firm that builds monorails to 
study a system that would link John Wayne Airport with a new train and bus 
station being built on the city's southern flank. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials also are considering participating in the study with Irvine 
and Florida-based Transportation Group Inc. The Santa Ana City Council is 
expected to discuss the matter Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Group Inc., a subsidiary of giant Bombardier of Canada, is 
slated to build a short monorail spur to ferry passengers from the airport 
terminal to an office complex planned nearby on MacArthur Boulevard by 
McDonnell Douglas Realty Co. Plans for that half-mile-long spur helped spark 
the current proposals for a more ambitious regional system. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned, a regional monorail network could link Disneyland and Anaheim 
Stadium in the north with the MainPlace shopping mall and Civic Center in Santa 
</P>
<P>
Ana, and continue south, serving several large office developments, John Wayne 
Airport, and the sprawling Irvine Spectrum office and industrial complex. An 
alternate line in Costa Mesa could connect with South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The backbone of the system would be a single line with monorails capable of 
about 60 m.p.h. running along a raised rail stretching from Irvine in the south 
through Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and Orange, then terminating in Anaheim. 
Lower-speed monorail lines would branch off the main system to ferry passengers 
to locations to the east and west. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the monorail network could be built along existing streets, 
requiring the purchase of little or no private property through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he believes that Santa Ana would play a key role in any regional 
monorail system because of its central location and position as the home base 
for county government. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Young said, residents of the city make up more than one-third of 
the passengers on Orange County Transit District buses, meaning that Santa Ana 
could provide a ready base of riders for the monorail system. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he would like to see the cities join together and seek proposals 
from firms willing to privately build and operate the monorail line. 
</P>
<P>
"We think now is the time to get out there and see who wants to put down rail 
along an 18-mile urban corridor," Young said. "We've come to the realization 
that monorail technology is no longer a toy. It's been transformed into 
something that's efficient and cost-effective for areas like Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
If necessary, he said, some public financing or assistance could be tapped. In 
Irvine, for instance, officials are hoping that a multimillion-dollar state 
rail bond initiative expected on the June, 1990, ballot will provide $125 
million for a monorail system in that city.

<P>
Santa Ana officials have already met with developers of several large office 
projects in the city to discuss helping fund a monorail line or even taking on 
the task of building stations, which represent about one-third the cost of the 
proposal, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"The developers would get the advantage of having mass transit delivered right 
to their doorstep, and we'd get the advantage of getting stations essentially 
for free," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Other Santa Ana officials are equally bullish on the idea of a monorail linking 
their city with others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of whether some system is built, it's a question of when," 
said David Grosse, Santa Ana's public works director. "We want to have a plan 
in place by next summer showing the routes, the stations, how it would be 
financed. . . . We could potentially have a system operating in five years." 
</P>
<P>
Grosse said a monorail system would have lower construction costs than a 
subway, as well as offering trains that are quiet and non-polluting. Support 
columns could be fitted into the median strip of existing streets, meaning no 
new property would have to be purchased for the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
For Santa Ana, an ultramodern monorail would also fit in nicely with the city's 
ongoing downtown redevelopment efforts, Grosse said. 
</P>
<P>
As yet, officials have not selected what type of monorail trains they prefer -- 
and the issue could potentially become a dividing point among the various 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Some seem to be leaning toward traditional monorails that straddle a single 
rail and ride on wheels inside the undercarriage. That basic design, which is 
the style marketed by Transportation Group Inc., is akin to the monorail in 
operation at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials, however, have suggested "magnetic levitation" trains, which 
use electromagnets to float the vehicle just inches above the tracks and 
provide propulsion.

TALL-TREE LAW IS CUT DOWN TO SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
This city is facing something of a tree crisis. 
</P>
<P>
It started with a neighborhood dispute that turned up a little-known city law 
that says trees used as a hedge on the perimeters of a person's land must be no 
taller than six feet. 
</P>
<P>
That came as news to Councilman Don MacAllister, who, at Monday's City Council 
meeting, said he has "trees taller than that all around my property. If we 
enforced that ordinance strictly, we'd have to cut down trees all over the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
At MacAllister's insistence, the council unanimously passed a resolution 
putting a moratorium on the tree-height-limit law for 30 days. "I'm going to do 
everything I can to get the ordinance changed," MacAllister said later. 
</P>
<P>
City staff concede that hundreds of property owners have evergreens taller than 
six feet that screen back and side yards. The staff also conceded that many 
trees would die if chopped down to a stubby six feet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an interesting case," said Michael Gregory, a land-use technician for 
city government. "I don't think we've ever had to enforce this before, and this 
case could go either way. I think that's why the City Council wanted some time 
to study it." 
</P>
<P>
The "case" Gregory refers to involves the home of Jerri and Glen Hesprich at 
6971 Garden Circle. The Hesprich home has 105 mature Italian cypress trees, 
ranging from 20 to 30 feet tall, planted at the edge of the back and side 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
A complaint was lodged about the Hesprichs' trees after the couple did not 
agree to a neighbor's plan for a new block-wall fence. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of privacy I can't give names, but it was a citizen's complaint that 
we received about the trees," Gregory said. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 16, the Hesprichs received a "notice of violation" from the city's 
Department of Community Development. That notice ordered them to top all their 
cypress trees "to a maximum of six feet" within 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
A professional tree expert, hired by the Hesprichs, inspected the trees and 
told them that cutting the trees to six feet would kill them. 
</P>
<P>
With only two weeks to save the trees, the couple decided to take their case to 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd heard that a citizen could speak to the council," Jerri Hesprich said. 
"Lots of people, though, told me it would be a waste of time, and that nothing 
would come of it." 
</P>
<P>
But when she made her brief speech to the council, action came quickly. 
MacAllister said he was appalled that a city law could threaten so many trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you realize how many trees would be involved if we strictly enforced this 
ordinance?" MacAllister said during the meeting. Later in the week, MacAllister 
said he had driven down Golden West Street "and I'd say that 50% of the houses 
I drove by have cypress trees (taller than six feet) on the back property 
lines. If the city tried to enforce the ordinance against all those trees, 
well, I'd have to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance in question, passed in July, 1988, states that "fences, walls or 
hedges a maximum of six feet in height may be located on the property line in 
required side and rear yards. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory, of the city's land-use staff, said Wednesday the city considers "trees 
as hedges when they are bunched together for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Paul Cook said this week that "unless a tree is drooping 
down onto someone's property or obstructing passage on a sidewalk, it's no 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Jerri Hesprich on Wednesday said she was greatly encouraged by the City 
Council's response to her plea. 
</P>
<P>
"People say you can't fight City Hall, but I found that City Hall will help 
you," she said. "The system works. I am very grateful."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MASS SUNDAY FOR SALVADORAN PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mass will be celebrated Sunday in the name of the people of El Salvador, 
where hundreds were killed this month during some of the most violent fighting 
in that country's long-running civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Father Jaime Soto, vicar for the Latino community in the Diocese of Orange, 
will preside over the noon Mass at St. Joseph Church, 727 Minter St. 
</P>
<P>
Soto said the Roman Catholic church is calling upon the United States 
government to negotiate a cease-fire and ensure the protection of Salvadorans 
not involved in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"We call upon all parties to turn from the violence, conflict and war to the 
essential processes of dialogue, negotiation and peace," Soto said in a 
statement.

The City Council moved this week to purchase property at the city's Amtrak dpot 
for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.3 acres will be leased to one or more businesses interested in selling 
food, gifts, periodicals and other items to train travelers, said Terry 
Swindle, the city's real property agent. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council approved paying $1 million to settle a pending lawsuit 
over purchase of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Up to $800,000 of the $1 million will be paid by the state. The city estimates 
it will pay about $290,000 for the remaining costs, legal fees and interest. 
</P>

Fullerton is negotiating with a local company to provide services at the

CLERK AMASSES ABCS OF OFFICIAL LINGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City business is becoming more user-friendly, now that the city clerk's office 
has compiled a list of guidelines and definitions to help the public decipher 
complicated government lingo. 
</P>
<P>
Starting this week, the list will be attached to every City Council agenda, 
said City Clerk Mary Ann Hanover. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines cover two sides of a single page. One side offers advice on how 
and when the public may speak during a council meeting. The other side 
deciphers an alphabet soup of initials associated with planning documents. 
</P>
<P>
It also gives the reader government-oriented definitions that sometimes alter 
the common meaning of words. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the guide sheet tells the reader that "resolution" is not 
something you promise yourself on New Year's Day, but rather a formal 
expression of council opinion. A "motion" is not a physical movement; it is a 
proposal for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to try to make things understandable to the public," Hanover said. 
"It's only fair. 
</P>
<P>
"Who really knows what a closed session is?" she added, noting the long list of 
obscure words spoken by bureaucrats. "We could talk for a month and nobody 
would know what we were saying." WENDY PAULSON

CORONA DEL MAR GIRLS CARRY OC'S BANNER

<P>
Unlike some of his peers, Tom Cheese, Corona del Mar High School girls' 
cross-country coach, never had any doubts that his team would be one of Orange 
County's best this year. With five returning runners from last year's squad, 
Cheese knew the Sea Kings had the nucleus of a very good team. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew in August how good we could be, but I don't think anyone else had a 
clue," Cheese said. "All season, I've sort of felt like I've been carrying 
around this big secret." 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret anymore. Corona del Mar, a team that was unranked in county 
polls until three weeks ago and then was ranked no higher than eighth, will be 
the only Orange County girls' team to compete in the California Interscholastic 
Federation state cross-country championships today at Woodward Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings, ranked third in Division II -- medium schools' division 
(enrollment 700-1,599 students) -- qualified as the Southern Section's top team 
in Division II last Saturday at the Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's first the trip to Fresno in the three-year history of the 
state meet caps a successful season. Last month, the Sea Kings won their first 
Sea View League championship since 1979. And last Saturday, the team placed 
fifth in the Southern Section 4-A final, its best finish in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The key has been their consistency in their training and their racing," Cheese 
said. "No one has missed a race because of an injury. They work well together 
as a team. They help and encourage each other." 
</P>
<P>
Kirsten McFarland and Johanna Wallin are the team's front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland, a sophomore, played tennis last fall as a freshman, then decided in 
the spring to go out for track. She made the varsity team, placed fifth in the 
league 1,600-meter final, and then announced to Cheese she would leave tennis 
for cross-country this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Wallin, the only senior in the top five, was the team's No. 1 runner last year, 
but has had trouble this season with minor illnesses and is still not 100% 
healthy, Cheese said. Even so, Wallin finished as the team's top runner 
Saturday, placing 16th overall in the 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Kristen Shryock, a three-year varsity member, freshman Heather Bray and 
junior Holly Hannam round out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cheese, in his third year as Corona del Mar coach, admits that his 
past teams have never been exceptionally aggressive as a whole, this squad has 
developed into one that's mentally tough. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since track was over, a few of the girls were talking about how great 
they wanted to do in cross-country this year," he said. "They were really 
motivated, and that attitude has just spread among the whole team. All of a 
sudden, the ones who have been real tough are a little tougher, and the ones 
who weren't as serious are turning into animals." 
</P>
<P>
One of today's most interesting showdowns will be between undefeated runners 
Shelley Taylor of Edison and Becky Spies of Livermore in the Division I girls' 
race at 10:35. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a sophomore, placed eighth in this race last year, a performance she 
has referred to with disdain, even though last year was her first season of 
competitive running. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do very good last year; I think I'll do a lot better this time," 
Taylor said last week. "I'm really pumped up for it. Last year, I wasn't even 
nervous before the race. I said 'Oh, this is such a joke.' I was this little 
freshman who didn't know what she was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor held off her strongest challenge of the year -- Westlake's 
Jeannie Rothman -- last week to win the 4-A title, Taylor will need a much 
better race to outrun Spies, the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Spies, a junior, ran a two-mile race on the track in 10 minutes 35 seconds last 
month, beating her closest opponent by nearly a minute and a half. To find 
better competition this year, Spies competed as an unattached runner in several 
open, college-level invitationals before joining her team midway through the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor also should face a strong challenge from Beth Bartholomew of Sunnyvale 
Fremont and Deena Drossin of Agoura, the state cross-country champion in 1987. 
Drossin, whom Taylor beat at the Mt. SAC Invitational in October, ran 17 
seconds faster than Taylor last Saturday to win the 2-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Taylor, Orange County will be represented in the Division I race by 
Tanja Brix of University, 10th last year, Martha Pinto of Katella and Susannah 
Thrasher of Villa Park. Tish Williams of La Habra will compete in the Division 
II race. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
In boys' competition, Saddleback and San Clemente will have their final chances 
to prove which is the county's best; both will compete in the Division I race 
at 10 a.m. today. Saddleback, the county's top-ranked team through most of the 
season, was defeated by second-ranked San Clemente in the Southern Section 
prelims two weeks ago but outran San Clemente by 15 points last Saturday to 
place third overall in the 4-A final. Of course, both teams have greater 
concerns than each other. Camarillo, which won the 4-A title with ease last 
week, is the state's top-ranked team and De LaSalle of Concord is a strong 
second. In state rankings, San Clemente is fifth, Saddleback seventh. . . . 
Other county runners competing are Trabuco Hills' Mike Cowdrey and La Habra's 
Mark Gonzales in the Division II boys' race. Laguna Beach will be in the 
Division III boys' race. . . . The overall individual boys' favorite is 
Agoura's Bryan Dameworth, the two-time defending state champion.

WITH LA QUINTA DOWN, PACIFICA READY TO MOVE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The balance of power in Garden Grove League basketball finally has shifted away 
from La Quinta High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, who have won six of the past 10 league championships and qualified 
for the playoffs 11 consecutive years, have no returning starters and might 
struggle for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no Scott Campbell (the leading scorer in the county last year)," La 
Quinta Coach Jim Perry said. "We only have two returning lettermen. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are some people in the league licking their chops waiting to 
play us." 
</P>
<P>
One of the teams waiting in the wings is Pacifica. The Mariners have 
experience, three starters returning and a dominating front line of seniors 
Mike Maher (6-7), Randy Schulze (6-6) and Tim Whalen (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos and Kennedy also are contenders, along with a new face, Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Rhett Heckel at Pacifica will win the league," Perry said. "They've got the 
big, strong, physical kids." 
</P>
<P>
Heckel doesn't quite see his squad as head and shoulders above the competition, 
even if he has the league's tallest team. 
</P>
<P>
Only one starter -- senior forward Jim Barker -- returns for Kennedy, and the 
Fighting Irish will need him. 
</P>
<P>
The league's best player, David Green, plays for the team most likely to 
challenge Pacifica -- Rancho Alamitos. In fact, Rancho Alamitos, the league 
champion junior varsity team, might even edge Pacifica. Green and first-year 
Coach Eric Hamamoto, a former Kennedy assistant who turned around the Rancho 
Alamitos girls' program last season, could take the Vaquerosto the playoffs for 
the first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches say there is a bit more parity among teams in the league this season. 
And a team such as Garden Grove, with new Coach Dewey Van Cleave, three 
returning starters and Banning High School transfer Mike Perry, has a chance to 
move into a playoff spot or, at the least, shake things up a bit. 
</P>
<P>
BOLSA GRANDE -- Once again Bolsa Grande will be working at an extreme height 
disadvantage and will find it difficult to climb out of the cellar. Senior 
forward Hinh Bui (6-0), a second team all-league selection, averaged 12 points 
a game last year. He returns with senior point guard Thai Nguyen (5-7), who 
averaged five assists a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be very small again this year and will try to use quickness to 
compensate for the lack of height," second-year Coach Tom Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
The team's tallest player is Austin Paek (6-4). Paek played little basketball 
before he arrived in the country from Korea last April but he will see action. 
</P>
<P>
GARDEN GROVE -- Dewey Van Cleave, who spent the past five seasons as the 
freshman coach at Foothill High School after coaching the varsity at Garden 
Grove from 1974-78, returns as coach of the Argonauts, who should improve on 
last season's sixth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Three starters return, including 6-3 senior Joe Squyres, a standout receiver 
for the football team. Also back are guards Jesse Moriles and Gilbert Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Joe Aguirre (5-10) and Tim Vasser (6-1) will contend for starting 
positions. "He could be an impact player," Van Cleave said of Vasser. 
</P>
<P>
The team is deep but, "We don't have that one big player, that 6-7 or 6-8 guy 
you need to really be a strong team," Van Cleave said. 
</P>
<P>
KENNEDY -- In 12 years, Coach John Mayberry and the Fighting Irish have had 
only one losing season (1980). Last year runner-up Kennedy was the only team to 
defeat league champion La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
The graduations of Mike Pettengill, the floor leader the past two seasons, and 
post players Tom Deep and Greg Hansell leave some big sneakers to be filled. 
Mayberry is looking to 6-7 sophomore Jermaine Galloway, the tallest player in 
school history, to move from the junior varsity and lend a hand on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
Varsity starter Jim Barker (15.5 points), a 6-3 senior and one of the league's 
premier long-range shooters, returns along with Jeff Williams, a 6-5 center who 
was selected to the all-league team as a water polo goalie this season. 
</P>
<P>
LA QUINTA -- Times are lean at perennial power La Quinta, which hasn't a single 
starter returning. 
</P>
<P>
"In size, we are very adequate," Coach Jim Perry said. "Paul Hastings, at 6-5, 
is our biggest player and we have a couple of 6-3 players. Everybody else is 
all-Munchkin." 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Wes Kollar (6-3, forward-center) and Trent Julian (6-3, guard-forward) 
are the team's returning lettermen and will join senior Hastings on the front 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Lloyd Bennett, a 5-9 guard, will handle the point. Lloyd is the 
younger brother of Kenny Bennett, a three-time all-league player at La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
LOS AMIGOS -- Coach Famous Hooks is excited about his team's chances of 
improving on last season's fifth-place finish, despite the graduation of 
two-time all-league player Carlos Palomino.

"We lost Carlos, that's a real minus," Hooks said. "But the rest of the kids 
are better than last year. We are tall and have quicker guards. No one can 
shoot as well as Carlos, but the team is overall more balanced than last year. 
We should be better." 
</P>
<P>
The Lobos look to improve with returning starters Andre Roberson (6-3) a junior 
forward who averaged 10 points and eight rebounds; senior guards Steve Poynter 
(5-11), who averaged eight points, and Walter Montes, (5-10), who averaged four 
points a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
PACIFICA -- The biggest front line in the league will have to fill two key 
graduations. 
</P>
<P>
Three-year varsity starter Dustin Bonham (19.9-point average), the school's 
all-time leading scorer, and Billy Maurer, who led the county in assists last 
season, have graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Center Mike Maher (6-7, 240) and forward Randy Schulze (6-6, 190) are returning 
varsity starters. Maher averaged 8.2 points and 7.4 rebounds last season. 
Schulze averaged 16.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Heckel calls Junior Kevin Gaughen (6-4) "one of the purest shooters I've 
ever coached." He played for a junior varsity team that finished 17-3. Gaughen 
should contend for the other forward spot. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Whalen, a 6-4 guard who can stand under the basket and dunk with two hands 
and who averaged about 24 points a game on the junior varsity, probably will 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Anil Hanuman, a 6-1 guard, returns to the varsity for the second season and 
will play the point. 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO ALAMITOS -- If he chooses to, Coach Hamamoto can put a big team on the 
floor to contend with Pacifica, a smaller quick team to contend with Kennedy or 
a smart team he hopes will be able to contend with anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I can put a team on court with an aggregate grade-point average of 3.9," he 
said. "I think if you are successful off the court, it leads to success on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Hamamoto's philosophy proved successful with the girls' program last season. 
The team advanced to the playoff for the first time in school history with a 
20-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the team's players are seniors. Center Richard Pearce, an 
all-league selection who averaged 10.5 points last season, returns, as does 
David Green, who averaged 10 points and figures to be the league's most 
dominating player. 
</P>
<P>
Lamar Taylor (6-5) is up from the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- The Cavaliers have only one starter returning from last season's 
2-18 team -- 5-10 guard Sean Condon, who averaged about four points. With no 
player taller than 6-1, Coach Paul Anderson plans to play a fast-paced game 
with aggressive defense. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Carrasco (6-0, guard), Eddie Solis (6-1, forward), Van Trung (5-8, guard) 
and Huong Tran (5-8, guard) all played as reserves last season. Top newcomers 
include 6-1 forwards Jamal Nuristani, a senior, and junior Jeff McAteer and Con 
Nguyen, a 5-7, sophomore guard.

COUNTY'S MALLS, SWAP MEET BUSTLE ON 'OPENING' DAY 
</P>

<P>
While Orange County malls absorbed the biggest crowds of the holiday season's 
opening day Friday, thousands of area shoppers chose a different course, 
browsing for bargains at a bustling county swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
Under overcast skies, shoppers from throughout the county milled among 1,200 
booths and an eclectic mix of products, from Quake Ready Survival Kits to 
sunglasses to auto accessories. 
</P>
<P>
John Stevens, 14, of Huntington Beach said he "mainly came here for the 
inexpensive prices." Carrying bags in both arms, Stevens said he had "just 
about finished all my Christmas shopping in under two hours. . . . .This place 
is pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was among the tens of thousands of shoppers to descend on the Orange 
County Fairgrounds, picking the sprawling swap meet as an alternative to the 
county's packed shopping malls, where limited parking and traffic snarls 
complicated an already hectic day. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Davenport, the self-proclaimed Shammy Man, said business at his booth of 
absorbent car towels has been "wonderful." He said he averaged about 100 sales 
an hour, adding, "This place is crazy with shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
Davenport also sold his 125 copies of the farewell edition of the Los Angeles 
Herald Examiner for $10 each. The newspaper closed shop Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The swap meet extended its regular Saturday-Sunday schedule to accommodate 
shoppers who like to tackle their Christmas lists the day after Thanksgiving. 
Richard Olsson, managing director of the swap meet, said the 20-year-old, 
open-air market attracts a steady stream of customers who shy away from the 
scene at area malls. "I can't guarantee better prices, but I can guarantee a 
better time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the easygoing atmosphere at the swap meet, area malls grappled 
with long lines and occasional traffic delays. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, many of the malls were teeming with consumers searching for Christmas 
presents as well as parking spaces. Cars overflowed the South Coast Plaza mall 
in Costa Mesa, backing up traffic and overwhelming valet parking services. At 
times, the line for South Coast Plaza backed up as far as the San Diego Freeway 
near the Bristol Street exit, causing minor delays. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers also backed up traffic on the Santa Ana Freeway, where delays were 
common all day long. But the sometimes chaotic scene outside did little to 
dampen the enthusiasm of storekeepers who depend on the Friday after 
Thanksgiving to open the holiday shopping season with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
"This day is unique in retailing," Jo Qualls, vice president of the Costa Mesa 
Tiffany &amp; Co., said as patrons crammed into her store. "We all wait for 
this day all year long. This is what makes the retail world exciting."

RETAILING: SALES IN THE SOUTHLAND WERE CALLED DISAPPOINTING. ANALYSTS HAVE 
PREDICTED A QUIET HOLIDAY BUYING SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
America pushed aside the turkey and trimmings Friday and instead nibbled on the 
Christmas merchandise in the nation's shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Although thousands of shoppers flocked to the stores, many retailers and 
consumers found the turnout -- and appetite for buying -- surprisingly light 
for a day that often is the busiest of the Christmas shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet start," said Leonard Barron, a salesman at the J.R. Jonathan's 
shoe store in the Sherman Oaks Galleria, at midday. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Rad, manager of the Petite Sophisticate women's clothing store in the 
Glendale Galleria, said: "Before, money was no object. Now they (shoppers) are 
watching what they're spending." 
</P>
<P>
The disappointing sales at many stores throughout the Southland and the rest of 
the nation squared with the predictions of a number of retail industry experts. 
Among other things, analysts have said that shoppers may be getting worried 
about signs of a softening economy and bored with the merchandise retailers are 
offering this year. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bambrook of Anaheim is a case in point. Taking a break from shopping at 
MainPlace/Santa Ana, Bambrook and her husband, Gary, a freight driver, said 
they plan to hold the line on spending this Christmas by not charging 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we're only spending what we can afford," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a break from shopping at the Glendale Galleria, Terry Norton, a 
contractor from Burbank, said he expects to spend about 15% less than last year 
on gifts for his friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit just doesn't seem to be here," Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
His family's Christmas is "going to be nice but it's going to be less. I'm not 
going to buy the big-ticket items." 
</P>
<P>
"All year, it's sale, sale, sale," Norton added. "Who wants to go to another 
sale?" 
</P>
<P>
All the same, the retailers generating the most enthusiasm among customers 
seemed to be relying heavily on sharp markdowns -- a practice that once was 
limited mainly to the days immediately after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the markdowns stemmed from turmoil in the retailing industry that has 
brought such major companies as Campeau Corp. and L.J. Hooker Corp. to their 
knees. In New York, for example, shoppers jammed into B. Altman, an old-line 
chain that, with the exception of one store, is being liquidated by Hooker to 
pay creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Two shoppers at Limited Express in Santa Ana -- Pat Almeida of Santa Ana and 
her daughter, Kristi Bowin -- found discounts of 40% on merchandise with prices 
already slashed in half. "We bought five pieces -- a skirt, a jumper, a top, a 
coat-sweater, a pair of pants -- and three sets of earrings -- all for $117," 
Bowin said. "Everything was on sale." 
</P>
<P>
Those specialty shops with genuine bargains, in fact, seemed to find no 
shortage of customers. At L.A. Eyeworks at South Coast Plaza, customers began 
lining up at 8:30 a.m. -- 30 minutes before the eyeglass store opened -- to 
take advantage of the annual sale that brought discounts as high as 70% and 
eyeglass frames for as little as $10. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the shopping at South Coast and in at least two 
other top Orange County malls, Newport Center/Fashion Island and Westminster 
Mall, didn't pick up until close to noon. 
</P>
<P>
"People take it leisurely on a holiday," said Maura Eggan, South Coast Plaza's 
spokesperson. So while prime spaces could be found at the center's Crystal 
Court annex, the main mall's parking lot was packed by early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, at the newly renovated Fashion Island, business was steady through 
the day but ample parking could be found. Mall spokeswoman Eileen Bohen 
predicted that by the end of the day, 40,000 shoppers would have visited the 
Newport Beach mall, which just completed a lengthy remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
Several shoppers at the University Towne Centre mall in San Diego, where the 
economy is heavily influenced by military spending, expressed concern over 
proposed defense budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Fisher, who works at defense contractor McDonnell Douglas in San Diego, 
said: "We'll spend pretty much as we always do, although we may stay within our 
budget more. We won't be as extravagant." 
</P>
<P>
Bus driver Joe Anderson, shopping at San Diego's downtown Horton Plaza, said he 
is cutting back on his Christmas spending. "The rent's going up, the gas and 
electricity rates are going up. Things are much too expensive here." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he is going to offer his children a choice between a Christmas 
present and "a crisp $10 bill." 
</P>
<P>
His prediction: "They'll take the bill." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from trying to attract shoppers with price cuts, retailers also tried to 
provide some extra conveniences. Target stores, for example, opened at 7 a.m. 
and many others began business at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis is on service," said Linda Cerro, marketing director at Mall of 
Orange, where several major stores are adding more gift wrap or box locations, 
she said. "They're all trying to provide better service . . . so there are a 
lot of prepackaged gifts this year, and shirts and ties that come coordinated 
so the customer can grab them and run." 
</P>
<P>
The mall itself has added a pianist and broadened its customer service center 
by adding an expanded parcel checking service. "Now we offer everything from 
gift wrap to calling taxis to free strollers to (expanded) parcel shipping," 
Cerro said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the overall trend appeared to be one of disappointing sales for 
retailers, there were some hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m., the big Houston Galleria shopping mall was packed. At the Omni, a 
downtown shopping mall in Miami with mostly business and tourist customers, 
Jordan Marsh's general manager, Joe Mazloom, reported that "business has been 
very good. People seem to be shopping much earlier this year." 
</P>
<P>
There were even signs of hope for retailers in the San Francisco Bay area, 
where merchants expressed optimism that the Christmas season would revive sales 
that have been sluggish since the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan, throngs of eager shoppers moved more quickly on foot than the 
city's cabs and buses, caught in the gridlocked start of New York's annual 
Christmas season rush. With nearly five inches of Thanksgiving snow, the first 
on that holiday in more than half a century, there was no shortage of people in 
the Christmas shopping spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Even if sales were sluggish, some of the best part of the Christmas spirit was 
apparent at the malls. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the busiest counter at Fox Hills Mall was a small booth manned by 
three volunteers who scurried their way through 50 customers in less than two 
hours. And they weren't even selling anything. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Los Angeles County Foster Parent Assn.'s annual Holiday Dream Tree, 
and shoppers were lining up to grab colored cards printed with the Christmas 
wishes of the area's neglected children. One sample card read: "Age 14. Sex M. 
1st Choice: Watch. 2nd Choice: Football." 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't had problems this year," said Delois George, a Dream Tree 
volunteer. "The public really buys gifts for these children. It's been busy 
today." 
</P>

AIDING POOR A WELCOME TASK FOR MILLIONAIRE

Deborah Szekely was 62 years old and admittedly starting to feel lazy when she 
found the challenge she wanted as president of the Inter-American Foundation, a 
small, federally funded foundation that works in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
There were some who questioned whether Szekely, a Republican who became a 
millionaire by running a health spa for the overweight rich, was the right 
person to help poor Latin Americans. 
</P>
<P>
But Szekely, now 67, quickly proved that she could do the work and do it well. 
</P>
<P>
"She has been a stalwart. . . . She has done the kind of job that the 
Inter-American Foundation was created to do . . . and she has done it with 
great gusto," said Rep. Dante Fascell (D.-Fla.), who helped shape the 
legislation that created the agency in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Szekely, founder of the Golden Door health spa, did have other options. She had 
a chance to publish a magazine in New York. She considered moving to Paris and 
studying philosophy at the Sorbonne. She could have spent her time traveling 
and partying. 
</P>
<P>
But Szekely decided that what she really wanted was "something to stew and fret 
and worry about." Wrestling with the problems in Latin America has helped 
satisfy that craving, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting a second career at the foundation and coping with the challenge of the 
work there also has sharpened her mind, kept her vital and enabled her to 
blossom late in life. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't stretch if you aren't challenged," she said, "and if you mind isn't 
stretched, how do you keep your body flexible? The flexibility of both are so 
interwoven." 
</P>
<P>
In her Arlington, Va., office, brightened by colorful dolls and crafts made by 
Latin American artisans and presented to her as gifts, Szekely talked about the 
poverty she has seen on some of her trips. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up during the 1930s as a child in Mexico, Szekely saw plenty of poor 
people. "But every home had a vegetable garden, a goat tied in back, a few 
pigs, chickens underfoot. Today, because of the increased population, they have 
nothing. You go into houses, and there is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
As foundation director, Szekely oversees an agency with a staff of about 70 
people and a mandate to support the self-help efforts initiated by poor people 
in 32 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
When she travels, Szekely wears practical slacks, shirts and sandals. Her 
elegant and expensive business suits stay in the closet of her Georgetown home 
here. When necessary, she stays overnight in the field and sleeps in a hammock, 
in keeping with local customs. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is a self-described "health nut" who avoids meat at home, she has 
learned to eat fresh-killed chicken, barbecued goat and skinned guinea pig when 
it is served to her as an honored visitor. "When you have to eat shoe leather, 
I eat shoe leather," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Szekely never doubted that this job was perfect for her when she began lobbying 
the foundation's board of directors to hire her as president in 1984. She 
already spoke Spanish. She had worked in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
And she knew first-hand about development and management. She and her first 
husband, Bordeaux Szekely, opened their health spa, Rancho La Puerta, in Baja 
California in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"It was $17.50 a week, bring your own tent," she said. "We had kerosene lamps, 
outhouses. We started with absolutely nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Szekely opened a second spa, the Golden Door, in Escondido, Calif., in 1958. 
She and her husband were divorced in 1969. Her second marriage also ended in 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
But her businesses were booming. The Golden Door, which now charges $3,500 a 
week, has attracted such guests as Cher and Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
</P>
<P>
Szekely sees a basic similarity in trying to serve the very rich and the very 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is listening to what they are trying to say," she 
said. "The poor have the same ambition as the rich: They want a more fulfilling 
life. So you listen to what they are trying to say and try to establish what 
they need and how you can help." 
</P>
<P>
The worst poverty, she said, is in Brazil and along the Amazon tributaries, 
"where the only thing the people have is 10 kids. A woman has 20 births and 
maybe 10 live kids. And once in a while they will have a cassette radio, but no 
electricity. And the schools are a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
More than 80% of the foundation's $28-million annual budget last year was given 
as grants to stimulate development in Latin and Caribbean countries. 
</P>
<P>
Grants have helped farmers in Bolivia buy a tractor to grow more vegetables, 
enabled fishermen in Venezuela to purchase equipment they needed to market 
their catches and provided assistance to women artisans in Ecuador operating 
knitting and weaving businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Szekely believes she can apply what she has learned in Latin America in the 
United States. So she is now planning a third career, in which she hopes to 
establish a nonprofit agency to improve life of inner-city residents, just as 
the foundation has sought to make life better for poor Latin Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always taken on big problems and big headaches," Szekely said.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: JOY OF DOING LUNCH WITH 'AMERICA'S FAVORITE CHEF'

Heads turned and forks remained suspended in midair as the tall, 
familiar-looking woman in a Kelly-green suit walked into Pronto Grill in South 
Coast Plaza during the dinner hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that Julia Child?" called out an incredulous woman at one table. 
</P>
<P>
"Julia Child!" shouted her equally amazed dining companion. Child, in Costa 
Mesa on Monday evening for a book-signing at Rizzoli International Bookstore 
&amp; Gallery, continued walking toward the back of the restaurant where a 
hostess escorted her and her party into an empty dining room for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The woman whom Newsweek magazine calls "America's favorite chef" had just 
arrived by limousine from a book signing in La Jolla, and the plan was for 
Child, her publicist and Rizzoli manager Allene Symons to grab a quick bite to 
eat before the signing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 7 o'clock autograph session wouldn't begin for another 45 minutes, 
the line outside the bookstore was already snaking past several store fronts. 
By the time the 6-foot-1 celebrity sat down at a small table to scrawl her 
first signature, the line was nearly 200 strong, with each enthusiastic Julia 
fan clutching a copy (or two) of her new 511-page cookbook, "The Way to Cook" 
(Knopf), a hefty tome containing more than 800 recipes and costing as much as a 
full-course gourmet meal: $50. 
</P>
<P>
But first there was food to order. 
</P>
<P>
Child, 77, charming and as unpretentious as a pot of stew, dug a pair of 
reading glasses out of her black handbag and began scanning the menu. 
</P>
<P>
"Homemade pies, I see," she observed in that patented oven-warm trill first 
heard on a Boston public television station in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
The waiter approached the table. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you care for a cocktail or wine before dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think a little red wine would be very nice," said Child. "How is the 
Sebastiani Merlot? Is that nice? 
</P>
<P>
Waiter: "Uh, it's a little sweet." 
</P>
<P>
Child: "Sweet? 
</P>
<P>
Waiter: "Yeah. . . . I don't like it a lot myself, to tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Child: "Which one do you like the best?" 
</P>
<P>
Her wine order in, Child broke off a piece of dinner roll and began talking 
about "The Way to Cook," the first cookbook ever to be designated a Main 
Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. It is Child's seventh contribution to 
the nation's kitchen bookshelves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite different than the others in that, for one thing" -- she laughed -- 
"it weighs 5 3/4 pounds, and it has over 600 color photographs, and it sure is 
beautifully laid out." 
</P>
<P>
Child's first two books, including the best-selling "Mastering the Art of 
French Cooking, Volume I," which has sold 2 million copies and is in its 34th 
printing, dealt with French cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest have been my cooking -- a little bit of everything," she said, taking 
a bite of roll. "But I think the French techniques are what are important 
because they're the techniques of good cooking anywhere. And once you know them 
you can really do anything, and what I'm trying to do with this book is to get 
people to use their heads about cooking so they don't have to keep following 
recipes all the time." 
</P>
<P>
As she sees it, "if you know how to make a beef stew, all the other stews are 
just about the same." 
</P>
<P>
General cooking isn't difficult anyway, she said, "but it's the things that you 
add to it. It's kind of an assembly job. To poach a filet of fish in white wine 
is about the easiest thing you can possibly do, but then you can make 
tremendously elaborate sauces with it or be very, very simple. If you can get 
that across to someone, then it (cooking) begins to make sense." 
</P>
<P>
The drinks arrived and Child picked up her wine glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's to us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Are all the recipes in the new book her own? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they're my way of doing things -- what we call 'cooking my way,"' she 
said. "But they're based on the general techniques of good cooking." 
</P>
<P>
Her book, she said, "is for people who like to cook and like to eat." And, she 
maintains, it doesn't really take that much time to cook a good meal: "You just 
sit down and have a glass of wine and dinner's practically done. 
</P>
<P>
"My theory is the more you know about it (cooking), the faster you can do it. 
It's very important to get all the dog work done -- so that you can chop very 
fast and peel very fast and get down to the cooking. It just depends on how 
much time you have, how much labor you want it to be." 
</P>
<P>
The waiter returned to take orders. 
</P>
<P>
"What can we do that's fast?" Child asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The linguine fresca is very nice," said the waiter. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmm, good. OK," Child said, turning to her companions: "What are you going to 
have?" 
</P>
<P>
They both said they were going to have the minestrone. 
</P>
<P>
"That might be a good idea, I think," said Child. "I'll have the minestrone 
too. That might be easier. And it comes with a lot of cheese, does it? Or you 
can put some in?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well," said the waiter, "we can put some in. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Taking a sip of wine, Child said, "It's a very nice wine." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you," said the waiter. 
</P>
<P>
With so many Americans eating on the run, Child was asked if "microwave" is a 
bad word in her vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a microwave (oven) since they first came out," she said. "I don't do 
so much actual cooking with it, but I'm very glad to have it. I think you can 
start a baked potato in it and finish it in the oven, that kind of thing -- 
heat up the coffee, dry out the newspaper." She laughed: "You must remember it 
was invented for the frozen TV dinner. Which it does very well." 
</P>
<P>
Is cooking, the way she practices it, a dying art in this country? 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are beginning to find that they like to eat some good food now 
and then," she said. "I think eating out is terribly expensive and then you 
don't know what you're eating half the time. If you cook at home simply, the 
more you cook the faster you can do it, and you don't have to be elaborate. But 
then there are a lot of people that just enjoy the mechanics of cooking, which 
I do. It's a nice hobby, particularly for men. Like making French bread, it's 
just a fascinating hobby." 
</P>
<P>
The waiter arrived with the soup orders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's lovely," cooed Child, gazing at her steaming bowl of soup. "Uhmm, it 
looks good. That was a very good idea." 
</P>
<P>
Child, whose 87-year-old husband, Paul, is now in a Massachusetts nursing home, 
would be leaving the next day for her home in Cambridge. The couple, who have 
been married 44 years, also own a condominium in Santa Barbara. Says the 
Pasadena-born Child: "I think once California is in your blood, there's nothing 
like it, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
After completing her book tour, Child said, she is going to concentrate on the 
San Francisco-based American Institute of Wine and Food, which she co-founded 
in 1981 to promote the serious study of wine and food. 
</P>
<P>
Her fans won't like it, but Child says "The Way to Cook" will be her last 
cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes so long (to do one)," she said. "It's like I was sort of confined to 
stove and computer. I just don't want to be that limited anymore. I want to do 
some teaching and do some articles now and then, but I'm mainly going to 
concentrate on the American Institute of Wine and Food." 
</P>
<P>
Retirement is not on her agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"Why retire?" she said. "It's such fun to move around. It's a good thing with 
this kind of a profession, or career, you never have to retire because you're 
self-employed." 
</P>
<P>
Although Julia Child has come to symbolize cooking in America, she said she 
never anticipated becoming a celebrity. Her celebrity, she said, "kind of 
evolved." And she's realistic about its fleeting nature: "You realize that once 
you're off the boob tube, you're through. So you don't get a swelled head." 
</P>
<P>
But being a celebrity, she conceded, does have it's advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing, which is nice, is that you usually get a seat in a restaurant if 
you're recognized by food people. So that's nice. Otherwise it's no sweat. I 
think usually people are pleasant because they're cooks." With a laugh she 
added, "I think if you were a sex goddess, it would be terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Sopping up the remaining soup in her bowl with a piece of roll, Child said she 
enjoys doing the book tours, particularly visiting new cities and sampling the 
local cuisine. She said she had stone crab in Miami, for example. 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, the waiter approached the table. 
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me. How's the soup? 
</P>
<P>
"Delicious," said America's favorite chef. "Very good. It was a good choice."

POLICEMEN'S LIFE PARTNERS GET TOGETHER TO SHARE THE BURDENS ON THE HOME FRONT

<P>
Her husband told her not to be surprised if he got home early: He wouldn't be 
finishing his graveyard shift that night. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Patrol Officer Jeff Mayer was calling his wife from the hospital to let 
her know he had been hurt. He and his partner had chased a man suspected of 
stealing a motorcycle, and in the ensuing struggle, the suspect, who was high 
on PCP, beat both Mayer and his partner on the head with Mayer's night stick. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect wrestled with Mayer's partner. Mayer was forced to shoot when the 
man didn't heed orders to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to be there, needed to be there for him," Linda Mayer said. 
But she was stranded in her house with her five children. 
</P>
<P>
"You go through a range of emotions yourself. He has been hurt before but this 
time it really affected me," Linda Mayer said. "I have a lot of confidence in 
my husband, (but this kind of situation) leaves you feeling a little helpless. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry now if he hasn't come home for a few hours. I get scared," Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Mayer only received a concussion that required a few stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, her 7-year-old also started to worry when his father, due home at 
3:30 a.m., was not there by 7. "I'm getting worried about Dad," he said to his 
mother. "Do you think he's dead?" 
</P>
<P>
Television cop shows have familiarized everyone with the risks police officers 
face in the line of duty. Lesser known are the stresses and fears of the 
officers' spouses: the feelings of exclusion from his work life, the emotional 
armor that hinders intimacy with his wife, the difficulties in maintaining a 
family life with children or even celebrating holidays, the ever-present fear 
that he might get killed. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Mayer shared her thoughts in a recent meeting of 26 women, members and 
female guests of the Anaheim Police Wives Assn. This group, in existence for 
more than 30 years, gives wives a chance to voice concerns among others who may 
have had to confront similar situations. They discuss how to cope with a 
husband's frequently changing shifts, how to explain a father's absence to the 
kids. (One wife switched jobs and worked as a cashier at a grocery store so she 
and her husband would have the same hours free.) 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim gatherings also give wives a chance to leave behind household 
responsibilities just one evening a month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my Monday," is how Becky Martinez, Anaheim Police Wives Assn. president, 
describes those monthly meetings. "It's so important that we have those couple 
of hours. . . (to) release a lot of tension. We like to socialize and have a 
good time. It's good for the kids; their mom is less stressed." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Judith Neighbors attended the Anaheim Police Wives Assn. meeting 
earlier this month. The wives expressed concern about a number of recent 
shootings in the city. Neighbors, who is working on her doctorate in 
post-traumatic stress at UC San Diego, had been invited to field questions by 
the membership. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Jefferson told the group about how her husband was involved in a 
shooting. "It was 2 o'clock in the morning and the driver did not have on any 
lights. When a third officer tried to pull the man over he ran into a motel." 
Two officers shot because they believed he had a gun, but the man was not 
armed. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, who was on the graveyard shift, woke her up to ask if someone else 
could take her to work. She said she knew he might be shaken up and waited for 
him to come home so he wasn't greeted by an empty house. In the end he made it 
home and she was glad she'd stayed, "glad they had a chance to talk about it" 
in those 15 minutes as he drove her to work. 
</P>
<P>
"You can live with whatever happens," Jefferson said. "He has to know everyone 
else is gonna rag on him but he can come home and tell me. People second-guess 
it. (It was a) split-second decision with limited information. It's important 
that the family can deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Mayer said her husband, Jeff, confessed that he's still angry about the 
situation. "I should have killed him," Linda said he told her. "He'll be out on 
the streets." The man was jailed only for a few months and has already been 
released, according to Linda Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
Communication is the key to bridging misunderstanding and nurturing intimacy in 
times of crisis, Neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
"Be supportive, interested, understand, but know you can't fix it. Talk about 
it (just to help him) to let it go," she said. Once officers start shutting off 
emotions to deal with the criminal element on the streets, they may carry that 
out in other areas, such as their home life, Neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Police wives are also concerned about how their husbands are perceived by their 
children, their neighbors, the media. 
</P>
<P>
One woman at the Anaheim meeting said her 3-year-old son had started telling 
his playmates, "My Daddy's a policeman. He shoots people." Or a variation: 
"People don't like Daddy. Why do they want to hurt Daddy?" 
</P>
<P>
Background Investigator Rick Martinez, Becky Martinez's husband, has worked as 
a school resource officer and given talks to Anaheim elementary school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
He gave a puppet show on Halloween safety. A little girl once asked him, "Have 
you ever been killed?" presumably meaning, "Have you ever been shot?" 
</P>
<P>
But Rick Martinez answered her question. "If I'd been killed, would I be 
standing here talking to you? No, I'm very much alive." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the kids think it's really neat their daddy's a cop," Becky Martinez 
said about their 7- and 9-year-old daughters. Once they're in junior high and 
high school they'll start saying that their dad "works for the city." 
</P>
<P>
"There's often disrespect toward (the kind of work) your husband does," Becky 
Martinez continued. 
</P>
<P>
The news media is seen as a primary offender. In any news story, police wives 
contend, the media will always blame the police officer. One officer told his 
wife, "I should have been a fireman." 
</P>
<P>
"Their feelings are hurt," Neighbors said, when officers get bad press about 
their work. "They're out there trying to save the world and somebody tells them 
they're rotten or they're doing a bad job." 
</P>
<P>
The area of police work in which a husband specializes and its level of danger 
definitely has an effect on his wife's level of stress. Jennifer Vargas' 
husband has just begun assault training in two-man units. "He doesn't go out 
there (on patrol) to try to be a hero. Now he's dealing with people from 
Colombia (involved in narcotics). Now he's following people I wouldn't want to 
know. And . . . he's gone all the time," she added, more as an observation than 
a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
But while the wives lament their husbands' transfer to narcotics, they say the 
men love the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
One woman told of a vice cop she knew who died from a combination of stress and 
a congenitally bad heart. He spent four hours every night working at 
smoke-infested bars, drinking watered-down drinks so his sources would smell 
alcohol on his breath. He couldn't wash or shave; the smell of soap on him 
would betray him. And he got only three or four hours of sleep a night. 
</P>
<P>
His doctor told him he needed a desk job. 
</P>
<P>
He died in his early 30s, leaving a wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
The job description for working vice should include a statement saying, " 'Only 
single men apply, not daddies,' " says Becky Martinez. "It should be a law that 
these guys not be married, should be single or already divorced," she 
continues. "Seventy percent of divorces come from this. . . . Working vice in 
bars, they're dealing with the lowest forms of life, the Mafioso, the drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"And (the officers) have to be on the streets constantly," Martinez says. "But 
the wives and kids are suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez has told her husband, Rick, that if he were ever to work vice, "it 
would almost be like being unfaithful. I thank God every day that I have 
(Rick)." 
</P>
<P>
Becky and Rick Martinez have been married 11 years, and Becky attributes this 
to the fact that their "communication is strong. I've always been there (for 
him) 100%. He can bring home his work." He has in the past worked swing and 
graveyard shifts and "was on motors swing and day (a motorcycle officer on the 
swing and day shifts) for four years." 
</P>
<P>
He is currently a background investigator for potential candidates for the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Martinez discusses job opportunities with his wife. They recently talked 
about his interest in a juvenile detective job, which he later chose not to 
seek. His support for her efforts with the Anaheim police wives group is 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
Not all police officers are so enthusiastic about the police wives' 
associations. Becky Martinez reports that some husbands have accused their 
wives of spending the time "just gossiping." 
</P>
<P>
These men fear that discussions among their wives would reveal more than they 
had intended to say about their personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
But in Becky Martinez's view, it is these wives who need the help and support 
of other police wives most of all. 
</P>
<P>
"If a man doesn't want his wife to join," she said, "maybe (she) should check 
into it." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the membership doubled when Pamela Molloy, the wife of the new 
Anaheim police chief, joined the group, Becky Martinez says. Once she had 
joined, the officers were telling their wives to join so they could get keep on 
top of whatever information was being traded. "It's helped," Becky said. 
</P>
<P>
Becky's advice to young women considering marriage to a police officer is to 
"research it before you get into it. Many holidays find the wife home alone. 
And the work shift changes are inevitable and can cause problems." 
</P>
<P>
"Young marriages are at high risk" if one of the partners is a police officer, 
says Barry Spatz, a therapist who works with the Santa Ana Police Department. 
The typical pattern is that the wife starts out an innocent, he reports. Within 
five years they divorce ("We drifted apart, she didn't understand"). And in 
another two to three years the man will remarry. 
</P>
<P>
In Spatz's view, a police officer's optimal career expectancy is seven to nine 
years. After that he or she may burn out or succumb to alcohol abuse. They 
survive by going up in the ranks and taking a desk job. 
</P>
<P>
An officer just starting out undergoes "a tempering process," Spatz says. "The 
husband changes. He'll drink with the boys after his shift to loosen up the 
tension. The wife gets excluded from him and his career. His partner becomes 
more intimate. 
</P>
<P>
"Wives don't understand the changes their husbands are going through from 
simply being a cop," Spatz says. An officer will develop an emotional suit of 
armor. Then "it's too much work to take that suit of armor off. (The officer) 
will stop talking to his wife." 
</P>
<P>
"They are walking time bombs if they don't talk about what's going on. A wife 
has to pry him open and become a part of his life," Spatz says. 
</P>
<P>
He recommends wives taking ride-alongs, becoming more supportive and involved. 
"Spouses need to read the signs, not choose to ignore them. Marriages could be 
saved," he concludes. "When communication goes, the marriage goes."

CARVING A LIFE;

<P>
AFTER LONG STRUGGLE, DEAF TUSTIN MAN DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST: INTRICATE 
HANDWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL, Joseph N. Bell is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You notice the eyes first, then the hands. The eyes are wonderfully expressive; 
they have to be. They provide Julian Posada his only means of communication 
with people who don't know sign language. 
</P>
<P>
The hands communicate too. Julian's firm, strong, calloused grip speaks of a 
life spent working with hands -- rough work that tore and scarred and once took 
a finger. But when you see that work, you know those eyes reflect creativity, 
and the rough-hewn hands are capable of the finest and gentlest and most 
delicate artistry. 
</P>
<P>
It took a leap of imagination for Steve Shedd and Tom Silk to see this -- or 
even suspect it. Shedd and Silk are partners who own and operate Steven-Thomas 
Antiques on Dyer Road in Santa Ana. Four years ago, they advertised for a 
warehouseman. Julian Posada answered that ad. Or rather Julian and his family 
did. Julian had been commuting from Tustin to a job in Los Angeles. Because he 
can't drive, that meant spending the week with a friend in Los Angeles and 
taking a bus to Tustin for weekends. The Posada family wanted a better life for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
So when a friend pointed out the Steven-Thomas ad, Julian, his wife, Ana Rosa, 
and their daughter, Rosalind, came to interview for the job. Ana Rosa, like 
Julian, has neither speech nor hearing. Rosalind -- a dark-haired, willowy, 
animated teen-ager who is a freshman at Tustin High School -- is their voice, 
their opening to a speaking world. 
</P>
<P>
"She was 10 when they came in that first time," Shedd recalls. "A very 
self-possessed young woman. She was dickering with us on behalf of her father, 
and I never knew how much of it was getting back to him." 
</P>
<P>
It was clear from the beginning that Julian was not a candidate for the 
warehouse job. He was too old, for starters, but he was also too skilled. He 
brought with him some pictures of furniture he had designed and built. The 
pictures gave no real clue to his woodcarving skills, but they intrigued the 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
"The pictures," Shedd says, "gave him a whole new dimension, but Tom and I were 
fascinated from the beginning with the fact that he was deaf, and we got 
emotionally involved. That isn't always wise, but with Julian, it turned out 
that we got a lot out of it too." 
</P>
<P>
That likelihood became clear the first day Julian was on the job. "We needed to 
duplicate a leg for a cabinet," Shedd says, "and the pictures Julian showed us 
didn't indicate he knew woodcarving. But I asked him to do it anyway, and the 
finished job was so perfect I couldn't tell the original legs from Julian's 
carving." 
</P>
<P>
Since that first test, Julian has carved his own place in the Steven-Thomas 
operation. As the partners explained, antique furniture is sometimes damaged in 
shipment from its source to the Santa Ana store. Delicately carved pieces are 
broken or missing. So it became Julian's job to replicate those missing or 
damaged pieces so perfectly that the repair work could never be seen. And that 
he has done with consummate skill. 
</P>
<P>
He proudly showed some of the jobs he has completed and the projects on which 
he is now working -- mostly fine, intricate carving that he does with hand 
tools. Then he sat at a table outside his workshop with Ana Rosa, Rosalind and 
a friend named Luis Londono, who lives with the family, and talked about the 
route he has traveled from Colombia to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
He talked with his hands and Rosalind translated. Ana Rosa and Luis -- reading 
the sign language -- would frequently interrupt, and there would be a spirited 
-- and silent -- argument among the three about the facts while Rosalind 
patiently tried to get a consensus to report. 
</P>
<P>
The basic biographical facts are undisputed. Julian and Ana Rosa, both deaf 
from birth, grew up in Bogota, Colombia. Julian was one of six children whose 
father struggled constantly to feed and clothe them on a carpenter's wage. 
Julian began working with wood when he was 7, and by the time he reached 
adulthood, Julian had his own woodcarving and cabinetmaking shop. He was mostly 
self-taught, working from books he learned to read during two years of study at 
a school for the deaf in Bogota. He met Ana Rosa at a party and was almost 40 
when they were married in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife migrated to Florida three years later. Colombians could not 
afford Julian's fine work and he hoped to find customers for his skills in 
wealthy America. But it didn't work that way. He was unable to demonstrate his 
skills in Miami -- mostly because he couldn't communicate -- and spent six 
months as a dishwasher before he and Ana Rosa moved to Fresno to join a cousin. 
Again, Julian couldn't find satisfactory work, so the couple moved to Houston, 
where he found a job as a carpenter. But the wages were low and the birth of 
Rosalind made Julian want to seek a better life. 
</P>
<P>
That's when he wanted to give up the American Dream and move back to Colombia, 
but Ana Rosa resisted. Hard. And into this standoff stepped an American friend 
named Laura Valbuena, who had met and befriended Ana Rosa during a long stay in 
Colombia a few years earlier. Valbuena, who is also deaf, lives in Orange 
County and came to Houston to persuade Julian to get a green card and move back 
to California. She helped him find work as a carpenter in Los Angeles and was 
later instrumental in persuading the family to move to a much more attractive 
home in Tustin. And this, in turn, precipitated the commuting problem that 
brought about Julian's appearance at Steven-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
In the decade after his departure from Colombia, Julian's woodcarving skills 
had lain dormant. And his carpenter work had cost him a finger in Texas, where 
he accidentally cut off half the middle finger of his left hand with a power 
tool while standing on a ladder. So at the age of 53, Julian went back to the 
craft he had learned in his father's workshop almost five decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through his daughter, Julian said: "This is the best job I've ever 
had. I'm comfortable here. I have more chance to do design work here than I had 
in Colombia. I mostly do what Steve tells me he wants, but I give him 
suggestions too. I can be creative." 
</P>
<P>
Communicating with Julian has been less of a problem than his employers or 
co-workers anticipated. An artisan's hands can shape images as well as wield 
tools, and Julian does this very eloquently. He also reads lips moderately well 
if spoken to in Spanish, which most of his foremen have been able to do. And 
usually his employers can show him a sample of what they want. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly communication takes place in the exchange of creative minds that 
have come more and more into sync every year. As Shedd points out: "Julian has 
spent a lifetime learning to adapt quickly in a speaking, hearing world. His 
senses of sight and feel are more developed than a hearing person's." 
</P>
<P>
And Julian also has a priceless asset in his daughter, who hears normally and 
has grown up in two quite different worlds. Her mother taught her sign language 
in both Spanish and English when she was very small, and she learned spoken 
language at the same time. Today, she moves easily between her own hearing 
world and her parents' close friends, most of whom are deaf.

So in Orange County in 1989, the Posada family has at last tapped into that 
elusive American Dream that seduced them in Colombia 16 years ago. Ana Rosa has 
found a job as an assembler at a nearby factory, Rosalind is doing well in high 
school, and Julian rides his bicycle to and from a job that finally is making 
use of the talents he honed for the first four decades of his life. 
</P>
<P>
As Steve Shedd wrote in a recent issue of the company newsletter: "Watching 
Julian work wood is like watching Horowitz play the piano or Ozzie Smith 
release a throw to first base -- the motion pure, confident and dignified." 
</P>
<P>
There's another feeling that comes through profoundly in observing the Posada 
family interact and Julian at work: a great sense of respect. Respect for 
Julian's craft, respect for one another, respect for life. In that context, 
it's hard to see Julian's deafness as an infirmity and a limitation. Or, 
finally, to notice it at all.
