Holidays mean gift books, and gift books mean books with lots of pictures, and 
books with lots of pictures mean weighty and often oversize art books -- so 
let's start instead with a slim paperback volume that has 200 pages of pure 
text and but one picture, in black and white, on the cover, depicting a blank 
wall and a gallery attendent seated behind a typically imposing gallery 
reception desk. (I'll never know why they call them "reception" desks, by the 
way, since most attendents seated behind them ignore, with studied and icy 
indifference, your very existence on the planet.) 
</P>

The cover photo to The 7 Days Art Columns: 1988-1990 by critic Peter Schjeldahl 
(The Figures: $12.50; 208 pp.) says a lot about the book's contents, which 
consists of all 76 columns, short reviews and articles that appeared in the now 
defunct, much lamented New York weekly, "7 Days." Schjeldahl is the finest 
journalistic art critic at work today, and the assembly is 
late-1980s-Manhattan-intensive, specific to its time and place as all 
first-rate journalism is. Published by a small independent press, the book is a 
prelude to a full-dress anthology of the critic's writing since the 1960s, due 
out from the University of California Press in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The 7-Days Art Columns" offers considered musings about the art that chugged 
into New York's museums and galleries during the last two years, as sorted and 
chewed over by an unabashed fan. Whether Rembrandt and Velazquez or Cindy 
Sherman and Mike Kelley, Schjeldahl writes from the bleachers, an eager 
observer who knows his stats and wants to share with you his best guess as to 
how the art-game is going. It's not always going well. "The 7-Days Art Columns" 
kick in at a moment of growing malaise in the market-capital of contemporary 
art. Still, the condition of culture being always worth an argument, this short 
collection has the vivid flavor of an eye-witness account. The perfect 
stocking-stuffer. 
</P>
<P>
Only Gargantua's stocking could accomodate Art Across America: Two Centuries of 
Regional Painting (Abbeville Press: $425; 1,376 pp.), William H. Gerdts' 
sweeping, three-volume survey of American art that is the first to travel roads 
leading far from Boston, Philadelphia and New York City, the traditional 
trinity of centers. With nearly 1,000 illustrations, more than half in 
(generally good) color, and carefully laid out for ease of use as both a 
reference book and a set of readable volumes, "Art Across America" is the 
glamour-production of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, it's also a monumental achievement. Prof. Gerdts, a distinguished 
scholar at the City University of New York, writes with clarity and precision, 
qualities that serve him in good stead if only for the sheer logistics of his 
enormous task. "Art Across America" encompasses paintings by more than 800 
artists, who worked between 1710 and 1920 in burgs as far afield as Bucksport, 
Maine, and Hilo, Hawaii. (When Gerdts says "across America," he means it.) Most 
are likely to be complete strangers to you, as they were to me. 
</P>
<P>
James Audubon, Gilbert Stuart, Winslow Homer and other household names do 
indeed show up, but only if they spent considerable time living and working 
beyond one of the three, magnetic art centers. Gerdts wants to show the degree 
to which painting flourished quite like the nation did in the decades of birth 
and expansion -- and, conversely, he means to demonstrate just how narrow our 
established vision of American art has been. The three volumes are divided by 
region -- New England, New York and the Mid-Atlantic (Vol. I); the South and 
Near Midwest (Vol. II); and the Far Midwest, Rocky Mountain West, Southwest and 
Pacific (Vol. III) -- and each region is subdivided by state. Don't go looking 
for unknown geniuses (I didn't find any), but be prepared for a surprising 
number of notable second-stringers. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling far from the beaten path has been a practice of increasing frequency 
for art historians in recent years. In part, it's a result of a larger 
philosophical revision in the way we look at art, as socially and culturally 
revealing rather than as the singular utterance of individual genius. It's also 
a feature of an expanded discipline, as young scholars search for untrammeled 
fields. And, yes, the art market plays its part, as tapped-out masters are 
successively replaced by new areas with lots of available product for sale. 
</P>
<P>
That widened scope, mixed with a frankly market-driven motive, seems to have 
been behind World Impressionism: The International Movement, 1860 -- 1920 
(Norma Broude, ed.; Harry N. Abrams: $75; 424 pp.). What would the holidays be 
without another paen to Everybody's Favorite Art, yet who could really bear 
another compendium of Renoir? 
</P>
<P>
"World Impressionism" plays a bit fast-and-loose with its ism, treating as an 
Impressionist any artist, anywhere, who used broken color as a means to convey 
atmosphere and light. Still, an impressive array of writers and historians has 
been gathered -- including Brooks Adams, Alessandra Comini, Eleanor Tufts and 
(again) Prof. Gerdts -- to scan the terrain from Australia and Japan to Russia 
and Poland. Whether you'll regard Italy's Giuseppe De Nittis a master or an 
adept imitator of Monet, or England's George Clausen an unsung hero or a sleek 
prettifier of Jean-Francois Millet is entirely up to you. But Norma Broude, 
professor at the American University in Washington, D.C., means to subsume 
French Impressionism into what she perceives to be a larger, global movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot fully understand the art of the late 19th Century until we stop 
privileging the French school," she writes, although it's hard to know how 
using a specifically French term to describe "World Impressionism" counts as a 
loss of rank. Nonetheless, this self-described "postmodern" point of view does 
yield a welcome expansion of our contextual understanding of individual 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Widening vistas also characterize Marco Livingstone's Pop Art: A Continuing 
History (Abrams: $49.50; 272 pp.). Actually, it may be more accurate to say 
that Livingstone, author of an admirable monograph on David Hockney, here pulls 
together in one volume the assorted manifestations of Pop that emerged in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s in Great Britain, the United States, France, Germany 
and Italy, with a few forays into the "Post-Pop" legacy of more recent years. 
Not the least useful aspect of his labor is the chapter on a group of artists 
and students at London's Royal College of Art in 1959, who came the closest to 
forming a coherent movement by uniting to topple the staid realist aesthetic at 
the school. Definitely the least useful aspect, alas, is the frequently poor 
quality of the abundant color reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
Shifting global priorities may also explain a trio of books from Rizzoli 
International. The emergence of post-Franco Spain into the cultural spotlight 
of recent years has been the source of much attention. Rizzoli has now issued 
the sumptuous second volume of a projected six-volume catalogue raisonne of the 
Barcelona abstract painter, Antoni Tapies (Tapies: The Complete Works, 1961 -- 
1968, Anna Agusti, 511 pp., 1027 illus., $250); a grand survey of Madrid 
realist painter and sculptor Antonio Lopez Garcia, with essays by Francisco 
Calvo Serraller and Edward J. Sullivan and an interview with the artist by New 
York Times critic Michael Brenson (350 pp., 200 illus., $150); and a lavish, 
in-depth study of Colombian artist Fernando Botero's artistic relationship to 
the Spanish tradition of la corrida (Botero: The Bullfight by Jose Manuel 
Caballero Bonald, $150; 214 pp.). Tapies is a "major minor artist" whose 
scarred and brutalized abstractions are highly romantic and paradoxically 
representational in feeling, while Lopez Garcia and Botero are decidedly 
acquired tastes (read: someone else's taste, not mine). If you've acquired the 
taste, these handsomely produced books will likely more than satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
Among the monographs this season are four worth noting either for the scope of 
their achievement, the depth of their insight or even the simple choice of 
subject. Grappling with a single artist, each author illuminates more than a 
single life. 
</P>
<P>
Claus Grimm's Frans Hals: The Complete Work (Abrams: $95; 296 pp.) is an 
exceptional study of the great portraitist of Holland's Golden Age, an artist 
whose high star fell and then rose again when his lush and lively painting 
style was championed some 200 years later by Impressionist painters (remember 
them?). Grimm knows more about Hals, his clients and the professional milieu 
within which 17th Century portraitists worked than just about anyone -- except, 
maybe, Seymour Slive, whose own great monograph of the early 1970s this one 
means to supplant as definitive account. Grimm admirably lays out the artist's 
story, including voluminous technical analyses of the paintings, and the book 
is enhanced by excellent reproductions, many of them large-scale details -- a 
shirt collar, a cupped hand, a face and such -- which provide a good idea of 
Hals's juicy handling of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Equally all-encompassing is the admirable Egon Schiele: The Complete Works 
(Abrams: $195; 687 pp.), by Jane Kallir of New York's Galerie St. Etienne, 
which has been responsible for keeping the artist's flame alive in this country 
since the 1940s. The volume includes a comprehensive biographical study, a 
catalogue raisonne of Schiele's work in all media, several useful appendices, 
excellent cross-referenced indexes and a fascinating account of the youthful 
artist's posthumous rise to fame, by Wolfgang C. Fischer. Schiele -- the Robert 
Mapplethorpe of turn-of-the-century Vienna, whose haunted images of the darker 
side of human sexuality have frequently been suppressed -- is an artist of 
extraordinary graphic power, especially in works on paper. Kallir occasionally 
succumbs to the overly protective demeanor of an enthusiastic supporter wary of 
dissenters -- and given past censorship of Schiele, perhaps not without good 
reason -- but the book is nonetheless an essential one for any devotee of 
modern Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long way from Schiele to Camille Pissarro, long regarded as the 
sweet-tempered guiding spirit of Impressionism. Richard Bretell's Pissarro and 
Pontoise: The Painter in a Landscape (Yale University Press: $45; 227 pp.) is a 
highly focused reinterpretation of more than 300 of the artist's landscape 
paintings, executed in the provincial town north of Paris between 1866 and 
1883. 
</P>
<P>
Bretell has been a leading light among second-generation revisionists of the 
history of 19th Century modern art, and his first-hand knowledge of Pissarro's 
paintings -- he organized an important retrospective of the artist in 1984 -- 
results in a closely argued text. We tend to assume landscape painters paint 
whatever happens to be in front in them, but Bretell shows how -- and 
speculates as to why -- Pissarro selectively edited the scenes he chose to 
render. The artist would sketch from nature, then put together analytic 
pictures in the studio by reassembling the sketches in a variety of ways. The 
relationship between this practice and the subsequent work of Cezanne -- and 
later, the Cubists -- is interesting to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
Relationships among artists and styles often are. Take Milton Avery, who has 
always been an odd case. Intimate of some of the most adventurous American 
painters of the 1940s and 1950s, including Mark Rothko, he was profoundly 
conservative in his own art, seeking to unite traditional School of Paris style 
with a fully American ambience. Age may have been a factor -- born in 1885, 
Avery was considerably older than most of the Abstract Expressionists, who 
looked up to him as a kind of artistic father-figure -- but, whatever the 
reason, he was a minor artist who played a major role in the cultural life of 
his time. There hasn't been a full and substantive monograph to date, which 
makes Robert Hobbs's Milton Avery (Hudson Hills Press: $75; 263 pp.) a welcome 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs shows how Avery fused a faith in the power of color and the 
simplification of form, traits associated with the art of Matisse and Bonnard, 
toward an interest in similar qualities found in American folk art. Copiously 
illustrated, and with a complete bibliography, the book provides a fine 
summation of the artist's life and work. (A word of caution: Beware the wildly 
overheated introduction by critic Hilton Kramer, who insists with a straight 
face that not only did Avery paint some of the greatest paintings ever made, 
but that he stands as America's answer to Matisse. Anyone who could make such 
an outlandish allusion is not only blind to Avery, he's blind to the great 
Frenchman, too.) 
</P>
<P>
Artists, if they're fortunate, have their collectors, and two new books neatly 
bracket the history of collecting in America. Mr. Luman Reed's Picture Gallery: 
A Pioneer Collector of American Art (Abrams and the New York Historical 
Society: $45; 228 pp.) starts at the very beginning, with a New York merchant 
who assembled, in the 1830s, one of the earliest American collections of 
significant art. Reed could succumb to the saccharine, as attested by his 
fondness for the paintings of George Whiting Flagg (the 19th Century's answer 
to today's schlocky "wide-eyed children" by Walter Keene); but, he will long be 
remembered for having commissioned the great, four-panel "The Course of Empire" 
from Thomas Cole. As cultural history, and with several contributors, the book 
goes a long way toward illuminating the early formation of American taste. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, Affinities and Intuitions: The Gerald S. 
Elliott Collection of Contemporary Art (Neal Benezra, ed., Thames and Hudson: 
$60; 312 pp.) turns to the present, with a Chicago lawyer who has assembled a 
vast holding of work by some of the most important American and European 
artists working today. Visitors to Elliott's art-stuffed apartment high in the 
John Hancock Tower know well the degree of his obsession: The blinds are 
typically drawn on the million-dollar view of the skyline and Lake Michigan, 
for you are there, after all, to look at the art. The book, published on the 
occassion of an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, is a thorough 
compendium of 170 objects from Elliott's often remarkable assembly of Minimal, 
Post-Minimal and Neo-Expressionist art, and features ten essays on assorted 
facets of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as long as we're considering art it might be useful to consider 
"not-really art," too. Fake? The Art of Deception (Mark Jones, ed., University 
of California Press: $49.95; 312 pp.) does just that, in a fascinating account 
of the ways in which phony Babylonian inscriptions in stone (an ancient 
forgery) and trumped-up Vermeers on canvas (a modern hoax) have fooled more 
than one knowledgeable expert. Indeed, part of the appeal of this wide-ranging 
companion volume to an exhibition recently at the British Museum is in 
accepting just how frail and fallible is the human condition -- something the 
experts who have been fooled share with the forgers who do the fooling.

'HIGH SPIRITS: A COLLECTION OF GHOST STORIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What could be more appropriate for the holiday season than a collection of 
ghost stories? Especially when the ghosts involved are amusing rather than 
frightening, far distant cousins, if related at all, to the ogres that 
terrified us in our youth. In one sense they are descendants of the ghost of 
Marley; for they are all Christmas ghosts, but ghosts of a far more engaging 
Christmas Present than anything seen by Scrooge. And Robertson Davies, modern 
master of magic and creator of this baker's dozen of stories, acknowledges this 
debt in an engrossing tale, "Dickens Digested." 
</P>
<P>
Davies himself reads the introduction to this collection with stylish zest, 
explaining how, when he had been appointed to the first Master of Massey 
College at the University of Toronto, it became established that at the annual 
Christmas party he should tell a ghost story. Few institutions of higher 
learning can enjoy a happier tradition. But one does not, fortunately, need to 
have been exposed to graduate study to enjoy what Davies calls these 
"party-ghosts, emanating from high spirits." On the other hand, if one has 
experienced that dubious privilege, some of these ghosts may seem at times far 
more real than supernatural, and the hearer may go beyond empathizing with the 
central figure of the first story, "The Ghost Who Vanished by Degrees," and 
experience complete identification. 
</P>
<P>
The stories themselves are read with obvious enjoyment by Christopher Plummer, 
who gives just the right tone to each of the characters, whether in the flesh 
or ectoplasm. This is high praise, for the range of Davies' interests is 
enormous, and he makes full use of them here. Among his favorite targets are 
provincialism, manners, dress, and self-pride. He can be both benign and 
biting, sometimes in the same breath. Who else could dream up an encounter 
between the ghosts of Albert Einstein and Little Lord Fauntleroy? 
</P>
<P>
That meeting occurs in "Einstein and the Little Lord," and I give the title 
simply to indicate one of the difficulties of reviewing a collection of ghost 
stories. A recounting of the story itself is out of the question. It could be 
nothing but a condensed, pale imitation of the original, spoiling the real 
thing for the listener. A listing of some of the titles to be heard here may be 
the best solution, especially those titles that give an indication -- even if a 
misleading one -- of the delights to follow. So, in addition to those already 
named, the listener can look forward to "The Great Queen is Amused," "The Night 
of the Three Kings," "When Satan Goes Home for Christmas," and "The Ugly 
Spectre of Sexism." Finally, there is "Offer of Immortality." What more could 
one ask for? 
</P>
<P>
With his interests in Jungian theory and magic, Davies, not surprisingly, has 
himself become a figure of legend and myth. This is a mark of his peculiar 
genius, something that anyone who has heard him speak or even simply looked at 
his current portraits can understand. One of the most enchanting details 
concerning him has been told to me solemnly by more than one admirer, and that 
is that his splendidly full beard is the result of his face having never been 
touched by a razor. 
</P>
<P>
If Davies himself had invented this fiction I would keep my silence. But 
knowing that he has not, I feel free to explode that particular myth. Davies 
and I were contemporaries at Oxford in pre-war days. More than that, we were 
both members of an exclusive club, its membership limited for life to four 
persons. We were all clean shaven when this club was founded, though two of the 
members began to sport mustaches before we went down. Davies was not one of 
these. I have heard Davies' appearance compared to that of Michelangelo's Moses 
and to Freud's. But surely his model in this current role is a seasonal figure. 
Clearly he is the latter-day manifestation of Saint Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
The name of our club, by the way: The Long Christmas Dinner Society.

With the holiday season looming on the horizon like a crashing blimp, the 
deluge of coffee table gift books has begun; and, none of the arts is better 
suited to the oversized book format than photography. The most intimate of 
mediums, it's the only artform that lends itself to being cradled in one's lap 
and examined with a magnifying glass; moreover, photo books are the most 
affordable and convenient means of having a direct art experience. 
</P>
<P>
One bit of carping before we get to the books; the text in art photo books 
tends to be hyperbolic, fawning critical blather. Biographical information 
about the artists is usually skimpy at best, and the critical essays usually 
discuss a given photographer's work solely within the context of developments 
in the field of photography and world events; they rarely connect a 
photographer's choices in regards to his work to events in his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list of new books is Sebastiao Salgado's An Uncertain Grace 
(Aperture: $60; 155 pp.) A Brazilian photographer whose work is in the 
tradition of the great photojournalist Eugene Smith, Salgado has covered major 
news events around the world since 1973, and this brutally frank visual essay 
on the grotesque imbalance of life in the 20th Century is not for the faint 
hearted. Salgado spent 15 months in the famine stricken Sahel region of Africa 
(these pictures are extremely difficult to look at), and a good deal of time in 
the Serra Pelada gold mines of Brazil. The shots from Serra Pelada are 
Salgado's best known work; we see thousands of semi-nude men covered with mud, 
swarming on rickety ladders up and down the precarious earthen walls of a gold 
mine. Published to accompany an exhibition organized by the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art that opens at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery on December 16, "An 
Uncertain Grace" is an epic work that raises profoundly disturbing questions 
about our attitudes and responses to suffering. 
</P>
<P>
In a much lighter vein is William Wegman: Paintings, Drawings, Photographs, 
Videotapes (Abrams: $39.95; 216 pp.) The catalogue for a major retrospective 
traveling Europe and the U.S. through 1991, this is the first comprehensive 
study of Wegman's work in four mediums. Unique in that he's had a big impact on 
the avant garde while winning a popular following, Wegman is best known for his 
photographs of his two Weimaraners, Man Ray and Fay Ray, and a good portion of 
the book is given over to his dog pictures (many of them previously 
unpublished). These pictures are incredibly winning; Wegman's sense of whimsy 
combined with the lovable silliness of dogs is irresistible. The book also 
includes an excellent essay on Wegman's paintings by critic Peter Schjeldahl, 
as well as a short essay by Wegman that's written with great clarity and wit. 
Wegman's short autobiography is in fact imminently more readable than the three 
critical essays in the book. 
</P>
<P>
New York Times photography critic Andy Grundberg offers a crash course in the 
ground breaking work of the Starn Twins in Doug and Mike Starn (Abrams: $40; 
144 pp.). The most controversial artists currently working in photography, 
these young twin brothers from New Jersy create massive photo-collages 
involving up to 50 prints. Creased and crudely taped together, casually tacked 
to the wall or presented on industrial clamps that stretch the prints like drum 
heads, the Starns' unorthodox work has a large faction of the photography world 
fuming. However, as can be seen in this comprehensive survey of their work of 
the past five years, their rapturously romantic pictures may break all the 
rules but they're very easy to like. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the flame of tradition burning brightly are Ansel Adams, Paul Strand, 
Alfred Eisenstadt, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, and Robert Mapplethorpe -- all of whom 
have new books out. 
</P>
<P>
Likely to be the last oversized Adams book published (or so say his 
publishers), Ansel Adams: The American Wilderness (Bulfinch: $100; 146 pp.) was 
conceived shortly before Adams' death in 1984 and is the summation of his 
legacy to the environmental movement. Including 107 photos (one third 
previously unpublished or rarely seen) along with exerpts from Adams' writings 
on the need to preserve the wilderness, this huge book is a glorious symphony 
of heroic landscapes splashed across two page spreads. Sad to say, the book 
feels a bit like a eulogy for the American wilderness -- the human race has 
undeniably botched things badly in the 50 years since most of these pictures 
were shot. One also has to say that despite Adams' admirable intentions, this 
book is a symphony of one note; his pictures feel bombastic, a little too 
perfect and more than a pinch sanctimonious. Nonetheless, this is sure to be a 
widely loved book. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly high minded was Paul Strand. The subject of an exhibition on view at 
the J. Paul Getty Museum through Nov. 25, Strand is also the subject of Paul 
Strand (Aperture in Association with the National Gallery of Art: $100; 170 
pp.). The catalogue for an exhibition at Washington's National Gallery of Art 
marking the 100th anniversary of the artist's birth, this book includes several 
previously unpublished images, a rambling critical discourse by Sarah Greenough 
and a selection of Strand's letters. The most painterly of photographers, 
Strand created pictures that glowed with a lustrous, creamy quality -- even his 
shots of abject poverty and squalor feel rich. Strand had an unerring feeling 
for composition, and his pictures -- portraits, landscapes, formal nature 
studies -- are infused with tremendous poise. Graceful though they are, there's 
nothing remotely candid about these solemn pictures and his work occasionally 
feels a bit too polite. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Alvarez Bravo's style had much in common with Strand's -- they even 
photographed many of the same places at roughly the same time. But, whereas 
Strand's work has a classical formality, Bravo's pulsates with the messy 
vitality of real life. Manuel Alvarez Bravo (Museum of Photographic Arts, San 
Diego: $75, cloth; $19.95, paper; 134 pp.), is the catalogue for an exhibition 
recently presented by the Museum of Photographic Arts, (it left there for a 
seven-city tour on Sept. 9) and it includes images spanning 66 years in the 
life of this great Mexican photographer. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo had a keen eye for the magic that dances just below the surface of 
everyday life, and his pictures -- of domestic interiors, nudes, landscapes, 
portraits and religious icons -- hum with a hallucinatory edge evocative of 
Borges. Too bad the essay by Nissan N. Perez has none of that spark. Based on 
extensive meetings with Bravo over an eight year period, Perez's essay hardly 
quotes Bravo at all. It would be preferable to hear what the artist had to say 
about his work, rather than the dry, scholarly essay we're given. It would also 
be nice if the images in the book were in chronological order; it's difficult 
to see the evolution of Bravo's work with the works sequenced as they are.

Alfred Eisenstadt was one of the star photographers of Life Magazine, which 
elevated photo journalism to new heights during the 1940s. Eisenstadt's Life 
press pass gave him a front row seat for most of the great events of this 
century and Eisenstadt: Remembrances (Bulfinch: $40; 141 pp.) doubles as an 
encapsulated history of the modern era. Eisenstadt took the most widely 
reproduced image to ever appear in Life -- a shot of a sailor kissing a nurse 
in Times Square on V.J. Day in 1945 -- and that enormously popular picture is 
here, as are insightful portraits of everyone from Thomas Mann to Marilyn 
Monroe. Designed to illustrate the breadth and variety of Eisenstadt's 
photographic career, this lovely book leaves one marveling at how exciting the 
20th Century has been.

In the wake of the ruckus Robert Mapplethorpe's work has kicked up since his 
death in March of 1989 (a ruckus that no doubt would've delighted him), people 
approach his work expecting to be shocked. Mapplethorpe's Flowers (Bullfinch: 
$50; 49 pp.) will probably raise a few eyebrows -- by virtue of the fact that 
it's an incredibly tame book. A series of color still life studies of flowers 
that was shot over a 12 year period beginning in 1977, "Flowers" (which 
includes a forward by Mapplethorpe's good friend Patti Smith) is a formal 
exercise in color and composition. Controlled to the point of asphyxiation, 
each shot involves one perfect flower at the very peak of its bloom in a vase 
selected to set off the flower, awash in dramatically elegant lighting. There's 
something cold and a bit cruel about this obsessively austere interpretation of 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most pleasant surprises among the current crop of books is Women 
Photographers (Abrams: $65; 264 pp.). One approaches the book with a groan -- 
oh no, one thinks, a feminist reading of photography. Thankfully, the book 
makes no attempt to establish a feminine photographic sensibility; rather, it 
seeks to introduce worthy women photographers who've been overlooked by 
history, and to examine lesser known works by prominent women photographers. 
Among its wonderful discoveries are: pictures by Moholy Nagy's wife Lucia; 
Eudora Welty's photographs of southern blacks; Lee Miller's harrowing images of 
Dachau; and a broad sampling of women leading the field today (Cindy Sherman, 
Barbara Ess, Tina Barney and Nan Goldin, to name a few). Susan Meiselas, one of 
the most respected photojournalists presently working chronicles the obscene 
violence of the war in Nicaragua, while Debbie Fleming Cafferty distills David 
Lynch's aesthetic to a single beautiful image in "Enterprise Sugar Mill." If 
you buy just one photo book this year, "Woman Photographers" would be a good 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Yung Wai-Chuen's Autumn Flood (Oxford University Press: $125) is a visual 
interpretation of a well known work by Taoist philosopher Chuang Tze. You need 
a small crane to handle this cumbersome book, but conceptually it's lighter 
than air and quite enchanting. The artist spent ten years traveling the world 
in search of landscapes that reflect Chuang Tze's pearls of wisdom, and the 
results -- gloriously colorful photographs shot from the windows of commercial 
airliners -- are as inspiring as the artist intended they be.

James Arkatov takes an intimate look at the leading lights of the world of 
classical music with Masters of Music: Great Artists at Work (Capra Press: $50; 
200 pp.). As a first-desk cellist, Arkatov has been on the inside of this world 
for decades, and he's compiled an impressively comprehensive visual survey of 
the great musicians of this century. Arakatov is, however, a staunch 
traditionalist and the star composers of what's known as "New Music" -- John 
Cage, Phillip Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams -- are conspicuously absent. 
Fleshed out with brief biographical sketches by critic Alan Rich and 
recollections of the photo sessions by Arkatov, this is a valuable historical 
record. However, the world of concert music is visually quite drab -- all these 
people seem to dress identically and spend all their time in non-descript 
concert halls. That makes this book for music aficionados only. 
</P>
<P>
Last in the pile is Sylvia Plachy's Unguided Tour (Aperture: $39.95). A highly 
poetic photojournalist who specializes in street photography, Plachy has been a 
contributor to the Village Voice since 1982. Plachy has clearly been influenced 
by her friend and mentor Andre Kertez, and there's a trace of Diane Arbus in 
her work as well; like Arbus, Plachy's work is perfumed with a bittersweet 
melancholy, and she underscores that mood with the fragments of text she's 
selected to accompany her pictures. The words of Rilke and Borges are the 
perfect accompaniment to Plachy's exquisitely moving pictures.

EYE ON HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patrick Goldstein, Goldstein writes about film and music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unabashed admirer of Robert Frank, Jack Kerouac once told the great Swiss 
photographer, "You got eyes." 
</P>
<P>
This new batch of film books show off the Hollywood photographers' eye. Largely 
photo essays, they are celebrity chronicles, told through the camera. While 
none have the remarkable intimacy of "Jean Howard's Hollywood," they do offer 
absorbing images of artists, actors and craftsmen -- at work and at play. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best collection is Hollywood At Home: A Family Album 1950-1965 
(Crown Publishers: $30; 144 pp.). Before the arrival of People magazine, which 
snuck us into celebrities' homes (the kitchen and the bathtub being particular 
areas of interest), there was Sid Avery, an award-winning photographer whose 
work appeared in such family magazines as the Saturday Evening Post, Look and 
Colliers. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando with his bongos. Audrey Hepburn astride her bike, cycling on the 
Paramount lot. Kirk Douglas with his kids, all wearing fake mustaches. These 
are playful, authorized portraits from an age when the protective studio 
machinery was still in high gear. As Richard Schickel's elegant introductory 
essay acknowledges, there's nothing especially garish or probing about these 
shots. Yet the passage of time gives the pictures more than just a nostalgic 
tug. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Avery's watchful eye and good humor, they often have a giddily campy 
appeal, whether it's a photo of Ernest Borgnine reading the comics with his 
kids, or Lawrence Welk posing with his band, showing off a fleet of new 
Chryslers donated by his TV sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Who's that chewing the fat over their Beverly Hills back fence? Why, it's 
friendly neighbors Rossano Brazzi and Jimmy Durante! Who's sunning herself on 
the set of "Giant"? Why, it's Elizabeth Taylor, looking impossibly young and 
erotic. 
</P>
<P>
This is a Hollywood book, so the pose is the thing, especially when you see 
Rock Hudson barbecuing in his back yard wearing a "Wolf in Chef's Clothing" 
apron. But sometimes the pose has an odd poignancy. To see a frail Humphrey 
Bogart reading to his child under Lauren Bacall's watchful eye, while a trio of 
massive boxers doze nearby, is to see an image of Hollywood at the end of an 
era. 
</P>
<P>
It seems appropriate that Avery later became a successful TV commercial 
director. His images are fresh and candid, without ever casting a harsh glare. 
It's sometimes hard to tell, however, whether Avery has captured an intimate 
moment -- or simply a moment of studied informality. 
</P>
<P>
The images are far less striking in a pair of new James Dean collections, James 
Dean: Behind the Scene by Leith Adams and Keith Burns (Birch Lane Press: 
$29.95; 223 pp.) and James Dean: Shooting Star by Barney Hoskyns (Doubleday: 
$40; 191 pp.). The former is an awe-struck compilation of still photos, 
letters, studio memos -- even cast and crew lists, complete with vintage 
addresses and phone numbers. (Fanatics take note: When Dean made "Rebel Without 
a Cause," he lived at 1541 Sunset Plaza Drive.) 
</P>
<P>
Neither book has much new to say. Buttressed with a rambling introduction by 
Dennis Hopper (who did "Giant" with Dean), "Behind the Scene" is largely 
devoted to shots of Dean on the set of his three Hollywood films. The memos 
offer the tastiest tidbits. One highlight is a letter to Jack Warner from Hays 
Office czar Joseph Breen, ordering trims in the "Giant" script, including three 
"damns," one "Good Lord" and an offending "Madre de Dios." 
</P>
<P>
Both books view Dean as an icon of devotion. "Shooting Star" offers photos as 
Dean as a toddler, as a high-school basketball star and as Malcolm in a 1951 
UCLA production of "Macbeth." (We also see him clowning around with Milton 
Berle -- Dean armed with a cigarette, Uncle Miltie with his cigar.) 
</P>
<P>
The segment of the book which surely will attract the most notice is its 
account of Dean's brief live-in relationship with a homosexual TV director, who 
took him to gay bars and helped get him bit parts. 
</P>
<P>
Dean got even more career assistance from the press. Author Hoskyns mentions 
Dean's shrewd media courtship only in passing, but it's an apt footnote to his 
emergence as a mythic youth-culture idol. According to Hoskyns, "Giant" 
director George Stevens put it this way: "Dean was the only person he knew who 
could walk into a crowded room and instinctively pick out the four journalists 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
At 81, Katharine Hepburn can ignore the media -- and everyone else. At the 
beginning of John Bryson's The Private World of Katharine Hepburn (Little, 
Brown: $39.95; 175 pp.), the feisty actress is pictured at her front gate, 
which has a sign reading: "Please Go Away." An old friend, Bryson somehow 
passed muster and has photographed Hepburn for more than 15 years. 
Unfortunately, it's the least interesting 15 years of her life -- and it shows 
in this forgettable photo book, which is crammed with the kind of fluffy 
snapshots that should've remained buried in Bryson's closet. 
</P>
<P>
We see Kate's shoe collection, her old golf clubs and, of course, a photo of 
her Oscar statuettes (which is pompously captioned: "The first photograph of 
the four Hepburn Oscars together"). Even the insider shots, of Hepburn at work 
with George Cukor, Henry Fonda and John Wayne, are mostly forgettable 
movie-location fare. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn's assessment of Wayne has all the sass and poetry that these photos 
lack. "He had tiny Irish feet," she says. "Enormous man. Tiny feet. Big hands. 
You leaned against him and it was exactly like leaning against an oak tree." 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn is only pictured once in Fashion in Film (Prestel/te Neues Publishing: 
$49.95; 244 pp.). But this history of Hollywood costume design, edited by 
Regine and Peter W. Engelmeier, is a luscious treat. Even if you couldn't give 
a hoot about Christian Dior (who did Marlene Dietrich's sleek outfits in 
Hitchcock's "Stage Fright") or Hubert de Givenchy (who provided Audrey Hepburn 
with a series of stunning outfits), you can't help but be enchanted by this 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Full of alluring photos of Hollywood's most glamorous women (and debonair 
gents), it offers an absorbing portrait of shifting fashion trends, from Pola 
Negri's Caligari cloaks with batwing sleeves to Madonna's Hell's Angels leather 
and lace bustiers. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the fashions look so chic today, especially the pop-art outfits of the 
late '60's. Don't miss Britt Ekland (from "The Bobo") who looks as though she's 
wearing a shrimper's net, or Raquel Welch, who displays a hairdo in 
"Roustabout" that appears to have been a prototype design for a new football 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Hedy Lamarr once said she felt naked without something on her head. But 
Hollywood's hat fashions have usually been more ridiculous than sublime. In 
"The Merry Widow," Mae Murray has a headdress with more feathers than anything 
Sitting Bull ever owned, while Mitzi Gaynor gamely wears a hat in "Anything 
Goes" that appears to have been patterned after a Tiny Naylor's drive-in. 
</P>
<P>
"Fashion in Film" pictures John Wayne in a natty sports jacket, but let's face 
it -- the Duke looked more at home in dusty cavalry britches and a battered 
cowboy hat. That's the way we see him throughout Ted Sennett's Great Hollywood 
Westerns (Abrams: $49.50: 272 pp.), a massive volume which chronicles seven 
decades of our most fabled film genre. 
</P>
<P>
The great Western directors, from John Ford to Budd Boetticher and Sam 
Peckinpah, were just as taken by the vast landscape as by its swaggering 
heroes. And the epic sweep of the West is pictured here in all its majesty, 
from the forbidding buttes of Monument Valley to the flat prairie, its arid 
stretches dotted with ragged lines of covered wagons. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne is the genre's most affecting hero whether he's on horseback with Henry 
Fonda, in a rare color still from "Fort Apache," or slouched wearily against a 
huge rock during his painful quest in "The Searchers." Despite his dry prose, 
Sennett is a thoughtful writer, especially when critiquing the Western's shoddy 
treatment of the Indians (who couldn't even play themselves, as noted in a 
photo spread picturing Victor Mature, Robert Taylor and Charleton Heston as 
fierce Indian braves). 
</P>
<P>
Unless you count the brat-pack cowpokes of "Young Guns II," the Western is 
largely dead and buried today. But Sennett's book does an admirable job of 
illustrating its gospel of rugged individualism. As Paul Newman says in "Hud": 
"If you don't look out for yourself, the only hand you'll ever get is when they 
lower the box."

"Enemies: A Chess Story," by Mitch Berman (Oct. 7), states that Kasparov and 
Karpov will play "in front of television cameras." I thought the condition was 
that no TV cameras could tape the actual tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Am I wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Besides that, did I enjoy the article? Yes! I took notes on your descriptions 
of the players and their moods, when you sat down with them to play. The way 
they are as persons came across nicely.

Mitch Berman replies: TV cameras did film the match, and snippets were 
broadcasted nationally every Sunday evening on ABC's World News Tonight. The 
entire course of the match was also shown live on closed-circuit monitors 
throughout the New York hotel, where the first half the world chess 
champtionship was held.

In reading the Oct. 21 Letters column in response to the story about Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez "Gabo Speaks," by Anthony Day and Marjorie Miller (Sept. 2), I 
am struck with the diversity of comment. There were intellectual comments and 
reasonings and emotional rationalizations. 
</P>
<P>
There were words of praise and of abuse. It is as if the article and Marquez's 
writings provoke just the opposite of what is intended. To me those books are 
like music, and like music, which is merely notes, one mustn't be deterred from 
the notes themselves, in Marquez's case, the words themselves. 
</P>
<P>
We must not be thrown off the track of the notes or the words. We would be 
wise, and enriched, if we just enjoy them for that.

<P>
I HAVE A PLAINTIVE LETTER from a Lancaster woman asking for my help in dealing 
with a problem that seems to have descended upon her through no fault of her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a 76-year-old woman living alone here on the high desert," writes Nellie 
Bibbie. "This letter is selfish, but I thought I would take a chance on your 
understanding of humans and animals." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, I find it hard to resist an appeal of that kind. 
</P>
<P>
About four years ago, she says, two rabbits came to her home. She doesn't say 
what kind of rabbits they were nor where they came from. Evidently they just 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"The dogs carried away the male in the middle of the night. The female hid 
under a car in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bibbie doesn't say how she knows the dogs carried off the male in the 
night (nor how she knew it was a male), but it's probably a sound presumption. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the inevitable happened. "Soon some cute little bunnies came 
hopping out from under the car, and I set out food and water. I now have about 
100 rabbits." 
</P>
<P>
I say "the inevitable" happened. We must assume that the female was already 
pregnant when the male was carried off, but female rabbits are almost always 
pregnant, so that is no problem. 
</P>
<P>
One wonders, though, how the number of bunnies reached 100 in the absence of a 
male rabbit. Rabbits in a litter may number from two to eight, and a female may 
have several litters a year, the gestation period being only one month. 
However, each succeeding litter requires the cooperation of a male. So, I 
suspect, a new male has crept into Mrs. Bibbie's establishment, or the family 
is incestuous. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, a curious biological mechanism is responsible for the rabbit's 
prolific reproduction rate. Copulation activates a process that causes the 
female to ovulate, almost guaranteeing pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bibbie's problem, of course, is one of overpopulation. What she asks of me 
is some help in finding people who'd be willing to take some of her rabbits. 
(Bunnies quickly become rabbits.) Mrs. Bibbie does not want to sell her 
rabbits, and she does not want them to be caged or eaten. "They have never been 
in cages," she asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bibbie appeals especially to us hillsiders who live with fire hazards. "I 
used to have to chop weeds for a firebreak," she says, "but now there is no 
fire danger. Not a blade of grass." 
</P>
<P>
One wonders, though, how the rabbits could be trained to eat the bad grass and 
leave the good grass alone. I'm afraid my wife's gardens would be devastated. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is always the problem of excessive reproduction. What has 
happened to Mrs. Bibbie would almost certainly happen to anyone who took a 
family of her rabbits. (She says a family is 13, though it seems to me that two 
would be quite enough.) 
</P>
<P>
The unchecked proliferation of rabbits can be terrible. I remember newsreels of 
the 1930s showing mass rabbit drives in Australia, with hundreds of Aussies 
slaughtering rabbits with clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Children like rabbits as pets, but there is always that danger of soon having 
more rabbits than one wants. My elder granddaughter once had a pet rabbit, but, 
like Mrs. Bibbie's male, it was carried off by the dogs. She was heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
If Mrs. Bibbie's rabbits are not in cages, I don't see how they escape 
predators, especially up there in the desert where there must be plenty of 
owls, snakes and coyotes. Our Los Angeles hills, too, are infested with wild 
animals looking for an easy meal. Although rabbits have been known to drive off 
raccoons and even bobcats with their strong hind legs, they are, in the long 
run, no match for their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
As hideous as the prospect may be to Mrs. Bibbie and to me, one must expect 
surplus rabbits to end up on the dinner table. As far as I know, the only 
rabbit I have ever eaten was Welsh rabbit, which is not rabbit at all, but 
cheese; still, we cannot escape the fact that many people consider rabbit a 
delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Good Housekeeping Cookbook," which I assume is owned and used by 
civilized people, I have found recipes for fried rabbit, rabbit supreme and 
hasenpfeffer, which my dictionary tells me is "a German dish of rabbit meat 
marinated in vinegar and stewed in the marinade." 
</P>
<P>
The recipe for rabbit supreme calls for "two 2-pound ready-to-cook wild 
rabbits." Where does one get ready-to-cook wild rabbits? Surely they must be 
shot or trapped first and then skinned. I don't like it. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone wants to adopt a family of rabbits, I'll be happy to put him or her 
in touch with Mrs. Bibbie. Otherwise, she will have to leave the rabbits to 
their enemies, and let nature take its course.

EXOTICA FROM THE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, Wilson is the Times Art Critic and author of California 
Museums (Abrams). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is it about the holiday season that rekindles a taste for the exotic? It 
is, after all, the most traditional of times. We think muzzy thoughts of 
friends, family and bygone days, but soon the mind dreams of treasures from 
Rangoon to Mandalay. 
</P>
<P>
This leaning to the fanciful probably comes from the remembered imprint of the 
first Christmas tree that found the focus of infant eyes with its delicate 
glass ornaments and flamboyant lights. Magic is, after all, magic. 
</P>
<P>
Then again it is true that my exotic is somebody else's traditional. Anyway, 
that urge to the remote and marvelous comes with the season and four new books 
feed the craving. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular is Masterpieces of Japanese Screen Painting (George 
Braziller: $150). The introductory text by Miyeko Murase is as flat as a 
blackboard but factually informative. It reminds us that screens were an 
integral part of traditional Japanese architecture. Structures tended to be 
short on interior walls. Screens served the function, first as small 
free-standing panels called tsuitate, then as sliding semi-permanent fixtures. 
This fusuma type served for both doors and space dividers. Finally there were 
the byobu folding screens which provided temporary interior space-definition 
and ceremonial backdrops. They were also hauled outdoors to give temporary 
enclosure for unspecified activities. The holiday mind hopes there was 
dalliance within. 
</P>
<P>
It was on these folding screens that artists attained the aesthetic pinnacle of 
the form. The 16th-Century warlords of the Momoyama era built formidable dark 
fortresses after the Portuguese made killing more efficient with firearms. To 
trumpet their power and status -- and offset the gloom of their imprisoning 
palaces -- the tyrants commissioned dazzling screens painted on gold leaf, 
developing such legendary artists as Kano Eitoku and eventually producing 
panoramic scenes on double screens encompassing 12 panels. 
</P>
<P>
This brilliant state of affairs persisted through styles and ages until the 
Japanese were silly enough to fall in love with western furniture and 
architecture. Luckily, some Americans had meantime fallen for Japanese screens, 
causing some of the best of them to wind up in U.S. collections and thence in 
this book. It is quite the most sumptuous thing of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
The CinemaScope character of the screens is reproduced on 18 sets of double 
facing pages that unfold to over 4 feet wide. Ogata Korin's "Irises and Bridge" 
may remind some viewers of Vincent Van Gogh on account of subject and recent 
Japanese passion for his flowers, but a closer look brings a contemporary L.A. 
artist to mind. Korin (1658-1710) was among the most stylized artists in an 
already frankly artificial tradition, resulting in an art that appears, modern, 
witty and remarkably predictive of the spirit of David Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
There is an epic quality to the anonymous Momoyama "Tales of the Hogen and 
Heiji Insurrections" that brings Arika Kurosawa's "Ran" to mind, but not all 
the screens are ornate. The sobering influence of Chinese landscape lingers in 
a 17th-Century pastoral, "A Cherry Blossom Viewing Picnic." Eccentric Zen ink 
painting lives into the 19th Century in Shibata Zeshin's freewheeling 
"Ibaraki." 
</P>
<P>
Where the Braziller book takes on the character of a free-standing experience, 
the others are catalogues of a museum collection and two exhibitions. Such 
publications by definition make you want to see the real thing. Happily both 
shows are coming to California and the collection belongs to the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art. All three deal with crossroads cultures where numerous 
influences have been absorbed into the native style. That tends to result in 
complex art that often both beguiles and baffles western eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Art of Tibet (LACMA/Abrams: $60; 328 pp.) is an expansion of his original 
catalogue by Pratapaditya Pal, LACMA's erudite senior curator of Indian and 
Southeast Asian art. One of the best writers among scholarly curators, Pal 
intertwines history, myth, connoisseurship and cultural observation often 
creating lasting epiphanies. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most telling here is simply that Tibet, magisterially remote and 
ferociously isolated, produces an art -- all religious -- that manages to 
combine terror and tranquillity. For western viewers part of the angst must 
come from trying to untangle the elements of Indian, Nepalese, Mongol and 
Chinese art that have fused with the native pre-Buddhist shamanism. 
</P>
<P>
Something decidedly unrefined and absolute comes from this art, recalling the 
European early middle ages. An illustrated pair of butter lamps look like 
medieval chalices. The paintings love opposing red and blue and have a flat 
assertiveness whose complexity outstrips that of primitive manuscript 
illumination. At a minimum, this book should enlighten anyone who thinks 
Tibetian monks are a lot of wispy dreamers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course if we knew all about it it wouldn't be exotic. Court Arts of 
Indonesia (The Asia Society Galleries/Abrams: $65; 288 pp.) is by Helen 
Ibbitson Jessup and attests to the pomp and power of the islands' ancient 
kings. It looks at their world from its fantastic architecture to its lush 
textiles and gold work. A browser through the book might be less aware of the 
complex mixture of influences from Indic, Chinese, Islamic and European sources 
than the delicacy and sumptuousness of the art. A pair of seated figures from 
Java are as touchingly simple and eloquent in form as works of Old Kingdom 
Egypt. Long-nosed shadow puppets are delicate as smoke and ceremonial daggers 
as ferocious as tigers. The 160-work compendium will arrive at the Los Angeles 
Museum of Natural history in October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Sculpture of Indonesia (National Gallery of Art/Abrams $65; 312 pp.) 
catalogues 110 objects that will visit San Francisco's Asian Art Museum in 
September 1991. With essays by Jan Fontein and other scholars, this is serious 
business. It traces Indonesian history from the Buddhist and Hindu period from 
the 8th century until the 15th and the triumph of Islam. Illustrated objects 
entice from a solemn 9th century monk to a series of 18 10th century bronze 
mythic figures who seem to be in serial dance positions. For those who find 
gold as irresistible as good sculpture there is an exquisite 14th century 
repousse of a prince carried away by a demon.

THE REAL DIRT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To give a book as a gift to a gardener, it is best to first find out what kind 
of gardener he or she is. They are not all alike. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a gardener, you already know this and will instantly recognize the 
various types, and I hope you will forgive the caricatures that follow. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, casual gardeners with no particular penchant for anything 
and no distinguishing marks. They grow marigolds next to roses and don't mind 
at all the clash of colors and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly they come out in the spring and then aren't seen again at the nursery 
until the following year. Their yearly purchase: a sack of fertilizer for the 
lawn, that flat of marigolds, plus some bug spray for the roses. They water 
everything with thumb clamped over the end of the hose. 
</P>
<P>
These gardeners are frugal sorts (some even mow their own lawns) and for the 
most part they limit their book purchases to Sunset or Ortho how-to books with 
price tags of $9.95 or less, so they would be thrilled to receive The Gardens 
of Southern California, with photographs by Melba Levick and text by Helaine 
Kaplan Prentice (Chronicle Books: $35). 
</P>
<P>
The gardens referred to all are public ones, so they can visit in person after 
looking at the lovely photographs (there are no fewer than 25 public gardens to 
visit between Santa Barbara and San Diego). At the end of the book there are 
maps that roughly locate the gardens, plus the necessary addresses and phone 
numbers, visiting days and hours. The text is quite well done and often 
amusing. Another large group of gardeners is composed of transplants from other 
climates. They formerly grew peonies and lilacs back home in the East or 
Midwest and are in need of direction in California's very different climate. 
</P>
<P>
They often read the wrong books, and go further astray. The book they need most 
is the standard New Sunset Western Garden Book, which describes Western 
climates, cultural practices and the plants we grow here, in no-nonsense text. 
But for gift-giving, consider one of these: 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Horticulture Book of Western Gardening, edited by George Waters and 
Nora Harlow (David R. Godine: $50), is perhaps the most exiting book of the 
season, even though all of the material is from past issues of the magazine 
Pacific Horticulture. This is cutting-edge material, though, since this 
epicurean magazine is generally far in advance of current gardening trends. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, this book makes the point that we are a Mediterranean climate -- 
not desert, not tropical, not temperate. Actually, every avid West Coast 
gardener, not just transplants, should have this book; it will elevate anyone 
to the level of sophisticated horticulturist. 
</P>
<P>
The most surprising book of the season is called The Mediterranean Gardener by 
Hugo Latymer (Barrons's: $35). This is the first book I have seen that tells 
how people garden around the Mediterranean sea, and what they grow. It is not 
specifically about California, but about a sister -- and namesake -- climate, 
and as such is very interesting and inspirational. It is fun to see native 
California plants, such as the ceanothus, called "outstanding" when they are so 
seldom grown in their own native land. 
</P>
<P>
Gardeners who like nothing better than to get their hands dirty will enjoy 
Masters of the Victory Garden by Jim Wilson (Little, Brown: $19.95, paper) 
because it is about really good gardeners and how they grow plants. The 
transplants among us should ignore the sections on rhododendrons, hostas and 
peonies, which don't grow here or are darned difficult, but the daylilies, 
roses, lilies, peppers and other plants mentioned in this book do fine. 
</P>
<P>
A growing group of gardeners sees the yard as part of the overall environment. 
They are interested in native plants and wildflowers, and would be thrilled to 
receive Butterfly Gardening, by the Xerces Society (Sierra Club Books: $18.95). 
This is about butterflies and the plants they use for food, and how to set up a 
garden that is as attractive to butterflies as Westwood is to teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors are quite another group of gardeners and more common than you might 
think. You probably know one or two of them. To ferret them out, casually ask 
these simple questions when the opportunity arises: What is your favorite 
plant? What is your second-favorite plant? If the answer both times is African 
violets, or cactus, or bromeliads, or orchids, you have uncovered a collector. 
As a rule, they like one group of plants and have absolutely no interest in any 
other. They are very difficult to buy books for because they probably already 
own every one of interest. If you happen to know an orchid collector, however, 
you might beat him to the bookstore for the brand-new edition of Home Orchid 
Growing by Rebecca Tyson Northern (Prentice Hall Press: $45), one of the more 
understandable of orchid books. Here is everything about orchids, from Acallis 
to Zygostates. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody loves roses, so books on roses have an almost universal appeal. 
Although there are certainly rose zealots who grow nothing else, they were 
clearly not the intended audience for The Glory of Roses, with photographs by 
Christopher Baker (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang: $50). Author Allen Lacy 
provides an interesting and amusing text and takes a stab at identifying the 
various roses in the gorgeous photographs by Baker. But be forewarned: They 
often go unnamed, which on occasion is quite frustrating if you are looking at 
a rose you desperately want for your own garden. Never mind; in this case the 
pictures alone may be worth the price.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROCHELLE REED, Reed is Style Editor of The Los Angeles Times Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past ten years, Southern Californians have been obsessively interested 
in home design. This is not surprising: "style" runs a predictable course. In 
the teenage years through the twenties, your average person is usually 
interested in personal adornment -- clothes -- and by extension, the 
accoutrements of a successful personal appearance: watches, fancy datebooks, 
prestigious cars. In the thirties years when a career has been launched, 
private rather than public values become important. This usually means an 
attempt at decorating an apartment. Then comes the desire to own (and 
redecorate) a house -- the stage now commanding the attention of the baby boom 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
No matter at what stage you find it, however, style is expensive, especially 
home style. Chose the expensive bathroom fixtures and there goes the vacation. 
The fact that the eight international style books produced by writer Suzanne 
Slesin and designer Stafford Cliff combine home design with armchair travel may 
be one reason why they continue to fascinate. Another reason, of course, is 
that they have what's known in the decorating business as "sigh" quality. These 
books show beautiful, real life interiors, demonstrating what some decorating 
magazines have learned and many decorators have not: that a perfectly decorated 
room, or a room without a sense of the owner, looks cold and forbidding no 
matter the weave of the fabric or the cost of the chairs. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the duo have brought forth two splendid works -- Indian Style, 
photographed by David Brittain (Clarkson Potter, $45), and Spanish Style, with 
stylist Daniel Rozensztroch and photographer Gilles de Chabaneix (Clarkson 
Potter, $45). Both are books about true style -- that is, they show a look, not 
a pricetag. 
</P>
<P>
The cover of "Indian Style" tells the story. It pictures a small, ochre-colored 
house in the walled city Jaisalmer. Laundry is draped over a second floor 
balcony and a hasty coat of turquoise paint dribbles down the architectural 
details. It may be the house of a poor family by our standards, but it is 
gorgeous. And then some 700 photos peer inside maharajas palaces, Kashmiri 
houseboats, even painted mud huts in the countryside. One photo simply shows a 
tall English cupboard unceremoniously topped with cardboard boxes. Perhaps 
better than in any of their other books, Slesin and Cliff convincingly 
demonstrate that elegance and sophistication doesn't have anything to do with 
money, yet the owner of a mansion as well as an apartment rentor will carry 
away ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise the just-off-the-press "Spanish Style" is a visual tour de force 
behind closed doors. For the most part, interiors are pin-neat; you can imagine 
stylist Daniel Rozensztroch working behind the scenes to arrange lemons in 
compotes and straighten a collection of antique iron keys adorning a kitchen 
wall. And as they have begun to do in "Indian Style," Slesin and Cliff expand 
their coverage beyond interiors with a bit of Spanish history and color. 
</P>
<P>
Similar in format to "Spanish Style," Miami Hot &amp; Cool (Clarkson Potter, 
$35) by Laura Cerwinske and Steven Brooke pokes through a variety of Florida 
houses from the beach to the everglades. Though smaller in scale than the 
Slesin-Cliff books -- there are 400 photos compared to some 700 in "Indian 
Style" -- "Miami Hot &amp; Cool" is directly revelant to home decor in Southern 
California. Glancing at the modern beach cottages with their collections of 
Bauer ware, you almost think you are in Southern California. But then there are 
memorable places -- and important decorating lessons in use of color, for 
instance -- in homes such as a tropical tree house raised high in the palms of 
the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
If cool minimalism is to your taste, The New Moderns by Jonathan Glancey and 
Richard Bryant (Crown, $35) is an international survey of new residential 
architecture. Interiors are constructed to take advantage of light and provide 
ample open space; there's no Post-Modern fussiness here. Although these 
interiors are extremely difficult to photograph because their simple and 
unadorned geometric shapes don't impart the warmth that the residences have in 
real life, Bryant's photographs manage the task quite well. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Mary Emmerling's passion for the American country look never 
becomes cloying, making it appealing even to fans of modern minimalism. Her 
latest tome, Mary Emmerling's American Country Classics (Clarkson Potter, $40) 
updates American Country, her classic work of ten years ago. Some of these 
interiors are familiar to readers of decorating magazines -- for instance, the 
Malibu residences of Bruce Dern and Peter Guber's Aspen lodge -- but this book 
is a fine montage of country styles, running the gamut from pure country to 
Western cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
As though to fill the shelves of newly renovated homes, the season also brings 
an excellent book on collectibles. Jaya Jaitly and Kamal Sahar's Crafts of 
Kashmir, Jammu &amp; Ladakh (Abbeville Press, $55) is an intriguing look at a 
variety of crafts from this richly creative area of India. The jeweled nose 
rings and silver necklaces almost make me wish that personal adornment -- not 
family habitat -- was my own stage of Style.

PAPERBACKS: CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON, Solomon writes the weekly Paperbacks column for Book 
Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the economy stumbles into recession, stagflation or just plain bad times, 
paperbacks become increasingly attractive gift choices: They're cheaper, easier 
to wrap and ship and less likely to turn up on the discount tables the day 
after New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
Photographers rushed to document the monumental events in Eastern Europe that 
marked the end of the Cold War era, and collections of their work rank among 
the year's most dramatic gift offerings. 
</P>
<P>
The western face of the Berlin Wall apparently served as the world's largest 
graffiti gallery, eclipsing even the New York subway system. Two new books 
record those vanished markings, The Writing on the Wall: Peace At the Berlin 
Wall by Terry Tillman (22/7 Publishing: $19.95) and The Berlin Wall by Hermann 
Waldenburg (Abbeville: $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
Tillman, a former singer with the New Christie Minstrels, wears his heart on 
his page, juxtaposing the graffiti (which range from words to cartoon 
characters to stylized images of the Statue of Liberty) with quotations from 
John F. Kennedy, Albert Einstein, Carl Sandberg, Bob Dylan et al. The presence 
of so much "inspirational" material in so small a space quickly cloys, and the 
book sinks beneath the weight of the author's good intentions. Waldenburg keeps 
the focus on the graffiti itself, which makes his book the more effective. 
Neither author bothers to translate the German inscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Breakthrough, edited by P. Christin &amp; A.C. Knigge (Catalan: $13.95), 
presents the reactions of an international group of cartoonists to the 
destruction of the Wall. Milo Manara (Italy) borrows imagery from Chagall to 
suggest the intoxication of East Germany's new freedom, while Andre Juillard 
(France) muses on the obstacles that still obstruct human communication in a 
series of stark, pale drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Most affecting of all is Moments of Revolution: Eastern Europe, photographs by 
David &amp; Peter Turnley, text by Mort Rosenblum (Stewart, Tabori, Chang: 
$19.95), which shows the reader human faces rather than slabs of concrete. An 
elderly woman prays in the Vilnius cathedral; Bulgarians in Sofia march by 
candlelight in one exquisite photograph, while their compatriots in Bucharest 
mourn the revolutionaries who died overthrowing the brutal Nicolae Ceausescu. 
Perhaps the most depressing picture for American readers is the introspective 
portrait of Czech president Vaclav Havel: Who can imagine George Bush -- or 
anyone else in the U.S. government -- choosing to go to jail rather than 
compromise his principles? 
</P>
<P>
Equally handsome and only slightly less dramatic are two exceptional nature 
books, which rank among the season's most desirable gifts: 
</P>
<P>
If there's a scale for measuring cuteness, giant pandas probably score even 
higher than koalas, puppies and bunnies. The Secret World of Pandas, edited by 
Byron Preiss and Gao Xueyu (Abrams: $24.95), ranks as the most endearing 
paperback of the holiday season. Pandas can't seem to help being appealing, 
whether rolling in bamboo groves, playing in the snow or caring for their cubs. 
Even the most hardened curmudgeon, looking at these splendid photographs, will 
want to hug these distant cousins to bears. The text, a series of brief essays 
by various authors, is far less cheering. Only about 1,000 pandas remain in the 
mountains of central China, and the efforts to breed them in zoos have met with 
very limited success. Part of the proceeds from "Secret World" will go to the 
Chinese campaign to save the panda from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Few animals arouse a more primal response from humans than wolves; people tend 
to see them as either savage hunters or noble symbols of the untamed 
wilderness. Wolves by Candace Savage (Sierra Club Books: $19.95) weighs myth 
against scientific evidence to present a realistic picture of the lives of 
these splendid creatures -- hunting, communicating, socializing, parenting. 
Despite centuries of human hunting and trapping, wolves are doing much better 
than pandas. 
</P>
<P>
It's about 60 million years too late to do a photo book on dinosaurs, but 
Flying Dinosaurs by Michael Johnson (Contemporary Books: $14.95) is sure to 
please any armchair paleontologist. The brightly colored, die-cut images of 
eight pterosaurs (flying dinosaurs) can be made into models that really fly. 
The printed patterns are handsome, but they look like an awful lot of work to 
assemble. Anyone who'd go to the bother of cutting out individual teeth with an 
Exacto knife isn't likely to risk flying his handiwork: A crash would be too 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
Much prettier -- and even more difficult-looking -- are the patterns in Chinese 
Artistic Kites by Ha Kuiming and Ha Yiqi, two members of Beijing's most 
celebrated family of kite-makers (China Books: $16.95). These exquisite 
constructions will come as a revelation to people who think of kites as clumsy, 
dime-store toys of tissue paper and balsa wood. Directions are included for 
opulently beautiful kites that resemble clusters of birds, butterflies, 
goldfish and dragons, but only a highly trained artist could possibly make 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The recipes in Lora Brody's Growing Up on the Chocolate Diet (Stephen Greene 
Press/Pelham: $10.95) are a lot easier to follow. Brody's ostensibly comic 
memoirs are pretty dumb, but some of the desserts sound terrific -- the 
Chocolate Cherry Torte, for example, or the Marquise Glacee au Chocolate 
(literally, "the chocolate-covered marquise"). However, Brody can't even serve 
cornflakes without tossing in extra-large egg yolks, heavy cream and unsalted 
butter, so it's probably best to give this book to someone who doesn't care 
about waistlines or cholesterol counts (the cast of "Babes," perhaps). 
</P>
<P>
Less ambitious (or more calorie-conscious) readers might prefer to spend their 
time with American Championship Crosswords, edited by Will Shortz (Fawcett 
Columbine: $7.95). These puzzles are supposed to be exceptionally tough, but 
most of them aren't all that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The silliest make-it-yourself book of the season is A Coloring Book: Drawings 
by Andy Warhol (Simon &amp; Schuster: $24.95), which consists of 13 
black-and-white reproductions of early Warhol drawings, waiting to be colored 
in by some upscale child whose parents are dim enough to blow $25 on a coloring 
book. At 15x20 inches, the book is so large that it would be tricky to carry a 
copy down the street during a Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s have passed and no one seems eager to have them return, but Albrecht 
Bangert and Karl Michael Armer offer a paean to the Reagan era's curious tastes 
in furnishings in 80s Style: Designs of the Decade (Abbeville: $29.95). Most of 
the furniture they extol in the often tongue-in-cheek text is opulent, eclectic 
(if not downright bizarre-looking) and wildly impractical. Shiro Kuramata's 
"How High the Moon" chair of metal mesh, Stefan Zwicky's cast-concrete chair 
and the cut and folded sheet-steel chair by Ron Arad look about as comfortable 
as an iron maiden. 
</P>
<P>
The images of flyblown coffee shops, motels and gas stations in Route 66: The 
Highway and Its People, a photographic essay by Quinta Scott, text by Susan 
Croce Kelly (University of Oklahoma Press: $17.95), evoke a different time in 
America. The 2,200-mile road, which ran from Chicago to Santa Monica, crossed 
the heartland of the continent before travelers deserted it. The prose and 
black-and-white photographs form a portrait of the '40s and '50s that feels 
both simpler and stultifying. 
</P>
<P>
Native American Portraits 1862-1918 by Nancy Hathaway (Chronicle Books: $16.95) 
offers a more sobering look at America's past. These photographs, taken between 
the Civil War and World War I, capture the beauty and tragedy of the Amerindian 
people. Harriet Smith Pullen's 1906 portrait of Ano-Ylosk, head chief of the 
Taku tribe, reveals an opulent prince in all his majesty, while George W. 
Scott's study of Sitting Bull conveys the monumental sorrow of a Greek tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Two handsome volumes in "The Making of the Past" series have recently been 
issued in paperback: The Egyptian Kingdoms by A. Rosalie David and The Greek 
World by Roger Ling (Peter Bedrick: $16.95 each). "Kingdoms" is far more 
interesting, especially the discussion of how the pyramids and other gargantuan 
monuments served as vast public-works projects rather than sops to royal 
vanity. "The Greek World" presents such a stuffy, sanitized account of 
classical culture that even the splendid reproductions of Greek statuary can't 
redeem it. 
</P>
<P>
Cartoon books always are popular gifts, and in these times, Americans need 
their sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
The most delightful cartoon book of the season is On Holiday by Jean Jacques 
Sempe (Prestel/te Neues: $24.95), whose captionless studies of little people 
lost in summer landscapes are familiar to readers of the New Yorker. Instead of 
drawing types -- suburban housewives, gawky teen-agers, businessmen -- Sempe 
populates his drawings with individuals, characters who happen to be housewives 
and teen-agers and businessmen but who also have lives that extend beyond the 
moment in the cartoon. This unusual depth imbues his simple drawings in pen, 
pencil and watercolor with an irresistible charm. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to creating the comic-macabre characters of "The Addams Family" 
fame, the late Charles Addams pioneered black humor in cartooning, preparing 
audiences for the work of Gary Larson, Gahan Wilson and B. Kliban. My Crowd 
(Fireside: $10.95) includes some classic examples of Addams' off-the-wall 
humor, including Morticia, Gomez and Lurch preparing to pour boiling oil onto a 
group of holiday carolers, and an ordinary little man who turns into a werewolf 
during a planetarium show about the moon. 
</P>
<P>
A unique combination of imagination, childhood memories and fine drawing makes 
Bill Watterson's "Calvin and Hobbes" the best comic strip in the newspapers 
today. The Authoritative Calvin and Hobbes (Andrews and McMeel: $12.95) is that 
rare treasure, the perfect gift, sure to please a close friend or the distant 
relative who agrees to put you up during a holiday skiing trip. John Caldwell's 
Fax This Book (Workman: $9.95), a collection of comic cover sheets designed to 
attract people's attention to messages sent via fax machine, is certainly the 
oddest cartoon book of the year. Whether the idea will work is anybody's guess, 
but Caldwell deserves a better outlet for his considerable talent. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Jones, who created Wile E. Coyote, the Road Runner, Pepe LePew and some 
of the best Bugs Bunny cartoons, offers his recollections of life at the Warner 
Brothers cartoon studio and some general thoughts on animation in Chuck Amuck: 
The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist (Avon: $12.95). Jones writes the 
way he talks, and reading "Chuck Amuck" is like spending an afternoon with one 
America's foremost cartoon directors. 
</P>
<P>
Moving from animation to live-action, MGM's "The Wizard of Oz" remains one of 
the most perfect fantasies ever created in Hollywood. The Wizard of Oz: The 
Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History by John Fricke, Jay Scarfone and 
William Stillman (Warner: $16.95) probably would please anyone who loves the 
movie -- which includes just about everyone. An even more detailed look at the 
way the Hollywood studio system functioned during its final years can be found 
in Ronald Haver's A Star Is Born (Harper &amp; Row: $12.95). Haver also 
recounts his experiences in restoring the 1954 musical for its 1983 re-release, 
and shows readers just how carelessly films were treated in the not-so-good old 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn: March 1955, photographs by Ed Feingersh, text by Bob Labrasca (Delta: 
$12.95), documents a week the actress spent in New York City, culminating in 
her appearance atop a pink elephant at a benefit performance of the Ringling 
Brothers, Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in Madison Square Garden. "Marilyn" 
undoubtedly will delight nostalgia buffs and devotees of supermarket tabloids, 
but more balanced readers may wonder if the poor woman will ever be left in 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals looking for a coffee-table book (or anyone wondering what the recent 
brouhaha in Cincinatti was all about) might like a copy of Robert Mapplethorpe 
by Richard Marshall (Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown: $29.95), the program from 
the exhibit that provoked the firestorm of controversy over freedom of 
expression versus obscenity. However, readers in search of salacious thrills 
probably will be disappointed: Although often cooly beautiful, Mapplethrope's 
imagery seems so remote and so imbued with a fashion-photography sensibility 
that the shots of people doing awful things look like glossy magazine ads for 
De Sade Interiors. 
</P>
<P>
Readers curious to know what really went on in the park with Georges should 
consider Seurat by Richard Thomson (Phaidon/Universe: $29.95), a scholarly yet 
approachable study of the artist's work and influences. Watercolors by Jean 
Leymarie (Rizzoli: $25.00) surveys the medium from Leonardo to Picasso, Cezanne 
and Balthus. Handsomely printed reproductions capture the nuances of the 
delicate paintings, including Durer's astonishingly realistic study of a clump 
of marsh grasses. 
</P>
<P>
And as Santa Claus remarked as he emerged from the bookstore (pausing by the 
remainder table to kick over a stack of Nancy Reagan's "My Turn"), "Merry 
Christmas to all, and to all a good read!"

IN SRI LANKA, STRIFE IN THE VILLAGE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SADDAM HUSSEIN, Sri Lanka 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away among palm trees and fertile rice fields, the village of Saddam 
Hussein stands as a grim reminder of the bloody violence sweeping the Tamil and 
Muslim communities of eastern Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
Six hundred families once lived in Saddam Hussein village, built in 1982 with 
funds from the Iraqi government and named after its president. 
</P>
<P>
Today, its dusty streets and houses are deserted. Its population fled after 
they were chased away by the Tamil Tiger guerrillas, who are fighting the Sri 
Lankan government for an independent homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Crowded into refugee camps, the angry Muslims claim that the man their village 
is named after gives them the inspiration for their jihad (holy war) against 
the Tamils. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had enough of the Tamils," says Muhammad Rashif, a former resident of 
the village. "We are fighting to make Islam strong once again." 
</P>
<P>
Gun battles between armed Muslims and Tamil guerrillas take place daily as the 
two sides carry out a series of reprisal attacks. The predominantly Hindu 
Tamils are abducted if they venture into Muslim areas. The Muslims, many of 
whom are farmers, are shot if they stray into Tamil territory. Muslim youths 
have also formed clandestine hit squads to carry out attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the emergence of an ethnic apartheid with the two communities 
estranged and polarized. 
</P>
<P>
Violence between the two communities first flared last August, after 300 
Muslims were killed in a series of massacres by suspected Tamil Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Muslims have traditionally made up a nonpolitical, prosperous business 
community and have not been involved in Sri Lanka's ethnic politics. But the 
massacres sparked a new-found militancy among Sri Lanka's Muslims, which is 
drawing much of its strength from the worldwide growth in Islamic 
fundamentalism and the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam is our hero. He is fighting for Islam and we look to his example," says 
Faroq Talfiq, a teacher in the Muslim town of Eravur in eastern Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
The violence also marks a significant shift in Sri Lanka's ethnic crisis. 
Muslims and Tamils have always lived side by side in eastern parts of the 
island, where Muslims, who are the descendants of Arab traders, make up 35% of 
the 1.2-million population. 
</P>
<P>
As the violence between Muslims and Tamils escalates, leaders of the Muslim 
community have already begun asking for regional autonomy for their people.

CLIENTELE IS CHANGED, BUT MONACO'S REPUTATION IS STILL RICHLY DESERVED; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: THE TINY NATION REMAINS A PLAYGROUND OF THE WEALTHY. BUT TODAY'S 
VISITORS ARE MOSTLY BUSINESS TYCOONS, NOT IDLE ARISTOCRATS.

MONACO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this glamorous tax haven, money's playground by the sea, the idle rich are 
making room for the busy, bustling rich. 
</P>
<P>
Aristocrats still risk fortunes at the Casino's velvet-covered tables, but the 
380-acre principality is catering to a new breed of wealth and power. 
</P>
<P>
It seeks the working rich who may spend a week in Monaco -- not six months like 
the grand dukes of a century ago -- to check on an industrial investment, watch 
the Grand Prix or attend a business convention. 
</P>
<P>
On a stroll through the Casino gardens, you're more likely to meet carpet 
salesmen from Toronto than European royalty. Last year, Monaco welcomed 50,000 
convention-goers. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism now generates only one-fourth of the $5 billion gross national product. 
Gambling, once the government's mainstay, brings in only 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Banking accounts for 35% and light industry 27%. Monaco now has 50 banks, and 
more are coming. 
</P>
<P>
Rainier III, prince of Monaco and ruler since 1949, sought to preserve and 
capitalize on Monaco's reputation for glamour when he called for economic 
diversification. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has put its money behind prestige and luxury," said a public 
relations officer for the principality. "It used to bank on the very rich. 
Today it has sought to develop a clientele of the slightly less rich." 
</P>
<P>
Hotel statistics are revealing. Monaco has 2,400 rooms, 80% in the luxury 
category going for $200 to $450. Fewer than 100 rooms cost less than $50. 
</P>
<P>
Officials try to keep industry and tourism apart. Hardly any of the3 million 
day-trippers who spilled from trains and buses last year went near the 
industrial park on Fontvieille, a peninsula reclaimed from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Monaco's 700 industrial companies are there. Most are in such 
high-tech, non-polluting fields as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
A value-added tax on the new commercial activities is the largest source of 
revenue in Monaco's annual budget of $510 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fontvieille accommodates both factories and company headquarters, stacked atop 
each other in skyscrapers. Nearby are a new sports stadium, a three-star hotel, 
a heliport and Monaco's only low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
It was the brainchild of Prince Rainier, who saw the future in real estate for 
his tiny realm. A forest of skyscrapers, eyesores to many visitors, looms 
against a background of steep mountains, dwarfing hillside villas built in the 
19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial or residential space in Monaco generally is more expensive than in 
Paris and New York. A two-room apartment in Fontvieille rents for $3,000 a 
month, and cheaper accommodations are difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
Housing has become a major headache. The government gives priority for 
state-owned housing and rent subsidies of up to 50% to the natives, called 
Monegasques, but demand exceeds supply. 
</P>
<P>
Many apartments are owned by investors who spend little time in them. At night, 
darkened windows make patches on luxury high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
Nightlife revolves around a few expensive discotheques and clubs, and around 
cultural events geared to the wealthy Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Young residents complain of little to do. Monaco has only one movie theater, no 
discount or department stores, and no major shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
There is virtually no unemployment, yet Monegasques -- about 4,500 in a 
population of 27,000 -- worry about the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not finding jobs for young Monegasques, it's finding jobs 
suited to their educational degrees and qualifications," said Stephane Valeri, 
28. 
</P>
<P>
He heads the Assn. of Young Monegasques, founded in 1986 to handle their 
employment and housing problems and help them start businesses. Citizens now 
own less than 3% of commerce and industry in Monaco, but Valeri said new 
opportunities have been opening in services and the law. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very attached to our history, our traditions and to the royal family," 
he said. "We're just trying to make Monaco better for the year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the myth that all are rich, which the government tries to 
dispel, Monegasques have a poor reputation as workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Monegasques . . . adopt a superior attitude and feel they can get away 
with anything because they know they can't be fired," said a government 
spokesperson on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,000 Italians who cross the border each day to work in hotels and 
restaurants envy the privileges of Monegasques, including comprehensive health 
insurance, higher wages and the first crack at vacant jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of this fiscal paradise, except for French nationals who have arrived 
since 1957, pay no taxes on income, capital gains or on an inheritance if it 
comes directly from a parent or spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Security and respectability are basic tenets. The police force, which has 400 
members, help tourists, direct traffic and discourage purse snatching and other 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"Monaco is the type of place where you think twice about dropping candy 
wrappers," said a retired Greek executive who has lived here 35 years. "You 
feel very safe, and life is very calm." 
</P>
<P>
A dress code confines bathing suits to the beach and forbids going barefoot. 
Shorts are permitted, but men are not allowed to go bare-chested. Expulsion 
from Monaco is the punishment for violations. 
</P>
<P>
Officials know the future depends on physical expansion. Besides putting the 
train station underground, architects unveiled plans last year for three 
floating islands with their own stores and homes, connected to the mainland by 
bridges and ferries. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like . . . Jules Verne, but it's something I'm sure my successors 
will have to deal with," said Jean-Louis Medecin, the mayor.

SURVIVOR OF ENNISKILLEN 1987 BLOOD BATH RELIVES NIGHTMARE THAT TOUCHED WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
DUBLIN, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gordon Wilson touched hearts around the world with his grief-stricken words of 
forgiveness for the IRA bombers who killed his daughter in the war memorial 
massacre in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"Dirty sort of talk is not going to bring her back," he said in a moving 
interview that may have helped to stop another blood bath -- Protestant 
extremist retaliation for one of the Irish Republican Army's biggest bomb 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson received 10,000 letters of support after relating how he clutched the 
hand of his daughter, Marie, as she lay fatally injured under the ruins of 
Enniskillen's community center. Her last words: "Daddy, I love you very much." 
</P>
<P>
Now, three years after the bombing that killed 11 people and injured 63 in the 
picturesque border town on Nov. 8, 1987, Wilson has tried to exorcise his grief 
with a poignantly told biography entitled "Marie." 
</P>
<P>
"It literally ripped a hole in the heart of the community but miraculously that 
heart beat continues and grows steadily stronger," writes Wilson, who was 
showered with man-of-the-year and peace awards. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II praised the depth of his forgiveness in her Christmas 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"Spirit of Enniskillen" scholarships enabled children from across Northern 
Ireland's sectarian divide to go abroad. The town opened its own integrated 
school. 
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 people signed a book of condolence in the Dublin Lord Mayor's 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson won widespread praise for recently retelling the tragic story on Irish 
television and the biography has become a bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the carnage continues. Sixty-five people have died so far this year in 
Northern Ireland's political and sectarian conflict, topping the figure for all 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Enniskillen was not the catalyst, never the turning point that Wilson hoped it 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
After the agony of the loss of his daughter, Wilson felt that the story of the 
20-year-old nurse had to be told. He recalled it all just hours after the 
explosion in a hesitant voice that echoed round the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The wall collapsed and we were thrown forward, rubble and stones all around us 
and under us. I remember thinking: 'I'm not hurt but there is a pain in my 
shoulder.' I shouted to Marie: 'Are you all right?' 
</P>
<P>
"She said 'Yes.' She found my hand and said "Is that your hand, Dad?' I said: " 
'Are you all right dear?' But we were under six feet of rubble. Three or four 
times I asked her. Three or four times I asked her: 'Are you all right Marie?' 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her the fifth time. She said: 'Daddy, I love you very much.' 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the last words she spoke to me. I kept shouting 'Marie, are you all 
right?' There was no reply. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lost my daughter but I bear no ill will, no grudge. Dirty sort of talk 
is not going to bring her back to life. I don't have an answer. But I know 
there has to be a plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't think that, I would commit suicide. It's part of a great plan and 
God is good. And we shall meet again." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors fought for five hours to save Marie's life. 
</P>
<P>
In the book her mother, Joan, recalls: "My darling Marie was dying. I kissed 
her and I shall always see her eyelids flickering to my dying day. Sister (a 
nurse) whispered very gently: 'Mrs. Wilson, Marie's heart has stopped beating.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Offering the best epitaph he can for his daughter, Gordon Wilson writes of the 
IRA bombers: "It cannot be easy to look at yourself in the mirror in such a 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am not going to add to the hatreds by talking about bitterness or 
revenge. I'll go on praying for all of them and leave the rest to God. That is 
the only way I can handle it and still live with myself. 
</P>
<P>
"In life and after death there is only one ultimate standard by which we are 
judged. Marie showed that to us all as she lay under rubble at the cenotaph, 
holding my hand with her life slipping away. The bottom line is love. There is 
nothing more I can say."

MONK TYCOON BUILDS A BUDDHIST EMPIRE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hsing Yun TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Hsing Yun fled China in 1949 with only his gray 
robe and cotton shoes. Today, he is a millionaire monk, praised by some as a 
philanthropist, reviled by others as a mail-order preacher. 
</P>
<P>
He has more than 400,000 disciples in Taiwan, 27 monasteries around the world 
and assets valued at more than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
In two decades, Hsing Yun has fashioned a Buddhist empire that stretches from 
Taiwan to Australia and the United States. He runs a temple in Las Vegas and 
hopes to build a university in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the 63-year-old monk returned to China as a philanthropist, drawing 
big crowds as he donated handsomely to dozens of temples. 
</P>
<P>
His influence, popularity and cash won him a meeting with China's president, 
Yang Shangkun, despite the fact that the Communist Party strictly controls 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
To critics, who believe that Buddhists should be austere, Hsing Yun is a 
mail-order preacher who makes a fortune from contributors seeking a fast route 
to Nirvana. He operates his temples as a big business, they say, raking in 
profits with special prayer services for the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say Hsing Yun offers free prayer services and free Buddhist 
education to the poor, including about 500 students at his six Buddhist 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
They also praise the monk's political acumen and his philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the many Buddhist masters who instruct their disciples to give up 
pleasures for a serene after-life, Hsing Yun teaches how to achieve peace in a 
busy, industrial society. 
</P>
<P>
Hsing Yun has called on many world and religious leaders who avoid visiting 
diplomatically isolated Taiwan. To the Taiwan press, he is the island's "super 
diplomat." 
</P>
<P>
The monk's Hsi Lai Temple near Los Angeles has given refuge to several 
dissidents who fled China after the June, 1989, crackdown on the pro-democracy 
movement. Earlier this year, Xu Jiatun, China's top diplomat in Hong Kong, 
stayed at the temple after abruptly leaving the British colony. 
</P>
<P>
"If we live in reclusion and are concerned only about cultivating ourselves, 
what do our nation and society want us for?" Hsing Yun asked during an 
interview. "Money comes from all quarters and goes to all rounds." 
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, huge crowds attend Hsing Yun's frequent rallies, where he uses 
anecdotes from Buddhism to teach people how to build happy families. He also 
uses radio and television to preach his message. 
</P>
<P>
Hsing Yun was born into a peasant family in Jiangsu province, became a monk at 
12 in a monastery at Nanjing, central China, where he took his current name. It 
means "stars and clouds." 
</P>
<P>
He fled to Taiwan with the Nationalist government in 1949 after Communist 
forces won the civil war. For two years, his main job was to get water from a 
well for the monks and guests at a temple in western Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, he used royalties from his writings to buy a mountain in Kaohsiung in 
the south. In the following years, he used disciples' donations and bank loans 
to build Fo Kuang Shan, or Mountain of Buddha's Light, into a complex of 
temples, schools, guest houses, an old-age home, a museum and cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
Fo Kuang Shan has become a tourist attraction, with 10 glittering temples and a 
bronze Buddha 120 feet tall surrounded by 480 smaller ones at its feet. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the main temple are two pagodas 30 feet tall, each illuminated with 
bulbs and engraved with 7,200 miniature Buddha statues. Under computer control, 
they revolve and broadcast Buddhist hymns. 
</P>
<P>
Hsing Yun, who retired as abbot of Fo Kuang Shan four years ago but still 
controls temple business, says he lives a simple life and uses his money to 
educate the public about Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
"Buddhism is a human religion," he said as hundreds of disciples in black gowns 
prayed and sang hymns in a hall next to his reception room. "Monks and nuns 
must reach out and maintain a world view." 
</P>
<P>
One of his most ambitious plans is to open Hsi Lai University in Los Angeles 
for Americans interested in religious studies. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans have built universities in China and Taiwan," he said. "We should 
also do something to help cultural exchange with the West."

ALASKA BOOKMOBILE FLIES TO FAR POINTS;

LIBRARIES: THE STATE USES BACK-COUNTRY PILOTS TO GIVE ALL OF ITS RESIDENTS 
EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION, ENTERTAINMENT AND INFORMATION.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the back country of Alaska, out of the reach of television, commercial radio 
or even daily newspapers, thousands of families are staying in touch the 
old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
They're reading books. 
</P>
<P>
Bush pilots regularly fly library books to some 3,000 Alaskans to fulfill a 
promise dating from territorial days that all residents should have equal 
access to public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
For people such as Elaine and Pete Velsko and their two daughters, who live on 
Tutka Bay, 125 miles from Anchorage, those green mailbags full of books, which 
arrive once or twice a month, offer both education and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband asks for all nonfiction. He wants to keep up with the world," 
Elaine Velsko says. "But I like my stories. If I didn't get my green bags, I 
think I'd perish out here." 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Velsko has spent 13 years on Tutka Bay, 14 miles from Homer, managing 
her modern ranch home and teaching her children, ages 8 and 4, through 
correspondence courses. Her husband runs the state fish hatchery nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The way some people might flick on a soap opera, she'll pull a novel out of the 
sack and read. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living more the pioneering life," she says. "It's what we want." 
</P>
<P>
About 175 miles north, in the village of Skwentna, Joe and Norma Delia have 
spent 40 years on their 10-acre homestead hunting, trapping, running the post 
office and reading flown-in library books to their two children. 
</P>
<P>
"For my kids, books were a big thing in their lives," Joe Delia says. "They 
didn't have things that kids in town have to occupy their time." 
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1957, Alaska's bush library service operated for more than a decade 
out of the state library at Juneau. But it specialized in historical and 
government material and, for readers, wasn't the same as being able to browse a 
library shelf or bookstore for a good read. 
</P>
<P>
George Smith, who oversees the $265,000 state grant that pays for the service's 
postage and library staff, says the service was transferred 10 years ago to the 
public libraries at Juneau, Fairbanks and Anchorage to give readers a chance at 
more contemporary collections. 
</P>
<P>
Only a fraction of the estimated 40,000 people who live in rural Alaska are 
signed up for books by mail. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is writer Janice Schofield. From her one-room cabin in the Rocky 
River Valley near Homer, Schofield began a study of grasses and flowers and was 
inspired to write a book on Alaska's native plants. 
</P>
<P>
Her reference guides were almost exclusively library books delivered by mail 
plane and left for her at a remote mail shed on Kantishna Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always great -- like having this little goody box coming in the mail," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
To fetch the books, Schofield and her husband, Edward, hiked or skied to their 
car, drove to the end of the road, and then hiked or skied another half a mile 
to reach the shed. There the books went into backpacks and the Schofields made 
their way back out. 
</P>
<P>
"Discovering Wild Plants," published last year by Northwest Discovery 
Publications, was the first book she ever researched by mail, letting the 
library know generally what she needed and then waiting to see what turned up. 
</P>
<P>
Most people in the bush want popular fiction, children's books and popular 
nonfiction, Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell us what they want -- either they give us titles or they just specify 
a subject -- and then we choose the collections," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Delia, who says he'll often rise at 3 a.m. to finish a Louis L'Amour novel 
or maybe a spy thriller by Robert Ludlum, has been a patron of the bush library 
service for at least 20 years, longer than almost anyone else. Once in a while, 
he says, he'll open a fresh sack of six or 10 books only to find he's already 
read them. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I read the more I want to read," says Delia, 59. 
</P>
<P>
"When we had nothing to read in the trap line cabins -- and this is no joke -- 
we'd read the labels on cans. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be able to tell you all the ingredients in a can of Carnation milk. 
I didn't pronounce it all correctly, but I knew them." 
</P>
<P>
In Juneau or Fairbanks or Anchorage, where a computer helps track the book 
requests, librarians too can follow a family's progress by the books they want. 
After a few years of being a family's personal book shopper, library workers 
get Christmas cards or friendly notes. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep up a lot of correspondence," says Brenda Bergsrud, who works with the 
program at Anchorage's Z.J. Loussac Library. 
</P>
<P>
"A parent will write and say, 'Tanya likes horses, so send us horse books.' And 
then Tanya will send us a picture of a horse. We start to feel like family."

ARABS NOW SCARCE ON BANGKOK SIN STRIP 
</P>

<P>
Hard times are visiting the hotels, bars and sex shops of Nana Road, a favorite 
hangout of visiting Arabs until the murders of three Saudi diplomats and the 
Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
For Arab tourists, most of whom were Saudi, Nana Road was a ready source of the 
sex and drink they could not enjoy in their own strict societies. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have to go out with Westerners," said Alisa, a 24-year-old prostitute. 
She said some of her friends had abandoned the trade and returned to their 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
Alisa said her monthly income dropped by more than half after the murders, to 
10,000 baht ($390). Lately, she has had no Arab customers at all. 
</P>
<P>
Three officials of the Saudi Embassy were shot down on Bangkok streets Feb. 1. 
The Saudi government, impatient with the slow Thai investigation, suspended 
acceptance of Thai workers and advised Saudis to stay away from Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
After Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2, citizens of the gulf states have been 
preoccupied with matters at home. Iraq barred foreign travel for its nationals 
soon after the invasion and Kuwaitis cannot leave. 
</P>
<P>
Flights to Bangkok from the Middle East have been curtailed. On Sept. 9, Thai 
Airways International indefinitely suspended its four weekly flights to Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tourism Authority figures, 130,751 tourists from the Middle East 
visited Thailand in 1989. They included 54,984 Saudis, 18,530 Israelis, 9,865 
Kuwaitis and 47,372 of other nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
The latest available figures show 52,828 tourists from the Middle East in the 
first six months of 1990, or 7,716 fewer than the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Arabs, once conspicuous in their white robes, have virtually disappeared from 
Nana Road. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Pee, assistant manager of the Rajah Hotel, said Arabs previously 
occupied 15% of the rooms, but the total fell to 5% after Iraq occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Nikorn Sirijaroenwat, captain at the Nana Fondue Grill, said Middle Easterners 
once accounted for 95% of his customers but now were only 10%. European and 
Thai dishes have been added to the menu, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Gulati tailor shop, the proprietor said: "We have to rearrange the shop 
so that it will appeal to Westerners." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is unhappy about the decline in Arab tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Some hotel owners did not accept Arab men, complaining of destruction of 
property in hotel rooms and "orgies" with local women. 
</P>
<P>
Several bars run by Western expatriates have signs saying Middle Eastern 
customers are not welcome. Some of the owners worked in the Middle East, and 
say they resent serving people from countries where they had faced punishment 
for drinking alcohol or trying to strike up friendships with women. 
</P>
<P>
Few Arabs frequented Patpong Road, the best-known sin strip in Bangkok, which 
caters largely to Westerners, resident expatriates and Thais.

SWISS ROAD BUILDER TREKS INTO HISTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
If Swiss geologist Toni Hagen had climbed instead of trekked for 40 years, he 
could have conquered Mt. Everest 1,500 times. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen, 72, estimates he has covered 5,550 miles of this Himalayan kingdom since 
he came 40 years ago to help build Nepal's first highway. 
</P>
<P>
"I have crisscrossed the whole country, and there is no corner where I have not 
been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently King Birendra enacted a constitution, establishing a constitutional 
monarchy and declaring a multiparty democracy. But in 1950, Nepal was one of 
the world's last forbidden kingdoms. Few foreigners had been allowed to enter, 
and none had explored it. It had no roads. 
</P>
<P>
The government, seeking to build a highway through the Himalayas and across the 
plains to India, sought help from Switzerland, another mountainous nation. 
Hagen was asked to make a geological survey. 
</P>
<P>
There already were a few cars in the kingdom: limousines that were carted over 
narrow mule paths by human porters. Thirty-six men, marching in four sweating 
rows, carried nine wooden beams bearing a shiny new automobile destined for the 
aristocracy. 
</P>
<P>
Other people, including Hagen, walked -- from Mt. Everest in the north to the 
Indian border in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Four decades later, Hagen still leaves his home in Switzerland's Lenzerheide 
hill resort for an annual trek in Nepal. A stocky man with thinning white hair, 
he reckons the trekking and a sense of humor "keeps me youthful." 
</P>
<P>
Once, during his travels as a surveyor, Hagen reached what was then the kingdom 
of Mustang on the northwestern border with Tibet. The next day the queen of 
Mustang sent a message that she was suffering from sunburn and could Hagen 
help? 
</P>
<P>
Hagen sent the best he had -- a pain-relieving ointment that at least would do 
no harm. "She was just curious," Hagen said. "She wanted to get some contact 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
The royal couple invited Hagen to tea the next day. The queen said the ointment 
was excellent. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not a doctor but had to carry a lot of medicines," Hagen said. "I had to 
distribute them because the local people considered me to be a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Another essential was the sack of silver coins that would take care of his 
expenses for six months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"The chief porter who was carrying the coins knew he was the most important man 
in the group," Hagen said. "Whenever we came to a resting place in a village, 
he would put down his basket under a tree with a big noise. 
</P>
<P>
"But imagine doing that in any other country at that time, or today in Nepal. 
The money would be gone in no time." 
</P>
<P>
One of Hagen's most treasured possessions is his trekking permit, a document 
now issued to tens of thousands of tourists every year. 
</P>
<P>
But Hagen's slip of paper carries a unique distinguishing mark -- the numeral 
1. It was the first ever issued.

CHINA ARCHEOLOGICAL TREASURE TROVES BEING LOOTED BY MODERN-DAY GRAVE ROBBERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
China's archeological treasures are being looted almost as soon as they are 
discovered, according to the man in charge of excavations at the country's most 
recent and possibly largest imperial find. 
</P>
<P>
Wang Xueli, deputy director of the Shaanxi Archaeology Institute in central 
China, told foreign journalists that modern-day tomb robbers were raiding 
unexcavated sites and leaving in luxury cars before flying out of the 
historically rich province. 
</P>
<P>
The capital of Shaanxi Province, Xian, was China's ancient capital and is best 
known as home to the famous terra-cotta army, found by accident 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In March this year, workers building a highway for Xian's new airport made 
another extraordinary discovery, stumbling upon a 2,100-year-old network of 
underground vaults that contain tens of thousands of pottery warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Two feet tall, the sculptures are one-third the size of the nearby terra-cotta 
army and are part of the burial site of Jingdi, a Han dynasty emperor who ruled 
from 157 BC to 141 BC. 
</P>
<P>
Wang and his team of five archeologists and up to 80 laborers have so far 
excavated just about 50 square yards. But already 300 warriors have been found, 
prompting speculation in the Chinese media that the entire site -- more than 25 
acres -- could contain between 40,000 and 100,000 figures, far surpassing the 
8,000-strong terra-cotta army. 
</P>
<P>
No foreigners have been allowed to visit the site -- about 12 miles from Xian. 
But in an interview with foreign journalists, Wang said the site was protected 
at night by local police. With 72 imperial tombs in Shaanxi province and none 
of them excavated -- only the adjoining areas -- Wang said tomb robbing had 
been a problem throughout history and continued today. Wang also made a plea 
for foreign money and experts to help China pursue more active archeology, 
rather than rely on farmers or road workers to discover sites accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
If foreigners want to contribute, they will be welcome, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But they are not welcome to the central authorities in Beijing. Any foreign 
archeologist wanting to work in China must get approval from the most senior 
level of government, the State Council. An official refused to say how many 
applications had been received but said not one had been approved. 
</P>
<P>
Wang said he did not know when the public will be able to see the latest 
discovery. But if the current pace of excavation is any guide, it will be many 
years before the little warriors are displayed.

CRUISE SHIPS CLEAN UP GARBAGE PRACTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WARREN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cruise ship recently embarked on its maiden voyage with state-of-the-art 
garbage facilities and a promise by passengers to be friendly to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of an effort to set a new standard for an industry dependent on 
pristine waters. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone spotted tossing as much as a cigarette butt into the waters of the South 
Pacific from the Frontier Spirit will be fined $50, said Lars Wikander, 
president of Salen-Lindblad Cruising. 
</P>
<P>
"Even biodegradable matter, such as food, will not be put overboard when we're 
in ecologically delicate regions. We don't want to disturb the feeding and 
breeding patterns of animal species in these areas," Wikander said from his 
headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The $50-million, 164-passenger Frontier Spirit will freeze its food and plastic 
waste, grind its glass to sand and burn the rest in specially filtered 
incinerators, said Wikander, who contends that the ship establishes a new 
non-polluting standard for the cruise industry. 
</P>
<P>
Salen-Lindblad can afford to install this technology -- its passengers tend to 
be well-off environmentalists who are willing to pay a little more and follow 
strict rules in order to see exotic locales. 
</P>
<P>
But even mainstream cruise lines pitching more affordable trips to middle-class 
tourists on the well-traveled Caribbean circuit are trying to make the most of 
the ecotourism trend. 
</P>
<P>
"People who pay for cruises are escaping to the beautiful beaches and 
crystal-clear, deep blue waters you advertise in your brochures. Dumping trash 
at sea, even though it's within the law, doesn't fit this image," Coast Guard 
Cmdr. Darryle Waldron told an international conference of cruise line officials 
in Miami recently. 
</P>
<P>
International regulations forbid the dumping of plastics anywhere in the ocean, 
but glass, paper, metal and other garbage can legally be tossed overboard 25 
nautical miles from shore. Violators face up to $25,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has investigated 57 allegations of illegal dumping since the 
regulations took effect in May, 1989, and many of the charges are brought by 
cruise ship passengers, Waldron said. 
</P>
<P>
Once, 50 passengers signed a letter saying they saw the crew of their cruise 
ship dump bag after plastic bag of garbage over the side. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for ship captains to deny that sort of a complaint," said 
Waldron, who wouldn't identify the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Cargo vessels and weekend pleasure-boaters are responsible for most of the 
ocean debris, Waldron said, but the cruise ships' image still suffered when a 
group of volunteers found more than 65 plastic cups and shampoo bottles bearing 
their insignias in a Sept. 22 cleanup of Florida beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 100 items out of the more than 399,666 pounds of garbage collected 
in the Center for Marine Conservation cleanup doesn't seem like much, but the 
center's Gina Ruiz says cruise ship trash remains troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
"What washes up is only a very small sampling of what's actually out there. 
It's a significant amount of garbage," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines doesn't plan to fine anybody for throwing 
trash overboard, but its passengers are encouraged to separate plastics from 
glass, cans and paper in garbage cans on the deck. 
</P>
<P>
And on Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines' newer ships, huge sewage treatment systems 
and incinerators that burn at 900 degrees Fahrenheit take all the pollutants 
out of the waste released into the air and sea, said spokesman Lloyd Axelrod.

NEW MADRID QUAKE PREDICTION MAKES SOME SHAKE WHILE OTHERS WANT TO PARTY 
</P>

NEW MADRID, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While some people are stockpiling bottled water in preparation for a possible 
earthquake in the New Madrid Fault zone, Jack Hailey is amassing beer. 
</P>
<P>
Hailey, the owner of Hap's Bar and Grill, is planning an all-day Shake, Rattle 
and Roll Party on Dec. 3 -- the date of a projected earthquake along the fault. 
</P>
<P>
The party will feature a bottomless pot of gumbo for his regulars and all the 
media representatives expected to be in town. A St. Louis rock 'n' roll radio 
station will broadcast live from the tavern. 
</P>
<P>
However, many people are taking the projection more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Schools throughout southeast Missouri's Bootheel region already have canceled 
classes for the day. Stores have found it difficult to keep in stock items such 
as bottled water, can openers and other emergency supplies. And travel agents 
have been busy helping people make plans to be out of town that week. 
</P>
<P>
All the commotion stems from the work of Iben Browning, a climatologist and 
business consultant from Sandia Park, N.M. Browning says tidal forces coming to 
a head on or about Dec. 3 will create a 50-50 chance for an earthquake 
measuring 7.0 or greater. 
</P>
<P>
The New Madrid Fault zone runs roughly from Marked Tree, Ark., through the 
Missouri Bootheel and into Southern Illinois. Experts say the fault zone 
produces about 200 quakes a year, most hardly felt. 
</P>
<P>
At Travel with Flair in Sikeston, about 20 miles north of here, a sign outside 
advertises a special rate for a trip to Cancun, Mexico, with the motto: "Get 
Out of Town Quake Sale." 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of calls about getting out of town in that time frame," manager 
Joe Miller said. "The hysteria down here is unbelievable. One guy today bought 
a one-way ticket to Phoenix. He said he'd buy (a ticket back) when the 
earthquake's over." 
</P>
<P>
Some people apparently are planning to sit out the quake in Springfield, on the 
western side of the state. 
</P>
<P>
That city's Convention and Tourists Bureau ran a one-day ad in several Bootheel 
newspapers promoting 10% to 50% discounts on hotel rooms for the week of Dec. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
The "Take a Break from the Quake" ad generated more than 400 responses, Tracy 
Kimberlin, the bureau's executive director, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Springfield sits on a great deal of bedrock,' Kimberlin said. "All the 
information we have read says that Springfield would feel it but would have 
little if any damage. On the other hand, Memphis and St. Louis could be a 
different story." 
</P>
<P>
The ad happened to run on Sept. 26, the day the Bootheel and surrounding states 
were jolted by a moderate earthquake that caused no structural damage or 
injuries but rattled already frazzled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
That quake, measuring 4.6, was centered near New Hamburg, about 20 miles north 
of Sikeston. It was followed by a 3.0 aftershock that evening and a 2.6 
aftershock on Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Westrich, owner of Schindler's Tavern, learned then about the interest the 
news media has in the quake projection. His place was besieged by reporters and 
photographers looking for good quotes and pictures. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he will be ready with free barbecue and 75-cent "I Survived the New 
Hamburg Earthquake -- Save Your Water, Drink at Schindler's Tavern" bumper 
stickers. The price of beer may go up, however. 
</P>
<P>
Just to the northeast, in Cape Girardeau, students at Southeast Missouri State 
will be starting their last week of classes before final exams. At least, 
that's what the calendar says they'll be doing. Kim Reeves thinks differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a feeling half of the students will fly the coop," said Reeves, 
managing editor of the student paper, The Capaha Arrow. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri's Gov. John Ashcroft doesn't plan to shy away from the region, though. 
In fact, Ashcroft recently planned a trip to the Bootheel on Dec. 3 and 4 to 
visit several agricultural enterprises and to help alleviate people's fears. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to southeast Missouri because Dec. 3 and Dec. 4 are like any other 
days," said the governor's spokesman, Bob Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
Ashcroft's office already had rejected a request from Bootheel county clerks to 
reschedule a special Senate election set for Dec. 4. The clerks expressed 
concern that voter turnout would be cut because of people leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Bell, school superintendent in Caruthersville, said: "It's easy, I 
guess, to say, if you don't live here, that it's silly to worry about quakes 
and all. 
</P>
<P>
"But we live with it, and it's hard not to get caught up in the spirit of the 
concern," he said. "The concern is coming from well-meaning, truly concerned 
parents and staff members. . . . They're frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every school from Cape Girardeau south to the Arkansas line has 
scheduled at least two days off. Many school officials said it was ludicrous to 
hold school with most parents planning to keep their children at home. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri education officials say there has never been so many school closings 
in advance of an event. They say as many as 40,000 students will be out of 
school on Dec. 3 and 4. Similar school closings have been reported in Arkansas, 
Kentucky, Tennessee and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Carlson would like to have the day off. She is the director of the New 
Madrid Historical Museum, where T-shirts -- "Visit New Madrid While It's Still 
Here" and "It's Our Fault" -- go for $10. She knows the 1886 building probably 
wouldn't be safe in a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been record numbers of visitors since the earthquake hype 
started, and the media requests have been overwhelming. The museum will be 
broadcast headquarters for CNN and a St. Louis radio station on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm going to kind of stand with one foot out the door," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agrees on one thing: It's about time people in the New Madrid Fault 
zone prepared for a major earthquake, because one could occur any day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's had some definite pluses," Carlson said. First, the preparedness 
awareness. And second, "now everybody knows how to pronounce our name." 
</P>
<P>
It's New MAD-drid.

A company has produced four videos to help aging Americans and those who care 
for them sort through the bewildering choices about insurance and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanette Vaughan studied health care in college but couldn't think of a way to 
market her research. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing "L.A. Law" character Arnold Becker peddle a video of himself 
giving advice on divorce, Vaughn plunged in. 
</P>
<P>
She made the video series "All About Aging" and created AgeView Inc., which 
distributes the tapes. The series sells for $195 and is marketed to hospitals, 
nursing homes and health care agencies. While the public can buy the series, 
Vaughan hopes agencies will buy it to show consumers for free. 
</P>
<P>
By 2030, 21% of Americans will be over 65. But Vaughan said most of the country 
hasn't considered the idea of an older America. 
</P>
<P>
"The first ones feeling the impact are the women over 40 who are working and 
also trying to take care of aging parents," said Vaughan, 28 
</P>
<P>
Among the topics on the tapes are how to obtain Medicare, Medicaid, private 
insurance and home health care; the psychosocial views of aging and how to 
relate to older relatives; and details on nutrition, safety and equipment use 
for elderly patients cared for at home. 
</P>
<P>
Delores Moyer, executive director of Alverno Health Care Corp., based in 
Memphis, Tenn., is one of the agencies in 275 U.S. cities that use the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to start broadcasting the tapes across our closed-circuit TV network 
in the hospitals so patients and families can view the tapes while they are in 
the waiting room," said Moyer, whose company operates nine hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan said she plans to develop additional tapes. "It's not the answer to 
everything, but it points people in the right direction," she said.

VOLCANIC ACTIVITY SLOWLY BUILDING A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE IN THE PACIFIC; 
</P>
<P>
GEOLOGY: A NINTH HAWAIIAN ISLAND IS LIKELY TO RISE FROM THE SEA. BUT DEVELOPERS 
WILL HAVE TO WAIT THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

VOLCANO, Hawaii 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mysterious geologic forces behind the current eruptions of Mt. Kilauea are 
quietly creating the newest piece of America. 
</P>
<P>
Climbing with agonizing slowness from the warm tropical waters just southeast 
of the Big Island of Hawaii is an undersea mountain named Loihi. Volcanologists 
believe Loihi eventually could emerge as the ninth Hawaiian island. 
</P>
<P>
"Loihi has grown about 10,100 feet from the Pacific floor," Thomas L. Wright, 
scientist-in-charge of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said. "It seems to be 
tapping the same source of magma (lava still underground) as Kilauea. Loihi 
needs about 3,100 more feet to break the surface." 
</P>
<P>
The observatory, on the rim of Kilauea's summit caldera, or lava lake, is 
operated by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Volcanoes have been creating and modifying the environment over eons of 
geologic time. More than 80% of Earth's surface is of volcanic origin. Volcanic 
eruptions have formed fertile soils and sculpted mountains, plateaus and other 
majestic landscapes. Gaseous emissions from volcanic vents helped to form the 
early atmosphere and oceans where scientists believe life first emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The volcanic machine powering Kilauea and building Loihi may represent the most 
visible and most persistent example of this little-known facet of volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
Kilauea has been in the news time and again since it resumed erupting on Jan. 
3, 1983. Lava oozing at the rate of 635,000 cubic feet each day has traveled 20 
miles east to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Lava flowing from the eruption, 50 feet thick in some places, already has 
torched 140 houses and caused more than $60 million in damage. Last May 5, a 
2,000-foot-wide flow cut off an entire village on the island's southeast coast, 
and Gov. John D. Waihee declared the town a disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
These highly publicized lava flows, and those silently lifting Loihi toward the 
surface, result from the peculiar form of volcanic activity occurring in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 500 active surface volcanoes on Earth straddle the margins of 
continents and the huge plates of rock that fit together like pieces of a 
jigsaw puzzle to make up the planet's surface. 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen of these plates, each of which is about 50 miles thick. 
The plates move relative to each other a few inches a year. Active volcanoes 
tend to occur in zones of under-thrusting, or "subduction," where one plate is 
slipping beneath another. 
</P>
<P>
How can volcanic activity occur in the Hawaiian Islands, which are more than 
2,000 miles from the nearest plate margin? 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian volcanoes are believed to result from a different phenomenon termed 
"hot spot" volcanism. Geologists theorize that deep under the Pacific plate is 
an exquisitely hot, stationary region termed the "Hawaiian hot spot." 
</P>
<P>
Like a propane torch placed under a moving sheet of plastic, the hot spot melts 
rock in the overriding Pacific plate. The molten rock, or magma, is less dense 
than surrounding solid rock and rises through fractures to spill onto the 
surface or ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
Over about 70 million years, the continuous movement of the Pacific plate over 
this stationary "fountain of fire" left a trail of more than 80 big volcanoes 
over the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Called the Hawaiian Ridge-Emperor Seamount 
Chain, the islands and undersea mountains, or seamounts, stretch northwestward 
about 4,000 miles, from the Big Island of Hawaii to the Kamchatka Peninsula in 
Soviet territory. 
</P>
<P>
The five main Hawaiian islands are the tops of volcanic mountains that were 
formed as the Pacific plate moved over the Hawaiian hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
A scientific record of the plate's movement to the northwest is evident in the 
age of solidified lava left on each of the islands. The age decreases from 
northwest to southeast. Kauai, in the extreme northwest, is 5.6 million years 
old; Oahu is 3.4 million; Molokai is 1.8 million, Maui is 800,000, Hawaii is 
under 700,000 years old. Lava ages even decrease in the same 
northwest-to-southeast fashion on each individual island. 
</P>
<P>
Continued movement of the Pacific plate promises to give the goddess Pele a new 
home and Hawaii a new island. 
</P>
<P>
If theories about hot spot volcanism are correct, plate movement eventually 
will carry the Big Island off the Hawaiian hot spot. The two active volcanoes 
on the island, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, will become extinct. The hot spot then 
will pour molten rock onto the surface through the next volcano in the Hawaiian 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
Experts do not know exactly when Loihi will emerge as a new island. Assuming 
Loihi's growth continues at current rates, it could take from a few thousand to 
a few tens of thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
But other fates also may await the infant volcano. 
</P>
<P>
Infusions of molten rock from the hot spot, for instance, may cease 
unexpectedly. Loihi's growth would be stunted, leaving it just another seamount 
in the chain. The ninth Hawaiian island thus may form in an entirely different 
place. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the possibility a sudden major undersea eruption could raise 
Loihi to the surface sooner than anyone expects.

<P>
The idea of enlisting our youth into local and national assistance projects is 
not new. It wasn't new when I wrote an essay on the subject to Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) nearly 15 years ago. Cranston forwarded my recommendations 
to a few of the appropriate federal agencies and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
Make this proposal to almost anyone, and they will listen and nod their 
approval but do nothing about it. The Kennedy charisma brought us closest to 
the ideal with the Peace Corps. William F. Buckley's version is certainly worth 
considering and maybe it's an idea whose time has come. 
</P>
<P>
(But) Buckley simply doesn't go far enough. I definitely concur with a system 
of offering high school graduates a two-year stint in either the military or 
civilian sector of service to the country. Social services, environmental 
agencies, medical clinics, parks and forests, and any number of local and 
federal projects would be well served by such a source of workers. 
</P>
<P>
(I propose that) for their service, the young population receive higher 
education gratis. Those who did not volunteer for service would have to pay the 
going rate for college. Those who served the two years and wanted to go on for 
higher and specialized degrees would be given the option to pay or receive 
their education free if they agreed to serve an additional two years following 
the receipt of their degrees. In that additional term of service, they would 
complete their internship in areas of the country woefully lacking in social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
In that sort of scheme, the nation is a winner. We have a work force that 
enters into national service at a time when they are just formulating their 
career choices. They are given the opportunity to try their wings and to work 
in cooperation with their peers on worthy projects. They are exposed to the 
realities of their society. Pretty good preparation for life. 
</P>
<P>
How much is this going to cost? Far less than our ignorant abuse of national 
resources has to this point. We will improve the current state of affairs 
quickly and be investing in a much brighter future. The opportunity for 
individual youngsters to realize their hopes could put a dent into the gang 
culture we spawned through terrible neglect.

As a 19-year-old, maybe I have luckily escaped the scheme of William F. Buckley 
Jr. (a.k.a. Dr. Pangloss) to force 18-year-olds into some sort of an 
indoctrination program a la the Chinese Communists so they can learn the error 
of their ways and dutifully worship their country. 
</P>
<P>
Having grown up with The Great Communicator, I find I now must cope with The 
Great Hallucinator. 
</P>
<P>
You state: "William F. Buckley Jr. . . . is best known for sparking an 
intellectual movement that eventually swept Ronald Reagan into the White House. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Any teen-ager who can read should know that with Reagan came deregulation and 
with that (came) Michael Milken and lesser lights, and $500 billion kind of 
disappeared from the savings and loan associations. I disagree that this 
generation has not been called upon to make sacrifices. We'll have to cough up 
that $500 billion for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
If any generation needs reorientation in its sense of values, it would seem to 
me to be Buckley's. 
</P>
<P>
Why doesn't he organize a senior citizens' corps (with appropriate sanctions, 
of course, for noncompliance). If grabbing a shovel and attempting to 
ameliorate the damage his generation is doing to our environment is not to his 
taste or physical condition, maybe he can use his vast mental powers and 
vocabulary to sway the Charles Hurwitzes of this country not to saw the 
nation's redwoods and the Neil Bushes not to give away other people's money.

"Mahvelous" it is for Bill Buckley Jr. in his pre-senile years to have 
conceived of a national service program with Draconian sanctions for those 
refusing to volunteer when reaching their 18th birthdays ("King of the Right," 
Nov. 11). 
</P>
<P>
Shall we continue to suffer having the old tell the young how to lead their 
lives? Are there too few wars left for old men to send youth to die in? Shall 
our country continue to be impoverished by not including in the service program 
those over 18 who have gained skills in college and beyond? 
</P>
<P>
Shall those like Bill Buckley, who have been denied the benefits of a national 
service program, now be provided the opportunity to do so with Draconian 
sanctions should they refuse to serve?

Whereas I am in favor of all people volunteering their time to show 
appreciation for our societal privileges, I don't think it should be government 
mandated at the expense of drivers' licenses and student loans. I believe this 
because the people in power for the most part are greedy and self-absorbed, 
unwilling to volunteer their own time, so why should we? 
</P>
<P>
Also, today's society dictates that young people work harder to accommodate the 
same middle-class lifestyle that our parents had, thus allowing less time to 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
While I do my part (I'm a teacher, attend school and still volunteer many 
hours), I will not condemn my peers for their selfishness. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, rallying behind the imparted wisdom of someone who grew up wealthy -- 
never having struggled, nor understood nor appreciated the opinions or tastes 
of the middle class -- is another crusade we can do without.

SCREEN STYLE: WRAPPING A RAPPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE SHOW: "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"(NBC, Mondays, 8 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
THE SETUP: Will Smith plays "the Fresh Prince" (also his real-life rap 
moniker), a kid from a tough Philly neighborhood whose parents send him to live 
with his well-to-do uncle Philip Banks (James Avery) and his family in Bel-Air. 
The frequent clashes between the young rapper and the upper-crust set provide 
sparks. 
</P>
<P>
And also some smooth dance steps. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Smith (pictured) frequently wears bright, extra-large shirts, 
extra-large baggy pants in neon colors. His look is fresh, young and 
unrestricted, especially compared to Carlton, his totally preppy cousin. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking our cue from Will Smith/Fresh Prince. He is the character, so his 
wardrobe for the show is pretty much what he'd wear himself," said the show's 
costume designer, Judy Richman. 
</P>
<P>
THE LABELS: The Westside Pavilion's young contemporary shops provide Richman 
with a lot of that fresh stuff. At DJ's, she gets men's sportswear, silk 
jackets with matching pants in a variety of colors and dressy unstructured 
blazers. At GHQ, Richman finds bright shirts and jeans. The shoes that allow 
the Prince to hip-hop are Nike Air Jordans (the kind you fill with air) and 
Reeboks. 
</P>
<P>
The yuppie relatives dress to blend into the Bel-Air landscape. Clothes come 
from Neiman Marcus, Maxfield boutique on Melrose, Modasport and Carroll &amp; 
Co. in Beverly Hills. SUE MARTIN

IN THE SEASON FOR GIVING, SOME LESSONS ON GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You do it. I do it. Everybody does it. 
</P>
<P>
According to anthropologist Terry Y. Le Vine, the practice of giving and 
receiving gifts is so universal "it is part of what it means to be human." 
</P>
<P>
As a visiting curator at UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History, Le Vine is 
organizing an exhibit of the roles gifts play in five cultures, including our 
own. "It's something everyone can relate to," explains Le Vine, who has been 
exchanging gifts all her life and scrutinizing the practice professionally for 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Many gifts are quite beautiful (they do reflect the taste of the giver, after 
all), which makes them an obvious choice for display. But gifts are much more 
than art objects, according to Le Vine. In virtually every culture, gifts and 
the events at which they are exchanged are a crucial part of the essential 
process of creating and maintaining social relationships, she says. Presents 
help glue societies together. And even in societies such as ours that maintain 
that giving is better than receiving, gifts are frequently given with the 
understanding that the recipient will reciprocate in time. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit Le Vine is organizing will open in 1993 at the Fowler Museum, then 
travel to four other cities. It will feature gifts favored by five societies: 
the !Kung of Southwest Africa, the Kwakiutl Indians of the Pacific Northwest, 
the Trobriand Islanders of the South Pacific, the people of modern Japan, and 
contemporary North America. Le Vine is also coordinating the writing of a book 
on gift-giving that will bring together the work of experts in anthropology, 
sociology and law. 
</P>
<P>
Le Vine hopes that visitors to the exhibit will share the experience she had 
the first time she looked at UCLA's extensive collection of !Kung artifacts and 
realized, "Hey, all these things on all these storage shelves represent 
people." Although the objects given and received vary from culture to culture, 
gifts are almost always important social tools, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Among the !Kung, for instance, newborns are given a gift that "introduces the 
baby to the idea of giving and receiving." As Le Vine explains, the newborn is 
given necklaces by his or her grandparents. At 6 months or so, the necklaces 
are taken from the child, taken apart and incorporated into new necklaces that 
are then given to people with whom the mother thinks the child should have a 
gift-exchanging relationship. This process of exchanging necklaces and other 
gifts continues throughout the child's lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The gifts exchanged by the !Kung may be evidence of the generosity of the 
giver, the prestige of the recipient or affection between the two, but they 
represent something even more basic as well. As Le Vine points out, the !Kung 
are people whose very lives depend on the uncertain bounty of the Kalahari 
Desert. Relationships with fellow tribesmen in other areas, relationships 
cemented with gifts, are a kind of insurance against the day when your own 
garden fails to bloom and your survival hinges on the hospitality of others. 
Not surprisingly, the first gift was probably food, says Le Vine, citing the 
classic study of gift-giving, Marcel Mauss' "The Gift." 
</P>
<P>
One of the issues that Le Vine and her consultants have been grappling with is 
the difference between a gift and a bribe. The definition is culturally 
relative. "In many cultures, what we would call a bribe is just a way of doing 
business," she says. The Japanese, for instance, often give gifts in 
circumstances Americans would consider inappropriate. It is common practice in 
Japan, for example, to give your surgeon a gift before you go under the knife. 
Among the artifacts Le Vine hopes to include in the exhibit are examples of the 
gorgeous envelopes, in different colors for different occasions, in which the 
Japanese give gifts of money. 
</P>
<P>
Cultures also vary in what they regard as the ultimate gift. "Often it is 
something hard to get," Le Vine says. The relative scarcity of diamonds may 
explain why Americans value them for such important occasions as betrothals and 
anniversaries. Among the Kwakiutl, or Kwakwaka'waka, as members of the 
Northwest tribe prefer to be called, copper was the premier gift after contact 
with Western culture (grease continued to be an important gift as well). 
</P>
<P>
In the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea, the Rolls-Royce of presents is a 
green stone called beku. In Trobriand society, Le Vine explains, a young man 
gives gifts to an older, more powerful man in the hopes of winning his support. 
Such patronage will eventually mean the young man can use land held by the clan 
to raise yams, another important gift among the Trobriand Islanders. This 
process, which proceeds according to a prescribed timetable, typically begins 
with the giving of such relatively modest gifts as fish and culminates in the 
giving of a beku ax blade. "That usually gets to them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The gift that travels" is another worldwide phenomenon, according to Le Vine. 
One example common in mainstream American culture is the gift that is handed 
down from one generation to the next. A family quilt or a string of pearls that 
passes from mother to daughter functions as an "identity marker," she says. 
"They carry messages of identification with those who have gone before. They 
tell us who we are." 
</P>
<P>
One of the experts involved in the project is Gloria Cranmer Webster, a 
Kwakwaka'waka from British Columbia. She is providing an insider's perspective 
on one of the world's most famous gift-giving rituals, the potlatch. A festive 
occasion at which enormous numbers of gifts are given and sometimes destroyed, 
potlatch has entered the English language as a synonym for excess. But, as Le 
Vine notes, potlatches were, and are, ceremonies that reinforce the social 
hierarchy that is so important to the Northwestern Indian nation. As gifts so 
often do, the number and quality of potlatch goods carry information about the 
underlying status of the giver and the recipient, Le Vine says. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't think of us in the past," Webster told Le Vine. "We're still here. We're 
still doing potlatching. We've been doing it all along." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the gifts presented at potlatches are non-material, such as the right 
to use certain family crests or sing a family song or dramatize family myths 
(symbols of such gifts are often included in "privilege boxes," passed between 
father-in-law and son-in-law in potlatches occasioned by marriages). But 
material things have always been a vital part of the tradition. When Le Vine 
made a recent visit to British Columbia, Webster showed her the upstairs room 
in which the Indian woman was collecting boxes of linens, glassware, dishes and 
other gifts for an upcoming potlatch. 
</P>
<P>
Potlatching was outlawed by the Canadian government in 1884 and not legalized 
until 1951. During that time, it went underground, Webster told Le Vine. 
Webster's father, Daniel, a chief of the Nimpkish tribe, was arrested for 
potlatching in 1921, and the goods he had collected to give, including masks 
and other ceremonial objects, were confiscated. The Canadian government has 
been returning such objects to the Indians if they can show that they will 
provide safe, museum-like places for their preservation. 
</P>
<P>
The giving of gifts proved too close to the heart of being Kwakwaka'waka to 
give up, no matter what the civil law. As a result, one winter during the bad 
old days of the ban, Webster's father and fellow tribesmen "pretended they were 
celebrating Christmas when they were really holding a potlatch."

<P>
Mamoru Eto is 107. He lives at the Minami Keiro Nursing Home, near Lincoln Park 
northeast of downtown Los Angeles, where the residents eat Japanese meals, are 
entertained with Japanese songs and are cared for by a mostly Japanese staff. 
</P>
<P>
Like Eto, many of the other residents were interned during the war and have 
received their apologies and reparations checks. But Eto has the distinction of 
being the first among them -- in fact, the first in the country -- to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
Born into a samurai family, Eto won medals in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 
and taught physical education at a missionary school before heading to America 
in 1919, intending to study at a school in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Eto planned to go back to Japan after a few years and become a professor. But 
when he arrived in San Francisco, he was moved by seeing impoverished railroad 
laborers who had come to the United States planning to make money and return to 
their homelands, but who ended up gambling their earnings away every night. 
</P>
<P>
Then and there, he recalled, he decided to be a minister. 
</P>
<P>
He worked on a farm, preached on the side, and sent for his wife, Kura, and his 
3-year-old daughter, Hitoko, who now goes by the name of Helen. The Etos 
eventually had 10 children and settled in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Kura took care of the children while Eto supported the family through gardening 
jobs. On weekends, he delivered sermons at the First Japanese Nazarene Church, 
which he established "in our living room," said Helen, 75, who served as 
interpreter for the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Kura Eto returned to Japan in 1936 because of illness and died there during 
World War II. At the start of the war, Helen and two other adult Eto children 
decided to leave the West Coast on their own, which the government briefly 
allowed as an alternative to internment. 
</P>
<P>
Mamoru Eto and the other seven children were sent to the Tulare Assembly Center 
in Central California in the spring of 1942. There they lived in stables while 
more permanent camps were being built. After about five months, they were put 
on a train to the camp at Gila River, Ariz., where they would spend another two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Eto set out to make the best of the inhospitable conditions. The camp grounds 
were barren, so he dug up saplings from a nearby riverbank and replanted them 
near the barracks. To escape the heat, he dug a den in the crawl space under 
their quarters, put a desk and chair there, and used it as a study. 
</P>
<P>
And, naturally, he started church services and a Sunday school at the 
13,340-person camp, and wrote shigin poetry with religious themes. 
</P>
<P>
Helen, who had settled in Salt Lake City, visited a few times. "It was 
horrible," she said. "It was so hot." 
</P>
<P>
Eto's son David, then 10, went to school, played baseball, basketball and other 
sports and invented games with his friends. "We rolled rocks down the hill, big 
boulders," he recalled in a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The boy found his father no longer the commanding disciplinarian he used to be, 
now that the War Relocation Authority was setting all the rules and schedules. 
"(The children) were pretty much on our own," David said. But he added: "It was 
a pretty constrained environment. There (was) not a lot of trouble you (could) 
get into, as a 10-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
A year after they were evacuated, the internees were asked to take a loyalty 
oath: Would they pledge allegiance to the United States and forswear any 
allegiance to the emperor of Japan? 
</P>
<P>
Even though he was a proud and decorated veteran of Japan's war with Russia, 
and even though he was ineligible for U.S. citizenship under the 1924 Exclusion 
Act, Eto accepted the oath. 
</P>
<P>
Answering no was inconceivable, he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to America," he said. "We're not Japanese anymore; we're American. Of 
course, I think about Japan, but when it comes to inochi (life) or defending 
(one's country), that's where I'd put my efforts -- with America. . . . There's 
no other way." 
</P>
<P>
"I never doubted" the U.S. government, Eto said. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1944, having taken the oath and being too old for military service -- 
he was 61 -- Eto was allowed to leave camp for Seabrook Farms in New Jersey, a 
frozen-food processing plant that needed workers. He took his two sons with 
him, while his daughters went to live with Helen in Salt Lake City. Eto ended 
up tending the gardens on magnate Charles Seabrook's estate. He set up a 
Japanese church in New Jersey, obtained his U.S. citizenship, and returned to 
California nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Eto said the idea of seeking redress never entered his mind, but when he first 
learned of the campaign to obtain it, he said: "I probably thought if they were 
giving us money, that was nice." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Eto enjoys the attention he has received lately. With a grin, he 
displayed a clipping from the Nichi Bei Times, a Japanese-language newspaper 
published in San Francisco: "The First is 107, Mr. Eto." (Although Eto was the 
first recipient, he is not the oldest. A Phoenix woman who is 108 was unable to 
make the trip to Washington.) 
</P>
<P>
In the Justice Department's Great Hall, he delivered the invocation in 
Japanese. Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh presented the apology and redress 
check, kneeling first to Eto in his wheelchair, then he gave checks to the 
other eight elderly internees. 
</P>
<P>
"By finally admitting a wrong, a nation does not destroy its integrity, but, 
rather, reinforces the sincerity of its commitment to the Constitution and 
hence to its people," the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can never fully right the wrongs of the past," President Bush wrote to the 
internees. "But we can . . . recognize that serious injustices were done to 
Japanese-Americans during World War II." 
</P>
<P>
Admitting a wrong doesn't come easily for Eto, so he figures that it must have 
been agonizing for the government. As Helen says: "I've never heard him 
apologize to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Eto had never talked much about the camp with the family, not even 
with Helen, a Santa Monica resident who visits him at the nursing home at least 
once a week. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasizes that there were some good things about camp life -- leisure time, 
for one. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I had to work to feed and shelter the family -- and now the government 
took over that job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What was worst, he said in a defiant voice, was being herded there at all. 
</P>
<P>
He pounded the table with his hand. "Japanese are not the type of people you 
have to put (behind a fence). . . . It was absolutely uncalled for to be put in 
camp, inside the wire fence and with a soldier with a gun in a tower."

LONG EFFORT ENDS IN COUNCIL SEAT FOR VAZQUEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Vazquez will become the first Latino member of the Santa Monica City 
Council when he is sworn in on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez's election on Nov. 6 was the culmination of 15 years of efforts on his 
part to provide a voice in government for the Latino community, beginning with 
his work as a student volunteer in the mid-1970s for Fred Beteta's successful 
campaign for a seat on Santa Monica's joint school and community college board 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we have been working for since the mid-'70s," Vazquez said. 
"Maybe now the city can be a little bit more sensitive to the needs of the 
Latino and black communities." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Vazquez at Tuesday's swearing-in will be Robert T. Holbrook and Kelly 
Olsen, who were also elected to four-year terms on the seven-member City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez, with the aid of a new generation of Latino student volunteers from 
Santa Monica College, was the top vote-getter among nine candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign observers said that what set the tone for Vazquez was a four-page 
brochure that was mailed early in the campaign that identified him as a family 
man with ties to the community and a commitment to the future of the city. 
</P>
<P>
He was endorsed by the politically powerful tenants group, Santa Monicans for 
Renters' Rights -- an endorsement he acknowledges he could not have won without 
-- yet as a homeowner he was not viewed as a rent control radical. 
</P>
<P>
"He had all the political credentials of being a real candidate," said Steve 
Alpert, a political consultant who analyzed the election. "He probably had more 
volunteers than any other candidate and brought in a new constituency and was 
able to raise a great deal of money from people who were interested in seeing a 
Latino get elected." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, campaign records show Vazquez was able to raise a significant amount of 
his money from Latinos in the Westside, a group that previously had not been 
active in local elections. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez's brother, Nati, who was deeply involved in the campaign, said the 
victory was particularly significant in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
"People felt the system just didn't care," he said. "But Tony gives them a 
sense of pride, a sense that there is change in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Sigala, a student at Santa Monica College and vice president of the 
Chicano student group MEChA, said he got involved in the campaign because he 
thought it would be historic. 
</P>
<P>
"This proves that by being involved in the community we can bring about 
positive change. Eventually, I hope to be in Tony's shoes. I want to be in 
elected office." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane, who endorsed Vazquez, said the 34-year-old 
community planner with United Way will help bring Santa Monica together. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony brings to the council a unifying vision to resolve differences," said 
Zane. "In his philosophy and in his disposition, he is a healer." 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez did not always see himself in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Tijuana, Mexico, in 1956, he crossed the border to San Diego at the age 
of 2 with his family. After a brief stay in San Diego, the family moved to an 
apartment on Pontius Avenue in West Los Angeles, where they lived for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The family bought a home in Mar Vista in 1963. Vazquez first attended Mark 
Twain Junior High School but was soon transferred because "I was in rumbles all 
the time." He finished at Webster Junior High School, then went to Venice High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez said he had no interest in school and had planned to attend Los Angeles 
Trade Tech to become a machinist. But the summer after high school he was 
involved in an accident that totaled his car, and he was left without 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was bummed all summer," Vazquez said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident turned out to a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring that he could take the bus and hang out on the campus all day, Vazquez 
signed up for classes at Santa Monica College. But he quickly became involved 
in MEChA and with student government. 
</P>
<P>
It was at that time, Vazquez said, that he realized politics could make a 
difference in bettering his community, and he took part in getting Beteta 
elected to the school board in 1975. But after participating in two 
unsuccessful attempts to elect Latinos to local offices in the 1980s, he 
realized that a Latino candidate would need the support of the tenants group -- 
which gained control of the city in 1979 after getting a tough rent control law 
passed -- to have a shot at winning. 
</P>
<P>
After Vazquez had received a degree in history from USC and taught elementary 
school in the Montebello School District for five years, he and his wife, 
Maria, returned to Santa Monica in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where our roots are," Vazquez said in explaining the move back to the 
Westside. "My wife and I said that if we were going to do what we said we were 
going to do in the '70s (getting a Latino voice in government), then we wanted 
to do it in the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez, who became a U.S. citizen in 1978, is reaching his goal, and others 
are taking notice of what he hopes to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony's election is a big step toward moving leaders in the Latino community 
into leaders in the city," Zane said. "We have Rita Morales on the Planning 
Commission and now Tony Vazquez on the City Council. And I believe there are 
more to come . . . and it's high time."

PEOPLE: EX-SCIENTIST CREATES A PICTURE-PERFECT CAREER AS AN ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After a distinguished career in the field of mathematics and science, Marvin 
Howard, 65, of Brentwood is living his childhood dream of becoming an artist. 
</P>
<P>
Although as a youth Howard had a passion for painting and drawing, in the early 
1950s his mathematical expertise led him to the field of computer science. He 
became a pioneer in the business applications of computer science, which 
included developing scientific programs for the government and the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy not painting because the involvement with these vast computer 
projects made me forget about my artistic endeavors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But on his lunch hour about 10 years ago, a watercolor art exhibit in a bank 
building inspired him once more. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he retired from the world of science and began to pursue a second 
career as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
He has won a number of awards in his short art career, including first place in 
the 1987 National Landscape Painting Competition. He also was one of 100 
finalists in the 1988 and 1989 Arts for the Parks competitions sponsored by the 
National Parks Academy of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Howard and his wife have traveled throughout Hawaii, New England and the 
Southwest taking photographs for his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
His realistic work is mainly in black and white, although "now I'm also using 
color to add another aspect to my work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of his works is being displayed through Nov. 30 in the gallery of 
the library at El Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Tung H. Lin of Pacific Palisades, a UCLA professor emeritus of civil 
engineering, has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering, one of 
the highest professional distinctions accorded an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the UCLA faculty since 1955, Lin was recognized for his pioneering 
development of micromechanical theories of plasticity, creep and fatigue crack 
initiation, as well as major contributions to inelastic structure analysis. 
</P>
<P>
A number of local high school students have been awarded the Rensselaer Medal 
by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
They are Jennifer Keen of Palisades High School, Daniel Lee of Harvard School, 
Ai-Lan Wang of Culver City High School, Julian Jami of Beverly Hills High 
School and Janet Yu of Santa Monica High. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, Rensselaer presents the award to high school juniors for outstanding 
achievements in mathematics and science. 
</P>
<P>
Irma Colen was selected as Outstanding Volunteer for the 1990 Los Angeles 
Celebration of National Philanthropy Day. 
</P>
<P>
Colen, a longtime supporter of the Venice Family Clinic, was honored at a 
breakfast Nov. 15 at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles.

AT HOME IN OTHER LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think the housing market in the United States is tough, with mortgage 
interest rates about 10%, consider Argentina, where the rates range from 20% to 
24%. 
</P>
<P>
If you cringe at spending 30% of your household income on your mortgage, look 
at Australia, where the salary slice is 44%. 
</P>
<P>
And while Southern Californians complain about the high price of putting a roof 
over their heads, the average home in Tokyo -- a four-room condo in less than 
1,000 square feet -- costs more than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We gripe a lot, but I'd guess that the dream of owning a home is much more a 
reality here than anywhere else in the world," said Ivan Faggen, worldwide 
director, Real Estate Services Group, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., an 
international accounting and consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, owning a home is out of reach elsewhere," said Faggen, who is 
based in Los Angeles. "Maybe that's why they call it the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
He chuckled, but it's no joke. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
"Most other countries don't allow deductions for mortgage interest," said Jim 
Tobin, director of international tax for Ernst &amp; Young, by telephone from 
his New York office. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. approach of subsidizing home ownership through a tax system is a 
unique philosophical point of view." The Netherlands is one of the few other 
countries that do this, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is the only place that hasa 30-year fixed rate for mortgages," Faggen 
said. "Lenders don't know what it will cost them to make these loans, so they 
take much more risk than, say, a lender in Canada that matches a five-year, 
fixed-rate home loan with the current interest rate offered by the bank on 
deposits." 
</P>
<P>
Even since the introduction of the adjustable-rate mortgage, 40% of the homes 
in the United States are sold at long-term fixed rates, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"In most countries overseas, home ownership, while important, doesn't carry the 
same overwhelming personal desire for it as it does here," Tobin said. "A much 
lower percentage of the population owns homes, and people tend to buy much 
later in life, especially in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all tax driven more than cultural, I think, because it not only takes 
more time to save up to buy there, but few people trade up, because there is a 
hefty transfer tax on the sale of a home. So the value of a home must go up 20% 
(from the time it is purchased until the time it is sold) for the seller to 
break even." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he added, "people overseas, especially in Europe, tend to have one 
home for a lifetime." This is true of renters as well as owners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities in other countries are populated mostly by renters. Faggen called 
Tokyo and Toronto "cities of apartments." 
</P>
<P>
"But rents don't necessarily run with the price of a house," Tobin said. "In 
other words, there isn't necessarily a good yield on the rent of a 
single-family house." 
</P>
<P>
One reason houses are cheaper in the United States is there is more land 
available for housing, he figures. In most European cities, more land is 
allocated for parks. "This is government driven," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
European cities are more densely populated as a result. "But when you're five 
minutes out of Brussels, for instance, you're in the countryside," he said. In 
contrast, most big cities in the United States have miles and miles of suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to go 10 minutes out of a city and be in the countryside, but if you 
did that in New York, each house there would cost $3 million," he remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Even when people overseas own their homes, the homes are often what Faggen 
described as "substandard compared to ours." That's probably why American 
architectural styles are frequently copied for new housing in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably the country that pays the most attention to (architectural) 
style," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, for example, it's real prestigious to have a Western-style home, and 
in France, the third largest home builder is Kaufman &amp; Broad, a company 
from right here in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Whether in France, Japan or most any other country abroad, people can will 
their homes, as they do in the United States, to their children, and title is 
taken the same way as it is here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But in England, there are more land leases, and the leasehold interests are 
handed down from one generation to another." 
</P>
<P>
Leaseholds are also common in Hawaii, but the durations aren't as long as in 
Great Britain. "In England, where they evolved from so much land owned by the 
crown and the church, the leaseholds can run 500 to 1,000 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a financial disadvantage in that, he noted: "I saw one 500-year lease 
at $8 a year. They thought that was a lot of money in the 17th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Americans buy British castles on leased land, but mostly, Faggen 
said, Americans are buying the land and the real estate in resort areas like 
the French Riviera or the Spanish Costa del Sol. 
</P>
<P>
"Second homes in resorts are a popular way for Americans to own overseas," he 
noted, "but there are also American colonies in Mexico and Costa Rica, where 
retirees or semi-retirees find the cost of living to be a fraction of what it 
is here." 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners cannot buy land within 62 miles of the Mexican border or 31 miles 
within any Mexican coastal area, but they can establish a trust in which they 
lease the land for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeownership Around the World 
</P>
<P>
 (Note: Costs are given in U.S. currency at exchange rates valid within the 
past few weeks, and sizes have been converted from square meters to square 
feet.) 
</P>
<P>
 (All costs are average, and sizes, financing and family sizes are typical for 
each country. Income is annual for middle-income families, or households, 
unless specified as being per capita.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Argentina 
</P>
<P>
Cost: $30,000 to $100,000, depending on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Size: 2-3 bedrooms, living and dining rooms, garage, 1,076-2,152 square feet, 
with age of house from 20-50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: Due to high inflation, the only mortgages available are at interest 
rates of 24% to 30% with repayment in two to five years. Because of the economy 
and inflation, home loans are pretty much a thing of the past, and few people 
are buying homes now. 
</P>
<P>
Income: $7,000-$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Family size: Husband, wife, two children and one grandparent. Fifty percent of 
the wives work. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: There are no restrictions on building, buying or 
renovating except what has been termed the current "disastrous economic 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
About 50% of the families own their homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Australia 
</P>
<P>
Cost: $200,000-$400,000 for a two-bedroom apartment on Sydney's North Shore 
(close to city center) and $300,000-$450,000 for a 2-3 bedroom, free-standing 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Size: Besides bedrooms, homes usually include living and dining rooms, garage, 
sometimes a family room, 1,500 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: About 60% are purchased with bank loans, 40% with building 
societies, which are similar to savings and loans. Length of term is typically 
25 years at an interest rate of 17% and a down payment of 10% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Income: $30,000 per person. About 44% of the household income goes toward 
mortgage repayment, so many households now have three incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Family size: Husband, wife, two children. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: First-home buyers in Sydney need an annual household 
income of $64,100 to purchase a median-priced home, according to the Housing 
Industry of Australia; however, another source in Australia indicates that a 
household income of $78,000 is necessary to service a $200,000 mortgage on a 
$250,000 home.

20 to 25 years at a current interest rate of 15.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Income: Gross yearly median income of homeowners with mortgages is $18,578. 
Homeowners with mortgages have the hghest median income of any group in Great 
Britain. The typical household is still supported by one income, but it is 
increasingly becoming supported by two. 
</P>
<P>
Family size: 1987 statistics showed an average of 2.55 members, with the number 
of households with only one person increasing from 17% in 1971 to 25% in 1987.

dependent children. The average number of children in households with children 
was 1.8 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: There is a waiting list for public rented housing and

<P>
</P>
<P>
Italy 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Varies according to city and location of the house, whether is it in a 
downtown, a residential neighborhood or in a historical center. As an example, 
a house that is 1,290 square feet can range in price, depending on location,

</P>
<P>
4. Special characteristics: Average period of ownership is more than 40 years.

Italians have owned their homes for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The average age of a home is 40 to 50 years. In Italy, types of houses are 
defined as being Recent (built after 1960), Old (built between 1900-1960) and 
Ancient (built before 1900). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japan 
</P>
<P>
Cost: The average metropolitan Tokyo condo -- with 3 bedrooms, kitchen, dining 
and living rooms -- sold in fall of 1989 for the equivalent of $439,453. 
</P>
<P>
Size: Most recent figures indicate that the average floor space per dwelling in 
Tokyo is about 968 square feet, with 4.87 rooms per dwelling. Note, however, 
that in Japan, rooms that are below ground level and common areas that are 
enclosed by walls in apartment buildings, such as stairwells, are included in 
size averages. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: The newest thing in Japan is the 100-year mortgage, so that the 
burden of paying for a home can be passed from generation to generation, making 
housing more affordable to families. Interest rates are 7 1/2% for 20- or 
30-year mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Income: $42,463, mostly from husband's wages but also from wife's, other 
household members', side businesses, jobs and bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Family size: 3.21 persons per household. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: About 61% of the Japanese families own their own home. 
A survey showed that a number of Japanese prefer independent homes to condos, 
"unrealistic as that might be." Given the alternatives, 53.7% chose a house 
requiring long hours of commuting, and 35.1% preferred an apartment or condo 
close to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, developers were willing to go as much as about 22 miles from 
downtown Tokyo to build condos, but with decreasing land available, the radius 
has spread lately beyond 35 miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexico 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Some two-income families can buy homes for about $30,000, with government 
assistance, and pay for it in five years; then prices jump to $75,000 and more 
for the upper middle-class, which represents a small portion of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans who live in Mexico City are only comfortable in the two or three 
expensive neighborhoods of town, ranging from $200,000 to $1 million. Rents 
there can be as high as $3,500. An average, one-bedroom condo would cost about 
$1,250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Size: Homes at $75,000 and above average 2,583 square feet, including 3 
bedrooms; living, dining and family rooms and a garage. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: Mostly bank loans, with 10- and 15-year mortgages; interest rate 15 
percentage points above prime rate; 20%-40% down payments. 
</P>
<P>
Income: Per capita income is about $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Family size: Husband, wife, three children. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: There are three classes: working, poor, and upper 
middle-class and above. 
</P>
<P>
Unless housing is inherited or government sponsored, most people can't afford 
to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Netherlands 
</P>
<P>
Cost: $99,500, on average; most houses vary from $47,100-$78,500. Monthly rents 
vary from $130-$728, excluding utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Size: Most houses have five rooms. A separate dining room is found only in 
older homes. About 10% of the houses or flats have a garage. Detached houses 
are usually about 2,500 square feet; two-room apartments are 1,000 square feet; 
four-room apartments, 1,556 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: Mortgages are usually made by general banks and mortgage banks for a 
term of 25 years with the interest rate, now at 9%, "renewed" every five years. 
Most of the management-level families will own their houses. Mortgage loans are 
usually 2.5 times income. 
</P>
<P>
Income: The median income of the population is $22,000. Middle-income, 
management-level families earn 2.5 to 3 times this amount. Most families have 
two incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Family size: A household has an average of 1.8 children. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: There are waiting lists for rental houses in the 
bigger cities. 
</P>
<P>
The average age of most houses is 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Private property ownership is expanding with reforms taking place, but 
most people continue to rent their homes at subsidized monthly rates ranging 
from about $10 to $33. 
</P>
<P>
Size: The average home, a co-op apartment either rented or owned, is 409 square 
feet and includes a living room, which is also the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: In February, 1988, a government decree encouraged construction of 
new housing for Soviets and allowed citizens to take out bank loans for up to 
about $33,000 to build homes. In rural areas, the loans were to have a 50-year 
payback; in the cities, the loans had to be repaid within 25 years. Borrowing 
rates were 1%-3% a year. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, most of the housing is still owned by the state, and the rest belongs 
mainly to housing co-ops and cooperative enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
To date, all land must be leased from the state, and it is illegal to sell the 
lease or sublet the property. 
</P>
<P>
Income: About $330 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Family size: An average household has one child and a babushka or grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: One in five Soviet families lives in what is referred 
to as collective housing, which can be anything from a bunk in a collective 
farm barracks to a couple of rooms in an urban apartment shared with another 
family. There is a waiting list of about 10 years even for rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweden 
</P>
<P>
Cost: In the $70,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Size: A typical single-family home built with government assistance has 1,250 
square feet. An average flat has 680 square feet. Nearly half of the Swedish 
households own their own houses, or one-dwelling buildings. About 15% of the 
households own their own flats in multi-dwelling buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: A typical mortgage runs 30-40 years, either with a fixed interest 
rate, which is changed every fifth year, or a non-fixed interest rate. Today, 
the fixed-interest rate is about 15.5%, and the non-fixed rate is about 16.5%. 
</P>
<P>
It is usually possible to borrow up to 85% of the market value of the house on 
these terms. The last 15% can be financed with a so-called "top loan," with a 
slightly higher interest rate. The average household makes a down payment of 
10% to 30% of the house price. 
</P>
<P>
Income: Ninety percent of the working population works full time or more. These 
90% have an average annual income of about $25,400. The typical household 
living in a one-dwelling house has two incomes. Eighty percent of the Swedish 
women work. 
</P>
<P>
Family size: Most recent statistics, from 1985, show an average number of 
members in a household as 2.2, with the average family having 1.9 children. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: In the biggest cities, Stockholm and Gotenborg, there 
are 5- to 20-year waiting lists for flats to rent. Sites for houses are also 
hard to get in the major cities. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every house built in Sweden is built with government assistance. The 
assistance consists of a low-interest rate, which is about half the market 
rate, in the first years. There are some rules to be followed regarding the 
size of house and building cost per square meter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turkey 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Prices average $68,000 to $90,000 for a typical home. 
</P>
<P>
Size: 1,076-1,292 square feet, generally with 3 bedrooms, a kitchen and a bath. 
Most are flats. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: Housing loans, a new phenomenon in Turkey, can be obtained from the 
Mass Housing and Public Partnership Directorate, which is a public institution, 
or from certain banks. Loans are given according to limits based on house size. 
The amount of a loan covers 20%-25% of the market prices. The mortgage interest 
rate is currently about 7%. The maturity of these loans can be extended up to 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, loans are obtained from the construction company. The builder 
starts collecting installments for the house while it is under construction. 
After the payment of 60% to 70% of the total, the flat is transferred to the 
buyer. The balance is collected in various installments for up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Special characteristics: Families typically can buy a house through the 
government in the seventh or eighth year of marriage.

HOT PROPERTY: ROCKER AXL ROSE HEADS FOR THE HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy metal rocker AXL ROSE, due to be arraigned Thursday for allegedly 
clubbing a neighbor in his condo building with an empty wine bottle, has 
purchased a house in the Hollywood Hills and is remodeling it, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Rose and his wife, Erin, purchased the two-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot house on 
a private, 1 1/3-acre knoll in Beachwood Canyon for $800,000, public records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The lead singer of the band Guns N' Roses, Rose was arrested in late October 
after an argument began over loud music he had been playing in his 12th-floor 
condo off Sunset Strip, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's new neighbors are also worried about the noise. One wrote to The Times: 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping Mr. Rose won't blast us out of our bedrooms at night . . . The 
noise factor from his house would be the main concern . . . It is down a narrow 
road and sits on a promontory, where sound from it echoes throughout the 
canyon." 
</P>
<P>
The Roses bought the home, which also has a pool and city and Griffith Park 
views, from Victor Kaminoff, who had gutted and renovated the '50s-era house in 
1988 after buying the property a year earlier for $330,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Kaminoff gave the house what the sources described as "an Out-of-Africa, earthy 
or organic" feeling, with sisal on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has been replacing the sisal with hardwood, and he has been remodeling the 
kitchen, sources said last week. 
</P>
<P>
However, a few days before his arrest, Rose apparently suffered a bad case of 
buyer's remorse. The Nov. 19 issue of People magazine quoted him, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"This house doesn't mean anything to me. This is not what I wanted. I didn't 
work forever to have this lonely house on the hill that I live in because I'm a 
rich rock star." 
</P>
<P>
Then he broke all of the windows, shoved a $38,000 piano through the side of 
the house and destroyed a fireplace, according to the article. The fireplace, 
etched out of granite and placed against a 30-foot glass wall, was estimated to 
have cost Kaminoff $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The house had been Kaminoff's personal residence, but he was also the listing 
agent on the sale to the Roses, through Prudential California Realty's new 
Sunset Strip office. Neither he nor the selling agent, Arleen Ruby of the 
firm's Beverly Hills office, was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected state Treasurer KATHLEEN BROWN and her husband, ex-CBS news chief 
VAN GORDON SAUTER, have put their West Hollywood home on the market at $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has owned the one-story, 53-year-old house for nearly four years. 
They're planning to move to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The home has three bedrooms, six baths, maid's quarters and a screening room in 
about 5,700 square feet. There is also a pool, spa, koi pond and circular drive 
on the property, which has ocean and city views, said realtor Donna Fields, who 
shares the listing with Joyce Rey at Prudential Rodeo Realty. 
</P>
<P>
GARY NARDINO -- executive producer of the movie "Star Trek III: The Search for 
Spock" and former head of Paramount Television, overseeing such hits as 
"Cheers," "Taxi," "Happy Days" and "Webster" -- has sold his Beverly Hills home 
of 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nardino, now chairman of Orion Television Entertainment, and his wife, 
Florence, sold their Italian villa just north of Sunset Boulevard and moved to 
a nearby rental, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Beverly Hills mayor, DONNA ELLMAN, and her new husband, Dr. Jess Garber, 
a retired obstetrician/gynecologist, bought the four-bedroom, 4,025-square-foot 
home with a pool for close to its $1,795,000 asking price, the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Jones and Michael Mahoney of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young shared the 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
DAWN MOORE, daughter of actor Clayton Moore -- who played the Lone Ranger for 
more than 35 years, and her husband, architect Michael Gerrity cq, just 
purchased the Hollywood Hills home of Edward Mallory, a director of the NBC 
soap opera "Generations," and his wife, Suzanne, a former star of "Days of Our 
Lives" and "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
The Mallorys sold their English, two-story home, built about 1926, for close to 
its $520,000 asking price and moved to Malibu. The house has three bedrooms and 
three baths in 1,600 square feet, and it has a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Moore and her husband will use the home as a pied a terre, as they also have a 
ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains, with a late '40s house filled with buffalo 
heads and bearskin rugs, sources said.

<P>
Patricia Vincente has been trying to sell some commercial property for longer 
than she cares to say. And some of her clients have had homes on the market for 
two years without so much as a nibble -- even though they've dropped their 
prices, offered to help with financing and even suggested trading with 
potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
So Vincente has gone a step further in hope of getting an edge in a depressed 
real estate market: She bought three 6-inch, $3 plastic statuettes of St. 
Joseph, suitable for burying. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is so bad I'll try anything," said Vincente, a Catholic and owner of 
Vincente Realty. So she buried one of the statuettes upside down on her 
property. The other two, she plans to give to the sellers she thinks are "most 
desperate." 
</P>
<P>
In back yards from New York to California, statuettes of the patron saint of 
home and family are being buried by owners wishing for a little luck, or at the 
very least, a firm offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got about 10 agents burying the statues now," said Chuck Lamb, who owns 
four Century 21 offices in the San Fernando Valley. "Most of them aren't even 
Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
Added Jackie Anderson of the West Orange County Assn. of Realtors in Garden 
Grove: "We had 50 statues, but we sold them all. They're in short supply right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
No one agrees how or when the idea originated -- some say it goes back to the 
Middle Ages when nuns buried St. Joseph medals on property they wanted to 
acquire for convents. Others say it was on a Chicago talk show in the early 
1980s -- but they do agree on one thing: St. Joseph statuettes are to home 
sellers what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are to school kids. 
</P>
<P>
At Panation Trade Co. Inc., a religious import and wholesale business in New 
York City, owner Fred Mulfeld has been getting daily calls from retailers 
begging for more. But he can't help. His stock has been almost depleted. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Joseph has been a popular statue . . . but in the last six months, it's 
been a phenomenon of the sort that doesn't usually happen in this industry," he 
said.

BIRD OF PARADISE NOT JUST SHOW PIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bird of Paradise seems to scare off a good many gardeners who think of it 
as a show piece for botanical gardens and plant specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Bird of Paradise is less tender than most people think, often standing several 
degrees of frost inland and thriving too in cool coastal gardens. 
</P>
<P>
A wise gardener will give it some protection from frost in valley areas and 
plenty of sun near the coast. The reward will be bright blooms, almost 
startling in their beauty, from fall through spring, and often into summer.

<P>
GET EDGE ON QUALITY IN BUILDING WITH PLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
FINISH: THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO DISPLAY WORKMANSHIP MAKING THE ROUGH EDGES OF 
BOARDS LOOK SMOOTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY EISINGER, Eisinger, author of How to Build and Contract Your Own Home, 
is a do-it-yourself authority and syndicated columnist.

<TEXT>
<P>
If you're building a piece of furniture, ripping some shelving from a sheet of 
plywood or fabricating a countertop for plastic laminate or ceramic tile, the 
way you finish the edges will reflect the quality of your workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Plywood got its name because thin layers, or plies, of wood were glued together 
at right angles to each other, which provided stability and rigidity, in a 
manufacturing process that yielded more usable wood from each log. However, the 
process also resulted in a panel with a rough edge. Chipboard -- made by mixing 
and compressing small chips of wood in an adhesive -- also has a rough edge 
that requires special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
You have many edge-finishing options that you can exercise, depending on the 
project, your skill and your tools. 
</P>
<P>
A very popular way to conceal the end grain is to miter the corners, as 
illustrated in Figure 1. However, this requires a table or radial arm saw, 
absolutely flat material and some skill on your part. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the mostly widely used edge treatment -- because it's easier and more 
economical -- is to fill the edge grain with a paste wood filler, sand the 
filler smooth and repeat the application until the grain no longer is visible, 
as illustrated in Figure 2. 
</P>
<P>
Another technique that is faster but slightly more expensive is to glue and 
nail decorative molding to the front (see Figure 3). This is an especially fine 
technique when making a coffee table or decorative shelving. 
</P>
<P>
If you are working with expensive hardwood panels, such as birch or mahogany, 
and plan to show the natural grain and color of the wood, your edge treatment 
should be to adhere a strip of the same type wood to the edge, as shown in 
Figure 4. A contact adhesive is best, and the veneer should be at least 
one-eighth inch wider than the thickness of the plywood. When in place, the 
protruding edge of the veneer can be easily cut away with a plane, razor or 
even sanded so it is flush with the top. 
</P>
<P>
If you are building a kitchen countertop or making shelves that require 
additional reinforcement, the edge treatment illustrated in Figure 5 is best. 
Screw and nail straight white pine pieces, sand smooth and you are ready for 
covering the surface and edge with ceramic tile or the most widely used 
countertop material, decorative plastic laminate.

Q: What is causing the lower leaves of my tomato plant to curl? The rest of the 
plant is fine. 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't worry. This condition is caused by a cold spell early in the plant's 
growth cycle. It will not affect new growth and the plant should grow normally 
and produce fruit.

GARDEN NEWS: CHRISTMAS TREES THAT REALLY GROW ON YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two rather surprising living Christmas trees are at nurseries this season, one 
that should stay small for many years, and one that definitely won't. The small 
contender is an upright variety of rosemary with the tantalizing name of 
"Tuscan Blue." Sold in bright red pots, these have been trimmed into the 
classic pyramidal shape and after the holidays they can probably be kept that 
way in a container, or in the ground, with regular shearing. Out in the garden 
"Tuscan Blue" would make a handsome accent and the sight and smell will remind 
you of the formal villas in Tuscany. With time, "Tuscan Blue" can grow to 6 or 
more feet. 
</P>
<P>
The other surprising living Christmas tree is California's own giant sequoia, 
Sequoiadendron giganteum. In time this one will grow to 300 feet with a trunk 
30 feet across! However, it grows slowly (2-3 feet a year) and makes a handsome 
tree, especially in inland areas. Many elegant specimens grow in the Inland 
Empire. The hold their lower branches a long time so become too wide for small 
gardens, but they need less water than the coast redwood. As baby trees, they 
have a perfect Christmas tree shape and the foliage is a very pretty, pearly 
gray. 
</P>
<P>
Don't keep either "tree" indoors for more than a few weeks and when you do 
bring them back outdoors, put them in shade for a few days to acclimate.

mail. There are low and tall gates and several styles including one with a 
sunrise motif and others with little heart or conifer cutouts. Write to P.O.

ABOUT REAL ESTATE: TAX ISSUES OF BUILDING 'GRANNY FLAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY L. KASS, Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist 
specializing in real estate and tax matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We are in our 60s and are contemplating selling our large home and 
adding a "granny flat" of 1,000 square feet to a home owned by our son and his 
wife. They are amenable. 
</P>
<P>
We would finance the construction because the equity in our present home would 
be more than enough to cover the cost. What is the best way to proceed to 
protect everyone's interest, and what should be covered in the agreement our 
attorney will draw up? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: First, the tax issues. On the assumption that you and your wife have 
been living in your house for three out of the past five years, because you are 
in your 60s, you are eligible for the once-in-a-lifetime exemption of up to 
$125,000 of any profits you earned on your house. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you have made a profit of more than $125,000, this additional gain 
will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. It is possible that this additional 
gain will kick you into the highest tax bracket, which currently for married 
individuals filing joint returns can be as high as 33% on any taxable income 
between $74,850 and $155,320. 
</P>
<P>
If the profit is significant, you might want to consider hanging on to the 
house, renting it out, and leaving it as an inheritance for your children. 
</P>
<P>
They would then obtain the "stepped-up" basis which currently under tax laws 
would save them from having to pay the tax on the profit that you may have to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership issue is also complex. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing you want is to have your other children fighting and bickering 
over the ownership of that addition. It must be kept in mind that you have 
taken perhaps your largest asset -- i.e., your house -- and in effect have 
given it to your son. While this may be your intention, there is an old 
expression that "when there is a will, there are relatives."

ABOUT REAL ESTATE: DRAWING A LINE BETWEEN CONDO DESIGN CHANGES AND TYRANNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

specializing in real estate and tax matters.

<P>
QUESTION: I live in a new townhouse development and serve on the architectural 
control committee. Some of the homeowners do not feel the need to go through 
our committee for approval before they make any interior changes. 
</P>
<P>
Our declaration of covenants specifies that approval is required prior to any 
such exterior changes. A lot of people do not understand what belonging to an 
association means, and when we try to explain, they become hostile to us. Can 
you address this issue so homeowners can understand that this is not peculiar 
to our development but to associations in general? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Probably every community association has some form of architectural 
review committee. Often, an owner -- whether in a condominium, planned unit 
development or homeowners association -- wants to make exterior changes to his 
or her own unit, and feels that it is a burden to have to obtain prior approval 
from an architectural control committee. 
</P>
<P>
However, the purpose of design review must be highlighted at the outset of this 
article. There are at least two functions for this design review. First, to 
establish and preserve a harmonious design for a community, and second to 
protect the value of the property in that community. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no doubt that going before the architectural committee can be a 
burden, the positive benefits of this design review should also be kept in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, a Florida court summed up this problem as follows: 
</P>
<P>
"Every man may justly consider his home his castle and himself as the king 
thereof; nonetheless his sovereign fiat to use his property as he pleases must 
yield, at least in degree, where ownership is in common or cooperation with 
others. The benefits of condominium living and ownership demand no less. The 
individual ought not to be permitted to disrupt the integrity of the common 
scheme through his desire for change, however laudable that change might be." 
</P>
<P>
When one buys into a community association, one must understand that it is 
community living. Decisions cannot be unilaterally made, nor can the rules and 
regulations of the association be unilaterally ignored. 
</P>
<P>
One might disagree with the need for external uniformity, for example, but the 
fact remains that if the association documents require external uniformity, 
that is the law of the association and is binding on its members. 
</P>
<P>
Having discussed the function and purpose of architectural controls, however, 
boards of directors of community associations must also recognize that the 
architectural control committee cannot be an autocratic dictator, arbitrarily 
rendering decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The courts that have addressed architectural review cases have made it quite 
clear that architectural covenants are valid and enforceable, provided there 
are clear policy guidelines establishing the overall standards. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it is not enough to say that owners may not make changes to the 
exterior without first obtaining the written approval of the board or the 
architectural control committee. 
</P>
<P>
If no specific standards have been developed, neither the unit owner nor the 
review board will have any objective standard by which to measure the proposed 
external change. Boards of directors must establish fairly specific guidelines, 
and if the guidelines are not already in the association documents, they should 
be approved by a majority of the homeowners. Furthermore, the board of 
directors should be aware that the following will be valid defenses by a unit 
owner when the board of directors tries to seek enforcement of the 
architectural standards: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Arbitrary and capricious action. The architectural standards must be 
applied fairly and consistently, and in good faith. It is totally improper for 
a board of directors (or its architectural review committee) to pick and choose 
in the enforcement of the covenants. If a unit owner is in violation of the 
architectural standards (or at least the board believes there is a violation), 
the board must begin prompt action to assure compliance of the standards. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Laches. This means that the board has permitted a long time to elapse 
before taking action against a particular unit owner. One court has ruled that 
where the board waited six months in filing suit against an unauthorized fence 
that this gave the owner of that fence the defense of laches -- and thus the 
board could not enforce the covenants under those circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Waiver or estoppel. These legal concepts mean basically that if the board 
fails to enforce a covenant against one homeowner, the board may be prohibited 
in a similar situation from enforcing the same standard against another 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
Because this is community living, there has to be a give and take not only by 
the homeowner, but by the board of directors. All too often, architectural 
control boards have been accused of asserting dictatorial powers; indeed, in 
one large Washington community, the architectural control committee is openly 
referred to as the "KGB." 
</P>
<P>
A careful balance must be drawn between enforcement of major and minor 
infractions. Often, boards of directors -- or their architectural committees -- 
become obsessed with minor, petty violations, and often lose sight of reality 
and harmony. 
</P>
<P>
A considerable amount of money has been spent by both homeowners and boards of 
directors in litigation that should never have been brought. Boards of 
directors must sit down with the homeowner who is alleged to have violated the 
architectural standards, and try to work out an amicable resolution of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, boards of directors and their architectural control 
committees must be firm, but must also be reasonable and flexible.

PREPARE FOR BARE-ROOT ROSE PLANTING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New bare-root roses will be out in another month, so start preparing now. 
</P>
<P>
If this is your first try at roses, select a sunny spot with enough room for 
several bushes. The impact of beautiful roses is even more dramatic when 
planted in mass. 
</P>
<P>
If you already have roses, you might want to remove old bushes that are worn 
out. Generous spacing between the plants will aid air circulation. Proper 
spacing depends on the growth habit and climate. Consult a California Certified 
Nurseryman at your local garden center. Get the soil ready by working in 
liberal amounts of organic matter and fertilizer.

Travel to the Seychelles is booming. Tourism officials predict that a record 
100,000 people will have visited the Indian Ocean archipelago by the end of 
this year, and that the number of visitors will climb to more than 140,000 a 
year by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
To cope with this influx, Air Seychelles is planning to buy a second aircraft 
to supplement its only large plane, a Boeing 767, which is operating at 95% 
capacity on its three flights a week to and from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Seychelles, which depend on tourism for most of their foreign exchange 
earnings, also are linked to Europe by two British Airways and three Air France 
flights each week. 
</P>

North to Alaska: Dana Brockway, the director of tourism in Alaska, believes 
that the state's most famous highway has a bad reputation and that something 
should be done about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to soften the harsh image of the Alaska Highway," Brockway said. "Few 
people know it's virtually all paved and that there's more to do along the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Look for more such comments in the future. State tourism officials already are 
beginning their drive to promote independent travel to Alaska in advance of 
1992's 50th anniversary of the building of the Alaska Highway.

Quick Fact: The wingspan of a 747 jumbo jet is longer than the Wright brothers' 
first flight -- 195 feet 8 inches compared to 120 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Right Off Her Head: Visitors to Switzerland might soon be able to see a lock of 
hair taken from the head of Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France who was 
guillotined in 1793. 
</P>
<P>
The lock was purchased by an unidentified Swiss museum at an auction of 
historical items in Munich, Germany, earlier this month. The cost? $1,750. 
</P>
<P>
Air Lines: If the crowds at the airport (any airport, it doesn't matter) seemed 
even worse than usual this Thanksgiving weekend, they probably were. And 
industry analysts believe such crowding will be the norm for everyday travel 
within a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Air travel over the holiday was expected to hit a peak today, with a total of 
1.7 million passengers on the move. That figure is about 30% above the 1.3 
million daily average. 
</P>
<P>
"Air travel at the turn of the century will look much like today's peak holiday 
periods," Drew Steketee, executive director of the Partnership for Improved Air 
Travel, said in calling for increased expenditure on airport facilities to 
counter the expected congestion. "In just 10 years, some 2 million passengers 
will be flying on an average day." 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: Gasoline costs more in New England than any other place in the 
nation -- an average of $1.45 per gallon for self-serve regular unleaded. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, More Turkey: The United States and Turkey have signed a new aviation 
agreement that the Transportation Department says will eliminate some 
restrictions and lead to increases in passenger travel and air cargo trade 
between the countries. 
</P>
<P>
Major provisions of the accord allow each country to designate one or more 
airlines to operate between the United States and Turkey, and state that 
neither country may unilaterally restrict capacity, frequency or type of 
aircraft used. 
</P>
<P>
But Can They Read? Despite the allure of today's high-tech toys, books are 
holding their own in popularity among children, according to a recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
The Hilton Report on Children and Travel, a national survey of 300 children 
ages 6 to 12, revealed that nearly 3 out of 4 children (71%) would take a book 
along with them on vacation in preference to anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Cheers: A total of 177 million bottles of cognac were produced in France last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A Tasteful Museum: Travelers to Korea soon learn that kimchi is the country's 
national dish, but visitors are sometimes hesitant to sample the spicy blend of 
vegetables, garlic and red pepper, fearing that it might be too hot. 
</P>
<P>
Now, foreigners can receive a thorough introduction to kimchi by visiting the 
Kimchi Museum, near the Chung-muro subway station in downtown Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
The museum explains the entire kimchi story. There are history and preservation 
rooms, an information and material room, a buffet restaurant and a tasting 
room. About 50 types of kimchi can be sampled, along with 15 other traditional 
foods. The tasting fee is nominal, about $3.75 per person, and there is no 
admission fee. The museum is open daily. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen tools and standard ingredients are displayed, with explanations in 
Korean, English and Japanese. Teaching sessions are held on Wednesdays, and 
students experience kimchi preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, kimchi is prepared after the autumn harvest to preserve cabbage 
and other vegetables through the winter, and there are as many kimchi recipes 
as there are kitchens in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: There are 157 billionaires in the world.

<P>
Silver Arch: The Gateway Arch in St. Louis is celebrating its 25th anniversary 
this year, and its record stands. It is still the tallest structure in the 
city, rising 630 feet above the Missouri River. By law, no St. Louis building 
is allowed to be taller than the Arch.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: RUGS LOOM LARGE AS EXCELLENT BUYS IN PORTUGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ARRAIOLOS, Portugal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the most beautiful collectibles available in Portugal are handmade 
Arraiolos rugs. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-embroidered in beautiful, earthy and vibrant colors and intricate 
patterns, the rugs are still created according to centuries-old techniques, 
making them affordable treasures that will likely increase in value. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rugs are available in specialized shops in the United States and 
other countries, smart shoppers who buy in Portugal have a great advantage. 
Prices in the United States are generally five or six times higher. Further, 
the selection available in Portugal is better, and rugs can be specially 
ordered for color and pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Credit for initiating Portugal's rug-weaving tradition probably can be given to 
the Moors who wove carpets to use as wall coverings and prayer rugs. When the 
Moors settled in the village of Arraiolos (pronounced Ar-ray-oh-loush), where 
fertile farming and grazing land was available, they taught their rug-making 
techniques to local women and the town's name thereafter became synonymous with 
embroidered rugs. 
</P>
<P>
Now among Portugal's leading cottage industries, Arraiolos rugs are still 
fashioned using the Moors' exacting techniques. Traditionally, the rugs were 
made in the home, but recently the work has moved to small factories. 
</P>
<P>
To make the rugs, a sturdy jute backing is covered with an elongated 
cross-stitch reinforced by a double thickness of wool yarn. 
</P>
<P>
Because manufacture of Arraiolos rugs doesn't require a loom, they can be made 
in any size, shape, pattern and color. 
</P>
<P>
Two grades of stitching are used: fine point and gros point. Fine point allows 
for greater intricacy of design but requires more time to make and is, 
therefore, more expensive. It also is more durable. 
</P>
<P>
Rugs made during the 17th and 18th centuries were often rectangular and used 
four basic design elements. Plants, including two dozen varieties of flowers, 
were popular, as were geometric patterns based on intricate linear Moorish 
designs. Animals and birds, hearts, crowns and amphoras were also used. 
</P>
<P>
During the 19th Century, the Napoleonic Wars, the exile of Portuguese nobility 
to Brazil and economic difficulties undermined Portuguese rug-making. But the 
industry was revived in the early 1900s by Portuguese artist Jose de Quieros, 
who researched ancient patterns and found bright, clear dyes. Rug-making spread 
from Arraiolos to other towns in Portugal, especially to the north near the 
city of Oporto. 
</P>
<P>
Arraiolos rugs attracted international attention between 1920 and 1940 when 
Europeans and Americans began collecting them. New design elements, based on 
French Aubusson and English floral patterns, were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some rugs are made with modified palette and patterns to suit the tastes 
of contemporary buyers, but many traditional design elements, especially floral 
and geometric patterns, have been retained. 
</P>
<P>
Several people may work on one rug simultaneously. It takes a fast worker about 
15 days to complete about 40 square inches of fine point, which has more than 
40,000 stitches. Such work makes the prices sound like bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Ready-made rugs cost from $12 to $28 per square foot. Special orders cost 35% 
to 45% more. U.S. import duties will add 9.8% to the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
After purchase, the rugs are easy to transport home. A 9-by-12-foot rug can be 
folded into a suitcase-size bundle. Or the rugs can be shipped. 
</P>
<P>
In Lisbon, an excellent source of Arraiolos rugs is Casa Quintao, a 
century-old, family-run business. The shop (at Rua Ivens 30) regularly exports 
rugs to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On the first floor, you'll find antique furniture and objets d'art. The rug 
treasury is on the second floor, up a palatial stairway that is often cluttered 
with burlap-bagged rugs ready for shipment. The walls of the spacious gallery 
are covered with exquisite and varied Arraiolos, many with grand dimensions. On 
the floor are stacks of variously sized and shaped rugs. You can spend several 
pleasant hours lifting rug corners to peek at items buried in the stacks. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not sure of colors, you may request sample yarns to bring home for 
comparison with other furnishings. Before you buy, check for quality: Place the 
rug on the floor to make sure it lies flat and inspect the underside to see 
that the pattern is as clearly defined there as it is on the top. 
</P>
<P>
Casa Quintao also sells a limited selection of Arraiolos rug kits that include 
all supplies and instructions. A 2-by-4-foot rug kit sells for about $65, a 
4-by-6-foot for $150. 
</P>
<P>
Another good Lisbon rug shop is Arraiolos Trevo (Avenida Oscar Montiero-Torres 
33-A), which has a fine selection. 
</P>
<P>
Or you might prefer to visit Arraiolos for the day. The town is about 90 miles 
southeast of Lisbon. If you go, you'll still see women busily stitching rugs 
along the town's charming cobblestone streets. 
</P>
<P>
In Arraiolos, Tapetes de Arraiolos Condestaval has a fine collection of rugs 
and will fill special orders. The shop also has a branch in nearby Evora. Both 
shops are open 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 7 p.m. In Arraiolos, workshop hours 
are 8 a.m. to noon and 1 to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.

BARGAIN CORNER: AIR, CAR DISCOUNTS COVER MANY EUROPEAN CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Air Littoral, a French commuter airline, has introduced two new travel passes. 
</P>
<P>
The passes permit unlimited flights on most of the carrier's service to 23 
cities throughout France. The only exceptions are some peak-time flights called 
"Red Flights." A seven-day pass costs $199, while a 10-day pass is $249. Passes 
must be used on consecutive days. Rates are good until the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities Air Littoral serves are Paris, Marseilles, Nice, Lyon, 
Bordeaux, Toulouse, Brest, Clermont, Perigueux, Pau, Grenoble, Agen, Bergerac, 
Le Puy, Vichy, Angouleme and Beziers. 
</P>
<P>
Passes have to be bought in the United States. Contact travel agents or Air 
Promotion Systems, the line's U.S. representative, at (800) 677-4277 or (213) 
670-7302. 
</P>
<P>
Air Inter, another domestic French carrier, has a more flexible seven-day "Le 
France" pass that permits you to choose any seven days to fly within a month. 
This pass costs $210. Air Inter serves 36 cities in France, including Paris, 
Nice, Marseilles, Lyon, Biarritz and Toulouse. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Air Littoral serves smaller cities than Air Inter. 
</P>
<P>
Air France, in conjunction with Kemwel Rental Car, is offering a special rate 
of $39 for one-week car rentals in Europe. To qualify, two passengers have to 
purchase round-trip, transatlantic flights from any U.S. city served by Air 
France. 
</P>
<P>
The offer, good until March 31, includes unlimited mileage, value-added tax and 
full collision-damage insurance with no deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Cars can be picked up at such Air France gateways as Paris, Nice, Rome, Venice, 
Milan, Geneva, Zurich, Madrid, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels and 
Athens. To avoid a drop-off charge, you have to return the car to the same 
Kemwel station where you picked it up.. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to drop the car off at a different station in the same country, 
figure on a $50 charge. And if you want to give the car back in another 
country, the rate is $175. 
</P>
<P>
Car reservations must be made at least seven days before departure from the 
United States. JACK ADLER

CAPTIVATED BY CHINA

<TEXT>
<P>
As a result of a brief note you published concerning bargain trips to China by 
Inter Pacific Tours, we left Aug. 29 and spent two absolutely wonderful weeks 
in China. 
</P>
<P>
You mentioned a cost of $1,000, which seemed too good to be true. Inter Pacific 
Tours did everything it promised. We traveled locally via public bus, taxi and 
rickshaw. We loved China and the Chinese people and look forward to returning. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks again for turning us on to a wonderful opportunity.

JUST OUT OF AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having just returned from two weeks in Africa, reading the Nov. 11 Travel 
Section cover story ("Camp Kenya") was a great pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
I would amend your recommendations for hotels in the Masai Mara, Kenya, to 
include Governor's Camp, located in a beautiful series of bends in the Mara 
River and overlooking the plains and distant escarpments of the Rift Valley. 
Prices run about $320 a day for two, with all meals, game runs, laundry 
included. The tent houses are large, lamp-lit at night with a full bath, 
including bidet. So it manages to be a bit rustic and luxurious at the same 
time. The meals and the staff were wonderful and the animals abundant.

BUREAUCRATIC BLOCK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
We visited Ellis Island by ferry from New Jersey on Sept. 25 and found the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Island is part of New York state, but is located about 1,000 feet from 
the New Jersey shore. While the main building was being remodeled, they built a 
temporary bridge to New Jersey, but now the bureaucrats have decided it must be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge would permit visitors to walk the short distance from the mainland 
to the museum, rather than stand in line and pay $6 for the few-minute boat 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
One official said if people could walk to Ellis Island, they would lose the 
feeling of isolation the immigrants felt while they were on this island. More 
likely his brother owns the ferry boat company!

INSTANT REPLAY: WERE ARIZONA VOTERS OUT OF BOUNDS ON KING VOTE?; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: ARIZONANS ARE PENALIZED FOR REJECTING A KING HOLIDAY, BUT THE 
ILL-INFORMED REACTION IS LACED WITH SACTIMONIOUS HYPOCRISY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul F. Eckstein, Paul Eckstein is a lawyer in Phoenix and was co-prosecutor 
in the 1988 impeachment trial of former Gov. Evan Mecham. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHOENIX 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the rejection of a paid state holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 
Arizona once again has become America's favorite political football. The sports 
world, the media and other leading ethicists have pronounced Arizona a racist 
state, a virtual South Africa in an otherwise racially enlightened nation. 
</P>
<P>
While much has been said and written about why Arizona voters turned down the 
King holiday, most of the commentary has been uninformed, and nearly all of it 
has been laced with heavy doses of sanctimony and hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
It is not as if this national scolding is wholly unwarranted. After all, 
despite protestations to the contrary, some Arizonans plainly rejected the King 
holiday on racist grounds. A poll conducted by the Behavior Research Center of 
Arizona put that number at 6%, well in excess of the 1% margin by which the 
King holiday was defeated. But racists alone did not keep Arizona from joining 
47 other states in celebrating King's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is easy in this state. In May, 1986, nine days after the Arizona House 
of Representatives defeated by a single vote a bill that would have followed 
the federal model of a King holiday by combining Washington and Lincoln's 
birthdays into a Presidents' Day, then-Gov. Bruce Babbitt issued an executive 
order declaring the third Monday in January a paid King holiday for state 
employees. When Evan Mecham succeeded Babbitt in January, 1987, he promptly and 
gleefully rescinded Babbitt's order. 
</P>
<P>
Now it gets complicated. After Mecham was impeached and convicted by the 
Arizona Legislature, and with inordinate pressure from the Phoenix business 
community, which was trying to land the 1993 Super Bowl, the Legislature caved 
in and passed a bill in September, 1989, which created a King Day while at the 
same time eliminating Columbus Day as a paid holiday for state employees. That 
angered the Italian community, which joined forces with the Evanistas (Mecham 
loyalists) to circulate petitions to place the question on the November, 1990, 
ballot. They quickly and easily gathered enough signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that a King Day without a Columbus Day was doomed, in May of this 
year the pro-King Day forces persuaded the Legislature to restore Columbus Day 
while leaving King Day in place. Once again the Evanistas took to the streets 
with their petitions, securing enough signatures to place a second King Day 
proposition on the ballot -- this time with Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
In a rational world, the second act restoring Columbus Day would have rendered 
the earlier legislation removing Columbus Day moot. However, the attorney 
general ruled otherwise. Thus, there were two King Day propositions on the Nov. 
6 general election ballot, one without a Columbus Day (Proposition 301) and one 
with a Columbus Day (Proposition 302). Voters rejected both versions. However, 
subsequent polling confirms that more voters in Arizona wanted some sort of 
King Day rather than none at all. A poll last week found that 63% of voters 
supported one of the two versions of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The split vote is not the only reason Arizona does not have a paid King 
holiday. On the Sunday before election day, sports commentator Greg Gumbel on 
the TV program "The NFL Today" disclosed the existence of a draft press release 
from the NFL stating that Arizona would lose the 1993 Super Bowl, scheduled for 
Arizona State University's stadium, if its voters rejected the King holiday. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that many voters who were on the fence changed their vote at 
the last minute to send a message to New York that no one was going to bludgeon 
Arizonans into voting "yes." According to the Behavior Research poll, as may as 
60,000 voters changed from "yes" to "no" just before the election as a result 
of the NFL story. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the schizophrenic nature of Arizona politics, the vote was highly 
fragmented. King Day carried in two-thirds of the state's legislative districts 
and passed by margins in excess of 65% in many of the precincts in central 
Phoenix and Tucson. But it failed miserably in the rural counties, particularly 
those along the Colorado River and populated largely by retirees unable to 
afford housing in California. There the margin against was 2-1 and more. 
Arizona senior citizens in general opposed the King Day in a big way. For 
example, Propositon 302 carried a mere 29% of the vote in the retirement 
communities of Sun City and Sun City West. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt those who live several hundred miles from Phoenix resented the 
boosterism that pervaded the King Day campaign. Rightly or wrongly, rural 
voters perceived that the holiday was being promoted solely for the economic 
benefit of the Phoenix business Establishment. From the rural voters' 
perspective, the King Day vote was as much anti-Phoenix as anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the final tally showing that Proposition 302 lost by 17,000 
votes statewide out of 1.1 million votes cast, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
announced that unless Arizona changed its mind, and did so quickly, it would 
lose the 1993 Super Bowl. Shortly thereafter, the National Basketball Assn. 
threatened to pull the 1992 NBA All-Star game, the University of Virginia 
(where King shares his day with noted civil-rights activists Robert E. Lee and 
Stonewall Jackson) spurned an invitation to the 1990 Fiesta Bowl, conventions 
were moved elsewhere and the national media resoundingly condemned the outcome. 
In football, this is called piling on. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the cacophony of sanctimony and hypocrisy are several salient facts: 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans, site of the 1992 Super Bowl, is located in a state that does not 
mandate a King Day but rather depends on an annual declaration by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, site of the 1988 Super Bowl, voted by a 60% margin to change the 
name of Martin Luther King Jr. Way back to Market Street in 1987, without any 
untoward consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL itself has only one black head coach and no black owners, despite the 
fact that more than 60% of the players are black. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix, Tucson, Tempe and 18 other cities in the state adopted a paid King 
holiday for their employees before anyone in Arizona even dreamed of hosting 
the Super Bowl; Arizona does not need lessons in political morality from the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
On that last score, Arizona should withdraw any bids for special events 
dependent on the outcome of the King Day issue -- thereby sending a message to 
the NFL, the NBA and anyone else trying to buy Arizona's morality that it is 
not for sale. Sports and the King Day vote must be decoupled. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the advocates of King Day must go to every corner of the state 
with the message that Arizona needs the day not to secure a Super Bowl, but 
rather to honor a man who, more than any other figure in American history, 
through dogged persistence, steadfast courage and stirring rhetoric, brought an 
end to our national shame and led us a long way down the road to becoming one 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, when the University of Oklahoma football teams were the envy 
of the nation, legendary coach Bud Wilkinson bragged that one day Oklahoma 
would have a university of which its football team could be proud. While the 
Phoenix Cardinals are hardly the envy of the NFL, by this time in 1992, when 
the state will have another chance to vote on a paid King holiday, perhaps 
Arizonans will have a state of which its football teams at long last can be 
proud.

A rising issue at American universities is "political correctness." Activists 
on both sides at Harvard make their cases. 
</P>
<P>
A university can be seen as a forum for many voices. But the voices being heard 
today at Harvard and other campuses do not properly represent the many 
individual opinions and beliefs in the university community. "Politically 
correct" students and administrators have grown increasingly intolerant of the 
conservative message during the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Their vocal coalition has determined not only to corner the market on ideas, 
but also to suppress any alternative points of view. This dogma of political 
correctness has forced conservative and religious groups into the closet. 
Within the last year, however, we conservatives have made a resurgence at 
Harvard, exposing the stifling politically correct mode of operation that had 
rendered so many of our voices impotent. But the struggle has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about Harvard that impels many to look with disdain upon their 
upbringing? To ridicule their parents? To laugh at the institutions through 
which they have grown and prospered? 
</P>
<P>
This environment demands a conservative revolution. In this climate our 
organization, the Assn. Against Learning in the Absence of Religion and 
Morality (AALARM), has sought to promote traditional American values -- ideals 
of faith, family, country and community. 
</P>
<P>
We, like most Americans, have been taught the importance of God and the 
community of the church. The ideals of faith and religion play an integral role 
in our lives. We unfashionably respect our parents, recognizing that rebellion 
for rebellion's sake shows contempt for the value of experience. 
</P>
<P>
We have been taught that the important lessons of the human experience are 
learned through interdependence, not isolation. Only within the community can 
individual human beings reach their highest potential. 
</P>
<P>
The clearest manifestation of our communal instinct is a love of country. These 
are the values that have made America strong. But, unfortunately, these beliefs 
are incompatible with politically correct dogma at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Moral relativism and secular humanism have been tacitly adopted as the official 
university religion. For example, the college promotes unrestrained sexual 
activity by providing "morning after" abortions and 100% of the funding for 
clinical abortions. The University Health Services also charge unsuspecting 
parents for student contraceptives. These items appear without special notice 
in billings, as would cough syrup or aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
But our most formidable task to date has been the promotion of traditional 
family values in the face of vociferous and imperious homosexual activists. 
Many licentious homosexual activities have occurred at Harvard facilities, 
evoking no concern among the administration and many students. Recently several 
men were arrested for lewd behavior by Harvard police in the publicly 
accessible Science Center restroom. This area is rumored to be a virtual 
brothel for anonymous homosexual acts. The outrage on campus, appallingly, was 
directed not toward the accused men but toward the police for their intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
The central predicament for Harvard conservatives is simply being heard. At a 
recent debate between AALARM and a homosexual organization, our statements were 
rarely audible over the hissing, booing and obscenities of gay supporters. 
Politically correct students regularly destroy the posters and publications of 
AALARM. Harvard's conservative publication, Peninsula, which appeared for the 
first time last year, has had hundreds of issues removed from dining halls and 
student dorms and destroyed. Administrators as well have attempted to thwart 
our operations. After we postered Harvard Yard, a university official removed 
AALARM posters and delivered them to the dean of students in an unsuccessful 
attempt to see us punished for our beliefs. Recently, the administration, 
through an assistant dean, denounced AALARM in the Boston Globe. In committing 
such shameful acts of censorship they have violated our freedom of speech, and 
in quashing our voice, have breached students' freedom of thought. 
</P>
<P>
George Washington once said, "Let us raise a standard to which the wise and 
honest can repair." Ironically, these words have been immortalized on the wall 
of the Harvard Union -- on a campus rife with moral decay. Until now this 
message has been in vain. But, conservative groups such as AALARM and 
Peninsula, have the courage and tenacity to stand up to the politically correct 
oppressors. Harvard, the finest educational institution in the world, is dear 
to us, and for that reason we cannot be silent. 
</P>
<P>
We stand out as a glimmer of hope, not only to the Harvard community but also 
to the people of tomorrow who will be raised, educated, and cared for by the 
people of today.

A rising issue at American universities is "political correctness." Activists 
on both sides at Harvard make their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy has been described as four wolves and a lamb voting on what to have 
for lunch. Unmoderated majority rule means that the mistakes, the ignorance and 
the prejudices of the majority will become law. Minorities will be devoured, 
and the resulting society will be one of enforced and fearful homogeneity. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, if challenges to the majority voice of "mainstream" American 
values are not permitted and protected by law, our culture will lose its 
fundamental strength, that of many voices conversing and dissenting to forge 
new solutions. 
</P>
<P>
What is the majority anyway but a temporary coalition of minorities? What will 
the four remaining wolves decide to have for lunch the next day? One of 
yesterday's wolves, now become a lamb. In the end, the defense of the rights of 
one is the defense of the rights of all. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal is pluralism, the peaceful coexistence of people holding divergent, 
often irreconcilable, interests and ideals, including people of different 
genders, races, sexual preferences, political affiliations, cultures, and 
religions. Pluralism demands the respect of every individual by the group, 
however offensive the individual may seem to some. 
</P>
<P>
As the unique junction of divergent interests that will never again have such 
close contact and direct communication, universities are charged with special 
responsibility in this regard. Harvard College, like any university, is a 
microcosm of the increasing pluralism of American society. The admissions 
committee has chosen students who will represent multiple viewpoints, with the 
purpose of inciting dialogue between them. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond academic education, universities should also expose their students to 
values, and lifestyles different from those in which they have been raised or 
find comfortable. It is a social service when universities graduate people who 
have learned tolerance and respect. 
</P>
<P>
This intensified pluralism does not sit well with some, especially those who 
are accustomed to privilege: straight, white, Christian men who have never 
before had their voices challenged. 
</P>
<P>
On entering college, they are affronted by people whom they have always been 
able to ignore, now represented in the university as their equals. Finding that 
their voices no longer enjoy the artificial privilege created when minority 
voices are stifled by intimidation, these people often become reactionaries. 
They claim to be oppressed when actually they only feel the constrictions of 
equality. Respect for the needs and worth of all groups within a society may 
require that a dominant group concede some privilege, it is true, but only if 
it has stolen that privilege from others. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in the workplace does not mean a man out of work. Similarly, the right 
of gay people to love and raise children is no infringement on straight 
people's right to do the same. Problems arise only when one group wants to 
exert unjust control over another's capacity to work or have children. 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case at Harvard, reactionaries sometimes become irrational, 
paranoid and aggressive, feeling that the university has taken special measures 
to discredit their values and silence their collective voice. But this would be 
counter to the aim of college. There is room for, and a genuine need for, 
everyone's opinions. The university provides a rational and unbiased forum in 
which they can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Those who bear the brunt of homophobia, racism, sexism, ethnocentrism and 
chauvinism of every sort would rather the opposition be expressed openly than 
remain hidden or latent. When brought to the surface, it can at least be 
identified and countered. No one wants to silence reactionaries. Their voices 
are as valuable as anyone's, but freedom to speak does not mean freedom from 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior proctor told us in our first year, Harvard has chosen students for 
their "sharp edges," the differences that enable them to contribute something 
unique to the university community. Sharp edges mean that sometimes members of 
the community will offend each other, but sharp edges also serve as spurs for 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
The minorities of a society are often its most driven and creative members, its 
pioneers and iconoclasts. They offer choices, light new paths and represent 
ideas that, though they may offer the greatest gifts, would otherwise be 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
That is why our country has laws to protect the rights of minorities, and that 
is why, especially on university campuses, everyone's voices, and especially 
minority voices that be silenced in other parts of society, must be tolerated 
and protected. Reactionaries may not realize it, but the very people whom they 
wish to oppress are fighting for the right of even reactionaries to speak their 
minds. All that is demanded of them is fairness, not surrender.

POLITICAL FORECAST; 
</P>
<P>
TOWARD THE YEAR 2000: WILL WE BREATHE CLEANER AIR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Will tough new anti-pollution regulations really make Southern California air 
quality better by the year 2000? How will the changes affect you personally? 
</P>
<P>
Mary D. Nichols, senior attorney, Natural Resources Defense Council: 
</P>
<P>
I think it is quite certain that we will have fewer days when we violate the 
first-stage emergency episode level. Perhaps we might even be at a point where 
we don't have any episodes because of an enormous effort on the part of many 
different industries and the consuming public to use cleaner technology than 
the ones currently in use: the turnover of our automotive fleet, beginning the 
successful introduction of electric cars or extremely low-polluting, 
alternative-fueled vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
We will see shifting of some polluting businesses to electricity, from those 
that currently burn fossil fuels. More of our electricity will be generated 
outside the basin with clean-burning and renewable fuels, including solar and 
geothermal. I think we will have a goodly amount of energy conservation in 
effect, which will reduce the overall demand for electric power. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 there will be a few million more of us here. We are beginning 
to see some serious efforts made on the part of local planning and 
transportation planning to cope with that growth in a way that promotes infill 
instead of sprawl, and that can be serviced by mass transit, which is a much 
more energy-efficient and less-polluting way of getting around. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I will be able to tell my grandchildren that I was part of the 
process that made it all happen -- tell them stories about how much worse it 
used to be when I was young. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Garcia, Los Angeles attorney, member of the city's Police Commission and 
former president of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission: 
</P>
<P>
I think the air quality will be somewhat better. We still have -- and have had 
for some time -- the strictest controls on stationary sources of pollution in 
the world. With new regulations being issued practically every day as to 
manufacturing and other sources of pollution, those levels will be diminished 
even further. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that there is an open question as to whether the burdens of 
achieving air quality have been fairly distributed. It seems apparent, at least 
to the extent that you can single out air quality -- and this is hard -- as 
being a major contributing factor to the diminution of manufacturing jobs, 
those jobs are held disproportionately by minorities. If you are looking at 
increased costs for utilities, that is a regressive sort of tax. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Levon, senior consultant in environmental sciences, ARCO: 
</P>
<P>
With the new car technology, the air is going to get significantly better 
because the new cars are better able to handle the emissions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The one biggest source for reducing emissions is the automobile, and the 
California Clean Air Act recognized this. This is why the major provision for 
transportation control measures (van pools, car pools, other public 
transportation) are now required for every company that employs more than 100 
people. Such rules (help) to make people aware that they will directly 
contribute to reducing smog by increasing the occupancy of vehicles on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I commute about 40 miles a day to work, so that will help me as far 
as just the daily routine on the road. There are going to be less cars on the 
road. ARCO has had this (van-pooling and ride-sharing) program in effect for 
close to 20 years now. I participate in a van pool. 
</P>
<P>
John Mack, president of the Urban League: 
</P>
<P>
There are some competing and conflicting agendas here. . . . On the one end of 
the spectrum . . . environmentalists are rightly upset and exercised by the 
terrible condition of the environment. (But) I think some of the approaches 
have been so sweeping and so severe that they part company with business. 
</P>
<P>
I have been hearing recently from small, minority businesses that want to 
comply with the regulations that people are throwing at them, but frankly, it 
would put them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, cleaner air will have an impact on me personally as a resident. The 
Urban League will get increasingly concerned with some of the issues that our 
constituency faces. We have such a dearth of businesses and we certainly want 
to see the few that we have survive -- not only survive, but survive properly. 
</P>
<P>
I think it is important that we begin to have communication across sectors 
among the various, sometimes competing interests. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ong, associate professor of urban planning, UCLA School of Architecture 
and Urban Planning: 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt in my mind that, over all, the quality will improve. We do 
know that as we start tightening down on manufacturing, it will lead to some 
job losses, and it will also, obviously, lead to the creation of other jobs -- 
particularly jobs that supply equipment to control emissions better . 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, we also know that the group that is displaced is not the same 
group that is going to get employed. . . . We do know that women and minorities 
tend to be displaced at a higher rate. They lose their jobs at a higher rate; 
they tend to be unemployed for a longer time, and when they do find new 
employment they tend to suffer much larger losses in earnings than other 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
We don't have in place an employment policy to match our environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont Hempel, assistant professor and associate director of the Center for 
Politics and Policy, Claremont Graduate School: 
</P>
<P>
My guess is that it will be cleaner in the year 2000, but will it be cleaner in 
the year 2010? There is a race between the increase in vehicles and the 
increase of environmental control measures. 
</P>
<P>
We have learned that environmental regulation is a sometimes thing. We can 
expect reversals. We can expect some backlash. . . . . 
</P>
<P>
I think I am going to own an electric vehicle in the year 2000. I will be using 
telecommuting for some of my business travel, and I will just use electronic 
mail for things that would have involved a trip with my car in past years. It 
will probably affect my mental health if only visibility is improved. I am 
going to enjoy the aesthetics of living in Los Angeles now a lot more than I do 
today. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, I am going to be more concerned about the things I can't see: 
toxins in the air. And I am going to be more concerned about the things that I 
can't control as a resident of the Los Angeles area -- which means 
trans-boundary environmental pollution (greenhouse effects, carbon-dioxide 
emissions), things that the Air Quality Management District can only control 
locally without having any appreciable affect on the planet's atmosphere. I 
suspect that as our technology to detect what is in the air improves, we are 
going to find new things to worry about.

ABUSED CHILDREN FIND HELP UNDER ONE ROOF; 
</P>
<P>
A COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM AT STUART HOUSE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY TAKES YOUNGSTERS 
OUT OF COLD, INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gail Abarbanel and Aileen Adams, Gail Abarbanel is director of Santa Monica 
Hospital's Rape Treatment Center, and Aileen Adams is its legal counsel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ana was seven years old when she told her teacher that she had been sexually 
abused on many occasions by her stepfather. The Department of Children's 
Services removed her from her home at night while she was asleep. She awoke the 
next day in a foster home with strangers who spoke a different language. 
</P>
<P>
During the ensuing months, Ana was interviewed by four different children's 
services workers. She was questioned by three police officers. She waited two 
months to receive an expert medical examination. She testified at three 
different Dependency Court hearings. She was interviewed by two criminal 
prosecutors. The case still had not come to trial. After more than a year, her 
mother did not want Ana to participate any further in the prosecution of her 
assailant because "she was too traumatized by the system." 
</P>
<P>
A county study released last week showed that Ana's case was but one of the 
114,000 reported in Los Angeles last year. Every year, thousands of abused 
children from all economic and ethnic groups seek help from an overburdened, 
uncoordinated child protection system that too often victimizes them again. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to address this system's failure by adopting new approaches to 
handling child abuse cases. Los Angeles agencies need to work together, and 
they're doing it at Stuart House in a program that's much better for kids. 
</P>
<P>
This inter-agency program was designed to solve many serious problems. For 
example, sexually abused children, like Ana, are frequently interviewed at 
several different places by as many as a dozen professionals. These interviews 
are conducted in cold, institutional settings, such as police stations, that 
frighten young children. Many children either do not receive expert evidentiary 
medical examinations or wait several months to be evaluated. Crucial evidence 
is lost. Nationally, more than 90% of reported sexual abuse cases are never 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Few victims receive needed therapy, so many suffer from developmental problems 
and psychiatric disabilities. Abused children also are more likely to become 
abusers as adolescents and adults, becoming part of the "cycle of abuse." 
</P>
<P>
In cases involving a child harmed by a family member, the person believed 
responsible often is not removed from the home. Instead, the child is separated 
from supportive family members and forced to live in another location. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional and monetary costs of this inadequate system are staggering. 
Seldom does it provide either justice or healing. 
</P>
<P>
To remedy these problems, in 1988 several public agencies joined with Santa 
Monica Hospital's Rape Treatment Center to establish Stuart House. To design a 
new system, we tried looking through a child's eyes. For example, we knew 
children who were afraid of being questioned at police stations because "that's 
where criminals are taken." 
</P>
<P>
Major financial support from the private sector, including the Stuart 
Foundations, made it possible to build a brand new, child-oriented facility in 
Santa Monica. Every feature -- materials, surfaces, colors, and furnishings -- 
helps to make children feel comfortable and safe. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart House brings together -- for the first time -- in one location personnel 
from the Rape Treatment Center, District Attorney's Office, Department of 
Children's Services, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, Santa Monica Police Department, and other law enforcement 
agencies. Because they recognized the difficulties children have in the current 
system, the heads of these departments made a strong commitment by assigning 
their staff members to work on this team. 
</P>
<P>
This approach to handling child sexual abuse cases has many advantages. 
Families relate to one program in a single location. They experience continuity 
and support, instead of receiving conflicting advice from different agencies. 
Unnecessary, repetitive interviews are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Only one person from each agency handles a case from beginning to end. Timely 
medical examinations to gather evidence are performed in a privately funded 
clinic nearby at Santa Monica Hospital. Therapists at Stuart House ensure that 
comprehensive treatment services are provided for children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, cases are resolved more quickly. The participation of a prosecutor 
from the inception of each case enhances investigations. And few children are 
removed from their homes because child protection personnel have the evidence 
they require to have the offender removed instead. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperation that made Stuart House possible is urgently needed throughout 
the county to respond to what the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and 
Neglect recently declared a "national emergency." Working together, 
prosecutors, police, and other child-abuse specialists can reduce the trauma to 
children who participate in the system. 
</P>
<P>
Communities around the country, including Huntsville, Ala., and Seattle, Wash., 
have developed similar programs. Additional government money would support more 
inter-agency efforts. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) recently sponsored 
legislation inspired by Stuart House to provide $75 million in federal funding 
for programs that use a team approach. Money from the private sector is also 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Implementing collaborative, child-focused programs may appear in the short run 
more expensive than perpetuating the established system. But we are already 
paying a much higher price -- in our prisons, foster care system, and mental 
health programs -- for the current system's failure to respond adequately to 
the rapidly rising number of abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart House is one example of how a public/private sector partnership can 
marshal the resources needed to reform the traditional child protection system. 
Our society supports a separate juvenile justice system for young offenders. It 
is time we develop more responsive systems nationwide to serve innocent 
children who are victims of sexual physical abuse.

NEW PERSPECTIVE ON WILD WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two prongs to the famous "frontier thesis" which reporter Terry 
Pristin looks at in her piece on historians of the American West ("Taming of 
the Wild West Is Rewritten by Scholars," Part A, Nov. 14). On the one hand, the 
man who came up with this thesis, Frederick Jackson Turner, related American 
democracy to the "safety valve" function of the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
So long as there was lots of land on the other side of the border, and you were 
willing to destroy any Indian nation that stood in your way, losers in the 
"settled areas" could move west, get land of their own and become part of the 
self-supporting, self-governing mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
This was the historical part of the thesis. Turner used it to explain how the 
nation had managed to flourish up to 1890, expanding in the course of three 
centuries from one edge of the continent to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's second point was more threatening, and perhaps more relevant. To make 
it possible for you to afford your special version of democracy, he warned us, 
you have had to take over this entire land mass. The question now is, where are 
you going to expand next? 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Roosevelt in Panama and the Philippines, Woodrow Wilson in Vera Cruz, 
Haiti and Flanders, Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam, Ronald Reagan in Nicaragua and 
Grenada, each had his own answer to Turner's challenge. George Bush's upcoming 
grab for Middle Eastern oil is in the same brutal tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Surely it's time to stop playing this same bloody record. Bush seems locked in 
some abstract macho dance. Must Congress insist upon playing to his tune?

I so enjoyed the letter from Jeffrey Hayden (Nov. 11), deploring the condition 
of the Westwood elementary school where he voted, as contrasted with his posh 
bank. Yes, even in affluent Westwood the long-time lack of maintenance of our 
schools is reaching critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
My daughter teaches in a fairly new building in Los Angeles Unified School 
District. Yet cleanup is primarily student/teacher maintenance, due to the cuts 
in custodian time. Sweeping floors is difficult for her as she suffers back 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Her recent sneezing fits so alarmed a class that, responsibly, some suggested 
she go to the nurse (who is only there part-time). Wisely, several youngsters 
suspected that accumulated chalk dust was a factor. Her allergist agreed, and 
instructed her to buy a dozen cloth diapers and organize a mass damp-cloth 
cleaning of the boards and eraser trays. She is not the only person among the 
150 who use that room each day who has allergies. 
</P>
<P>
A wholesome environment is vital for both teachers and students. Helpful 
housekeeping can be character building for students. But it does pose a 
question as to how long maintenance can be deferred. And it certainly poses the 
question Hayden mentions: How do we house our children versus how do we house 
our money?

THE FIGHTING IS A FORM OF NEGOTIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new round of rebel attacks in El Salvador have President Alfredo Cristiani 
threatening to cut off peace talks with the guerrillas fighting to overthrow 
his government. While his frustration is understandable, it would be a mistake 
to stop negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
That will only exacerbate the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting that broke out last week really should not have surprised 
anyone. Army intelligence officers in San Salvador had been predicting it, and 
spokesmen for the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front had been 
threatening it. The FMLN insists that the only way it can get concessions from 
the government in the painfully slow, U.N.-sponsored peace talks is to remind 
Cristiani of the kind of damage its fighters can still inflict, even after more 
than 12 years of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even amid contradictory claims of battlefield casualties, it's clear 
that the rebels proved their point. Fighting was reported in half of El 
Salvador's 14 provinces, at least 90 persons were reported killed, perhaps half 
of them soldiers, and rebel sabotage of the electrical system blacked out large 
sections of the country. Frighteningly, many military analysts in El Salvador 
warned that the attacks may have been little more than a strategic feint by the 
rebels -- that the majority of their fighters may have been held in reserve for 
later. 
</P>
<P>
That fits the pattern of this long civil war -- neither side can defeat the 
other, but they can bloody each other badly. In a nation exhausted by war, that 
leaves negotiation as the only realistic option.

<TEXT>
<P>
In any prospective plunge towards war in the gulf, President Bush has been 
inhibited by two factors: the lack of any U.N. mandate for the use of force 
beyond the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the firm stance of 
domestic opinion in the United States, which is strongly opposed to any 
escalation. 
</P>
<P>
In their recent international tours, Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 
have been striving to rally support for a new U.N. Security Council resolution 
permitting military action to evict Iraq from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Baker can claim some success in their efforts. For some of the 
desperately poor African nations serving their tours in the 15-member council, 
straightforward bribery seems to have sufficed. This, too, may have been a 
factor in the minds of the Soviet leaders looking for aid in the grim winter 
ahead. Both Mikhail Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, 
offered language suggesting that they might go along with a new Security 
Council resolution. In Cairo last Friday, President Hosni Mubarak seemed to 
soften his previously clear insistence that Egyptian troops could not be used 
for any purpose beyond defense of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
There is less to boast about when it comes to major capitalist powers. German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl insists that his government is opposed to the use of 
force. Japan, terrified of another bout of Japan-bashing, is saying as little 
as possible, but remains clearly opposed to force. (The French are, as usual, 
talking out of both sides of their mouth.) 
</P>
<P>
A new Security Council resolution on the use of force against Iraq could come 
to a vote this week. Its language, clotted with cautionary subordinate clauses, 
hedged with sibylline provisos, could still allow Bush to boast that he has the 
mandate he desires. Such claims should be regarded with caution, since in the 
resolutions already passed by the Security Council in this crisis there has 
been a considerable gap between the texts and the construction placed on them 
by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
But simultaneously there has been the hunt for domestic consensus, and here 
Bush has faced an entirely different problem. Unlike his predecessors in the 
White House since the end of World War II, he has not been able to invoke the 
Red Menace as pretext for military action. Since it is impossible to cite the 
real reasons for armed intervention -- control of oil, supervision of "world 
order" by force or the threat of force -- Bush has fallen dismally short in 
offering the nation a persuasive rationale for going to war. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the White House may now be seizing a path of opportunity 
out of its difficulties. It is one fraught with peril. 
</P>
<P>
In polls displaying Americans' opposition to war, the only point on which they 
seem as strong as Bush against Iraq is that a nuclear arsenal under the control 
of Saddam Hussein is a matter of legitimate concern, even to the point of 
intervention. Bush may be seeking to make this his pivot for the consensus that 
every politician and editorialist is urging him to find. 
</P>
<P>
But if Iraq's presumptive nuclear arsenal is the animating factor in any march 
to war, then Kuwait becomes irrelevant. Saddam Hussein could order his troops 
out tomorrow and the situation would not change, except that any international 
consensus would immediately dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
Not merely the Arab nations would remind Bush of the following: As recently as 
April, Saddam Hussein called for the removal from the Middle East of all 
weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological and nuclear -- only to have 
his call dismissed by Washington and Tel Aviv. Iraq was one of the earliest 
signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and under that treaty's 
provisions has accepted inspections of nuclear facilities that might be of 
military significance. It recently invited another such inspection. 
</P>
<P>
These inspections are not conclusive, and suspicions were aroused by the 
interception at London's Heathrow Airport of equipment bound for Iraq that may 
have been destined for use as nuclear "triggers." But the answer is plainly 
more rigorous inspection under the terms of the non-proliferation treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly shattering to any international consensus, particularly in the Arab 
world, would be the fact that an unquestioned nuclear power in the region is 
Israel, which has always refused to sign the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing against both of these White House strategies -- the Security Council 
route and the manipulation of domestic opinion -- there remains the sensible 
present policy of sanctions, on which there is genuine consensus and which over 
the months will take their proper toll.

<P>
The surge of Hindu militance and Muslim fundamentalism that brought down the 
coalition government of Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh this month is as 
dismaying and bewildering to the average Hindu as it must be to non-Hindu 
readers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In a land as vast as Europe and with far greater ethnic, religious and 
linguistic diversity, it is imperative that a truly secular and democratic form 
of government be at India's helm, and that was exactly Singh's aim. The only 
political idea that all Indian citizens -- Hindus of all castes, Muslims, 
Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains -- can accept is the unique brand of 
"secularism" that Indians have claimed to practice since the bloody riots that 
marked the partition of the subcontinent into secular India and Muslim Pakistan 
in 1947. The state should sponsor no religion and tolerate them all. As a 
historian and a Hindu agnostic (which is not an oxymoron) I despair over the 
mindless, reactive and hysterical piety of the few that chills the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Logically and theologically, Hindu "fundamentalism" is a contradiction in 
terms. Hindus have many gods; they have scores of religious books, but no 
agreement on a "bible"; they have no organized church, only temples with 
regional and local influence. Sects with competing deities, texts, rituals and 
ideologies flourish; it is quite possible to be an atheist or an agnostic, 
observe no rituals, eat beef or be a vegetarian, and still be a good Hindu. 
</P>
<P>
There are some overarching beliefs that people largely accept: karma (action) 
and reincarnation; the notion that all human beings have an atman (self) that 
is a fraction of Brahman (universal, uncreated energy); and the sacred 
geography -- the rivers, mountains and lakes -- of the subcontinent, including 
the areas now designated as Islamic Pakistan and Bangladesh. Most important, 
Hindus must respect and honor the gods of others. Tolerance is the hallmark of 
Hinduism; to tolerate the intolerant, the monotheistic, the jihad-waging and 
the proselytizing is the test the Hindu must not fail. 
</P>
<P>
The current crisis is caused not by orthodox Hindus but a new breed of 
"protestant" Hindus who made their appearance in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Arya Samaj (Aryan Society), a sect that pioneered Hindu conversion and 
ceremonies to win back converts to Christianity and Islam; its members wanted 
to strip the old Hinduism of its wishy-washy, tolerant ways and (quite rightly) 
reform Hindu society's caste prejudice. The enemies were Muslims and 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS; National Volunteer Corps), formed in 
the 1920s, is an even more avowedly militant and nationalistic Hindu movement 
that fears the national ambitions of Muslims will divide the indivisible 
geographic and sacred entity of "Mother India." This and other sects of Hindu 
"reformers" fabricated a militant creed that distills nationalism, religion and 
militant protest into one volatile potion. 
</P>
<P>
The minority political party that represents this ideology, the Bharatiya 
Janata Party, supported V.P. Singh's coalition, giving him the numbers he 
needed to form a government. The party's latest tactics include opposition to 
Singh's plan to implement a broadened affirmative-action plan for the lower 
castes and support of a plan to restore about 3,000 temples that were torn down 
in the Muslim era, some of them replaced by mosques. 
</P>
<P>
The mosque in Ayodhya that has figured in the recent violence was built in 
1528, after the destruction of a 4th-Century temple that commemorated the 
birthplace of Rama, a greatly revered god of Hinduism. Yes, it was wrong for 
the 16th-Century Mughal emperor Babar to order the destruction of the temple. 
But can that wrong be undone by destroying the mosque and rebuilding the 
temple? It cannot, for a good Hindu. 
</P>
<P>
Bharatiya Janata leaders see their opportunity in a political landscape charged 
with other communal and religious agendas that fuel the fears of the Hindu 
community. A resurgent, expansionist, fundamentalist Islam is vivid in Iran, in 
the crumbling Soviet Union (India's loyal friend), and in the oil-rich gulf 
states. Within India, there are more Muslims than there are in Pakistan, and 
its only Muslim majority state, Kashmir, has a full-blown secessionist movement 
that strikes fears of a fourth war with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
The resolutions of the last few internal crises that rocked the Muslim 
community were seen by average Hindus as cynical pandering by the long-ruling 
Congress Party to the Muslim vote at the cost of eroding the secular 
Constitution. Militant Hindus now believe that they must gain control of the 
central government to combat Islamic politics that could divide India yet 
again. But the real tragedy is that these new Hindus, born in a colonialist age 
when Muslim separatism was invented, have twisted the old Hindu way of life to 
mirror that which they dread most: a militant, fundamentalist Islam, with its 
one unforgiving God and its belief in a theocratic state.

When the Athenians sent Themistocles into exile in 470 BC, they conveniently 
forgot everything he had done for them. It was he who had created the Athenian 
navy, held the Persians at Artemisium and finally defeated them at Salamis. It 
was he who had fortified Athens and made it the most prosperous city of the 
Aegean. His work was continued by Pericles, (without whose energy and public 
spirit the democratic traditions of Athens would certainly have been 
destroyed). But Pericles also was driven from office, tried on trumped-up 
charges and threatened with exile. 
</P>
<P>
Democracies have a natural tendency to turn against their saviors. It happened 
to Winston Churchill. It happened to Charles de Gaulle, and now it has happened 
to Margaret Thatcher. It was not the faults of those great leaders that caused 
their downfall but their virtues. Thatcher, like Themistocles, has been 
overthrown by the resentment of her inferiors. For in a democracy, inferior 
people have power. 
</P>
<P>
When she took office in 1979, it looked as though Britain was in a state of 
terminal decline. The trade unions, with power to bring down the elected 
government, were busy accumulating privileges for their largely idle 
membership. The country had no foreign policy to speak of, had irresolutely 
entered the European Community without any conception of the political cost and 
could no longer be relied upon to defend itself. Socialist mandarins reigned in 
the civil service, in the schools and in the universities, while more than half 
the gross national product was absorbed in public expenditure. Industry was 
crippled by strikes, and whole sections of the economy, run by central 
government, were protected from competition and maintained in a state of 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to communism, our leaders either maintained an embarrassed silence 
or made craven offers of friendship. For the Labor Party, the Soviet Union was 
a "socialist" state that had slightly deviated from its good intentions while 
remaining a friend of the working class. The threat to peace came from our 
habit of defending ourselves, in the face of which the poor Soviets could only 
reply in kind. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Britain was ready to surrender all that it stood for: its pride, its 
enterprise, its ideals of freedom and citizenship, even its national defense. 
The country wallowed in collective guilt feelings, reinforced by the dependency 
culture of the welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher changed all that. She compelled the British people to recognize that 
the individual's life is his own and the responsibility of living it cannot be 
borne by anyone else, still less by the state. She released the talent and 
enterprise that, notwithstanding decades of egalitarian claptrap, still exist 
in British society. She broke the power of the unions, exposing such men as 
Arthur Scargill, leader of the mine workers, for the Stalinists they are. She 
restored our national pride and sense of sovereignty, first by resisting the 
Argentine invasion of the Falklands, second by countering the Soviet threat and 
exposing the peace movement as a part of it, and third by defying the ambitions 
of the Eurocrats. She began to reform the education system, opposing the 
socialist apparatchiks who control it and holding up their "progressive" 
curriculum to scorn. She even took on the welfare state itself, trying to 
persuade people that their lives could be better, freer and simpler without 
this great cancer on the national economy, which benefits nobody so much as 
those appointed to control it. 
</P>
<P>
Those achievements led to her downfall. Anyone who threatens the dependency 
culture in Britain threatens the Establishment: the media, the universities, 
the schools, the welfare services, the vast heap of redundant civil servants. 
The chattering classes rose up in alarm, recognizing that Thatcher's triumph 
would be their destruction. Nobody was more disturbed than my university 
colleagues: For decades they have enjoyed financial security with no real 
obligations. They are natural believers in the state that nourishes them, and 
natural socialists when it comes -- as occasionally happens -- to exercising 
their minds. Acting together with their friends in the media, such people have 
created the myth of Thatcher as an "uncaring" and bossy woman, armed with 
Victorian values and a handbag. In fact she threatens nobody but the parasites. 
</P>
<P>
But the relentless campaign of denigration has at last paid off. The Tories, in 
a fit of nerves, have followed the rest of the nation in preferring mediocrity 
to excellence. And, like the Athenians, they are sure to regret it.

The producers made us look like suckers. The police arrested Ben Horne, but we

there's not enough evidence that he really killed her. Ben or Leland? Just have

<P>
OFFBEAT NETWORK DECIDES TO MAKE MOVIES -- THE FIRST TO AIR IS 'WORKING TRASH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was May a year ago that the Fox network kicked off "Fox Night at the Movies" 
with the critical and popular hit "The Fly." Since then, "Night at the Movies" 
has ap peared sporadically -- first on Wednesdays, now on Mondays -- and it has 
been filled with such undistinguished fare as "Less Than Zero," "A Night in the 
Life of Jimmy Reardon" and "Earth Girls Are Easy." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Fox seeks to boost its ratings and prestige with "Working Trash," 
the first movie made for "Fox Night at the Movies." Fox is aiming to get into 
the business of making movies for television without jeopardizing its image as 
the nonconformist network. 
</P>
<P>
Its executives promise there will be no disease-of-the-week movies, no 
women-in-jeopardy movies and no social issue movies. They say they will air 
different fare from the typical movies-of-the-week on the other three networks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping to be on the edge," said Larry Jones, president of FNM Co., the 
Fox Inc. company that produces the films for Fox Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"(The films) have to be either on the edge in their comedy, their sensibility 
in their drama or the way they tell their story. You can see (movies like) 'Roe 
vs. Wade' on NBC. They are important movies and from a personal standpoint, I 
am happy they are being made, but they are not for us. They are not for our 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Senior analyst Larry Gerbrandt of Paul Kagan Associates, a media analyst firm, 
said Fox has made a wise decision to stick to entertainment films. "Those 
(issue) movies actually tend to do better than the entertainment movies in the 
ratings, but they have very little residual value. They have become known in 
syndication as 'disease-of-the-week movies.' And what is highly topical here in 
the U.S. may not be highly topical overseas, and that is where you make back 
your money. They must go to the foreign marketplace for syndication." 
</P>
<P>
Fox's hopes are pinned on "Working Trash," which premieres Monday. The two-hour 
comedy was written by Jon Connolly, co-writer of the 1989 feature "The Dream 
Team," and directed by Alan Metter (director of "Back to School"). It stars 
stand-up comic George Carlin and MTV's Ben Stiller as two Wall Street janitors 
who strike it rich by investing on information picked up from company trash. 
</P>
<P>
"Working Trash" was originally a feature script that FNM optioned after it was 
shelved by a studio. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said: "It is in many ways typical of what we are trying to do -- take a 
concept that we really like, whether it is a comedy or a drama or an 
action-adventure, and marry it with talented writers, writers who don't 
necessarily do TV or maybe brand new writers. And then we try to cast it with 
clever casting, not necessarily TV casting. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to try to take talents at all different levels that are not that 
well known, like a Ben Stiller, or who are known in a different area, like 
George Carlin, put them together and take writers who are not known as 
directors and let them direct." 
</P>
<P>
"Working Trash" is the first starring role for veteran comic Carlin. "I have 
always wanted to add acting to my career," Carlin said. "I felt in the 1960s, 
the logical time to establish my acting, that I didn't have any confidence. I 
felt I was lost in the acting setting. Now I am able to approach the acting 
with a little more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Carlin said audiences are tired of run-of-the-mill TV movies. "It seems every 
time I see one of the three traditional networks, whenever I see any of their 
movies of the week, it is about some cripple or some person with cancer who 
recovers to make the gym team or something. This is an all-out comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Though Fox has not announced or scheduled its next original film, the network's 
executives hope to air three new films plus one feature each month. Though 
Jones believes this could happen by next fall, Fox hasn't set a start date. 
</P>
<P>
The budget of its average film will be less than the other three networks' 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
"But," Jones said, "the production values will clearly be equal to other TV 
movies. When you have an Alan Metter directing 'Working Trash,' you are going 
to get the quality level of TV movies or hopefully better. Our pictures are not 
star-driven, so that will reduce costs." 
</P>
<P>
Gerbrandt doesn't think the lower budgets and the fact Fox's movies will not be 
star-driven will hinder the quality and success of the films: "Their strategy 
has succeeded so far with their shows that don't have very well known stars. 
Tracey Ullman was not a household name. It looks again like Fox is staying 
within its formula that they can create new stars on their own. By and large 
they have been successful." 
</P>
<P>
FNM develops the movies and pays for the production. "We then license them to 
Fox and they distribute the films," Jones said. To help recoup expenses, the 
movies also will air on television worldwide. In some cases, when the project 
or the budget warrants it, the movies will be distributed internationally as 
theatrical films. "We will exploit our movies in any manner possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One such production is "Robin Hood," starring Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman, 
which started filming in Britain last month. "It's a large international film," 
Jones said. "We will deliver it to Fox Broadcasting as a three-hour special 
event for their broadcast, hopefully in the spring, and will license it 
throughout the world as a major theatrical motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have a couple more movies that can be (released as) theatricals 
throughout the rest of the world. That is where we make up the deficit between 
our production costs and our licensing fee, through our international 
distribution." 
</P>
<P>
Producing these movies is both fun and a challenge, said Jones. "It's not an 
easy task, but it's an empty canvas which we get to paint whatever we can 
figure out looks good." 
</P>
<P>
"Working Trash" airs Monday at 8 p.m. on Channels 11 and 6.

BACH: The Well-Tempered Clavier. Joao Carlos Martins, piano. Tomato 2699132. 
Martins focuses the listener's attention not on Bach's music, but on his own 
manner of playing it. 
</P>
<P>
He uses a whole range of rhetorical devices for expressive purposes, everything 
from unwritten rubatos and accents to gratuitous colorings and fussy 
articulations. Though occasionally he offers a straightforward reading by way 
of contrast, he often backs off even further, draining the music of all 
inflection and emotion and turning innocent counterpoint into stark 
mathematical formula. In giving many of these pieces a strongly pianistic and 
melodic cast, he obscures their multiple-voiced complexities. Martins's 
noodling may rarely bore, but it does seem arbitrary, and what Bach wrote is 
vastly more interesting. TIMOTHY MANGAN

EMI CDM-7 63256 2 (compact disc). This elegant, re-released collection of 20

Ovalle, Valdemar Henrique, Ernani Braga and Francisco Mignone. Easy-listening 
in the best sense, but the remastered sonics sound even more glossily

BEETHOVEN: SYMPHONIES NOS. 7 &amp; 8. Chicago Symphony conducted by Sir Georg 
Solti. 
</P>
<P>
London 425 525-2. No surprises here -- the performers are too familiar to us 
and to each other, and Solti too straightforward a conductor. Neither of these 
performances catch fire with the kind of emotional abandon and rhythmic 
vivacity others have found. But they're nevertheless surprisingly attractive in 
their plain-spoken sturdiness, effective despite (or because?) of the steady 
sobriety of their unfolding. Underlying the apparent effortlessness of the 
playing, however, is a firm hand at the helm, and an unselfish intellect that 
knows this music doesn't require much prodding to work. TIMOTHY MANGAN

The angst-ridden Symphony No. 3 -- a threnody to the victims of the Holocaust

no less, and it piles on the rage and redemption even more thickly and at 
greater length. At no time, though, does one hear even a ghost of a striking 
musical idea, something which acres of sumptuously recorded sound and fury 
can't quite hide. RICHARD S. GINELL

EAGLES NEST EGGS: As we predicted earlier this year, the Eagles have gotten 
back together and are working on a greatest-hits package. In fact, original 
members Don Henley, Joe Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit and Don Felder have been in a 
Los Angeles studio recording several new songs for possible inclusion on the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Who's missing from that list? None other than Glenn Frey, who didn't show up 
for the recent sessions. Has Frey had another falling out with Henley? Can the 
band pull off its much-anticipated 1991 reunion tour without Frey on board? 
Stay tuned. The band is scheduled to have another recording session in 
mid-December. Insiders say if Frey doesn't make an appearance, it could spell 
trouble for any reunion tour.

POP EYE: CAN PETER GABRIEL VANQUISH THE BOX? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's finally showdown time in the record business over the controversial CD 
longbox. 
</P>
<P>
If longbox foes and supporters agree on anything, it's that the true test of 
the longbox's future would come when a major rock star put out a CD without its 
bulky 6x12-inch package. 
</P>
<P>
The future is now. Two of rock's top stars, Peter Gabriel and Sting, are about 
to release albums that either ditch the longbox entirely or offer a replacement 
package that cuts down on paperboard waste, which has made the longbox such an 
ecological eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
A major force behind the recent series of Amnesty International concert tours, 
Gabriel puts out his Geffen Records album "Shaking the Tree: 16 Golden Greats" 
on Dec. 4. He'll be followed by Sting, another Amnesty participant and a 
longtime environmental activist, who'll release his new A&amp;M album "The Soul 
Cages" on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel's CD simply comes in a jewelbox. Sting's album uses a proposed longbox 
replacement, the Digitrak. It's a multi-paneled 5x11-inch paperboard package 
that is displayed in removable -- and potentially recyclable -- plastic 
holders, which allows it to fit in current CD retail bins but fold up to 
jewel-box size for use at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Gabriel CD poses the biggest test of anti-longbox fervor. Many retailers, 
most notably Show Industries chief Lou Fogelman, who runs several major 
record-store chains including Music Plus, have vowed not to stock or sell CDs 
distributed without a longbox. 
</P>
<P>
"When Peter came to us a few weeks ago and said he wanted to put this out 
without a longbox, I told him of all the consequences," said Geffen president 
Eddie Rosenblatt. "He knows this means he's going to lose a lot of sales, but 
he's willing to take the punishment. It's difficult to quantify, but judging 
from our discussions with our sales and distribution people, it could cost us 
40% of the records we'd normally ship to our accounts." 
</P>
<P>
(Rosenblatt would not provide specific figures, but gauging from past release 
patterns of superstar-hits packages, it's probable that Geffen is shipping 
about 100,000 less records than its normal 250,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt isn't eager to antagonize retailers, saying he believes they're 
willing to phase out longboxes "in an orderly" fashion. But he says his label 
wants to ban the box entirely, not settle for one of the many proposed 
alternatives now being touted by retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"The halfway measures don't solve the problem -- they simply continue it," 
Rosenblatt said. "You're still having to throw away or recycle a lot of 
material." 
</P>
<P>
THE STING: A&amp;M's upcoming Sting CD package has already stirred a noisy 
debate, especially among longbox foes. They say the pop star, who's been an 
outspoken environmental activist and has the commercial clout to influence 
label decisions, hasn't practiced what he's preached. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed to see Sting, who's been so vocal about other 
environmental issues, making so many obvious compromises when it came to his 
record," says Rykodisc president Robert Simonds, who runs the Ban the Box 
Coalition, which has the support of dozens of major pop artists. "It's 
frustrating to see an artist with his environmental consciousness not taking a 
stronger stand -- as Peter Gabriel has with his record." 
</P>
<P>
Still, A&amp;M is proud of launching a longbox alternative. Al Carfaro, A&amp;M 
senior vice president and general manager, says that the label has taken "a 
step in the right direction" with its Digitrak experiment, which he calls "a 
potential solution to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why A&amp;M is using a 5x11 replacement package instead of simply going 
with a jewel box, Carfaro acknowledged that the label was responding to retail 
pressures. "We simply couldn't run the risk of not having this record 
everywhere. A label our size can't dictate to the marketplace, which just isn't 
equipped to stock CDs without some kind of packaging." 
</P>
<P>
But what has peeved activists is that A&amp;M is shipping up to 300,000 initial 
copies of the Sting album with a longbox. The label says that's because the 
record is being released 10 days before AGI Inc., the company which makes 
Digitrak, can begin mass production of the package. 
</P>
<P>
Which begs the question -- if A&amp;M and Sting are such ardent 
environmentalists, why couldn't they wait 10 days? "From a marketing 
standpoint, we just had to get the record out," Carfaro says. "We had to have 
the album out by Feb. 1, which is when Sting's tour starts, and the dates are 
booked and couldn't be changed." 
</P>
<P>
The Digitrak's other drawback is its throwaway plastic holders. A&amp;M says 
they are recyclable -- but only if there's a system to collect and return the 
plastic. Carfaro says it's up to the retailers to provide such a system and 
admits that "we don't have any assurances yet that they're ready to set one 
up." 
</P>
<P>
So far the artists are letting the packages speak for themselves. Peter 
Gabriel's manager said he was in the studio and "too busy" to comment. Sting's 
label reps said he was in London and was unavailable for comment. 
(Incidentally, Rykodisc's Simonds acknowledged that his label's CDs are 
distributed in longboxes.)

NASTY BOYS: Watch for another escalation in the explicit-lyric wars this week 
after Warner Records (through its Reprise/Cold Chillin' subsidiaries) releases 
a new rap collection, "2 Nasty for Radio," which features a host of raunchy 
songs -- all conveniently compiled in one package. The album offers such 
X-rated items as Roxanne Shante's "Brothers Ain't (Expletive)," Ice-T's "Ladies 
LGBNAF" (don't even think about having us spell that out), and Big Daddy Kane's 
"Pimpin' Ain't Easy." 
</P>
<P>
(Priority Records has just released a similar package, "Explicit Rap," which 
offers nasty-rap from the likes of 2 Live Crew, Geto Boys, Too Short and 
N.W.A.) Warner sees its collection as a clever marketing vehicle. But anti-rap 
crusader Jack Thompson sees it as a provocation. "This is a purposeful effort 
by some corporate wise guys to put all this crap on one album and see what 
happens," he says. "What they're saying is, 'We dare you to do something.' And 
I think someone's going to take them up on it."

AND FINALLY: Expect PolyGram to announce its label reorganization plan as early 
as next week, with up-and-coming exec Ed Eckstine running Mercury Records and 
newly hired Rick Dobbis heading up PLG Records, which will encompass the 
Polydor, London and Smash labels. 
</P>
<P>
That means Eckstine gets most of PolyGram's big-name artists, including Bon 
Jovi, Cinderella, John Cougar Mellencamp, Def Leppard and Robert Cray. PLG will 
launch with younger bands like LA Guns, Hothouse Flowers and the Wonder Stuff. 
Watch for record producer Davitt Sigerson to join Dobbis' label in a key 
A&amp;R role.

PACIFIC DINING CAR'S NEW BRANCH CELEBRATES MID-AMERICAN ABUNDANCE -- AND THAT 
MEANS BIG AND MEATY (AND EXPENSIVE) MEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to imagine Santa in a really sunny sky. So even if you were born in 
California, come Christmas you start hoping for snow. 
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving never seems quite Californian either: Pilgrims and palm trees just 
don't go together. 
</P>
<P>
This is the time of year when a lot of Californians start leaning toward the 
east. If you are among them, you'll be happy to hear that Santa Monica's newest 
restaurant makes a person feel as if he has landed in Kansas. It's a true blue, 
manly sort of place that celebrates American abundance; it is where big people 
eat big food (and pay big prices). If you're tired of eating turkey, but still 
feeling like a gastronomic patriot, the new Pacific Dining Car is the perfect 
place for you. 
</P>
<P>
The room itself has a comfortingly nondescript air. The dark wood, cozy booths 
and old-fashioned lamps erase both space and time: Walk in the door and you 
could be anywhere in America, any time in the last century. In a city where new 
restaurants strain to look up-to-date, hip and unique, this is a room that asks 
only to be ignored. The original Pacific Dining Car is a charming collection of 
rooms with the atmosphere that comes with a patina of age. The new Pacific 
Dining Car is different: It is comfortable precisely because it doesn't call 
attention to itself. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does the menu; you could almost recite it with your eyes closed. There 
are steaks. And more steaks. And more meat -- veal, prime rib, pork chops. 
There is lobster (taken from a tank, sold by the pound and perfectly cooked). 
For people who don't eat meat and won't eat lobster, there are a couple flavors 
of fish (generally swordfish and salmon), but I suspect that it is hard to 
order them without feeling like a wimp. 
</P>
<P>
Even the meat can make you feel like a wimp; you may be feeling macho as you 
order, but the portions are dauntingly gigantic. Watching that hunk of flesh as 
it approaches the table can make you want to get up and run. (The most sensible 
people I've seen at Pacific Dining Car were a couple smart enough to split a 
single meal; they are just about the only people I've seen walk out the door 
without a doggie bag.) 
</P>
<P>
Your meat is accompanied by a baked potato, which comes equipped with someone 
whose sole mission seems to be walking around the restaurant smothering 
innocent spuds in clouds of sour cream. If you don't feel up to this onslaught 
of cream and carbohydrates, you could opt for French fries, sliced tomatoes 
(but why would you?), rice pilaf (the favorite of those fish-eating wimps), 
cottage cheese (ditto), or very good cole slaw. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a token vegetable on the plate: One night it was spinach, as 
dark and thick as a swamp with a strong back note of nutmeg. Another night it 
was watery zucchini in tomato sauce, which made me realize that the spinach at 
least had the virtue of keeping to itself; these vegetables insisted on running 
all over the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The meat is good aged stuff, expertly grilled over mesquite charcoal -- but 
some cuts are considerably better than others. The T-bone costs $5 more than 
the others -- and it's worth it. The next best, for my money, is the Delmonico 
steak; order it without the bone and it becomes New York strip steak. I've 
never much liked filet mignon -- too soft -- and the rib steak I had at Pacific 
Dining Car was a real disappointment. But that T-bone was a powerful piece of 
flesh -- well-aged meat that gave you something to dig your teeth into (not to 
mention a great bone for breakfast). 
</P>
<P>
There is a selection of vegetables to go with the meat and potatoes -- most of 
them not green. There are great onion rings -- the skinny kind -- that come 
folded into a napkin in a huge basket. They are hot and sweet and amazingly 
delicious -- just the sort of food that makes you glad to be an American. The 
fried zucchini is surprisingly similar; the zucchini is shredded into thin 
strands, dipped into the same buttermilk batter and fried. It's hard to make a 
case that these vegetables are actually good for you, but they are very 
appealing. There are also mushrooms or steamed spinach or broccoli -- all of 
them served in portions generous enough to feed a few hungry people. 
</P>
<P>
Appetizers are big too. The fresh, briny Kumamoto oysters are served not in the 
usual half dozen but nine to an order. They come with lemon, cocktail sauce and 
wonderfully powerful fresh horseradish. Shrimp cocktail is not quite so 
generous; for $12.50 you get 5 shrimp. They are, however, very large shrimp. 
Cracked crab is served on ice -- and if you simply must have meat before your 
meat, half a rack of baby back ribs should take the edge off your appetite. 
</P>
<P>
As you might imagine, salads here are the sort that could never be called 
"rabbit food." Spinach is drenched in bacon and eggs and the Caesar is creamy 
-- laden with croutons and cheese. There is also a giant beefsteak tomato and 
Maui onion salad whose main purpose seems to be to make you wonder why you are 
fool enough to be paying $8.75 for this particular pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts are big, sweet and all-American. There is pecan pie made with maple 
syrup and big plates of strawberry shortcake. The hot fudge sundae comes in a 
flat bowl with three scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, pecans -- and enough 
spoons for the entire table. 
</P>
<P>
If you've gotten to this point in the meal, you probably have forgotten that 
you're still in California. Should you want to come back to reality (before the 
enormousness of the bill brings you crashing down to earth), try the rather 
leaden apple pie. If this really were Kansas, the restaurant surely would not 
be serving a pie this poor.

WINE LIST: NOT YOUR AVERAGE RAILROAD DINING CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Dan Berger is Times wine critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No railroad dining car ever had this array of wines. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Dining Car's wine list, modest when the restaurant opened in 1921, 
became a personal project of the grandson of the original owners. By 1964, Wes 
Idol had created an excellent list, and he has kept it that way for a quarter 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of the list at the downtown location will be pleased to know that the list 
at the new restaurant is identical. 
</P>
<P>
"We put three or four of everything into a truck and brought it over," said 
manager Michael Green. The wines are now safely ensconced in a glass-enclosed 
cool room, along with the Waterford crystal decanters into which they are 
decanted. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other elegant accouterments are silver ice buckets and handsome, 
thin-rimmed stemware. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rogness, former sommelier at Joss and one of the most knowledgeable wine 
stewards around, is on hand to serve the wine. He loves to talk about wine with 
interested diners. He is proud of the fact that the restaurant has some great 
wines with lower prices, including 1982 Heitz Martha's Vineyard Cabernet at $55 
(probably $20 a bottle lower than it could sell for) and 1980 BV Private 
Reserve Cabernet ($50) and the same wine in a magnum at $90. 
</P>
<P>
Westside patrons are apparently opting for different wines than those sold at 
the original location. "We've actually sold more Pinot Noir than Cabernet," 
said Green. "I always think Cabernet is the thing to drink with steak, but we 
have some excellent Pinot Noirs, and the folks here are finding them." 
</P>
<P>
One exceptional value is the 1984 Tulocay Pinot Noir ($29 on this list). There 
are a half dozen other wines priced under $30. (Pricing is about 2.5 times 
wholesale for most items, with a smaller markup on more expensive wines.) 
</P>
<P>
Other good values: 1987 Justin Reserve from Paso Robles ($33), the wine that 
won the red wine sweepstakes at the Los Angeles County Fair wine competition a 
few months ago, and 1985 Kenwood Jack London Cabernet ($35). Among the red 
Burgundies, there's a 1984 Morey St. Denis from Hubert Lignier ($53). 
</P>
<P>
This is a steak house, so red wine is favored by a wide margin, and white wines 
seem a bit overpriced; most Chardonnay sells for about three times wholesale 
and more. Examples: 1988 Acacia at $38; 1988 Chateau Montelena "Alexander 
Valley" at $39, 1987 Chateau St. Jean Robert Young at $41 and 1988 Bonny Doon 
at $34. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Sauvignon Blancs are steep: Chateau St. Jean "Sonoma County" at $22 
and 1988 Matanzas Creek at $28. One value is 1985 Robert Pepi at $22. 
</P>
<P>
You might want to bring your own white wine: corkage is $10 a bottle, but it is 
occasionally waived.

NOTEBOOK: FRANKS-AND-BELL EXPRESS HEADS FOR THE DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without a doubt, Michael Franks and Robert Bell are the restaurant kingpins of 
the South Bay. Their company already owns Chez Melange and Chez Allez in 
Redondo Beach, plus Fino and Misto in Torrance. Now they're at work on yet 
another place in Torrance, the Depot, scheduled to open in February. 
</P>
<P>
The new restaurant will occupy the recently restored 1912-vintage Southern 
Pacific railway depot in downtown Torrance. "It looks exactly as it did when it 
was built," says Franks, "except that back then it was surrounded by fields." 
Now it will be the centerpiece for the Depot shopping complex. Franks describes 
the place as having "an almost Southwestern look outside, with high ceilings, 
brick walls, and lots of color inside." The food, which Franks says is 
"completely different from anything we've done so far," will be in the "modern 
grill style with an Asian eclectic feel to it." There will be an oyster bar and 
lots of fresh fish on the menu, entree prices will range from $7 to $14, and 
the chef will be Jim Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
LOOK WHO'S COOKING: The last time we heard news of Vern and Charlene Rollins 
was in late 1987, when they were discovered behind the stoves at the Longfellow 
Cafe in Mt. Vernon, Wash. The couple -- who ran the acclaimed restaurant New 
Boonville Hotel in Northern California's Anderson Valley -- had disappeared 
suddenly in 1986, leaving behind a number of disgruntled employees and 
investors. Their friends and fans might be interested to learn that they are 
now established in Ashland, Ore., at the tiny but popular Sammy's New Age 
Cowboy Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
SALT AND PEPPER: Tomorrow through Dec. 2, Tulipe in West Hollywood highlights 
the foods and wines of France's Lyonnaise region, in addition to serving its 
regular dishes. A five-course menu is offered at $40 for food only, $50 
including three glasses of wine -- and the Lyonnaise specialties are also 
available a la carte. . . . The former Central Park Cafe in Brentwood has been 
bought by the executive chef at the Los Angeles Hilton, Reto Ryffel, and become 
the Central Park West Wine Bar and Grill. L.I.F.E. (Love Is Feeding Everyone) 
takes over the restaurant Thursday for a benefit "Evening of the Senses," 
featuring items from the Central Park menu, a silent auction, an exhibition of 
art by Marquis de Jadraque and music by jazz vocalist Ruth Price. Tickets are 
$75. . . . And also on Thursday, in honor of Carol Fields' newly released 
"Celebrating Italy" -- Campanile hosts a four-course dinner made from the 
festival recipes in Fields' book. Santa Lucia's Christmas goose and and Alba's 
herb-flavored custard, served during the Palio of Donkeys, are some of the 
offerings. The dinner is $48 per person.

The articles should have been titled "White Women in Hollywood," because 
apparently no women of color exist in the industry to speak of (or is the lack

Isn't it curious that Dutka's article could protest the trivialization of 
(white) actresses while omitting any mention of the fact that black and other 
minority women get hardly any roles at all, minor or otherwise? What black 
actress other than Whoopi Goldberg is working on a regular basis? I care a lot 
more about this than whether Streep gets paid as much as Nicholson.

A TIME TO PLAY HARDBALL: SUE A STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While women in other industries have sought and obtained legal redress under 
the Equal Pay Act and other laws, actresses continue to accept low levels of 
pay and the feeble justifications made by the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
Given the clear pattern of discrimination against the female members of the 
Screen Actors Guild, I propose that a class-action suit be filed against one of 
the major studios. 
</P>
<P>
It's about time that the most visible women in America stood up for their 
rights and played hardball.

Unfortunately, Dutka's article on the shameful status of female stars is too 
true. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, I would give Rachel Ward a swift kick to the head in the hope 
that it might knock some sense into her. I would love to be the "fly on the 
wall" when she steps up to Sylvester Stallone and tells him he doesn't need 
$11-million-plus per picture. 
</P>
<P>
I propose women boycott films by Stallone, etc., especially non-actors Eddie 
Murphy and Arnold Schwarzenegger. If your under-25 boyfriend tries to talk you 
into seeing a male "action" film, drag him into bed instead.

THEATER NOTEBOOK: L.A. PERFORMANCE ARTIST'S CHILDHOOD MEMORIES INSPIRE PERSONAL 
PORTRAIT OF 'DOWNTOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, Arkatov writes regularly about theater for Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luis Alfaro is making theater like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last six months, I've done like 30 projects," said the local 
writer-performer whose latest effort, "Downtown," opens Friday at Highways in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, I'll write something on Monday, then work it, work it, work it. On 
Thursday, I memorize it; on Friday, I work it onstage; on Saturday, I perform 
it." The pace, he said, is largely fueled by request: "I'm always thrilled when 
people ask me to do my stuff. It's like an alcoholic -- I want to do everything 
anybody asks me to." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he does perform compulsively," said fellow performer Eduardo Santiago, 
who collaborated with Alfaro on "Peliculas Prohibidas" ("Forbidden Movies") at 
Power House in 1989. "The most interesting thing about Luis' work is that he 
performs all the time. Any night of the week you'll find him off doing 
something, somewhere. But he doesn't perform out of vanity, to showcase 
himself. After the show, he's not waiting around in the lobby for compliments. 
He's off to another performance." 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro's recent burst of performance activity follows several quiet years 
behind the scenes, studying acting with Michael Kearns and Scott Kelman. Alfaro 
said he spent many years at the Wallenboyd, a now-defunct downtown theater, 
"working on technical stuff: lighting design, stage managing, watching other 
people work. So I had a long gestation period. Now that I'm not studying with 
anybody, the training really comes from being onstage. It's also great training 
for me to able to write quickly -- and get the work out." 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown" has taken far longer to create. It's been in the making for seven 
months. A solo paean to Alfaro's growing up in the Pico-Union District, it is a 
montage of urban rhythms, movement and characters (eight in all, including tour 
guide Smiley, seamstress Lupe, the junkie and the father). 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro, whose works usually develop in the form of a short story or poem, 
performed earlier versions of "Downtown" during the year; the final version, he 
said, has "four new characters and a lot of new text." 
</P>
<P>
It also contains a segment about himself -- a persona and voice he generally 
avoids in performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually do the investigation through other characters," said Alfaro, 29, who 
includes in his performance a childhood recollection of his mother furiously 
battering a rat with a broom. "The image is so much the reality of growing up 
in downtown and being poor and living with that kind of desperation." 
</P>
<P>
The memories are not all gloomy, however. A latchkey kid, Alfaro recalls riding 
the bus downtown with his brother every day after school. "We spent our lives 
with people -- not people we necessarily knew -- but in the community, in 
large, open spaces -- and not being afraid of what that means," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His adult perspective has changed somewhat. For the past six months, Alfaro has 
been living in the tranquil high-rise setting of Park La Brea in the Fairfax 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming here was a release from having been robbed so many times, being held up 
in my home," he said with a sigh. "For the last six years, I lived on Sunset 
and Alvarado. I'd go down to Burrito King, walk to Pioneer Market. I'm very 
neighborhoody. I miss the neighbor who'd come over every day with soup, the old 
lady whose trash you'd pick up. Here, you don't talk to your neighbors; it's 
very sterile. I know I have to go back. But it was also a good thing to get 
away, distance myself from it. I think a lot of good writing came from it." 
</P>
<P>
His credits this year include "Smiley and Other Vatos Like Me" at the Los 
Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, "Retablo" at L.A. Contemporary Exhibitions, 
"Learning the Language" at the Saxon-Lee Gallery and "Relationships" at the 
Zeta Collective. Alfaro also has made numerous appearances in other people's 
work (including the acclaimed L.A. Festival entry "The Undead"), readings, 
writings and fund-raising performances for, among others, VIVA Latino Artists

Earlier this year, Alfaro was arrested downtown with a "chain gang" of artists, 
who were protesting the withdrawal of federal funding for the arts. "Part of me 
was really torn by this action of marching into downtown, being arrested at the 
Federal Building," Alfaro said. "A lot of the images I have of downtown are as 
a very nurturing place. In 'Downtown,' I pay homage to it; I speak of the 
buildings as 'big, long, tall, beautiful women.' So the idea of questioning 
power, going back and marching through that neighborhood -- it affected me 
deeply." 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro doesn't shun the mantle of a political agenda, nor does he court it. The 
same goes for his homosexuality. In "Downtown," he tells the story of a Virgin 
Mary figurine that's passed through the family. "At the end, I say, 'I met this 
guy who had a Virgin Mary doll that lit up, and I fell in love' -- and there's 
a naturalness about it. It's like, 'Oh, he fell in love. Oh, he's gay.' I'm not 
holding up a neon sign, throwing it in people's faces. I talk about family, I 
talk about Latino culture, I talk about being gay -- and it's all one big 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro's attraction to words started early. He recalls being the only child in 
his family who'd ask for books for Christmas. He was also a big talker, in 
spite of having to undergo speech therapy for a stutter. After high school, 
Alfaro attended Inner City Cultural Center, and has supported himself with a 
succession of jobs -- most recently working for a labor union and currently 
teaching performance art to grade-schoolers at the Los Angeles Children's 
Museum. "I get fed a lot by the kids," he said earnestly. "It also keeps me 
very contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
And honest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm constantly having to hand myself warning signs, keep myself in check," he 
said of performing. "So much of what I do is internal. So the balance is how to 
get all those things out externally without losing the power they have inside 
of me. I'm dealing with themes that are real important to me: family, the 
culture I'm tied to, the problems I see growing up in an urban environment. A 
lot of the work is getting that stuff out without making yourself too precious, 
too overbearing. It's also allowing yourself to be ugly -- and vulnerable." 
</P>

"Downtown" plays at 8:30 p.m. Fridays through Sundays at Highways Performance 
Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, through Dec. 9. Tickets are $10. (213)

ART NOTEBOOK: ART VENUES MOVE BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF GALLERY ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISBET NILSON, Nilson writes regularly about art in Westside/Valley 
Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of an art venue that is off the beaten track sounds odd in a city such 
as Los Angeles, where everything is decentralized to begin with. If there are 
any established art routes, they tend to run along La Brea Avenue and La 
Cienega Boulevard and, increasingly, into Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
But there are plenty of alternative forays around. For example, consider the 
following trio of Westside galleries that are off the regular art beat -- to 
some extent by choice. 
</P>
<P>
WALKER DISTANCE: "We didn't want to be too closely associated with the 
mainstream -- the mini-mall and all that," said David Walker of the Walker and 
Walker Gallery, referring to the complex of Santa Monica galleries in the 900 
block of Colorado Avenue. "We figure more people will follow." 
</P>
<P>
Follow, that is, to the end of Berkeley Street in Santa Monica -- an enclave 
already populated by Southern California Institute of Architecture (Sci-Arc) 
and a number of architects' and graphic designers' offices. On Sept. 11, Walker 
and his wife, Darby, opened their gallery there, hoping to distance themselves 
from other galleries by more than just pioneering geography. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're as interested in style as other galleries," David Walker 
said. "We are interested in artists who are pushing beyond the boundaries of 
popular contemporary criticism. And we are definitely taking on a rather 
pluralistic group." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the Walkers don't follow prevailing postmodern art criticism. In 
fact, the couple ran their own art magazine, Element, from 1985 until 1987, 
when their alternative rock band proved more successful. (She plays drums; he 
plays guitar and sings. The band -- named Fifteen Minutes, for the late Andy 
Warhol's measure of fame -- now exists mainly for fun, Walker said.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very conscious of and very interested in what's being said in Art Issues 
and Artforum, but I feel that we got kind of stuck," Walker said. "There's been 
a real dryness in the art world during the last five to six years. I'm 
interested in busting that open." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the Walkers are choosing to represent artists who are hard to pin 
down stylistically. Among them is a local art team called POM, who Walker 
described as a group of five best friends in their 20s. POM's paintings will be 
shown at the gallery in January. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not making art to answer popular criticism -- they're just making 
art," Walker said. "I call it 'in your face.' " 
</P>
<P>
In April, Walker and Walker will open the first U. S. show of paintings by a 
neo-Dadaist Dutch group called DNA, whose members early this year surprised an 
opening-night group of Amsterdam art patrons by dousing gallery lights, 
emerging dressed in coal miners' hats, then painting their finished canvases 
white. 
</P>
<P>
On view now at the gallery is the first Los Angeles show of the thickly worked 
paintings of San Francisco artist Ev Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
But, primarily, the gallery plans to represent local and regional emerging 
artists, who Walker believes must be supported. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that L. A. is a major art center," Walker said. "Los Angeles 
keeps falling into a trap: There are so many good, significant artists working 
here, but so many galleries look to New York and try to pull people out from 
New York -- even if they don't have a big reputation. . . . Los Angeles is 
still second-guessing itself, still looking to other places for validation." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker and Walker Gallery, 1748 Berkeley St., Santa Monica. (213) 829-9505. 
Open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays.

SCULPTURE FOR 50: Since 1976, a diverse group of sculptors known as the 
Sycamore Studio have studied together, shared tools and work premises, and 
mounted occasional group shows. Recently, the group -- which has grown from six 
or seven members to more than 50 -- decided to open its own small gallery at 
its studio in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time for them to have a showcase," said Sycamore Studio director Bob 
Cunningham, who also serves as the group's instructor. "These people have been 
working for quite a long time -- and they're really serious about what they are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
The group was born when Cunningham, who was teaching at Otis Parsons, was 
approached by a handful of students who were "looking for more than just 
classes -- they were looking for a studio situation where they could continue 
their learning on a higher level," Cunningham said. The group began meeting in 
Cunningham's former studio, then rented several other sites together before 
settling in the present Jefferson Boulevard location. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a big variety of aesthetic preferences and development and aptitude," 
said Cunningham, adding that preferred methods run the gamut from clay modeling 
and stone carving to welding and assemblage. The studio space is divided in 
two, with 
</P>
<P>
one area devoted to figurative work done from live models; the rest is 
allocated to individually structured "methods and materials" projects, 
Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sycamore Studio gallery each year will be able to accommodate individual 
shows for 18 of the group's members. In previous years, the studio held group 
shows at the Federal Building and at Angels Gate Cultural Center in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"But it takes a lot of energy to work up a show for so many people," Cunningham 
said. "Having a gallery here simplifies it -- you don't have to move the pieces 
so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Sculpture by Ben Bronson and Lee Jordan through Friday at Sycamore Studio, 
11904 Jefferson Blvd., Culver City. (213) 397-2697. Open from noon to 5 p.m. 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>

SEPIA CREEK: Since it opened in the spring of 1989, the nonprofit Highways has 
made a mark for itself as a locus for multicultural, often political 
performance art. Less well-known is its little visual art gallery, which opens 
an hour before each performance and weekday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly shows are generally tied into themes being explored in the 
performance-art schedule, Highways General Manager Jill Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
At present, in conjunction with the series "Witness L. A./Testigo L. A.," the 
gallery is showing an unusual body of work called "The Ballona Series" by Heidi 
Zin, whose work usually tends toward somewhat romantic pencil drawings and 
watercolors. 
</P>
<P>
These pieces are different. Almost all collaged works on paper, they look 
delicately sepia-toned at first glance. A closer look at a triptych called 
"Here, Drink This," however, reveals that it was done using plastic litter -- 
and swirled creek sludge. 
</P>
<P>
Zin went to Ballona Creek -- the undeveloped stretch of wetland that stretches 
between Marina del Rey and Playa del Rey -- for an early morning walk. She said 
she was amazed at the amount of collective waste deposited there: the mangled 
Styrofoam cups and other discarded plastics, even whole shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
"I could hardly see the water -- it was covered with Styrofoam cups," Zin said. 
"I was so touched that I wanted to do something about it." She picked up some 
cups and brought them back to her studio. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Zin stretched watercolor paper on boards and took them to the site. 
Then, clad in rubber boots and gloves, she dipped the boards into the water, 
lifting the top layer of sludge onto the paper. Zin noted that the resulting 
forms often reflected the motion of the liquid, as if it were a poured 
color-field painting. 
</P>
<P>
She has one or two more pieces she wants to do. But after that, she will 
probably abandon the series, Zin said: She has her health to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Zin, "The Ballona Series: An Oceanic Love Affair," through Friday at 
Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. (213) 453-1755. Open from 10 a.m. to 
noon, and 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays before each Highways 
performance.

ARTS FOR AMATEURS;

<P>
WORKSHOP STUDENTS ACT OUT THEIR FEELINGS TO EXPLORE THE REALITY OF AIDS 
</P>

Tim Miller stretches his students to their limits. 
</P>
<P>
If he isn't having them shake themselves like rag dolls or stretch in odd 
contortions, he's having them instantly act out scenes by shouting: "Be a 
ballerina while singing Italian opera for 14 seconds," or "Grab someone's head 
and shake it gently while telling them what you had for breakfast for eight 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Then, he has them concentrate their thoughts on the AIDS crisis and asks each 
student to pick a spot in a huge warehouse to rehearse and relate personal 
stories. The result is an emotional exercise that provokes laughter, tears, 
chills and warmth for both the storyteller and the audience. 
</P>
<P>
That's just the first day of class. Miller, 32, an avant-garde performance 
artist who has recently been swept into a battle with the National Endowment 
for the Arts, is giving free performance workshops through the end of January 
at Highways Performance Space in the 18th Street Arts Complex in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"These workshops are to focus on the AIDS and HIV crisis, and they are geared 
for a diverse group of people, who are caretakers, friends and people who are 
living with it," Miller said. "Our culture squelches people's stories, and I 
hope this will help people find material that comes from their lives to use in 
their performances." 
</P>
<P>
The workshops are financed by a nine-month, $8,100 grant from the California 
Arts Council and $4,500 more from Highways. Miller was one of four performance 
artists who was recently denied funding from the National Endowment for the 
Arts. The artists filed a lawsuit, claiming discrimination against the 
homosexual content of their art. The state grant, however, is not connected to 
the NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Burnham, manager of the arts complex, said Miller's workshop is "an 
exciting new program for us." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this week, Miller plans a Tuesday evening class specifically for gay 
men to work on performance pieces about homophobia, acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome issues, activism, relationships and sex. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays, two workshops are open to anyone. The Saturday workshops began in 
early November and continue through Jan. 26. A "Living/Moving" class in the 
mornings is for physical and vocal warm-ups and includes guide-visual imagery. 
Miller also encourages people he calls "differently abled" to join in because 
the exercises can be done while seated if someone is in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon workshop called "Performing All Our Lives" is for people who want 
to create their own performance works on how AIDS relates to people's lives. 
Miller is also available on Thursdays by appointment for anyone wanting to 
polish a performance or brainstorm about ideas for shows. 
</P>
<P>
Miller admitted that he was nervous about his first Saturday class becoming a 
bit depressing because of the AIDS focus, but he said it worked because the 
students were so different. The class had a good mix of men and women, various 
racial and ethnic groups, a young man on crutches and people ranging in age 
from their late teens to a man who admitted he "went to high school during the 
Eisenhower Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Peimer, a journalist, said he joined the class "to contribute something 
to an issue that has hit us all in some way." On his first day, Peimer herded 
the class into a dark, cramped room in the back of the warehouse and told a 
gut-wrenching story about a law school friend who died of complications of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Another student in a baseball cap sat on an old dusty couch and talked about 
how he explained to his young daughter that he was HIV-positive. "Sometimes I 
wish it would all go away, just disappear," he said. "It's been rough, I have 
to deal with this without drugs or alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Standing on top of a brick wall and holding onto a pipe, Merry O'Cleary, a film 
location representative and traffic school teacher, spoke softly about a recent 
talk with a police officer who found it difficult to pay a hospital visit to 
his brother, who has AIDS. "His co-workers were teasing him about it, but he 
went," O'Cleary said. 
</P>
<P>
"And for the first time, I saw this hand of authority reaching out to the 
community," she said, making a salute with one hand and reaching her hand out 
with the other. 
</P>
<P>
As a recovering alcoholic who has met many gay men and women in recovery who 
also have AIDS, O'Cleary said she is aware how the disease is devastating the 
community. "At this workshop, I can express what is in my heart in an 
absolutely supportive environment without judgment," said O'Cleary, who has 
spent many years performing. "I have never done an autobiographical piece 
before, and now I realize how hard it is." 
</P>
<P>
O'Cleary said she is excited that her class will lead an all-night vigil Dec. 1 
for the national "Day Without Art," commemorating art achievements and 
recognizing the losses of people who have died of AIDS. One student, Memo 
Sander, said the vigil and the workshops will help people begin to create a 
separate form of art and culture for gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much pain and suppression that myself and my friends are living 
through, and Tim channels it and helps us express it, because even though we 
may have similar sentiments, we all are different and have different needs of 
expression," said Sander, a Turkish-born dancer who wears his hair in a 
bowl-shaped tight-cropped cut modeled from the 1919 German Bauhaus art era. 
</P>
<P>
"The AIDS crisis is an issue that is very much ignored in the art world, and 
with a workshop like this, that will change," Sander said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Miller's four performance workshops meet at Highways Performance Space in 
the 18th Street Arts Complex, 1637 18th St., Santa Monica, from noon to 1:30 
p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. every Saturday, from 6 to 9 p.m. Tuesdays and by 
appointment Thursdays, through Jan. 26. The workshops are free. Call Highways 
at (213) 453-1755.

DRINKING DRIVERS NOW FACE GREATER ARREST RISK; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAW: A 13.8% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE JAILED IN THE COUNTY SINCE 
THE BLOOD-ALCOHOL LIMIT DROPPED TO 0.08% HAS NOT MEANT A SIMILAR RISE IN 
PROSECUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Drunk driving arrests in Ventura County have increased almost 14% this year 
since a new law went into effect lowering the legal blood alcohol level for 
driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the county is only slightly lower than a 16% increase reported 
statewide by the California Highway Patrol, but twice the 7% increase in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Since the new law which lowered the legal intoxication level from 0.10% 
blood-alcohol to 0.08% went into effect Jan. 1, arrests in Ventura County have 
increased by 13.85%, from 2,108 in the first nine months of 1989 to 2,400 in 
the same period of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the increase in arrests has not resulted in a similar increase 
in prosecutions by the Ventura County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office prosecuted 7,614 drunk driving cases last year 
and by Aug. 31 this year had filed 4,907 cases -- roughly the same rate of 
prosecution, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials said the prosecution rate in Ventura County has 
remained stable partly because county prosecutors have always been tough on 
prosecuting drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, drunk drivers also receive 
tougher sentences in Ventura County than in most other counties. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, who as part of a general policy against plea bargaining refuses to 
let drunk drivers plead guilty to lesser charges, said he would like to see the 
legal intoxication limit dropped to 0.00%. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the legal limit was dropped, state, county and local police 
officers in Ventura County sometimes arrested drivers with blood-alcohol levels 
as low as 0.07% and 0.06%. 
</P>
<P>
In other counties such drivers can nearly always plead guilty to reduced 
charges or have their cases dismissed, law enforcement officials said. But here 
the police "know we'll prosecute those cases," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction rate is high. Of the 191 felony drunk driving cases filed in 
1989, 118 have gone to court so far; 113 defendants pleaded guilty, three were 
convicted, two cases were dismissed and four cases were reduced to 
misdemeanors, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Totten said. None were acquitted, said 
Totten, who oversees prosecution of felony drunk driving cases. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1990, 153 cases were filed; 88 of those charged 
pleaded guilty, two were convicted, one case was dismissed for lack of evidence 
and four were reduced to misdemeanors. None was acquitted, Totten said. The 
average prison term was 28.75 months and the average jail sentence was 346 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Sentences in Ventura County are generally stiffer than elsewhere in the state, 
officials said. Judges usually give 48-hour jail terms to first-time drunk 
driving convicts who by law are eligible for a 90-day license restriction 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
Drunk driving convicts in Los Angeles County's Newhall Municipal Court usually 
receive the license restriction instead of jail time, said Pamela Davis 
Springer, the court's deputy district attorney-in-charge. 
</P>
<P>
The tough atmosphere in Ventura County has kept the prosecution rate for drunk 
driving cases stable despite the new law, said county Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward 
F. Brodie, chief of the office's misdemeanor division. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other counties, Brodie said, drunk driving suspects here are not allowed 
to plead guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving with alcohol, or "wet 
reckless," as it is known. 
</P>
<P>
"Counties like L.A. would give you a wet reckless at 0.12%," he said. "But as 
far as we were concerned if the reports indicated driving impairment in the 
field sobriety tests even if the blood-alcohol was below 0.10%, we'd file the 
case. And we won a substantial number of those cases . . . . Juries in our 
county take a hard look at DUI drivers. And we also take a hard look at them." 
</P>
<P>
Brodie said that 5% to 10% of drunk driving cases filed here last year were 
against drivers whose blood-alcohol content was below the then-legal 
intoxication level of 0.10%. 
</P>
<P>
This year, about 2% of the cases in this county are being filed against drivers 
who test below the new level of 0.08%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under a 0.08% it becomes extremely difficult to prove impairment," Brodie 
said. "Below that level you're looking at a lot of people sitting at the 
two-beer level, depending on their weight . . . . We try to weed those cases 
out at the filing stage." 
</P>
<P>
County criminalist Norman Fort said the knowledge that Ventura County has a 
tough approach to drunk driving probably keeps some drinkers off the road, but 
he said society is changing, too, and tolerance of drunk driving is declining 
steadily. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to drink and drive you'd better do it in L.A. County; the odds 
of you being arrested there are much less," said Fort, who oversees 
blood-alcohol testing for the sheriff's crime lab. "And the odds of you being 
prosecuted here are much higher. We don't take plea bargains; we don't take wet 
reckless as a plea or dry reckless like they do in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Public Defender Jean Farley said the atmosphere of intolerance may 
drive some people with defensible cases to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Farley worked as a deputy public defender from 1978 to 1986 in Orange County, 
where she said drunk driving charges often were reduced to wet reckless. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, she said, private attorneys often visit the public 
defender's office for insight on their clients' drunk driving cases. 
</P>
<P>
When the lawyers learn the district attorney is dead serious about prosecuting 
even the low-level cases, they're shocked, Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's tough prosecution policies drew criticism from Mark S. Borrell, 
president of the Ventura County Criminal Defense Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"In Santa Barbara the district attorneys are interested in talking about cases, 
trying to work out cases and reach dispositions that seem appropriate," said 
Borrell, who defends drunk driving suspects here and in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
"Down here in Ventura, essentially, once a case has been filed nobody wants to 
talk about it any more, so it goes to trial . . . . We have a court system 
that's already overloaded, and forcing cases to trial only adds fuel to that 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
Borrell also blamed Bradbury's stated no plea-bargaining policy for some of the 
court's backlog. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradbury said tougher courtrooms mean safer streets. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've tried to do for a long time is change this perception that you can 
drink and still be safe to drive," Bradbury said. "The scientific and medical 
data now indicates that you're an unsafe driver at 0.04%." 
</P>
<P>
Felony Supervisor Totten said the office's hard-nosed attitude is meant to 
shake even the most irredeemable alcoholics' beliefs about drinking and 
driving. 
</P>

"For a person to change his behavior and go dry, he has to hit bottom, and we 
like to think that one of the things that criminal prosecution does is raise 
the bottom for people," Totten said. "Where there are still that hard-core 
group that will continue to drink, regardless, a lot of people who do get sent 
to prison are going to change their behavior."

NURSES, PATIENTS FEEL THE PAIN OF SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGET CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: WITH THE RANKS OF PROFESSIONALS REDUCED, SOME MINOR MEDICAL 
EMERGENCIES AT SCHOOLS ARE BEING HANDLED BY SECRETARIES AND CLERKS.

Patricia Contini, the only staff nurse in the 3,500-student Fillmore Unified 
School District, was at her office recently when she got a call about an 
injured student at a school eight miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school student had run into a wall during recess and was 
complaining that her shoulder hurt. 
</P>
<P>
School officials called Contini, who advised that the girl's arms be put in 
slings while help was sought. But officials at the school didn't have the 
training or equipment to do it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been the more practical response, but because I wasn't there 
it wasn't done," Contini said. 
</P>
<P>
The student, whom Contini declined to identify, walked out of the school 
holding her arms to support her injured shoulders. She was taken to a doctor by 
her mother and later diagnosed with two fractured shoulder blades. 
</P>
<P>
Contini said the incident demonstrates the need for more school nurses. "That 
was one of several scenarios when I wished to heck I was at that school," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, about 50 school nurses serve more than 110,000 students in 20 
school districts, according to the Ventura County School Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
And the nurses' ranks are shrinking as public school funding dries up. 
</P>
<P>
Like nurses in other school districts in the county, Contini says she cannot 
treat all of the students she is supposed to serve. But at least most districts 
have at least one nurse on staff. Two districts, Santa Paula Elementary and 
Ojai Unified, have none. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, minor medical emergencies are handled by school secretaries or clerks, 
usually trained in basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Their 
duties also include notifying parents when their children are hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Kessler, Santa Paula's director of special services, said that the 
district has three CPR-trained health aides who serve seven schools and that 
each has at least six years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Smidt, superintendent of the Ojai Unified district, said the district 
has tried to provide emergency training to as many employees as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we're really providing a good response in terms of emergencies," Smidt 
said. "It's working well, and one of the reasons it's working well is we have a 
lot of folks alert to any particular problems." 
</P>
<P>
In districts with no nurses on staff, medical duties sometimes are performed by 
nurses on contract from the county school superintendent's office and paperwork 
is done by clerical aides. 
</P>
<P>
In the Simi Valley Unified School District, whose 11-member nursing program was 
considered a model and used as a training ground for new school nurses from Cal 
State Northridge, five nurses were laid off last spring as a result of $8 
million in budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, Camarillo's Pleasant Valley School District had only one 
school nurse, district Health Supervisor Jacqui Pease, who made the rounds at 
13 schools housing the district's 6,500 students. The district hired another 
full-time nurse this fall, Pease said. 
</P>
<P>
School nurses are required by the state to test vision and hearing and check 
for scoliosis, a disease that curves the spine and sometimes affects teen-age 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses or their assistants must also keep track of student immunization 
records, said Wana Klasen, school nurse at Channel Islands High School and 
co-president of the county school nurses group. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the demands of school nursing, the education requirements are 
high, Klasen said. Registered nurses who work in hospitals are not required to 
have college degrees, but school nurses must have bachelor's degrees, be RNs 
and have credentials from the state Department of Education, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole image of the school nurse as someone who sits there and hands out 
Band-Aids has really, really changed," said Klasen, who sees between 35 and 40 
students a day at the 2,800-student school. "That's a heavy caseload. They come 
in for everything you can think of -- health counseling, emotional counseling, 
first aid of course. Or they may be ill with the flu and need to be sent home." 
</P>
<P>
Klasen's district, the six-school Oxnard Union High School District, is one of 
the few in the county with a nurse at every school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most districts require parents to sign forms indicating how they can be reached 
in an emergency. Or, if a parent can't be reached, the form gives medical 
authorities permission to perform emergency procedures. 
</P>
<P>
In rare cases, a hospital might not accept the district's parental consent form 
but require a parent to be present when emergency treatment is given. In those 
instances, a court order would be obtained to treat the child, officials at 
several districts said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Everhart, a secretary at Santa Paula's Barbara Webster Elementary School, 
said she takes care of students' minor cuts and scrapes almost daily; less 
frequently, she must seek treatment for students with more serious injuries, 
such as fractures. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel qualified to handle all of the emergencies I've had thus far, and thank 
goodness we haven't had anything of a life-threatening nature," said Everhart. 
</P>
<P>
Everhart said she has authority to administer medication to children with 
written permission from their parents and permission and instructions from the 
family doctor. However, she said some secretaries are uneasy about 
administering injections to students allergic to bee stings because they have 
not been trained to use syringes. 
</P>
<P>
"However, in most cases if this should happen you would have a child's life in 
your hands. . . ," Everhart said. "They could die within 10 minutes or stop 
breathing. It really bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, as a result of $8 million in cutbacks, all of the nurses at the 
elementary level have been eliminated, said Assistant Supt. Allan Jacobs. 
However, the district's other five nurses still provide the same coverage to 
other schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the district's nurses are on call to respond to emergencies at 
elementary schools, Jacobs said. Minor elementary school injuries are handled 
by principals or secretaries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us were very sorry we had to do away with a nursing program that was 
outstanding," Jacobs said. "Obviously, it would be better to have a nurse full 
time on each campus, and it would be better to have more nurses, but in the 
scheme of things we have to do what we can to meet our budget." 
</P>
<P>
The district has rehired two of the laid-off nurses under special anti-drug 
grant programs, and two others are doing part-time vision testing in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Another former Simi Valley school nurse, Sandra Holmgren, is program specialist 
for health services and education in the Ventura Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling when the layoffs took place in Simi was that the children were 
being given short shrift," Holmgren said. "It was just a very good program and 
all of that was lost." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, Holmgren supervises five nurses, including full-time nurses at both 
Buena and Ventura high schools. 
</P>
<P>
During a typical, recent workday, Fillmore's Contini visited three schools for 
consultations and made three home visits, including two trips to deliver 
clothing that she purchased from the Salvation Army for needy students. 
</P>
<P>
"Our role as nurses is extremely vast," Contini said. "It's a lot like being a 
social worker. I don't spend a lot of time on first aid." 
</P>
<P>
But Contini, who, like several other county school nurses, gave up hospital 
work for school nursing, said she has no regrets about the trade-off. 
</P>
<P>
"I love what I do," Contini said. "I like this environment. I have a lot of 
autonomy. I have great ability to impact a lot of people, and I think that's 
wonderful."

PIONEER FAMILY WALKING AWAY FROM SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: A PROSPEROUS FARM COUPLE'S DECISION TO SELL LANDMARK PROPERTY REFLECTS 
THEIR DISCONTENT WITH THE CHANGE THAT HAS COME TO VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
Why would Allan and Linda Ayers, a couple of farm kids who married 20 years 
ago, want to sell Ventura County's Landmark No. 1, shut down their flourishing 
pumpkin business and leave town? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mystery to us all," a friend said recently as she watched Allan Ayers 
coax his team of Clydesdales around the playground of a school where he was 
giving free hayrides. 
</P>
<P>
The couple would seem to have it all: the deep roots of a pioneer farm family, 
cash flow from the booming Ayers Pumpkin Patch and Christmas Tree Farm and a 
homestead so picturesque that TV and motion picture companies have rented it 
nearly 100 times. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going great guns," Linda Ayers said in an interview at Faulkner 
House, a classic 18-room Victorian built by Allan's great-grandfather and 
restored by the couple since they bought it in 1982. "It's just faster than we 
want to go anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"I think of it as walking away from success," Allan Ayers said. 
</P>
<P>
Their decision to sell and move to the vast, empty high plains of northeastern 
New Mexico also reflects a general discontent with the change that has come to 
Ventura County over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're rural people. It's not rural here anymore," Allan Ayers said. "It's nice 
to be somewhere where the only sounds are the birds and the insects and the 
wind." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it was in Ventura County when George Washington Faulkner, an 
immigrant from Ohio, bought his 150-acre farm near Santa Paula in 1879 and when 
he built his splendid 8,000-square-foot Queen Anne Victorian home in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
It was still that way when Allan Ayers was growing up on a farm next door in 
the 1950s, before the nearby Santa Paula Freeway cut a swath through the 
peaceful Santa Clara River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"There was just nothing here. This was a farm road," Ayers said, motioning 
toward Telegraph Road, on which his farm fronts. 
</P>
<P>
"I romanticize about the way it used to be," he said. "People here were 
farmers. Now people buy small blocks and live out in the country and that's 
fine. But we get kind of lonely" for other farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers might not see the changes, since the old Faulkner farm -- an ornate 
house and two red barns on 27 acres -- is flanked by open fields and orchards 
and blessed with a mountain backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
But the ceaseless shift from farm to city life was enough to prompt Allan, 46, 
and Linda, 45, to list the homestead for sale in late 1989. Their price is now 
$2.35 million. They say that even if the property sold soon it would take 
another two years for them to find a new home and relocate with their 
10-year-old daughter, Alison, to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
As the couple sat on a love seat in their homey living room, surrounded by the 
warm floral patterns and rich woodwork of another era, they didn't seem eager 
to go just yet. 
</P>
<P>
ey talked of family history -- the love letters of great-grandparents, an Ayers 
ancestor who was among this country's first Methodist ministers -- and the 
wanderlust that led great-grandfather Faulkner to buy ranches in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Even before they move, life is slowing down and getting better, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan, who at 6 feet, 10 inches towers over even his outsized Clydesdale draft 
team, said he is happier than he has been for years because farm operations -- 
pared from 200 acres to 27 -- are so manageable. 
</P>
<P>
The streamlined business has also allowed Ayers to return to teaching after an 
eight-year absence. The fourth- and fifth-graders in his class at Poinsettia 
Elementary School in Ventura bring out the best in him, he said. Some of the 
students refer to him as the Big Friendly Giant, or BFG, after the character in 
children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
The couple are also making arrangements for next year's pumpkin patch, the 
business whose success has made it financially possible for them to walk away. 
A kind of country fair, it features huge pumpkins, hayrides, farm animals and a 
Dixieland band while drawing more than 40,000 people each October. Dozens of 
old friends work there during the season, adding to the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to give a party and have 40,000 people come to it," Allan said. 
"People sometimes talk down their nose at what we do here. Then they come out 
and see it, and they change their minds." 
</P>
<P>
People he hardly knows have told Ayers that they hope he can't sell the farm, 
so the pumpkin patch will not die, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the success of that 17-year-old business, along with the recent completion 
of an eight-year restoration of Faulkner House, helped convince the couple that 
it is time to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to leave with no regrets, with nothing left unfinished," said Linda 
Ayers, who has helped manage the farm and has overseen restoration of the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
At times during the 1980s, five craftsmen labored simultaneously to fix up the 
landmark at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
The home came to the couple in 1982 like an old, distinguished relative they 
had never really known but who needed care in old age. 
</P>
<P>
The house had deteriorated while Allan's great-uncle, George S. Faulkner, lived 
there until he died in 1981 at age 95. 
</P>
<P>
The Ayerses needed the farmland and barns, which they had leased as part of 
their business, so they bought the estate from the rest of their relatives. And 
the house -- then a faded mustard color on the outside and green on the inside 
-- came with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strictly business," said Allan, who had visited his great-uncle's house 
on holidays as a child but had no sentimental attachment to it. "But we didn't 
feel right having it and not doing right by it. It's a wonderful house and 
deserves the care we've given it." 
</P>
<P>
Even before it was restored, Faulkner House had been honored as the county's 
first designated landmark in 1968. Recently, it was nominated by the state for 
national landmark status. 
</P>
<P>
The house is also comfortable -- so spacious that when they first moved there, 
toddler Alison would crawl away and get lost in it, and convenient for Allan 
because he doesn't have to bend to get through its seven-foot doorways. 
</P>
<P>
But the restoration is done, and "we've seen the pumpkin patch through," Linda 
Ayers said. "So this move comes at a very good time for us." 
</P>
<P>
"You do something and you enjoy it," Allan said. "Then you move on to something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
They will do that in the shadow of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, south of the 
Colorado border in northeastern New Mexico, where the Great Plains meet the 
rocky spine of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
That new life may not include farming. "People who've never farmed get 
nostalgic about farming," Allan said. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape of ranches and farms hard against the mountains reminds him of 
Faulkner Farm, Allan said. But there are very few people there. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the beauty of it," he said.

CONVENTION CENTER WRAPS UP 1ST YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
NEW LANDMARK: FACILITY'S STAFF FINDS THAT UTILITY BILLS WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN 
EXPECTED; ALSO, EXPANSION IS ALREADY BEING STUDIED. 
</P>

<P>
The $161-million San Diego Convention Center celebrates its first anniversary 
this weekend, a year in which the huge, bayside structure became an instant 
landmark and community focal point. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1.1 million people attended events there, and the number of trade 
shows, conventions and local activities -- from weddings and meetings to 
banquets and seminars -- totaled 354, an amount industry officials say is 
unprecedented for a center's maiden year. 
</P>
<P>
The Convention Center has helped businesses around it, in the Gaslamp Quarter, 
Seaport Village and Horton Plaza, and expectations are that, as the center 
becomes better known, the number of dollar-spending tourists and locals will 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
It's estimated, for example, that the more than 250,000 out-of-town delegates 
who attended the 49 conventions and trade shows in the center's initial year 
spent nearly $226 million, the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
By all those measurements and others, the center has been a success. But those 
achievements, although not guaranteed, were expected. Part of the center's 
first-year story were the surprises, the things no one could predict because 
the building lacked a track record. 
</P>
<P>
Like living in a new house or buying a new pair of shoes, it took a while to 
break in the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
What officials found out over the course of a year was that the expense of 
operating the large structure was much higher than anyone had guessed. 
</P>
<P>
Mundane but costly things such as turning on the lights and air conditioning in 
some months were close to 40% more than what officials had budgeted. That was 
not good news for a facility whose operating budget is in the red. 
</P>
<P>
They also learned that the center lost more money than it made when it was 
rented for events that drew 300 people or fewer. "We've found it costs us more 
to turn on the lights" than the event pays for, said Donna Alm, spokeswoman for 
the San Diego Convention Center Corp., the nonprofit agency in charge of 
operating the center. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a new strategy for next year that anticipates, in part, having 
fewer events but ones that pay more. 
</P>
<P>
And experience has shown that, even though the structure is striking 
architecturally, some elements could have been designed better. There is no 
direct way, for example, to get to the bayside mezzanine level from the front 
of the center. It takes a long escalator ride up, directions from a few 
strategically posted ushers and then an elevator trip down to reach the 
mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
The 40,000-square-foot lobby is too small for some events, office space is 
cramped, and there are too few traffic lanes at the front entrance, where it 
gets congested with cars, buses and taxicabs. 
</P>
<P>
None of the flaws are considered fatal, and officials have found ways to 
overcome them -- or at least make them less troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most significant thing officials learned firsthand was something 
they suspected from the beginning: expansion -- most likely doubling exhibit 
space -- is a top priority. The need, according to Carroll Armstrong, the 
center's marketing director, is "dire" if the center is to meet growing exhibit 
space demands in the convention and trade show industry. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, he said, when the facility was being designed and constructed, 
groups interested in coming to San Diego were happy with the center's 254,000 
square feet of main exhibit space, plus the other 100,000 outside under a 
sail-like Teflon roof, but were worried about having enough hotel rooms nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the concerns have reversed, he said, and convention and trade show 
exhibitors are wary there will be sufficient exhibit space in the near future 
to accommodate out-of-towners staying in what is fast approaching an adequate 
number of hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Convention Center officials have advertised for consultants to begin exploring 
the expansion issue. The politically tough questions of who will pay for it and 
when an expansion can occur are expected to begin surfacing publicly next year. 
Others say such an effort is premature. 
</P>
<P>
The true cost of the new center is open to interpretation. According to figures 
supplied by San Diego Unified Port District, which paid for the facility, it 
cost $161.1 million to construct and outfit the 1.75-million-square-foot 
structure, including payments to contractors, architects, engineers and others. 
</P>
<P>
But, a few months ago, the Port District agreed to pay $11.2 million to hotel 
developer Doug Manchester, who sued because the two years' delay in 
constructing the center hurt business at his adjacent Marriott Hotel &amp; 
Marina. 
</P>
<P>
And the Port District is now faced with a $48-million lawsuit filed by the 
center's builder, the joint venture of Tutor-Saliba-Perini, in a dispute over 
design and construction changes. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Convention Center's operating budget the first year, it had a 
shortfall of about $530,000, with both revenues and expenses running higher 
than had been expected. It was anticipated that the operating budget would be 
in the red until the center's third year, when, it is projected, the center 
will break even. 
</P>
<P>
Center officials are holding to that projection, though they are making changes 
on the road to self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The goal the first year, Armstrong said, was on quantity, to have as many 
events as possible. That goal was achieved, even though officials were 
chagrined to discover that they lost money on some of the smaller events. In 
response, Armstrong said, the second-year goal is to increase revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that strategy calls for streamlining the booking system. The object is 
to take several of the smaller events and schedule them in different parts of 
the center on the same day, thereby spreading staff and utility expenses over a 
wider base of renters. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the profit better for the center, but it will keep costs down for 
the smaller groups, Armstrong said. The buzzword for this is yield management. 
</P>
<P>
"We want more bucks and to work smarter," he said. "We want to operate as 
effectively and efficiently as we possibly can and still be all things for all 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The center is also reviewing its rental rates, already the highest per net 
square foot on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The center is trying to see what it can do about its high utility expenses. 
Officials, for example, budgeted $125,000 a month for utilities, but some 
months the costs ran as high as $170,000, or nearly 40% over budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to find out how we can cut back on that or whether that's the way 
it's going to be," said Armstrong, adding that talks are going on with 
SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
In going for quality over quantity, Convention Center officials believe they 
will have fewer events the second year but make more money. They think they 
will be getting more "high-quality" conventions for one thing, which bring in 
more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The big challenge facing exposition facilities today is to quantify business 
to determine which events are the most profitable and desirable," said Tom 
Liegler, the center's general manager, in a prepared statement. "In short, we 
may provide the venue for fewer events but derive more financial impact. This 
means there will be less overhead, hopefully reducing our overall costs and 
bringing us closer to a positive bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons why there may be only half as many events as in the 
inaugural year. The trendiness of the facility is expected to wane, and the 
plan to consolidate several smaller events into a single day may lead to some 
drop-off. 
</P>
<P>
The more ominous sign, however, is an increasingly skittish convention and 
meeting industry. Talk of recession is making some Convention Center clients 
tentative, and already there have been two major cancellations in early 1991, 
including one by Mobil Oil. 
</P>
<P>
A full-scale retreat would not only harm the center but downtown businesses. 
Although none of the restaurant, bars, hotels or retail stores interviewed are 
yet dependent on convention business, it's clear they are expecting such 
business to play an increasingly important role. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Woodside, owner of the 515 5th Avenue restaurant in the Gaslamp Quarter, 
said the business her small, gourmet eatery received last January from the 
Action Sports Retailers' convention accounted for the best week she ever had. 
</P>
<P>
Her experience is similar to that of several others. Some weeks convention 
business is great, and at other times, when no large shows are in town, there 
is barely a trickle of business. Part of the lesson of year one of the 
Convention Center is learning to anticipate the business flow. 
</P>
<P>
"As time goes on, it (Convention Center business) will be a significant part of 
my business," Woodside said. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Kovar is a partner in the Cabo Cabo Grill, a seafood Mexican restaurant 
and bar built in an old trolley barn at 203 5th St., the closest restaurant to 
the center. When asked what impact the center has had on the grill, Kovar 
replied: "It's kind of like the difference between Vietnam and Cabo San Lucas. 
It's had a major impact from the git-go." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kovar said his base is among the locals, the Convention Center 
business is giving his restaurant more financial "breathing room." 
</P>
<P>
Farther from the center, at Reidy O'Neil's restaurant on 4th Avenue near 
Broadway, the impact has been less dramatic, though still felt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an irregular flow," said Michael McDade, a partner in the restaurant and 
head of the Gaslamp Quarter Planning Board. "It's like you're having a slow 
night, and then 49 people walk in the door. That kind of stuff is hard to 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely is not the panacea some people predicted," McDade said. "It's a 
nice increment but not enough to make or break a business." 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Croce, owner of popular Croce's restaurant, said "there's no question 
that, when conventions are here, we feel it . . . but it's not consistent yet." 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter as a whole, with its transients and street people, still is 
a pockmarked melange of vacant and boarded up storefronts standing next to 
thriving restaurants, bars with live entertainment and new apartments. 
</P>
<P>
At Horton Plaza, four blocks from the center, out-of-town conventioneers have 
had a mixed impact. Volker Schmitz, general manager of California Cafe, said 
his lunch business in particular has increased 15% to 20% when large 
conventions are in San Diego. "Although it's a bit of a roller-coaster right 
now, I think it's only going to get busier over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Some shops that don't feature food, drink or entertainment have seen increased 
numbers of people coming into their stores, but not necessarily more spending. 
"We've had more traffic-wise than dollar-wise," said Christina Bremner, manager 
of Williams-Sonoma Inc., which sells gourmet kitchen products and cookware. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Queisser, marketing director of the Marriott Hotel &amp; Marina next to 
the Convention Center, said that, in the last year, occupancy levels have 
remained flat though sales at the hotel have increased by 12%. He attributes 
the increase to the center and higher "quality" convention groups who spend 
more money. "It's a very positive situation, and we're really happy." 
</P>
<P>
While the center prepares for its second year of operation, it also is getting 
ready for the possibility of hosting the Republican National Convention in 
1992. The center is on a short list of potential cites being evaluated by GOP 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
City and Convention Center officials say the Republicans will have to pay to 
underwrite the convention, because they can't afford to subsidize it. 
</P>
<P>
When the Convention Center was being built, center officials said they didn't 
want to host a national convention of Democrats or Republicans because it was a 
money-loser. The reasons were plentiful: The facility would have to be closed 
for several weeks before, during and after the convention; the summer date 
would hit hotels and motels during the city's peak tourist season; the whole 
ordeal, in short, was more hassle than it was worth. 
</P>
<P>
But today, city and Convention Center officials have formed a uniform wall 
behind Mayor Maureen O'Connor's effort to woo the Republicans. Privately, 
though, some officials still hold to their initial misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
Another old problem that might again haunt the center in the coming year is the 
debacle over attempts to rename the center after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The 
effort by blacks and the Urban League to rename the facility led to an 
emotionally and racially charged debate that lasted for several weeks and fell 
one vote short at the Board of Port Commissioners. Some blacks protested last 
year's Nov. 24 opening and called for a boycott of the center, which has had no 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
The National Urban League, for example, is still scheduled to hold its national 
gathering at the center. 
</P>
<P>

DOWN WITH BLIMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So a London-based business group wants to splash our skies with 23 blimps to 
advertise for their clients ("UFO With a Message," Nov. 18). The blimps rent 
for a quarter of a million dollars a month! Which companies can afford such an 
amount for a mere portion of their advertising budgets? 
</P>
<P>
* The auto industry, which already has us all advertising their wares for them 
-- for free -- every time we use our vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
* The oil industry, such as Exxon. If they can't ruin our view with offshore 
oil wells and oil spills, they'll get our views somehow. 
</P>
<P>
* The tobacco industry, which is just dying to get to our young children. (They 
would do well to realize that the latest figures show that the number of 
smokers in the state of California is now down to 20.4%. For every one person 
lighting up, four people are glowering at them.) 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, Sea World tried a blimp out on us, and we could see the 
grinning teeth of the passengers as they swung very slowly over our gardens, 
invading our privacy from the air. We weren't happy about that, said so and Sea 
World, to its credit, backed down. 
</P>
<P>
On the odd day that I can lie out and enjoy my garden, gaze at the sky whilst 
smelling the roses, I'm hanged if I want to see a bunch of yobbos grinning 
back, or some creepy depiction of a desert animal advertising a product to 
which I am horrendously allergic. 
</P>
<P>
Any blimp that gets between me and the hard-earned view from my home, thus 
imposing advertising on me, will have those products advertised boycotted by 
me.

PROP. C FALLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While generally accurate and fair, The Times' article on the Proposition C 
aftermath ("Animal Advocates Unbowed by Defeat," Nov. 15) contains an 
inflammatory quote certain to leave a wrong impression. 
</P>
<P>
In the story, a Los Angeles "animal activist" called vivisectors to task, 
describing them in derogatory terms. 
</P>
<P>
The article then connected the quoted woman to the San Diego coalition opposing 
Proposition C. 
</P>
<P>
The woman quoted was not a part of the San Diego County coalition to defeat 
Proposition C, and was not authorized to speak for that coalition or for San 
Diego-based Stop Taking Our Pets. It is unfortunate that the article did not 
make that clear. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of Proposition C was and is pound seizure -- pets in research -- not 
the broader issue of vivisection and its practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, there were plenty of quotable anti-Proposition C people available 
locally without going so far afield for opinions on a San Diego County Issue.

NO REASON TO RUSH DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL COULD LOSE THE CHANCE TO CONTROL PLANS FOR NORTHERN-FRINGE RESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, the San Diego City Council's vote on the future of the 
12,000-acre urban reserve appears to have accomplished a number of long-held 
city land-use goals. 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy approved Monday, the expanse of land in the city's northern 
fringes would hold 4,000 homes at most, the kind of low-density development for 
which San Diegans have long been clamoring. 
</P>
<P>
The city's undeniable need for open space would be met by the thousands of 
acres developers will be required to donate in order to build in the reserve. 
One builder proposes to give the city 3,000 acres of open space (although 
nearly 1,000 acres would be golf courses, not the unspoiled hillsides that most 
of us consider open space). 
</P>
<P>
And who could oppose the requirement that 20% of the homes be affordable by 
people earning $25,000 or less? 
</P>
<P>
But in rushing to guarantee low-density housing throughout the area, the 
council appears to have lost track of what the land was intended to be -- a 
reserve for the future expansion of the city when there is nowhere left to 
build, not an enclave primarily for the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
A region of low-density, low-traffic development might be advantageous, if 
affordable and even low-income homes were mixed in among larger homes and lots. 
But given builders' recent history of producing primarily high-end homes, we 
remain skeptical until we see how this will be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
The city also will lose the chance to plan the area -- designing communities 
containing a mix of housing types, commercial developments and employment 
centers for the day when ever-scarcer developable land pushes the city into the 
reserve. That philosophy is designed to prevent the need for long commutes 
across this huge city. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the policy don't want to risk losing the donated open space. But 
the city's own planners believe that, in the future, ever-rising housing prices 
outside the reserve will make it economically attractive for builders to 
construct a variety of housing types within it and still give up the open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Would voters, given the authority under the 1985 Managed Growth Initiative to 
approve higher-density projects, do so? Probably not today, and not in the near 
future. But in years to come, when housing prices outside the reserve have 
escalated, that may not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
In passing that initiative, voters believed that they were giving themselves 
the right to approve or reject projects in the reserve. Because of a zoning 
regulation on the books before 1985, the council technically may not need their 
approval for projects zoned at one home per four acres. But it would be 
violating at least the spirit of the initiative to allow them. 
</P>
<P>
We urge the council to reconsider this blanket policy when it comes back for 
final approval, or to take a go-slow approach as each project comes before it. 
After all, what's the rush?

The article "3 Guilty of Rigging Superfund Toxic Tests" (Nov. 14) points out 
the fallacy of paying a contractor an incentive to meet U.S. Environmental

The "accountant mentality" used by government procurement officers to reduce

PARTNER'S LAND DEAL WAS AIDED BY MAYOR; 
</P>
<P>
LANCASTER: WILLIAM PURSLEY ACKNOWLEDGES HIS ROLE IN GETTING THE CITY COUNCIL TO 
CHANGE A DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENT BUT SAYS HE DID NOTHING WRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster Mayor William Pursley pushed the city to change a development 
requirement last June for land owned by a business partner, which the partner 
said helped him sell the property and also earned a commission for the real 
estate office where Pursley works. 
</P>
<P>
City records show Pursley introduced and voted on a City Council item June 18 
to reduce an easement along one edge of the nearly one-acre parcel, located at 
the northeast corner of Avenue M and 4th Street East. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster insurance broker Clyde Golding, an owner of the property and also 
Pursley's business partner, said the reduction made "a major difference" in 
completing the sale of the property, which was already in escrow. The city had 
sought the easement for a traffic acceleration lane. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires elected officials to avoid participating in or voting on 
decisions having a "material financial effect" on their financial interests. 
State regulations define those interests to include sources of income, such as 
employers, and business partners who have the type of relationship that exists 
between Pursley and Golding. The two are equal partners in an unrelated real 
estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley, who already is the subject of a state inquiry for failing to disclose 
at least several hundred thousand dollars of his income last year, acknowledged 
his role in the council action but said he did nothing wrong. The mayor also 
said he could not remember who sought his aid but is certain it was not 
Golding. 
</P>
<P>
Golding, however, said he asked the mayor for help while the two men were at a 
golf course. He said he believed the easement would have cut about $15,000 from 
the sale price because it would have reduced the size of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was handled through Mid Valley Real Estate, a Lancaster agency Pursley 
co-founded and has continued to work for since he sold his interest several 
years ago. The parcel sold for $242,955, according to the county assessor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
When escrow closed in early August, Mid Valley received a $22,177 commission, 
said Charla Abbott, the agent who handled the sale. Abbott said she received a 
$8,234 share of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley appointed Abbott to the city's Parks, Recreation and Arts Commission 
shortly after his election in March 1989. She is also president of the Antelope 
Valley Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the state's political watchdog agency, the 
Fair Political Practices Commission, confirmed its rules against conflict of 
interest by politicians. But Michioku said the commission was not aware of any 
actions Pursley might have taken on behalf of Golding and therefore could not 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku said the FPPC is still reviewing Pursley's failure to disclose all of 
his economic interests. At the behest of the FPPC, the mayor filed a new 
statement last month listing previously unreported sales commission income and 
other interests. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the Golding transaction was a demand by city officials that he and 
his partners give up a 14-foot-wide strip of land along 4th Street that could 
be used as an acceleration lane for traffic coming from Avenue M. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted in February to approve development standards in the area 
that included acceleration and deceleration lanes at various intersections, 
including the one at Golding's property. 
</P>
<P>
City Public Works Director Jeff Long said his department was originally 
approached by representatives of the owners but had refused to change the 
easement. Sometime later, Long said, he was called to a meeting with former 
City Manager Steve West and Pursley and asked to review the department's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Pursley then placed the issue on the agenda as a "special 
item," which can be added after the regular agenda is set. Because the item was 
rushed, public works staff didn't have time to prepare a formal report, Long 
said. Instead, Long gave the council diagrams of the site and discussed the 
situation with council members at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Although Long said the department did not change its position, he did discuss 
the option of reducing the easement to four feet. Pursley and three other 
council members voted for the reduction. The fifth member, Arnie Rodio, was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was important, Golding said, because the price the buyer, Farmers 
Insurance Exchange, had agreed to was based on a formula tied to the square 
footage of the site. The more land the city took for road purposes, the lower 
the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
"It made the difference in my own opinion between being a good and a bad 
business transaction," said Golding, who is chairman of the board of Antelope 
Valley Bank. His business, Antelope Valley Insurance Agency, has served as the 
city of Lancaster's insurance broker for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Golding said he wasn't aware of the easement when he struck his deal with 
Farmers. He said he believed the 10 additional feet could have reduced the 
sales price by about $15,000. "I wanted the dollar value up to the original 
commitment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to real estate records, Golding and his partners bought the property 
in September, 1989, for $150,000. The deed shows that Golding and his wife had 
a half interest, as did his daughter and son-in-law, Craig Carlton. Farmers is 
now starting to build a 6,400-square-foot claims office on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Golding and Abbott, in interviews with The Times, said the city did not need to 
take so much land. Golding said he might not have sold the parcel if the 
council had not reduced the easement because the price would have been too low. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley told The Times he thought owners of other land in the area had asked 
him to reduce the easement for Golding. At the time of the council vote, 
Pursley said he knew Golding owned the property and that it was in escrow. But 
he said, "I never got a call from Golding." 
</P>
<P>
Pursley said his other recollections of how and why he brought the item to the 
council were fuzzy. Pursley said he did meet with Long, but he doesn't remember 
what was said. The mayor said he had originally informed the Mid Valley office 
that Golding was looking to sell his land. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have thought there was any conflict, I would have abstained" from 
the council vote, Pursley said. "I don't feel I did anything wrong. I had no 
ulterior motives. My sole concern was to satisfy the total project" area where 
the city had set development standards. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley and his wife and Golding have been 50-50 partners in a real estate 
venture, Purgold Properties, since 1985, according to the mayor's economic 
interest statements. At the time of the council vote, Pursley and Golding said, 
Purgold held a trust deed on property sold in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
That property, about one acre, is near a Lancaster industrial park. It was sold 
for at least $350,000, according to real estate records. Pursley and Golding 
also had other prior shared property ownerships. Campaign records show Golding 
contributed $1,000 to Pursley's 1989 campaign for office.

6% OF PRESCHOOLERS AT DETROIT HOSPITAL WERE EXPOSED TO CRACK SMOKE, STUDY FINDS

<TEXT>
<P>
A study has found that 6% of young children treated at a Detroit hospital had 
cocaine in their systems, fueling concern that secondhand drug smoke harms 
infants, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Norman Rosenberg, chief of emergency medical services at Children's 
Hospital of Michigan, said his findings may be the first effort to determine 
the rate of children's exposure to smoke from crack, the highly addictive, 
smokable form of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing official has ever been published," he said. "Everyone I have talked to 
says it (evidence of exposure) is extraordinarily high." 
</P>
<P>
Since October, 1989, evidence of cocaine exposure has been found in the urine 
of about 6% of 360 children treated in the hospital's emergency room. An 
additional 120 samples have yet to be analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
The study includes children from 1 month to 5 years old who were taken to the 
hospital with non-life-threatening ailments. None had been breast-fed, and any 
cocaine from exposure in the womb would have dissipated from their blood by the 
time they were 1 month old. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg said youngsters who tested positive had to have been exposed to crack 
smoke within three days because cocaine passes through the body within 72 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Children were excluded from the study if they had symptoms such as seizures, 
hypertension and rapid pulse, which suggest they may have eaten the drug, 
Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Rahdert, a research psychologist at the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, said Rosenberg's results seem clinically significant. She said the 
finding is especially disturbing because crack addicts may be less likely than 
others to seek medical care for their children.

Five coal miners were killed Thursday night when an explosion ripped through a 
mine near the Siberian city of Kemerova, the official Tass news agency reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The blast at the Anzherskaya mine was caused by coal dust and methane, Tass 
said.

FINDING THE MONEY TO BUY A CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
* LAGUNA MUST LOOK HIGH AND LOW FOR NEEDED MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Lida Lenney said that the morning after Election Day, she 
awoke with a "$58-million headache." The euphoria of her city's astonishing 80% 
passage of a $20-million bond issue to help purchase Laguna Canyon was 
subsiding. In its place was the sobering realization that the bond sale would 
provide about a fourth of the $78 million needed over the next five years to 
buy the 2,150-acre canyon from the Irvine Co. That's a great deal of money for 
a city with a population of 25,000 and an annual budget of only $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
What now? 
</P>
<P>
There is no single answer, nor any easy one. To complete the purchase, the city 
needs to put together a patchwork of city, county, state and federal money, 
donations and fees aimed at meeting payments due between now and 1995, when a 
final $33-million payment will finalize the deal. That's going to take a 
complex and imaginative package of different strategies. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of a 3,200-unit housing development in Laguna Canyon -- no matter 
how tastefully or discreetly done -- seemed so intolerable that it sparked a 
protest by 8,000 residents that led the Irvine Co. to the bargaining table. The 
result: an historic agreement for the city to purchase the canyon from the 
developer on very favorable terms. 
</P>
<P>
But here comes the next set of hurdles: For example, the city must work with 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley to resolve a dispute over construction of the San 
Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor through the northern portion of the 
canyon. Riley has threatened to withhold $10 million in county money earmarked 
for purchase of the canyon over the next five years unless the city promises 
not to sue to block the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Working its way out of this dilemma may prove nearly as challenging for the 
city as the delicate negotiations that resulted in the pact to preserve Laguna 
Canyon. The two sides must try to find common ground, but Riley hardly can be 
surprised to learn that the city still opposes the roadway, given its reasons 
for wanting county help in keeping housing development out of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
There are other tough assignments, such as the need to bring in grants and 
donations. Soon, the City Council will decide whether to hire a fund-raiser. 
That won't be cheap -- it could cost $5,000 a month -- but a professional can 
help find the money needed to meet future payments. 
</P>
<P>
The city should also pursue money from the county's new half-cent sales tax for 
transportation, which passed Nov. 6, that could be used to widen Laguna Canyon 
Road. While the Irvine Co. already has agreed to pay for the widening, any 
money it doesn't have to use for that project could be credited directly to the 
city for the canyon's purchase. But to be eligible for sales tax money, the 
city will have to do some serious negotiating with the county over the specific 
plans for widening the canyon road. 
</P>
<P>
As if all that were not enough, the city must move quickly to compete for 
open-space, wetlands-preservation and wildlife-habitat money. It probably will 
need to propose a modest countywide open-space measure that clearly would 
provide money for projects in other areas of the county. And it should 
encourage formation of benefit-assessment districts in other nearby communities 
that also have a strong interest in preserving the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, saving Laguna Canyon from development seemed like a crazy idea. 
Now, it's a happy headache for Lenney, Laguna Beach and the rest of Orange 
County -- but there can be no illusions about how tough a job lies ahead.

THE LEAF-BLOWER AS MIND-BLOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minor as my complaint may be, it is nonetheless aggravating. It is the newest 
infernal machine: the leaf-blower! 
</P>
<P>
They are analogous to motorcycles that never move! They just rev and roar until 
everyone within the infernal machine's noise zone is moved but mental 
millimeters away from madness and mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
I realize that brooms are passe, but at least broomsters would, at the end of 
their sweepings, stoop to pick up what they had assembled. The leaf-blowers do 
not remove what is being blown -- they but relocate it! 
</P>
<P>
No doubt these monsters are here to stay but must they be made so powerful 
that, even muffled, they are outrageously offensive? Please support the 
legislation that is offered to tone down this pure pollution device!

BUILDING INDUSTRY WILL KEEP HELPING TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We thank you for your acknowledgement of the Orange County Building Industry 
Assn.'s efforts to help the homeless in your Nov. 11 editorial "Finally Homing 
In on SRO Solutions." 
</P>
<P>
The association has taken the initiative to be involved with many nonprofit 
organizations in order to assist homeless families in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Through HomeAid, a nonprofit organization established by the BIA, we have 
personally seen the many faces of homelessness, while helping to provide 
transitional homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
During Homeless Awareness Week (Nov. 10-17), HomeAid dedicated four new 
projects for the coming year: the Huntington Youth Shelter in Huntington Beach, 
the Friendship Shelter in Laguna Beach, the Precious Life Shelter in Los 
Alamitos and the Santa Ana YWCA Second Stage Housing Project. 
</P>
<P>
These are important examples of transitional shelters that provide homeless 
families and individuals the opportunity to prepare for long-term housing. And, 
as you have stated so well, that's where Single Room Occupancy hotels (SROs), 
which can provide long-term low-income housing, can help so well. 
</P>
<P>
The Building Industry Assn. will continue to exercise a leadership role to 
facilitate the development of SROs in Orange County. With the commitment of 
builders, nonprofit organizations, local governments, local community support 
and, of course, the all-important role of local media in spreading the good 
word, we can help alleviate the misery of the less fortunate and give them the 
chance for renewed dignity and purpose in life.

STILL WAITING FOR SOME ANSWERS TO HOUSING QUESTIONS IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must respond to your editorial "A Bad Time to Change Housing Goals -- 
Affordable Unit Concept Could Suffer Under New Action By Irvine City Council" 
(Nov. 18). 
</P>
<P>
First, I couldn't agree with you more; the 3,700 unit Westpark II (Village 38) 
must not be developed without its fair share of affordable housing units. 
</P>
<P>
I recently testified on behalf of Irvine Tomorrow (a citizen group concerned 
with the quality of life in Irvine) before the Irvine City Council expressing 
seven major concerns Irvine Tomorrow has about Village 38. 
</P>
<P>
Affordable housing was addressed as well as six other areas. Those areas are: 
the electromagnetic radiation from the high-voltage lines in the development; 
sound attenuation needed due to the helicopter flight patterns; the need for 
alternative transportation due to the increased number of car trips the 
development will generate; the sinking funds needed to offset unanticipated 
future costs in connection with additional burdens on the city infrastructure 
(these costs would be borne by the existing residents); schools (although there 
are two school sites, there is no assurance that they will be built) and 
institutional zoning because there currently is none for Village 38, and 
without this zoning, the development will fail to serve its own institutional 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
With this many questions and problems in the development of Village 38, Irvine 
Tomorrow will continue to ask the City Council the simple question: "Why now? 
Why is the current City Council in such a hurry to allow the Irvine Co. to rush 
through a development with these potential problems?"

3 MEN KILLED IN EARLY MORNING CAR ACCIDENTS; 
</P>

Traffic accidents claimed the lives of three men in the west San Fernando 
Valley early Saturday, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers died in a two-car collision after a driver failed to stop at a 
red light at a Northridge intersection. The third death occurred in Granada 
Hills when a Los Angeles Times deliveryman's car was struck by a suspected 
drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, Efran Reyes Ordones, 26, of Northridge, was driving west 
on Parthenia Street about 12:30 a.m. when he sped through a red traffic light 
at Lindley Avenue, Officer Ed Pedneau said. Ordones' car was broadsided in the 
intersection by a car driven by Bernard Davidson, 68, of Chatsworth, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ordones' car careened into a power pole. Two passengers in his car, Nectali 
Reyes Ordones, 23, the driver's brother, and Nelson Javier Colindres, 24, also 
of Northridge, died at the scene, Pedneau said. 
</P>
<P>
Colindres, who was in the back seat, was thrown through the car's rear window 
when the two vehicles collided, police said. The younger Ordones was killed 
when the car hit the pole. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, who suffered a broken collarbone, was arrested on suspicion of 
manslaughter after being treated at Northridge Medical Center, Pedneau said. He 
was being held at Van Nuys Jail in lieu of $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson was not seriously injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, a 28-year-old Sylmar man was delivering newspapers 
shortly after 4 a.m. on Louise Avenue when his Chevrolet Baretta was struck by 
another car at Nugent Street, Officer Lee Glozier said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was withheld until relatives could be notified, was thrown 
from his car, Glozier said. He died of head injuries later at Holy Cross 
Medical Center in Mission Hills, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Clarkson, 20, of Granada Hills, the driver of the second car, was 
arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, Glozier said. Clarkson was 
being held at Van Nuys Jail in lieu of $20,000 bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarkson, who had been drinking, hit the vehicle after failing to obey the 
four-way stop sign at the intersection, Glozier said. Tests were being 
conducted to determined if he was legally intoxicated at the time of the crash, 
police said.

TRANSPORTATION POLICY'S VICIOUS CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, Measure M will produce a lot of money to improve our roads. Two articles 
("Engineers Plan to Roll Fast on Measure M List," Nov. 11, and "Watchdogs Vie 
to Oversee 'M' Funds," Nov. 13) emphasize the huge sum that the additional 
half-cent sales tax will yield. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the money must be spent for purposes intended by the statute. The Times 
reports that 324 people applied for positions on the watchdog committee set up 
by the measure to monitor spending. 
</P>
<P>
The promise of Measure M is stillborn because the measure does not address the 
cause of auto pollution: overdevelopment of Orange County. Measure M fails to 
effectively address the issue of growth: population pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Do you have any doubt that traffic improvements from Measure M expenditures 
will be pounced upon by developers to argue for further growth? Developers did 
not pour in huge sums supporting the measure because they desired better 
quality of life for the rest of us. Congestion is profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic relief provided by Measure M funds will be temporary unless growth is 
curtailed, because our capacity to produce more drivers for more cars far 
outstrips our capacity to provide the roads upon which they must operate. 
</P>
<P>
My prediction: After the $3 billion garnered by Measure M has been expended as 
the measure requires, our automobile transportation mess will still be with us 
-- all pain, no gain. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the politicians who approved the growth that placed us in this mess will 
have continued those same policies, and they will still be in office. 
</P>
<P>
I would be a lot more impressed if 324 people had volunteered to monitor the 
politicians who made the decisions that produced this congested chaos in the 
first place.

IN GATES SETTLEMENT, PUBLIC PAYS WHILE SUPERVISORS EVADE HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider for a moment Sheriff Brad Gates' conduct before and after the court 
judgment ("Gates Off Hook in Suit; County to Pay $616,000," Nov. 17). Gates 
regularly issues permits to wealthy business people, friends and political 
backers during the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of his peers finds Gates guilty of denying the Ritter brothers their 
constitutional rights (he denied these licensed private investigators gun 
permits six times during the same period). 
</P>
<P>
After the judgment is rendered, Gates refuses to admit any wrongdoing. He even 
boasts that the judge trusts him, despite the fact that he has agreed in the 
court settlement to pay $616,000 and reaffirm that he will obey his own oath of 
office. 
</P>
<P>
And in the midst of it all, Gates persuades voters of our fiscally conservative 
county to reelect him sheriff.

History, religion and philosophy have taught that the excessive acquisition of 
wealth is damaging to human happiness.

<P>
The citizens of Laguna Beach have demonstrated their appreciation of this

Canyon.

<P>
We must convince our elected officials, developers and proponents of the San 
Joaquin freeway of this universal truth.

GOLF SKINS GAME;

<P>
SHUT OUT ON DAY 1, NICKLAUS HITS LOW

<P>
The first hole on the Stadium Course at PGA West is called Prelude, a 440-yard 
par-four with huge bunkers on the left and a very small green. And for Nick 
Faldo, Curtis Strange, Greg Norman and Jack Nicklaus, their first shots 
Saturday in the first nine holes of the Skins Game seemed ominous. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, did Nicklaus yank or hook that first drive? 
</P>
<P>
"No way I'm going to answer that," Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, trying to cut his drive, hooked it into the bushes. Strange, Faldo 
and Norman lined up in the middle. Strange won the first skin, but Faldo won 
the most, winning two skins worth $70,000. Strange finished next with two skins 
worth $65,000, and Norman, who played a role in five of the holes, won a 
$30,000 skin. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, playing in the Skins Game for the eighth year, was shut out and faces 
being blanked for the 18 holes first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't ever recall ever playing a worse nine holes of golf, whether it was 
practice or playing -- any time," Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
After Nicklaus' first tee shot, he seemed to hit into the gallery, the sand or 
the water the rest of the way. Even when he was in contention, he couldn't seem 
to get a break. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't ever recall hitting that many bad shots, and it wasn't like I was 
hitting them one way," Nicklaus said. "I hit them dead left or dead right. I 
mixed it up real well." 
</P>
<P>
So, after the round, he went straight to the practice range and said he thinks 
the problem was that he couldn't get his right arm out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much tennis," he said. "I hit them pretty well on the range." 
</P>
<P>
This is Faldo's first Skins Game. Last year he watched it on television. 
</P>
<P>
He won his first skin for $15,000, battling Nicklaus on the 184-yard, par-three 
fourth hole. Nicklaus hit a seemingly perfect drive to six feet below the pin. 
Faldo's drive stuck 18 feet from the cup. But Faldo sank his "triple-breaker" 
-- as he called it -- putt for birdie, and Nicklaus' putt missed left. 
</P>
<P>
But Faldo's biggest payment came on the 350-yard, par-four seventh hole. With 
$30,000 carrying over from the fifth and sixth holes, and an increase to 
$25,000 a hole on No. 7, the prize was $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus and Strange drove into the water, with Faldo and Norman landing on the 
fairway. Norman, about 107 yards from the pin, choked down on a wedge and hit 
to within six feet of the pin. Faldo hit a short wedge to within eight feet of 
the cup. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo sank his putt for birdie. But Norman's putt lipped the cup and came back 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
"It did a good 360 (-degree turn)," Norman said. "Curtis is right -- it is 
easier when you putt first." 
</P>
<P>
Faldo putted first on both holes he won. 
</P>
<P>
"The other guys had a chance, but they both missed," Faldo said. "You feel 
fortunate when they could have tied you. It's nice to get in there and then 
hold your breath whenever they putt." 
</P>
<P>
Strange sank a 12-foot putt on the first hole to earn his first skin and 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
"With that first skin out of the way, the pressure is somewhat off," said 
Strange, who seemed to be the liveliest of the group. "With Fuzzy (Zoeller) and 
Lee (Trevino) not here, it probably seemed more quiet out there." 
</P>
<P>
Strange had his best effort on the 450-yard, par-four ninth hole when he sank a 
four-foot putt for birdie and $50,000, which included a carryover from No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Norman took advantage of the carryover on the 446-yard, par-four third hole. 
His drive flew left past the bunkers, then hit a mound and kicked right to a 
raised lie about 160 yards out. He hit a seven-iron to the green about 45 feet 
from the pin. Then he sank his putt for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time this group has played together, and Strange thought they 
had a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"You know down deep it's an event made for TV, but you still try hard," Strange 
said. "We all know each other well, and I think we quipped enough between the 
four of us." 
</P>
<P>
Or at least among the three of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you this much, I will not play quite that badly tomorrow," Nicklaus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Today's prize money on the remaining holes is $285,000. Holes 10-12 are worth 
$25,000 each and the remaining six worth $35,000.

MORNING BRIEFING: STAKES HIGH AT HALFTIME AT USC GAMES

<P>
Finally, we're going to see how USC students respond to real pressure. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime of each Trojan men's and women's basketball game this season, two 
students will be given chances to sink four specified shots in 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The prize? Free tuition for a semester. 
</P>
<P>
The countdown begins tonight at the Lyon Center on campus, where the women play 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, how many shots does a USC player have to make to get eight 
semesters of free tuition. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do Laker Coach Mike Dunleavy and Clipper Coach Mike Schuler 
have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Roto-rooter alert: Even if you're not in a rotisserie league, it's legal to 
read "Rotisserie League Basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Editors Glen Waggoner and Robert Sklar evaluate each player in the NBA. For 
example: 
</P>
<P>
Jon Koncak, Atlanta: "Never one to run his mouth or feign injury, Koncak simply 
goes out and gets you four points and four rebounds every single night." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Roth, Minnesota: "He broke his nose for the ninth time last season. Alas, 
his shot is no straighter than his septum." 
</P>
<P>
Add rotisserie: Of Joe Barry Carroll, before his release by the Denver Nuggets, 
Waggoner and Sklar wrote: "The real Mailman: He's slow, doesn't deliver and is 
surrounded by dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Some reward: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have lost five games in a row and six of 
their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when asked whether he plans to fire Coach Ray Perkins, Buccaneer owner 
Hugh Culverhouse said: "Even if we lost every game the rest of the year, even 
if Ray Perkins wanted to quit, I wouldn't let him. I'd make him come back and 
coach the team next year. I hope that makes it plain and simple." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Inside: Bill Laimbeer and other contemporary NBA centers might have a 
shooting touch from long range, but George Mikan, considered the first great 
center of pro basketball's modern era, recently said he couldn't imagine 
himself taking on that role. 
</P>
<P>
Mikan, who played two years in the old NBL and with the Minneapolis Lakers from 
1948-'49 to 1955-'56 (he retired in 1954-'55), added: 
</P>
<P>
"The only time I would shoot from the outside was in practice, and then it was 
only when we were shooting for milkshakes. And as far as ballhandling goes, I 
always said that when I dribbled, it was two bounces and a kick." 
</P>
<P>
Remember their slogan: Jan Hubbard of Newsday isn't so sure James Worthy's 
endorsement possibilities have narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested: "Hi, this is James Worthy for the Yellow Pages." 
</P>
<P>
Run 10 laps: Sports promoter Al Franken comes neither to praise junk bond king 
Michael Milken nor to bury him -- merely to point out that Milken, who was 
sentenced last week to 10 years in prison for violating federal securities laws 
and other crimes, built a state-of-the-art running track two years ago for his 
alma mater, Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Does this give new meaning to the term artificial surface? 
</P>
<P>
Gimme a G, gimme an R. . . . : Michael Milken and actress Sally Field were yell 
leaders together at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Both were with the Milwaukee Bucks -- Dunleavy as a player and 
Schuler as an assistant coach -- in 1983-'84. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: New York Knick guard Mark Jackson, asked to explain his team's poor 
play in losing to Houston, 115-88, three days after playing well in a 106-79 
victory over Philadelphia: "It's hard to explain our Heckle and Jeckle 
performance." TED BROCK

Anthony Williams rushed for 141 yards and three touchdowns and Keith West 
passed for three touchdowns Saturday as Wake Forest routed Vanderbilt, 56-28. 
</P>
<P>
West got the starting nod for the Atlantic Coast Conference-member Deacons 
(3-8) when Phil Barnhill, Wake Forest's fifth all-time passing yardage leader, 
injured an ankle late in the week during practice. 
</P>
<P>
West completed 15 of 28 passes for 229 yards and connected on touchdown pass 
plays of 45 and 12 yards to Todd Dixon and 37 yards to Walter Rasby. 
</P>
<P>
The Commodores (1-9), members of the Southeastern Conference, saw their losing 
streak extended to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt took a 7-0 lead on a 34-yard run by Corey Harris with 6:23 left in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But West took Wake Forest to the Commodore end zone on four of the Deacons' 
next five possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest tied the score, 7-7, with 3:44 left in the first quarter when West 
connected with Dixon at the Vanderbilt eight-yard line and Dixon sidestepped a 
Commodore defender and ran into the end zone to complete a 45-yard scoring 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Demon Deacons moved 80 yards on their first possession of the second 
quarter with Williams sweeping his own right end for a 10-yard touchdown run 
and a 14-7 Wake Forest lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Rogers scored on a four-yard run late in the quarter to give Wake Forest a 
21-7 lead.

FOR BETTOR, IT'S A SYSTEM MADE IN HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last Saturday was an ordinary day at Rosehill Race Course, with no important 
stakes race or special attractions on the program. But by U.S. standards, it 
was extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of slightly less than 12,000 at the track bet $8.5 million -- $6 
million with the legal on-course bookmakers and $2.5 million through the tote 
machines. Per capita wagering exceeded $700, a stunning figure. In addition, 
the off-track betting system in the state of New South Wales generated $6 
million in wagers on the Rosehill card. And, at the same time, statewide 
off-track betting on other tracks in Australia added up to another $12 million. 
These totals dwarf anything ever seen in U.S. racing. 
</P>
<P>
A facile explanation for this huge level of betting, in a country with a small 
population beset with serious economic problems, is that Australians are manic 
gamblers. Indeed, horse racing here has the kind of widespread popularity that 
pro football does in the United States, and there are few social stigmas 
attached to betting. 
</P>
<P>
But the man who was once the biggest bookmaker in Australia -- and, indeed, the 
world -- says that the national character doesn't account for these spectacular 
wagering totals. "You always hear that Australians or Chinese are big gamblers, 
but people over the world are all the same," insisted Bill Waterhouse. "The 
difference is just a question of access and opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
What Australia has done is to create the best betting opportunities on earth -- 
and the result has been massive wagering that has in turn created an 
extraordinarily prosperous racing industry. The system here springs out of 
century-old betting traditions, so it is probably not copyable anywhere, but 
there is one sharp contrast between Australia and the United States that U.S. 
political leaders and racing officials might heed. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, just about anyone who admits he is a chronic horseplayer 
will be regarded as a loser -- and for good reason. When states and tracks 
extract from 17 to 25 percent of every dollar wagered, it takes an astute 
full-time student of the game just to break even. 
</P>
<P>
But in Australia, rational people study the form and bet seriously because they 
know there is an excellent chance of making money -- sometimes very big money. 
A bookmaker said: "The racecourses here are full of people who would be very 
upset if they have a losing year. In fact, they'd feel that it was a disgrace 
to lose." 
</P>
<P>
It was a man named Robert Sevier who was responsible for the virtues of the 
Australian betting system. Bookmakers had operated throughout the world long 
before he was born, but they generally served as private agents for owners and 
wealthy gamblers who wanted to bet a particular horse. 
</P>
<P>
In 1882 at Randwick Race Course, Sevier stood in the middle of a crowd and 
shouted the odds he would offer for every horse in a field. Modern-day 
bookmaking was born. Racecourses here were soon filled with bookies who posted 
odds on boards for every horse in a race. 
</P>
<P>
The early days of legal bookmaking were wild and woolly; one bookie was stomped 
to death by an angry crowd when he couldn't pay all his customers after a race. 
Some bookmakers attempted to fix races. But the industry eventually was put 
under tight supervision, and it flourished. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the competition was put on view in Melbourne recently, at an 
annual rite known as the "Calling of the Card." This was the first official 
posting of odds for the Melbourne Cup, and eight bookmakers were to quote their 
odds on the entrants, horse by horse. Whoever offered the best price would take 
the bets. 
</P>
<P>
When the name horse called Flying Luskin was called, seven bookmakers offered 
12 to 1, but then Ron Cain drew attention by announcing: "Fourteen to one." 
Immediately, somebody rose to take him up on the offer: "Flying Luskin, $70,000 
to $5,000," and other wagers followed. But the price of the horse was set at a 
generous 14 to 1 because bookmakers were vying for the action. 
</P>
<P>
This happens every day for every race. Because of the competition among 
bookmakers, bettors can get odds that make playing the horses a fair gamble. In 
the United States, the tote machines automatically take a big slice out of 
every dollar that is wagered. Bookmakers here typically will wind up with a 5 
percent edge over their customers (of which 2 percent goes for taxes and 1 
percent goes for overhead). 
</P>
<P>
The margin of profit is so small and the business is so tough that there are 
numerous professional gamblers in Australia who used to be bookies and quit -- 
because they concluded that the game was easier on the other side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
The bookmaking system fosters betting in ways that couldn't happen in the 
United States. A gambler who makes huge bets into the tote machines will be 
destroying his own odds. But here, the media baron Kerry Packer will bet as 
much as $1 million on a race -- yes, $1 million -- because bookmakers offer 
fixed odds. 
</P>
<P>
Other gamblers will bet simply because they know that looking for values with 
bookmakers is smart business. Waterhouse said: "There's not a market in the 
world -- the stock market or the commodities market -- as accurate as the 
starting price (i.e., the final odds) of bookmakers. If you get a bet above 
that starting price, you'll beat the bookmaker. If the favorite is 2 to 1, but 
you get 9 to 4 on him and you do that regularly, you've got a good shot at 
finishing ahead at the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
There is one drawback to this system, at least from the standpoint of 
politicians and racing officials, and that is that a tote system takes a much 
higher percentage of the betting dollar and yields more revenue. That is why 
the United States, and most countries, abolished bookies and went to the tote. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what some leaders of the Australian racing industry wanted to do in 
1960. Instead, the country developed a dual system, keeping the bookmakers 
while creating a tote betting network called the Totalizator Authority Board, 
or TAB. It is a system that makes a visiting horseplayer think that perhaps he 
has died and gone to heaven.

TEXAS GETS COTTON BID, COACH GETS A NEW DEAL;

SOUTHWEST: LONGHORNS RALLY AGAINST BAYLOR, 23-13, FOR BERTH AGAINST MIAMI.

The Texas Longhorns buried their Waco jinx, earned their first Southwest 
Conference title in seven years, and got Coach David McWilliams a new five-year 
contract on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns rallied for a 23-13 victory over Baylor in Floyd Casey Stadium, 
where Texas hadn't won since 1982. The victory sends sixth-ranked Texas to its 
19th Cotton Bowl for a meeting with second-ranked Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way they could beat us today," McWilliams told his team after the 
game. "You did what you've done all year, come from behind." 
</P>
<P>
With Texas trailing 10-3 at halftime, McWilliams reminded his players that they 
had rallied to win five times this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them they were a second-half team and that if any team could come back, 
we could," McWilliams said. "It sure feels good to see a smile on everyone's 
face." 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams was rewarded with a five-year contract by Texas President William 
Cunningham in the dressing room just before Cotton Bowl President John Stuart 
made everything official by inviting Texas to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams was under heat to produce a bowl season for the Longhorns before the 
year began and he pulled it off. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the new contract, but I really wasn't feeling any pressure from 
the administration before this year began," he said. "I told the team to play 
for themselves, not me. But I'm happy about it, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Butch Hadnot's 19-yard run and three Michael Pollak field goals helped Texas 
erase a 10-point Baylor lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Texas had the capability to come back," Baylor Coach Grant Teaff said. 
"We still had our chances. Texas will be a great representative of this 
conference. If they beat Miami, I predict they will be the national champion." 
</P>
<P>
Baylor had turned down a bid to the Independence Bowl to concentrate on Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad that we will end up second or third in the conference and not go to a 
bowl," Teaff said. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, which has a game remaining against Texas A&amp;M, improved to 9-1 
overall and 7-0 in the SWC and avenged a 43-point loss to the Bears last 
season. Baylor finished 6-4-1 and 5-2-1.

PROVIDING BETTER THAN A BETTING CHANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to almost any Australian racetrack will be struck by this phenomenon: 
The track's large, comfortable grandstand seating area almost always will be 
deserted. Horseplayers here rarely sit down. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that there is no time to kill between races; indeed, there is no 
time to waste as bettors consult odds on television monitors, compare 
bookmakers' prices and scurry to make wagers. This was the schedule at the 
Warwick Farm races here Tuesday: The first race was run at 12:40. At 12:55 
there was a simulcast from Melbourne. At 1:05 there was a simulcast from 
Brisbane. At 1:10 came a simulcast from Adelaide. Post time for the second live 
race from at Warwick Farm was 1:15. Breathless bettors had the opportunity to 
watch and play 34 races (all with quinella and trifecta wagering) during the 
course of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, citizens in virtually every part of this country had similar 
opportunities, because outlets for the Totalizator Agency Board, the country's 
off-track betting network, are ubiquitous. The TAB is the most efficient, 
extensive off-track betting system in the world. 
</P>
<P>
When technology made such systems possible, racing leaders in virtually every 
country sought the best way to implement it. America's first venture into this 
area was horribly botched by New York City's Off-Track Betting Corp., which 
produced a bloated bureaucracy and wrecked attendance at the tracks. England 
fared even worse, with a system that not only killed attendance but drained 
money from the sport and resulted in pitifully low purses. 
</P>
<P>
Australia did it right. 
</P>
<P>
The scope of illegal, off-track wagering here used to be massive; the 
neighborhood bookie was as much of a fixture in any community as the 
neighborhood cop. While legal, on-track bookmakers were taxed, the illegal 
operators were siphoning potential revenue from the states and the tracks. So 
in 1960 the legislature in the state of Victoria, where Melbourne is located, 
passed a bill creating the TAB to operate off-track betting shops, telephone 
betting and on-course tote betting. It was so successful that each of 
Australia's six states created its own TAB (each with its own management and 
its own betting pools). They revitalized horse racing in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria's TAB was created as a quasi-public authority with two missions: to 
raise money for the state and for the racing industry. The "take" from wagers 
is about 16 percent, of which about 5 percent goes to the tracks. In the past 
year, the TAB handled $1.4 billion in wagers and generated more than $80 
million for purses and track development in this one state alone. "The 
contribution the TAB has made to racing is massively greater than anything the 
tracks could generate themselves," said Victoria TAB General Manager Neil 
Walker. Because of this contribution, a race like the Melbourne Cup could offer 
a $1.6 million purse this year. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the TAB has reduced attendance at the track, a fact of life that 
tracks accept. "We know you can't have your cake and eat it too," said Pat 
Parker, chief executive of the Sydney Turf Club. But the tracks here still 
attract healthy crowds and retain an air of vitality, because on-course 
bookmakers remain legal. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than viewing them as rivals for the betting dollar, TAB and track 
officials know the bookies are an essential part of the game. "They bring 
people to the racecourse," said Parker. "They offer fixed odds and they give 
big players the opportunity to play. And they add a lot of atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the bookies' existence creates business for the tote 
because of arbitrage situations. If one horse is 2 to 1 with the bookmakers and 
5 to 1 on the tote, while the odds on another horse are the reverse, sharpies 
will be betting heavily to exploit the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
But if the arrival of the TAB was a bonanza for tracks and state governments, 
it was also a boon for bettors. When smart handicappers had to do battle with 
the bookies, it was a duel of wise guys vs. wise guys. But now billions of 
dollars of unsophisticated money -- they call it "mug money" here -- were 
flowing into the tote pools. "Our dual betting system makes this the best place 
in the world for a punter (horseplayer)," said Shane Templeton, a journalist 
and professional punter in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Waterhouse, the son of the man who used to be Australia's biggest 
bookmaker, was breaking into the business and was operating one frigid night at 
a little harness track at the foot of the Blue Mountains. In the middle of the 
betting ring was a large drum filled with burning coals where the gamblers 
could huddle to keep warm when they weren't betting. This was, in short, a 
hard-core crowd. One night the tote manager approached Waterhouse and said: 
"We've run out of money. Could you loan us a few thousand dollars?" Waterhouse 
initially wondered if he was being conned, but track officials took him to 
their office and explained that the track always wound up with less money than 
it started with. The on-track wise guys were showing a net profit that was 
being financed by TAB bettors throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Australia would be a wonderful enough place to play the horses just because it 
offers nonstop action, the chance to watch and bet more than 30 races in an 
afternoon. But where else on earth does the game offer the wondrous possibility 
that the crowd could win all of the track's money?

ILLINOIS' GRIFFITH RUNS FOR 263 YARDS AND TWO SCORES IN 28-23 VICTORY

Howard Griffith ran for a school-record 263 yards and scored two touchdowns to 
lead Illinois to a 28-23 Big Ten victory over Northwestern Saturday at 
Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith, who carried 37 times, broke the one-game mark set by Jim Grabowski, 
who gained 237 yards against Wisconsin in 1964. Griffith also set records with 
15 touchdowns this season and 33 in his career, two more than Red Grange, the 
Galloping Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really the story of the Galloping Grif today," Illinois Coach John 
Mackovic said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith scored an NCAA-record eight touchdowns in a 56-21 victory over 
Southern Illinois on Sept. 23. He gained 208 yards in 21 carries in that game. 
</P>
<P>
He needed 207 against Northwestern to finish the regular season with 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"My teammates were saying they would get me the 207 yards," Griffith said. "I 
was saying to myself, 'That's a lot of yards.' Basically, I can't do anything 
but thank my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith scored on a pair of two-yard runs for Illinois (8-3, 6-2), which will 
play Clemson in the Hall of Fame Bowl Jan. 1. Northwestern finished 2-9 and 
1-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini rolled to a 21-0 lead in the first quarter on Griffith's first 
touchdown, a three-yard run by Steve Feagin and a 14-yard scoring pass from 
Jason Verduzco to Jeff Finke. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Michigan State 14, Wisconsin 9 -- Hyland Hickson, with 134 yards 
rushing, and Tico Duckett, with 82, were double trouble for the Badgers at East 
Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Hickson ran for two touchdowns, both in the first quarter, and the Spartan 
defense held Wisconsin to 69 rushing yards as Michigan State (7-3-1, 6-2) won 
its fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Hickson finished the regular season with 1,128 yards. That, combined with 
Duckett's 1,376 yards, makes them the first Big Ten duo in 15 years and only 
the third in league history to combine for more than 2,000 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Duckett and Hickson are five yards shy of the Big Ten record of 2,509 yards by 
Ohio State's Archie Griffin and Pete Johnson in 1975. Since the conference 
includes bowl games in its records, the Michigan State runners appear certain 
to break the mark against USC in the John Hancock Bowl on Dec. 31 at El Paso, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin (1-10, 0-8) lost a school-record 13th consecutive conference game. 
The Badgers' last Big Ten victory was over Northwestern, 35-31, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously not crazy about our record, but we have some things we can 
build on," said Barry Alvarez, Wisconsin's first-year coach. "I was very proud 
of the effort that our kids gave today. It would have been easy . . . to come 
out here and go through the motions." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 28, Purdue 14 -- Vaughn Dunbar ran for 105 yards and three touchdowns 
at West Lafayette, Ind., and Mike Dumas set an Indiana school record with a 
99-yard interception return, although he fell a yard short of scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (6-4-1, 3-4-1) intercepted four passes and recovered three fumbles by 
Purdue's Ernest Calloway. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers secured a berth in the Peach Bowl Dec. 29 at Atlanta, where they 
will meet a Southeastern Conference opponent, probably the loser of next 
Saturday's Alabama-Auburn game. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's interceptions against Purdue included one returned 21 yards for a 
touchdown by Mark Hagen, one returned 25 yards by Damon Watts that set up 
Dunbar's first touchdown and the one by Dumas that set up Dunbar's final 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana, winning the annual season-ending battle for the Old Oaken Bucket, took 
a 21-0 halftime lead before Purdue's Eric Hunter passed 41 yards for a 
touchdown to Jermaine Ross early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers (2-9, 1-7) reached the Indiana 24 late in the quarter, but a 
pass intended for Jimmy Young was intercepted by Dumas at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas returned to the Purdue one before he was knocked out of bounds by Hunter. 
Three plays later, after a penalty for illegal motion, Dunbar ran three yards 
for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The return by Dumas broke the Indiana record of 98 yards, set by Tim Wilbur 
against Michigan State in 1978.

Rio Hondo Prep of Arcadia took advantage of seven turnovers by Canoga Park 
Faith Baptist to win the Southern Section eight-man football Large Schools 
Division championship, 35-6, Saturday at Faith Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist (9-2) fumbled six times, including twice at Rio Hondo's one-yard 
line. Rio Hondo led, 22-6, at halftime and utilized five second-half turnovers 
to build on its lead. 
</P>
<P>
The title was the fourth for Rio Hondo (10-0) since 1977 and the first since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Running backs Mike Whiteside and Rick Johnson led Rio Hondo. Whiteside finished 
with 150 yards in 24 carries and three touchdowns, and Johnson added 126 yards 
in 26 carries and two touchdowns. ERIC SHEPARD

CONFIDENT WOODARD HELPS VILLANOVA WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As it turned out, all Villanova's Greg Woodard needed was some encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he could become the best shooter in the country before the game," 
Villanova Coach Rollie Massimino said. 
</P>
<P>
The junior forward responded by making six of eight three-point shots and 
scoring 28 points as the Wildcats beat No. 14 Louisiana State, 93-91, in the 
Tip-Off game Saturday at Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed him," said Woodard, who averaged 11 points a game last season. 
"After talking to coach Massimino, I always feel like a different player. He 
gives me confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Massimino said his team needed the outside shooting because it couldn't handle 
7-foot-1 center Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried four of five different ways to stop him," Massimino said. "And he 
still got the ball, because he is so big and strong." 
</P>
<P>
Despite getting in early foul trouble, O'Neal finished with 24 points and 11 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers pulled to within 92-91 with 47 seconds left on a tip-in and foul 
shot by Harold Boudreaux. But then O'Neal, who played most of the second half 
with four fouls, missed a baseline jumper and Villanova's Lance Miller got the 
rebound with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who finished with 16 points, was immediately fouled and extended the 
lead by making one of two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 North Carolina 99, San Diego State 63 -- The Aztecs got closer than 20 
points only once in the second half at Chapel Hill, N.C., when Arthur Massey's 
layup made it 57-38 with 18:12 left. But a 16-6 run capped by two free throws 
by George Lynch with 12 minutes left extended North Carolina's lead to 73-44. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Alabama 72, Delaware 47 -- The Crimson Tide wore down the Blue Hens with 
a tough defense and a deep bench at Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama pulled away in the last 10 minutes, taking a 53-33 lead on Robert 
Horry's jump shot with 7:55 left. The Tide's first 25-point lead came with 3:56 
remaining when Marcus Jones' jumper made it 63-38. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Indiana 73, Santa Clara 69 -- After the Broncos pulled to within 51-46 
with 11:50 left in the semifinals of the Maui tournament at Lahaina, Calbert 
Cheaney scored seven consecutive points in the next 1:52 to give the Hoosiers a 
58-46 lead and they held on to win. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara had a chance in the final minutes, but Damon Bailey twice passed to 
Eric Anderson for layups as the 45-second shot clock wound down. After a 
rebound basket by LaCoby Phillips' with 15 seconds left made it 71-67, Cheaney 
made a dunk shot with eight seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16 Georgia Tech 100, Augusta 63 -- Jon Barry made three three-point shots 
to key a 28-0 run that enabled the Yellow Jackets to erase a 12-point deficit 
at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Augusta led, 35-23, with 6:57 left in the first half when Barry made the first 
of his three-point baskets, starting the run that put the Yellow Jackets ahead, 
44-35, at the half. Tech scored the first seven points of the second half and 
continued to build its lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Anderson scored 24 points and had 11 assists for the Yellow Jackets. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Connecticut 68, College of Charleston 52 -- John Gwynn and Chris Smith 
each made a three-point basket during a 15-6 run with 6:02 left that enabled 
the Huskies to pull away at Storrs, Conn. Smith led all scorers with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 21 Georgia 90, Richmond 45 -- The Bulldogs used runs of 17-0 and 12-0 to 
easily win the Richmond, Va., tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia set a tournament record for points in a game and winning margin. The 
45-point defeat was the worst for the Spiders under 10-year coach Dick Tarrant. 
</P>
<P>
Litterial Green led the Bulldogs with 27 points, including 20 in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 St. John's 135, Central Connecticut 92 -- Malik Sealy set a record with 
43 points and helped the Redmen extend their unbeaten record in the title game 
of the Joe Lapchick tournament at New York. The victory gave St. John's the 
title for the 16th consecutive year and improved its tournament record to 32-0. 
</P>
<P>
Sealy, a 6-8 forward, made 19 of 23 shots as he broke the Alumni Hall 
single-game scoring record and the tournament mark. Ernie DiGregorio scored 41 
points for Providence in 1973 for the Alumni Hall record and Glenn Williams of 
St. John's set the tournament single-game record of 37 in 1976.

COLORADO STATE KEEPS NORTHRIDGE IN CHECK

<P>
The margin of loss was nearly identical, but the difference between Cal State 
Northridge's first and second Division I games was like night and day. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Matadors' running game was slowed and the experience of guards 
Lynn Tryon and Mark Meredith led Colorado State past Northridge, 104-79, before 
6,472 Saturday night at Moby Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Tryon scored a career-high 30 points, including four three-pointers, and 
Meredith had 22 points, also making four three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was the most points scored by Colorado State since the 1971-72 
season, the pace wasn't nearly fast enough for Northridge's taste and nowhere 
near the frenzy of its 113-89 loss to Colorado a night earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"They got back well on defense and filled the passing lanes," Northridge Coach 
Pete Cassidy said. "We're not going to be able to run every game. Against a 
Boyd Grant-coached team, he's not going to let us run. You gotta be able to 
operate out of the halfcourt. You can't live on the break alone." 
</P>
<P>
David Keeter (four of six) was the only Northridge player able to get off more 
than one three-point basket as the Matadors were limited to 25 attempts, 
compared to 44 in their Division I debut. 
</P>
<P>
Keeter led the Matadors with 15 points.

Julian Jackson knocked out Herol Graham of Britain in the fourth round Saturday 
night to win the vacant World Boxing Council middleweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, the British middleweight champion, dominated the first three rounds, 
scoring with a variety of combinations and frustrating Jackson, who was missing 
wildly. 
</P>
<P>
But midway through the fourth round, when it appeared Graham (34-3) was in 
control, Jackson suddenly floored Graham with a short right hand. 
</P>
<P>
He was counted out by referee Joe Cortez of Atlantic City, N.J. Graham was on 
the canvas for more than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's victory gave him the WBC middleweight crown, vacant since Sugar Ray 
Leonard retired earlier this year. He also holds the World Boxing Assn. light 
middleweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson (42-1, 39 knockouts), from the U.S. Virgin Islands, scored his 34th 
consecutive knockout.

With Dominique Wilkins leading the way, it seemed the Hawks would end their 
losing streak Saturday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
There were only 10 1/2 minutes to play and the Atlanta Hawks led the 
Philadelphia 76ers, 106-88. 
</P>
<P>
But three-point field goals by Kenny Payne and Charles Barkley in the final 22 
seconds let the 76ers pull out a 124-121 victory. 
</P>
<P>
After the 76ers pulled to 121-119 with 22 seconds to play on Payne's shot, 
Wilkins, who scored 39 points, was tied up by Hersey Hawkins with 15 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers won the tip and Barkley sank a three-point shot with eight seconds to 
play. Rickey Green's two free throws with two seconds to play completed the 
scoring and the Hawks lost their seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, in early foul trouble, played only 33 minutes and had 23 points and 
seven rebounds. DAN HAFNER

If ever the stage was set for Paul Westhead's fast-paced style to produce a

</P>
<P>
The Nuggets were rested and they were up against the weary Chicago Bulls, 
playing their seventh game on a trip that began Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
For more than three quarters, the running Nuggets were in charge. They held a 
123-109 lead with less than 11 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bulls' Michael Jordan, who battled flu and some cold shooting nights 
during the trip, reached back and came up with something extra. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan sank two difficult jumpers and two free throws in the last 62 seconds to 
give the Bulls a 151-145 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by former Laker Orlando Woolridge nullified the first of 
Jordan's jumpers and tied the score, 145-145. 
</P>
<P>
The next time down the floor, Jordan went up between two Nuggets and sank a 
12-footer. After a miss, he grabbed the rebound, was fouled and sealed the 
victory with the two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan finished with 38 points; Woolridge had 29 for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls' Craig Hodges made three three-pointers during the fourth-quarter 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets fell to 1-11. The Bulls finished their toughest trip with a 4-3 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 113, Cleveland 102 -- One of the problems the Celtics have had in recent 
years has been an inability to win on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Late last season they appeared to overcome it. Now, they are winning on the 
road again. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Lewis made seven of his first eight shots at Richfield, Ohio, to get the 
Celtics off to a fast start and they never let the Cavaliers get close. 
</P>
<P>
With 16 of his 28 points in the first quarter, Lewis helped the Celtics to a 
14-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird had 29 points and 10 assists for the Celtics, who are 10-2, with 5-1 
records home and away. They lead the Atlantic Division by 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 107, New York 97 -- Throughout his career as one of the NBA's best 
sixth man, Ricky Pierce has been an excellent shooter. So the Bucks didn't 
worry too much when the sharpshooting guard went into a slump recently. 
</P>
<P>
As expected he regained his touch, and the Knicks, who are having trouble 
winning at home, were his victims. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, making nine of 13 shots, including three of five from three-point 
range, led the Bucks to their fourth consecutive victory and dropped the 
Knicks' record at Madison Square Garden to 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks never trailed after the opening moments and Pierce set the pace with 
31 points. 
</P>
<P>
After three games in which he made less than 40% of his shots, Pierce is 
shooting 55.9% and averaging 27.5 points during the winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a consistent shooter and I want it to stay that way," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Stu Jackson said his Knicks lacked a strong will to win right now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not defending at all," he said, "and we're not executing on offense. The 
ball's not moving enough." 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 117, Golden State 113 -- After ending their record road losing 
streak Friday night at Phoenix, the Nets were more confident at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
They led most of the way against the Warriors, but it took a 25-foot shot by 
7-foot-1 Sam Bowie as time ran out on the shot clock to win it. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets, trailing, 113-112, were trying to set up a winning basket, but the 
shot clock was running down when Bowie, all alone way out on the court, 
launched his shot. The ball went in to give the Nets a 115-113 lead with 21 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mullin missed a jumper, and, with five seconds left, the Nets' Reggie 
Theus was fouled. He made both shots and the Nets had a two-game road winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 125, Miami 112 -- The Hornets couldn't handle the Heat at home Friday 
night, but they were ready to play at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Newman scored 12 of his 30 points in the first quarter to give the 
Hornets a lead they never relinquished. Newman sparked a 15-point run that gave 
the Hornets a 33-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets kept their big lead most of the way with the help of 32 free throws 
in 34 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The victory pulled the Hornets back to .500 (7-7). Miami is 4-8. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 85, Dallas 74 -- The Jazz don't have their offense in gear this season, 
but their defense pulls out some games. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone scored 18 of his 27 points in the second half at Dallas and Utah 
overcame an 11-point second quarter to hand the Mavericks their third loss in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 107, Indiana 105 -- A layup by Haywoode Workman, a free-agent guard, 
with three seconds left in overtime at Landover, Md., ended the Bullets' 
five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard King kept the Bullets in the game, scoring 34 points. But when the 
Pacers surrounded King in the closing seconds of overtime, it was up to 
Workman. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers' Reggie Miller missed a three-pointer as the game ended. DAN HAFNER

Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande High and Jeannie Rothman of Westlake Village 
Westlake recorded the fastest times of the day in winning the boys' Division I 
and girls' Division II titles at the state cross-country championships Saturday 
at Woodward Park. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana toured the 5,000-meter (3.1-mile) course in 14 minutes 47 seconds -- 
two seconds shy of the state-meet record of 14:45 set last year by three-time 
champion Bryan Dameworth of Agoura. Rothman timed 17:28, one second away from 
Agoura standout Deena Drossin's record set in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin clocked 17:30, winning her third Division I title in the four years, 
and the Agoura girls' team ended three years of frustration by winning the team 
title with 41 points over San Diego Mt. Carmel, which had 68. Agoura placed 
second to Palos Verdes in the past three state Division I finals. Three-time 
defending champion Palos Verdes was fifth with 124 points. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Hart upset No. 1 Madera for the boys' Division I title after losing to 
the Coyotes in the Stanford and Mt. San Antonio College invitationals. The 
second-ranked Indians beat Madera, 58-113, behind the eighth-place effort of 
Billy Dixon (15:48). 
</P>
<P>
City Section champion Los Angeles Belmont matched Oxnard Channel Islands with 
147 points, but Belmont was awarded fourth outright on the basis of a faster 
sixth runner. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido San Pasqual became the first school to win two state titles in the 
same season. Robert Walker won in 15:25, leading the Golden Eagles past 
Camarillo, 64-86, in Division II. San Pasqual's girls placed five runners in 
the top 19 to beat Irvine Woodbridge, 38-83. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park junior Jeff Wilson posted the third-fastest time of the day -- 
15:15 -- in winning the Division III title over James Menon (15:26) of San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Carrie Garritson of Rim of the World in Riverside upset Livermore's 
Becky Spies, 18:01-18:21, in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked Fillmore beat No. 1 Sierra Madre Maranatha, 90-98, for the boys' 
Division IV title. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai Nordhoff edged Morro Bay, 77-79, for the Division IV girls title.

<P>
FORUM FIGHT TEAM LOOKS TOWARD THE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BULLETIN: The Forum is moving to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not altogether. And make that Rosemont, Ill., a Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Seems the Forum boxing staff is moving to the Rosemont Horizon to stage a fight 
card Dec. 13. If successful, the Forum may promote monthly fight shows there 
through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Forum's Illinois venture will have no impact on its bi-monthly Forum boxing 
shows. In fact, it's expected the move will free up more dates for aspiring 
Southland and Mexican pugilists who aspire to fight on Forum cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Chicago move is the result of two things," said John Jackson, Jerry Buss' 
Forum vice president in charge of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
"One, the Rosemont Horizon people came to us. They want to put on regular 
boxing shows, and since we have some expertise in that area, plus a lot of 
boxers, we talked. Second, we will now have access to another venue where we 
can provide exposure in the Midwest for boxers we already have." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said that if all parties are happy with the Dec. 13 show -- featuring 
unbeaten Chicago lightweight Louie Lomeli (21-0) and Forum junior-middleweight 
tournament champion Quincy Taylor (15-2) -- the Forum will sign a six-month or 
one-year deal calling for the Forum to provide monthly Horizon fight cards. 
</P>
<P>
The 17,000-seat arena was built 10 years ago by the city of Rosemont, near 
O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Horizon is a busy place, used for DePaul and Chicago Loyola basketball 
games, circuses, concerts, pro wrestling and ice shows. It had 200 dates on its 
1990 calendar but has not had regular boxing shows. 
</P>
<P>
One of the early impacts of the Forum foray into the Midwest will no doubt be a 
buildup of overtime requests by Jackson's staff. His boxing people are now 
looking at the following schedule: Genaro Hernandez vs. Rodolfo Gomez at the 
Forum Dec. 6, the Dec. 13 Rosemont Horizon show and the light-flyweight title 
fight between Humberto Gonzalez and Rolando Pascua at the Forum Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo (Cuyo) Hernandez, one of the busiest Mexican boxing managers, died 
recently in Mexico City at 82. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who at one time had more than 200 fighters in his Mexico City 
stable, handled many Mexican world champions, among them Ruben Olivares, Carlos 
Zarate and Alfonso Zamora. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, Hernandez was such a powerful figure in Mexican boxing he was 
called 'Don Cuyo,' " recalls Bill Caplan, who knew Hernandez well from his late 
1960s boxing publicity work for George Parnasus at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The second operation on Ten Goose Boxing's Gabriel Ruelas' elbow was a blow for 
both the young lightweight and his manager-promoter, Dan Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas was 21-0 last April 14 in Las Vegas and handily beating up his toughest 
foe to date, Jeff Franklin, when he broke his right elbow in the sixth round. 
Ruelas was stopped by the injury in the next round. 
</P>
<P>
His elbow was surgically repaired that night, or so everyone hoped. But during 
rehabilitation, Ruelas found he couldn't straighten his arm. During a second 
operation Nov. 8, it was discovered that screws holding the elbow together had 
broken loose and that the elbow had not healed. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas, 20, now faces at least three more months of healing and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The injury dates to Ruelas' boyhood. It's believed he broke his arm in a fall 
and was never treated by a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Rafael, 19, rolls along at 21-0. On Tuesday, he will try to win 
the California featherweight title against Richard Abila at the Country Club in 
Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
On the Reseda undercard will be an eight-round exhibition featuring Sugar Ray 
Leonard's next opponent, Terry Norris, against Tony Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard's long-talked about fight with junior-middleweight contender 
Terry Norris is all but set for Feb. 9 at New York's Madison Square Garden. . . 
. Just wondering: Why is it that the boxing public seems to love George 
Foreman, yet seemed ready to lynch Buster Douglas when he showed up 15 pounds 
overweight and was knocked out by Evander Holyfield last month? 
</P>
<P>
It's puzzling, because indications are that Foreman will show up for his title 
fight with Holyfield April 19 at roughly the same level of conditioning. 
Foreman weighed 284 pounds for a public sparring session in Seattle last week. 
Is it OK, then, for Foreman to fight fat, but not Douglas? 
</P>
<P>
Says longtime Foreman aide Bill Caplan: "George is going to train down to 235 
and see how he feels. If he feels strong, he'll stay there. If he doesn't, 
he'll go back up to . . . whatever." 
</P>
<P>
And did anyone notice? Holyfield became the sixth -- and most likely the last 
-- member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic team to win a pro title when he won the 
heavyweight championship. Half the members of the team that won nine gold 
medals in Los Angeles have now won pro titles: Holyfield, Virgil Hill, Frank 
Tate, Mark Breland, Pernell Whitaker and Meldrick Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, the most successful pro champion of the group, will defend his World 
Boxing Assn. light-heavyweight title, for the 10th time, Jan. 6 in Fargo, N.D., 
against Mike Peak. If successful, it's said, he may get Michael Moorer, who is 
also unbeaten, in a pay-per-view show at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
In case you're wondering how embattled Donald Trump can afford to pay a 
$10-million site fee for Holyfield-Foreman: Turns out the site, Trump Plaza, is 
the only one of his three Atlantic City properties to turn a profit in the 
third quarter of this year. Financial statements released last week show his 
Taj Mahal lost $11 million in the quarter and that Trump Castle lost $7.7 
million. Trump Plaza posted a $5.4 million profit. 
</P>
<P>
A boxing preview of this summer's Pan American Games in Havana: Light-flyweight 
Eric Griffin of Houston was the only 1990 U.S. winner of a World Cup title. But 
here's the kicker: Cubans won titles in all of the remaining 11 weight classes. 
The World Cup tournament this year was held in three stages: In Havana last 
February, Dublin in September and Bombay last week. 
</P>
<P>
Add amateurs: The U.S. lost one of its best amateurs to the pros recently when 
Colorado Springs welterweight Skipper Kelp signed with Bob Arum's Top Rank 
group. Kelp is a hard banger and figures to be more successful as a pro than as 
an amateur. Because amateur scoring rewards all-around boxing skills more than 
punching ability, Kelp didn't loom as a 1992 Olympic medal favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Dundee, middleweight champion Michael Nunn's trainer, says Nunn may 
become a regular headliner in Europe. Nunn, who stopped Donald Curry in Paris 
last month, is entertaining offers to fight again in both Paris and London, 
Dundee said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Nathanson, chairman of the California Athletic Commission, recently wrote 
a letter of protest to doctors Al Capanna and Joe LaMancusa, complaining about 
their report to the Nevada Athletic Commission which purported to show that 
California's controversial required neurological exams for boxers were "not 
valid." Nathanson called their study "inconclusive and unscientific." 
</P>
<P>
Add Foreman: Big George recently told writer Jack Welsh: "I'm more experienced 
in championship situations (than Holyfield)." Huh? Better look at the record, 
George. Foreman fought in four heavyweight championship fights and lost one. 
Holyfield has appeared in five cruiserweight championship fights and one 
heavyweight title fight, winning them all. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Amateur Invitational Boxing Tournament will be held 
Monday through Friday at the Lincoln Park Gym, 3501 Valley Blvd., Los Angeles, 
beginning at 7:30 p.m. each night. . . . An ESPN show worth watching: Vince 
Phillips (16-0) vs. Victorio Belcher (33-3-1) Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
High-ranked heavyweight Razor Ruddock has been added to the Dec. 8 Mike 
Tyson-Alex Stewart, Julio Cesar Chavez-Ahn Kyung-Duk card in Atlantic City. 
Ruddock (24-1-1) meets journeyman Mike Rouse (12-5-1). 
</P>
<P>

QUITE A RECEPTION FOR AZTECS; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO STATE: RECEIVING RECORDS TUMBLE IN 58-31 VICTORY OVER TEXAS EL PASO. 
AZTECS CLINCH SECOND CONSECUTIVE WINNING SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They have been bright spots throughout a mostly frustrating season. Patrick 
Rowe and Dennis Arey, together, like a fisherman and his net, catching nearly 
everything in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, during San Diego State's 58-31 victory over Texas El Paso, the NCAA 
record book caught them. 
</P>
<P>
Arey caught eight passes for 105 yards, giving him 1,020 yards for the season. 
Rowe has 1,290. Thus, the Aztecs become only the second team in NCAA history to 
have two receivers catch 1,000 or more yards worth of passes. The first was 
Houston, in 1988, when James Dixon and Jason Phillips accomplished it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like something that was a weight," Arey said. "Now, I don't have to 
worry about it. It's something I never imagined." 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. Rowe caught seven passes for 161 yards, enabling him to tie 
the NCAA record and break the SDSU record with eight consecutive games in which 
he has had 100 or more yards receiving. Rowe joined Tulsa's Howard Twilley 
(1965) and Fresno State's Henry Ellard (1982) in the NCAA record book. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe's 1,290 yards also established a school single-season receiving record, 
surpassing the mark of 1,272 set by Gary Garrison in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
This came in front a season-low crowd of 13,927 in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. Rowe kept what was left of the crowd in suspense -- he didn't cross 
the 100-yard mark until 1:41 remained in the game, and he needed a 68-yard 
touchdown pass from Cree Morris to do it. That gave SDSU a 58-23 lead. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his run, the entire Aztec bench raced into the end zone and 
joined the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP, though, was not impressed. There was a skirmish after the game as the 
teams were heading for the locker rooms, and the Aztecs said UTEP thought SDSU 
was trying to run the score up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how it's going to be looked at," Rowe said. "But I had no 
intention of running up the score. I'd like to apologize to the UTEP Miners. We 
were just trying to get the record." 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a night. The Aztecs clinched consecutive winning seasons for the 
first time since 1981-82 and, when everything was wrapped up, they wandered out 
of their locker room and into the night hoping to have finished in a tie for 
second in the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State played at Hawaii late Saturday, and a Ram loss would have 
dropped them into a tie for second with the Aztecs (6-4, 5-2 in the WAC). 
</P>
<P>
This was one SDSU Coach Al Luginbill wanted badly. With No. 2 Miami up next in 
the season finale, their prospects for a winning season didn't look good unless 
they defeated UTEP. 
</P>
<P>
They were able to accomplish that thanks to a tight second-half defense, four 
second-half touchdowns, and three Andy Trakas field goals -- 45, 24 and 35 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
They finished with 688 yards of total offense to UTEP's 307. Quarterback Dan 
McGwire completed 26 of 38 passes for 344 yards. For the first time this 
season, he didn't throw a touchdown pass. Back-up Cree Morris threw two in the 
fourth quarter, though. One was Rowe's 68-yarder and the other was a 17-yarder 
to Jimmy Raye. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP was able to stay relatively close though the first half thanks to several 
Aztec mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
A pass interference call on Chris Johnson helped the Miners toward their first 
touchdown. With nine minutes to play in the first quarter, on second-and-17 
from the SDSU 26, Johnson shoved Ricki Lopez from behind as the ball approached 
them. Lopez fell, and a flag followed shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
That gave UTEP the ball at the SDSU 11, and Howard Gasser dumped a short pass 
to freshman Ray Ross, who was cutting across the middle. Ross caught the ball, 
put several moves on free safety Damon Pieri and at least two other Aztecs, and 
scurried into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Pio Sagapolutele blocked Jason Gillespie's point after attempt, and the Aztecs 
maintained the lead -- which they had taken on a two-yard Curtis Butts 
touchdown run -- 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
But two minutes later, Aztec special teams broke down. After a 45-yard Andy 
Trakas field goal put SDSU ahead, 10-6, Ross returned the kick 99 yards for a 
touchdown. Ross fielded the ball at the UTEP 1, broke straight up the middle, 
made it through the seam and easily beat Trakas. It was the second-longest 
kickoff return by an opponent in Aztec history. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the last time UTEP took advantage of first quarter Aztec mistakes. 
After another Trakas field goal -- this one a 24-yarder -- gave SDSU a 16-10 
lead, UTEP moved into SDSU territory on a roughing-the-passer call. Gasser was 
hit late on second-and-12 from the UTEP 40, and the penalty put the Miners at 
the SDSU 45. After an incomplete pass, Gasser again connected with Ross, who 
made a big-time, diving catch at the SDSU 18. Four plays later, Gillespie 
kicked a 31-yard field goal to give UTEP a 16-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec offense, though, had more weapons. T.C. Wright went right up the 
middle for a 47-yard touchdown run on SDSU's next possession, and then, with 
just 1:55 left in the second quarter, Wright scored from the 1 to cap a 
13-play, 89-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Wright finished the first half with 123 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
But the Aztecs had four penalties for 50 yards, and the special teams 
breakdown. That's why the Miners were able to hang close despite being 
outgained in the half, 314-123, and why they they were able to match their 
per-game scoring average of 16 (100th in the nation) in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Just in case you're still not convinced that passing dominates the Western 
Athletic Conference: SDSU's T.C. Wright entered Saturday's game third in the 
conference in rushing -- with an average of just 60.50 yards a game.... Also 
entering Saturday's game, kicker Andy Trakas led the WAC in scoring at 9.22 
points a game.... Defensive end Jason Swaney played football at Coronado High 
in El Paso.... And they wonder why there's no atmosphere in San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium: As fans filtered in before the game Saturday, they were greeted 
by music videos on the DiamondVision. Supposedly, one of the benefits of the 
DiamondVision is that other games could be shown. And USC was playing Notre 
Dame... and this was a college football evening. But no. Music videos. Then, 
during a change of possession with 6:54 left in the first half, a "Don't Be a 
Waterhog" jingle was played over the public address system. Problem was, it 
wasn't a timeout. The SDSU offense lined up, the ball was snapped, and 
quarterback Dan McGwire handed off to Wright ... and through it all, the "Don't 
Be a Waterhog" song continued.

TAR HEELS TRAMPLE THE AZTECS

<P>
His team was overwhelmed, and that left San Diego State Coach Jim Brandenburg 
overcast. 
</P>
<P>
"They just annihilated us," said Brandenburg, his chagrin magnified by North 
Carolina's season-opening, 99-63 victory Saturday over the Aztecs in front of 
21,572 at the Smith Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels, christening Dean Smith's 30th year as their coach, grabbed a 
55-32 halftime lead because of their defense and eased home. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very aggressive and highly intelligent basketball team," Brandenburg 
said. "We played them two years ago (and pushed the Tar Heels into the final 
minute before losing 103-92), and I thought they were good then. They're bigger 
and stronger now." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs stayed close for seven minutes. Then UNC's depth and inside power 
took over. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels led 21-19 and were fighting their nerves, Smith said, so the 
coach went to his bench in a planned substitution and inserted five fresh 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Aztecs) looked poised," Smith said. "I thought they would be 
nervous, because they're such a young team. But we were the ones who were 
nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Into the UNC lineup came forward Clifford Rozier, forward Pat Sullivan and 
guard Brian Reese, all of whom are true freshmen; center Kevin Salvadori, a 
redshirt freshman; and Kenny Harris, a sophomore guard who played little last 
season. But SDSU could not take advantage of the young UNC lineup and let it 
ignite the surge that turned around the game. 
</P>
<P>
The subs scored eight consecutive points, and, despite Brandenburg's second 
timeout of the half, the Tar Heels' momentum wasn't dented. They scored 10 more 
points for a 39-19 lead with seven minutes left before Brandenburg used another 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"We hung in early against them, and we were prepared," Brandenburg said, "but 
as the game went on, all the changing defenses and substitutions took a toll. 
We lost our poise. We panicked, and they got a lot of cheap baskets." 
</P>
<P>
Marty Dow, SDSU's 7-foot-1 senior center, said that he had no idea what happed 
to his team midway through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we really broke down," Dow said. "North Carolina just increased 
its defensive pressure, and we didn't adjust." 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels' defense was smothering during the run. The Aztecs went 6:05 
between points, and in their 12 possessions, they missed five shots, five free 
throws and threw the ball away five times. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs had 14 turnovers in the half. They finished with 26, in addition to 
shooting only 40% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think it was that bad," Dow said. "I think we made a couple of 
decisions that weren't strong and they took advantage of them. We lost our 
composure for a minute." 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels hit 20 of its first 26 shots for a 46-23 lead with 4:27 left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels finished the half shooting 66%. They cooled down considerably in 
the second half and finished at 54% for the game, but the Aztecs still could 
not mount a second-half challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not far enough along to compete with a team like North Carolina," 
Brandenburg said. "Maybe we can next month." 
</P>
<P>
Dow was weakened by the flu, which he said that he has been fighting for almost 
a week. Guards Chris McKinney and Arthur Massey were also slowed by the flu, 
complicating SDSU's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Dow was able to manage only eight points, although he did grab eight rebounds. 
But he had little help on the boards, despite SDSU having seven players who are 
6-7 or taller. The Tar Heels had a 50-36 advantage in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got enough strength inside that they made us look pretty ordinary 
around the basket," Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Massey led SDSU with 18 points but made only six of 18 shots from the field. 
The only other Aztec to reach double figures was forward Keith Balzer, who 
scored 12 in his SDSU debut. 
</P>
<P>
UNC had four players in double figures, however, led by George Lynch, a 6-7 
sophomore forward. He scored 18 points, and his play was indicative of how the 
game went for UNC. Most of his shots came from the lane or just off the 
baselines. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I saw, George was all over the floor," Smith said. "We shot awfully 
well in the first half. My gosh. They were all easy shots." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU returns home for a game Tuesday night against the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that this was a great experience for us to play a 
team of this caliber," Dow said of North Carolina. "It was a great challenge 
for us to see we we are in our preparation and how far we've got to go." 
</P>
<P>
And how far is that? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really sure," Dow said.

VISION OF PLAYOFFS STILL DANCES IN HEADS OF HOPEFUL CHARGERS

To dream the impossible dream? Or just too many hits to the helmet? 
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe we can win our last five games and go to the playoffs," 
Chargers safety Martin Bayless said. "Anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
Anything? 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to win the Super Bowl," linebacker Junior Seau said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have been forewarned. 
</P>
<P>
And so have the Seahawks, Jets, Broncos, Chiefs and Raiders. They are all that 
stands in the way of the Chargers (5-6) from making the playoffs and advancing 
to Tampa for Super Bowl XXV. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we play against three teams that we have beaten already," Bayless 
said. "I could see it if we were playing against teams here on out that we 
haven't faced, but we've played all these teams. We can win the last five." 
</P>
<P>
First up are the Seahawks (4-6), whom the Chargers humiliated in the Kingdome, 
31-14, three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Seattle is saying the same things we're saying," cornerback Gill Byrd said. 
"They believe they're not out of it, and they can still make amends for the 
season by going out and winning the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we beat them in Seattle is not going to sit well with them. And Coach 
Chuck Knox is going to have them ready to play. It's a nationally televised 
game, and they're going to be fired up." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks rebounded from their defeat to the Chargers to upset the Chiefs, 
17-16, in Kansas City. However, they were left in retreat a week ago in a 24-21 
loss to Minnesota in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all playoffs from here on out," Chargers Coach Dan Henning said. "You 
can't afford to take any lost steps backward. We have to come out swinging, and 
we can't get ourselves into a position where we give up 10 points before we 
hand the ball off to Marion Butts. That's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the Chargers went down 10-0 to the Chiefs early in the first 
quarter and never recovered. They went on to lose, 27-10, to trail Houston 
(5-5) and Pittsburgh (5-5) for the third and final wild card playoff berth in 
the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
"We have possibilities if we win to stay in what's called the hunt," Henning 
said. "If we continue to win we will be there. That's our commission right now. 
In our situation, there are teams with five wins who have the chance to be 
there, but we have six losses, so we can't afford any more." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers ended a 10-year skid in Seattle earlier this season scoring a pair 
of third-quarter touchdowns in a span of 32 seconds to pad a 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Nate Lewis returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown, and on Seattle's 
next offensive play, Leslie O'Neal sacked quarterback Dave Krieg and forced a 
fumble that was recovered by teammate Les Miller in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' defense limited Seattle to 194 yards, forced three turnovers and 
collected four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went into that game it seemed like everything was going in Seattle's 
favor," Byrd said. "What seems like a sure win for one team ends up a loss 
because the other team comes in more prepared or their level of play is a 
little higher. 
</P>
<P>
"The score says we beat Seattle 31-14, but it was 17-7 and that was with a 
quarter to play. We got 14 points on two big plays, but you take those away and 
who knows. I don't know how you can look at this game and not think that it's 
going to be a close ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The nation -- minus a blacked out San Diego -- will be viewing this game on 
ESPN tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a difference to everybody because everybody you know is watching 
you," Chargers defensive end Burt Grossman said, "but it's not like you're on 
national TV and the other team is on regional TV. You hear what I'm saying: 
Both teams have that incentive." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have an 11-7 record in night games played in San Diego, including 
a 14-12 victory over the Los Angeles Raiders on ESPN last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think no one needs any extra incentive to go out and win a 
football game that can help put you in the playoffs," quarterback Billy Joe 
Tolliver said. "Besides, TV hasn't reached Boyd (Texas) yet -- cable TV, 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver, who is coming off a pulled groin muscle and bruised knee and elbow, 
completed 11 of 24 passes against Seattle for 145 yards, with an 11-yard 
touchdown pass to Ronnie Harmon, and a 45-yard touchdown strike to Quinn Early. 
</P>
<P>
In his last six starts, Tolliver has thrown five touchdown passes and two 
interceptions and the Chargers have gone 4-2. But it hasn't been enough to 
silence many of the booing hometown fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, apparently the verdict is going to be out on quarterbacks in this league 
until they win a Super Bowl," Tolliver said. "Because in Denver the verdict is 
still out on John Elway for reasons I don't understand. The fans are still down 
on him when he doesn't produce. So that's just the way it is: First incomplete 
pass, and I'll get booed." 
</P>
<P>
With Tolliver at quarterback, the Chargers, however, have defeated their next 
two opponents -- the Seahawks and Jets -- by a combined score of 70-17. Two 
more victories over these two teams, and the Chargers will be 7-6 with a bye 
week to prepare them for the stretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's too far-fetched to say we can win five games in a row," 
defensive tackle Lee Williams said. "I think I'm of sound mind and body when I 
make a statement like that." 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that Williams' idea of a delectable Thanksgiving Day dinner was 
soft-shell turtle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I know some people might think us crazy, but as long as you got a chance, 
that's all you can ask for," Bayless said. "God has worked greater miracles."

TEXAS A&amp;M IN HOLIDAY

Its Cotton Bowl hopes extinguished with Texas' 23-13 victory Saturday over 
Baylor, Texas A&amp;M accepted a bid from the Holiday Bowl after a 56-10 
victory over Texas Christian. 
</P>
<P>
And a few minutes after the traditional trading of congratulations and glowing 
praise between school and bowl officials, Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C. Slocum 
turned his attention to the Holiday Bowl matchup Dec. 29 with No. 4 Brigham 
Young, the Western Athletic Conference champion, and Heisman Trophy candidate 
Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited about the opportunity to play what I think is probably the best 
(college) football team in the country," Slocum said. "That guy Ty Detmer has 
my vote for Heisman Trophy." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Slocum doesn't get a vote, but that's OK. He didn't give defensive 
coordinator Bob Davies a vote on whether the Aggie defense wants to face the 
No. 2 offense in the nation (562 yards and 44 points a game). 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't ask Bob Davies for his vote," Slocum said wryly. "Obviously, the 
head coach made this decision. This presents a great challenge for our defense. 
</P>
<P>
"(Holiday Bowl team selection committee chairman) Vinnie (Vinson) kind of hurt 
my feelings a while ago when he said he thought the (Holiday Bowl) score could 
be 48-47. As an old defensive coordinator, that kind of hurts."

Four regional teams and three individuals won titles in the state high school 
cross-country championships in Woodward Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Hart became the second team in a row from the region to win the Division I 
boys' title and Agoura ended three years of frustration by winning the girls' 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Hart upset Madera, the state's top-ranked team, 58-113, to keep the Division I 
title in the area after Camarillo won it last year. The Indians lost twice this 
season to Madera, the Central Section champion, in the Stanford and Mt. San 
Antonio College invitationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured we would have to have a great team race and (Madera) would have to 
have some problems, and it happened," Hart Coach Gene Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Dixon surged from 12th to third during the second mile of the 5,000-meter 
race and held on to lead Hart with an eighth-place finish in 15 minutes 48 
seconds. Sophomore Keith Grossman was 13th in 15:55 and Hector Chavez placed 
20th in 16:06 for Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's girls avenged second-place finishes the past three years to claim 
their first state championship, beating San Diego Mt. Carmel, 41-68. 
</P>
<P>
Deena Drossin paced the Chargers by winning her third Division I individual 
title in the past four years. She timed 17:29. Teammate Tiffany York finished a 
surprising fourth in 18:14 and sophomore Kristie Camp placed 15th in 19:10. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes, which won the girls' Division I title three times from 1987-89, 
placed a distant fifth with 124 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a long time coming," Agoura Coach Bill Duley said. "(We) felt pretty 
confident (we) were going to win it last year but PV ran a great state meet (in 
a 65-75 win)." 
</P>
<P>
The Fillmore boys' team defeated top-ranked Maranatha for the Division IV 
championship, 90-98, and Nordhoff edged Morro Bay, 77-79, for the girls' 
Division IV title. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's Jorge Barajas sprinted by Richie Boulet of Drake (North Coast 
Section) to finish second in 15:43 behind Brian Singleton (15:41) of Altaville 
Bret Harte. Joel Lopez (16:23) and Victor Hernandez (16:35) placed 13th and 
17th for Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
In winning their first state title, the third-ranked Flashes avenged their loss 
to Maranatha in last week's Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
Dascha Spellman led Nordhoff with an eighth-place finish in 19:00 and was 
followed by freshman teammate Maria Garcia (14th in 19:34) and senior Jennifer 
Kimpton (20th, 19:57). 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Rothman of Westlake posted the fastest girls' time of the day in 
winning the Division II title in 17:28, one second off Drossin's state-meet 
record set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park's Jeff Wilson surged away from San Luis Obispo's James Menon with 
400 yards to go to win the Division III championship in 15:15. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin and Veronica Barajas of Channel Islands finished first and second in 
the Division I race.

Don't get defensive when discussing the Hart High football team. 
</P>
<P>
So what if it's not blowing teams out? So what if it's not scoring 45 points a 
game, throwing six touchdowns through the air as it marches through the 
Southern Section Division III playoffs? Do you have a problem with that, pal? 
</P>
<P>
Now, now. No need to get defensive. That's Hart's job. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it has been -- gulp -- defense that has carried Hart through the 
first two rounds of the playoffs and into Friday's semifinal game against 
unbeaten Esperanza of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Hart High? Defense? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the school that has produced offensive weaponry such as Jimmy Bonds, 
Darren Renfro and Brian Allen has changed its game face in the 1990 playoffs -- 
the school that led all area schools above Division X with a regular-season 
scoring average of 32.7 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians have been settling for low-scoring, hard-hitting affairs. Vince 
Lombardi would be proud. Bill Walsh might not be. 
</P>
<P>
Hart beat Los Alamitos in overtime, 13-10, in the first round and knocked off 
El Modena, 14-7, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena gained just two rushing yards in the second half. The quarterback was 
sacked four times. But the ultimate proof of Hart's defensive prowess came in 
the fourth quarter after El Modena had penetrated to the Hart 28-yard line and 
faced a fourth-and-one situation. But Hart standout defensive end George Kase 
-- all 6-foot-3, 225-pounds of him -- would allow little more. 
</P>
<P>
On an attempted run play, Kase closed. Case closed. El Modena's runner was 
stopped for a three-yard loss and Hart had its victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had two of those types of games in a row," Hart Coach Mike Herrington 
said. "Those were just two great defensive performances." 
</P>
<P>
Don't take offense, Hart fans. But what a defense. 
</P>
<P>
Lassoed: Even the sturdiest of Canyon fans must admit to a case of the nerves 
when Bishop Amat's Steve Molina lined up to attempt a potential game-winning 
kick with 58 seconds left in Canyon's 21-20 thriller of a win Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Molina had easily made field goals of 27 and 41 yards. This attempt of 33 yards 
seemed almost a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
But Canyon wide receiver-defensive back Rob Landtiser and teammates Billy 
Sivley and Rick Johnstad just weren't ready to concede the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
They had a plan. 
</P>
<P>
"They pulled them down and left me a wide-open hole," said a grinning, sweaty, 
muddy Landtiser after the game. 
</P>
<P>
In Canyon's field-goal defense, Sivley, Johnstad and Landtiser have assigned 
roles with designs on blocking kicks. It has worked all year, and it worked 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Sivley lined up over the tight end and crashed hard inside, forcing the tight 
end to collapse with him. Johnstad lined up directly across from the wing back 
and crashed directly at the kick holder. The wing man blocked down on Johnstad. 
</P>
<P>
Landtiser lined up outside Johnstad and also made a beeline for the holder. 
With the wing back and tight end tied up with his teammates, Landtiser took 
four steps and made a giant leap for Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"If he takes five steps, he's just a tenth or two-tenths of a second too late. 
But we saw Landtiser on the film of the last kick. He took just four perfect 
steps," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon has reached the Southern Section semifinals eight years in a row, which 
might be a record. Southern Section spokesman Scott Cathcart said Saturday it 
is unlikely that any team has matched that feat since the Southern Section 
began playoffs in 1915.

VENTURA, OXNARD WINS FLAVORED WITH MIDWEST SPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As far as Chicago reunions go, this would have been like seating Al Capone and 
Elliot Ness at the same table. 
</P>
<P>
Here was Lester Neal, Ventura's star center who hails from Chicago, playing 
against Malcolm X College of Chicago in the semifinals of the Ventura College 
tournament Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura won, 89-86, to set up a title-game matchup against Oxnard, but it was 
hardly happy home week for Neal. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Chicago is known as the Windy City is because its residents 
tend to brag so much, and when the Malcolm X players started blowing some hot 
air Neal's way, he blew his top. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy told me I was the worst thing to come out of Chicago," Neal said. "When 
he said that, I had to go berserk. How could you say something like that? That 
kind of hurt my feelings. I said, 'No, I ain't going for that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Neal scored 17 points, 13 in the second half, grabbed nine rebounds had five 
steals, four assists and blocked three shots. 
</P>
<P>
Neal is a product of Southside Dunbar High, whereas the Malcolm X guys are 
Westsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"They ain't my homeboys, they're just from Chicago," Neal said. "They got off 
light tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Uba Satterfield led all scorers with 32 points, 20 in the first half. 
Jerry Dalton added 23 points for Ventura (5-1). 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard (6-1) rebounded from a six-point second-half deficit to beat El Camino, 
68-61, and avenge its only loss of the season. El Camino had beaten Oxnard, 
70-58, in the Compton tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids have been playing the heck out of the defense," said Remy McCarthy, 
who is off to his best start in three seasons at Oxnard. "I'm in a pretty good 
mood right now." 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Talley, another Chicagoan, led Oxnard with 18 points. Tim Thomas added 15 
points, 10 rebounds and six steals. Don Mitchell also scored 15. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura and Oxnard will meet at 7:30 tonight for the championship.

Cleveland 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Kevin Crider, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 21-5; 1st in league, 9-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The best team in the Valley throughout the 1980s is once 
again the team to beat. But the Cavaliers are not as deep as in previous 
seasons. Cleveland, however, has experience in its starting five. While junior 
forward Brandon Martin (6-foot-4) is the team's lone returning starter, two 
other players saw extensive action in 1989-90, a season in which the Cavaliers 
advanced to the City Section 4-A Division semifinals. Kenny Collins (6-0, 
senior) was the backup point guard and Kayheed Murray (6-5, senior) was the 
third forward, and both rank among the best players in the conference. 
Newcomers Carlos Vasquez and Shawn Bankhead will start at off-guard and center. 
Vasquez (6-2, senior) and Bankhead (6-6, sophomore) played for the junior 
varsity last season. Vasquez ranks among the area's best perimeter shooters and 
Bankhead is the tallest player in the conference. Injuries might hurt the team 
in the short term. Senior guard Sean Gunter (5-11) suffered a broken leg five 
weeks ago but is expected back in early December. Martin, who averaged 13.6 
points to lead all returning conference players, might be the best player in 
the Valley, capable of playing inside or outside. Sophomore Cory Wallace (6-0) 
is Cleveland's backup point guard and will play a vital role in maintaining the 
tempo of Cleveland's pressing defense and running offense. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: If Cleveland adapts to Crider -- the team's fourth coach in a little 
more than one year -- then a third-consecutive league title is likely. 
Cleveland needs consistency from Collins, a transfer from Taft who struggled at 
times in summer-league competition. Murray and Martin give the Cavaliers the 
best forward combination in the area and if Bankhead continues to improve as 
quickly as he has over the past few months, Cleveland could again make a trip 
to the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bob Johnson, 13th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 17-9; 2nd in league, 8-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Highlanders were the only team to defeat Cleveland in 
league play last season and seem to have the experience and speed to pull off a 
repeat performance. Granada Hills has a pair of returning starters in forwards 
Adrian Sellers and Jerry Allen, the team's co-captains. All-league selection 
Sellers (6-4) averaged 11.1 points and eight rebounds and Allen (6-4) averaged 
7.6 points. "Allen is great, really a good player," Johnson said. "He's 
improved so much from last year." Several other returning lettermen give 
Granada Hills the league's best depth. Lettermen include point guard Jevon Lee 
(6-2), off-guard Sagy Koren (5-11) and swingmen Gene Varshtak (6-3) and Ryan 
Cravens (6-2). Cravens was a projected starter a season ago but was 
academically ineligible for most of the season. "He is the best athlete on the 
team -- he could play point guard if I asked him to," Johnson said of Cravens. 
Granada Hills and Taft are the most-experienced teams in the league. "We have 
at least eight guys who can play," Johnson said. "Depth is a definite 
strength." Koren (8.4 average) is a streak shooter who is capable of scoring 
from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Look for the Highlanders to maintain the breakneck pace of a season 
ago when they ran with everybody. "We have to be a running team because we're 
not tall and we can't set up," Johnson said. "We'll fire it up." Production and 
consistency from Lee will be critical -- he replaces Times All-Valley selection 
Jermoine Brantley, who set school records for assists and averaged 20.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taft 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Woodard, 10th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-11; tied for 3rd in league, 4-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Taft's inability to withstand pressure from quicker defenses 
was its Achilles' heel a season ago and improvement in that area alone could 
make the Toreadors a challenger for the league title. But there are other 
reasons to like Taft's chances. "We're deeper and much more experienced," 
Woodard said. "And we're much better at handling the ball." Returning starters 
Casey Sheahan (6-1, junior) and Cornell Hill (6-1, senior) give Taft the 
league's most experienced backcourt. Hill, however, has been sidelined by 
surgery on his right arm and might not play until December. Sheahan averaged 
9.5 points as a sophomore and has improved in the off-season. "He dunks with 
ease and is a much more physical player than people realize," Woodard said. 
Taft has veterans in other areas. Eric Dafney (6-4 1/2), whose half-brother 
Darrin starred at Fremont two years ago, returns and starts at forward. "We'll 
rely on him a lot for scoring and rebounding," Woodard said. Guard Mark Walker 
(6-0) and forward Steve Harris (6-2 1/2) played extensively as reserves a 
season ago and will start as seniors. James Wade, (6-3 senior) was the most 
valuable player on Taft's league-champion and undefeated junior varsity and is 
expected to start at center-forward. Joe Snow (6-0) and Miguel Carrillo (6-2), 
junior varsity standouts last season, will be swingmen. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Depth and perimeter shooting are team strengths, with Sheahan and 
Dafney capable of dropping the long-range bombs from all over the floor. 
"They're the two guys we're looking to for the big numbers," Woodard said. 
Height, however, is a problem. "We're not as tall as we have been," Woodard 
said. "Rebounding is something we'll have to work very hard on. We'll have to 
make up for a lack of height with intensity." Last season, Taft lost four 
consecutive league games by four points or less. Few expect a talented and 
well-seasoned Taft to experience similar straits this season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Yutaka Shimizu, 9th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-12; tied for 3rd in league, 4-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Every season, Shimizu seems to turn a bunch of junior-varsity 
players into a competitive team. With just two returning lettermen, the wily 
coach again has some hard work ahead of him. "We're still searching," Shimizu 
said. "We're going to play a lot of people early and see what happens." The 
team's best player, Athesis Harris, started at center as a sophomore two years 
ago but was academically ineligible last season. Harris (6-4) will again play 
in the post. Senior forward Alan Johnson (6-4) played last season as a reserve. 
Otherwise, the remaining positions in Kennedy's lineup are as up in the air as 
a jump ball. Joe Wyatt, (6-2 1/2 sophomore) is a probable starter at forward. 
Juniors Bobby Winn (6-0) and Shahien Talesh (5-9) are possible starters at 
off-guard and point guard. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Kennedy has no candidates at the moment to replace last season's 
gunner, Garret Anderson, who averaged 23 points to lead conference players in 
scoring. "We've been really balanced (in preseason scrimmages) and I prefer it 
that way," Shimizu said. "Every game it's been another guy. That makes a team 
harder to stop."

SAN PASQUAL RULES CROSS-COUNTRY

<P>
Will Wester, coach of the San Pasqual High cross-country team, recognizes the 
importance of having a solid sixth runner. 
</P>
<P>
And after the state cross-country championships here Saturday at Woodward Park, 
Wester can confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual became the first school to win boys' and girls' cross-country 
championships in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
"We had six kids going for us (on both teams) today," Wester said. "Most teams 
have 1-2-3-4-5 then a gap. We have six." 
</P>
<P>
Having a strong No. 6 runner offers a team a cushion should one of its top five 
not do well. 
</P>
<P>
Tamarra Tyrell, normally the Golden Eagles' sixth runner, finished with her 
team's third-best time Saturday, helping San Pasqual to the girls' Division II 
title, 38-83, over Irvine Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrell, a sophomore, timed 19 minutes, 15 seconds to place 19th overall. Junior 
Deanna Hadley placed eighth in 18:43 to lead San Pasqual, the state's No. 
1-ranked Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
The San Pasqual boys' team, ranked fifth in Division II, scored a 64-86 victory 
over No. 3 Camarillo, last year's state Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual senior Robert Walker ran in the back most of the race before 
surging by Tesfaye Beyene of Newark Memorial in the final stretch to win the 
individual title in 15:25. Beyene's time was 15:29. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of hung out behind (Daniel Das Veves of Helix) and (Beyene) and I 
started reeling them in after two miles," Walker said. "I was kind of worried 
because I could see them behind me (near the finish) and I didn't know if they 
were going to kick or not." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Milena Glusac of Fallbrook timed 17:54 to finish third in the girls' 
Division II race. Westlake Village Westlake's Jeannie Rothman had the fastest 
girls' time, 17:28, and won the Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla girls' team won its second consecutive team championship, but on a 
different level. The Vikings, who won the Division II title a year ago, scored 
31 points Saturday to win the Division III championship handily, beating Santa 
Ana Foothill (102). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, meet announcer Bob Womack confirmed La Jolla won the Division III team 
race before the official results were posted: "La Jolla has won its second 
state title in a row; we can guarantee that," he said as the Vikings' fifth and 
final scorer, freshman Lauren Andrade, crossed the finish line in 21st place. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell just after two miles that they had it unless something really 
drastic happened (in the final mile)," La Jolla Coach Bill Stock said. 
</P>
<P>
Mailee Ferguson, a junior, had missed the state meet the past two years because 
of a stress fracture and an asthma problem, but she led the Vikings Saturday, 
placing fourth with a time of 18:42. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla's score of 31 points is the lowest cumulative total in the history of 
the state meet. Camarillo had 39 points in winning the boys' Division I title 
last year.

CHAPMAN COMPENSATES FOR TURNOVERS TO WIN TITLE

<P>
Sixteen first-half turnovers didn't bother Chapman College Coach Bob Boyd 
Saturday night in the championship game of the Chapman/Doubletree Basketball 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Chapman's defense held Grand Canyon (2-1) to 25 first-half 
points on 35% shooting, and the Panthers (4-0) survived a second-half Grand 
Canyon rally for a 77-69 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems there is a trade-off with the turnovers and the shots we get," Boyd 
said. "We may throw some passes away under pressure, but we'll get a lot more 
chances to slam it in the goal." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman center Roger Middleton did much of that for Boyd, scoring the majority 
of his team-high 22 points from inside. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Hill, the tournament Most Valuable Player, handled Chapman's outside 
scoring, making three of four three-point shots and finishing with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman made 57% of its field goals but still needed some clutch free-throw 
shooting to hold off Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers made 22 of 28 free throws from the line, including sixth man Chuck 
McGavran's six of six in the final three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the win, because I think we beat a pretty good team," Boyd 
said, "and although Grand Canyon disrupted us at times, we adjusted well to 
their changing defenses." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's Frantz Reyes, who earned all-tournament honors along with Middleton 
and Hill, finished with 15 points. Eric Taylor led Grand Canyon with 17 points, 
16 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
In the tournament consolation game: 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College 98, Seattle 85 -- SCC's Mike Henjum scored 27 
points, and Jeff Bickmore added 26 and nine rebounds to lead the Vanguards 
(2-1) in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Bickmore earned all-tournament honors along with Everett Edwards, who scored 22 
points for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
After leading by two at halftime, SCC made 66% of its shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards made seven of 11 three-points shots, Henjum making four of six 
and adding a team high six assists.

CHULA VISTA ROLLS PAST MIRA MESA, 35-6

<TEXT>
<P>
The wicked temptation is to assume the Chula Vista football team was the loser 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Host Chula Vista stomped Mira Mesa, 35-6, in a 3-A quarterfinal playoff game to 
earn a date with top-ranked Morse next Friday in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Some fun. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I know we're going to be outmanned," Chula Vista Coach George Ohnesorgen 
said. "We'd have to play a perfect game to beat those guys. But if we have to 
go out, we'll go out against the No. 1 team." 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans sent Mira Mesa (9-3) out with relative ease Saturday. Using a 
powerful running game sparked by running backs Steve Gomez and Neviett 
Richardson, Chula Vista (10-2) scored on three of its first four possessions to 
take control. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez finished with 160 yards in 20 carries and four touchdowns. Richardson 
added 120 yards in 18 carries. Throughout the game, Gomez ran through wide gaps 
in the line and then trampled over anybody who got in his way. He made up his 
mind early on to avenge Chula Vista's 6-0 loss to Mira Mesa during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew at the beginning of the game they weren't going to bring me down," he 
said. "I was fired up." 
</P>
<P>
And Mira Mesa's fire was extinguished in the first quarter when its top 
offensive threat, running back Wayne Pittman, left the game with an ankle 
sprain. Pittman was the county's third leading rusher during the regular season 
with 1,604 yards. He played three downs Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody kind of lost their spirit when I got hurt," he said. "I don't know 
why, because the game shouldn't revolve around one person." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista took a 15-0 halftime lead on a 41-yard Gomez touchdown run, a 
22-yard field goal by Rod Rodriguez and an eight-yard Gomez touchdown run after 
a 40-yard drive. Gomez had 107 of his game-high rushing totals by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa made a brief bid to get back into the game on their first possession 
of the third quarter, driving to Chula Vista's 32 before quarterback Mike 
Bovee's pass was intercepted at the 25 by linebacker Donnie Edwards and 
returned to the Mira Mesa 17. Gomez covered all 17 yards on a run up the middle 
for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead. From then on, the Spartans coasted.

It's a difficult thing, bucking history. Point Loma discovered that. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista continued to remain unbeaten in section playoff games, 
winning its ninth consecutive with a 27-12 victory Saturday night over Point 
Loma in front of 4,200 at Vista High School. 
</P>
<P>
RBV will play Palomar League rival Orange Glen in the semifinals Saturday at a 
site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the Longhorns' menagerie of backs shone at one time or another. But it 
was the defense which ultimately provided the difference in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is where I thought we played exceptionally well," RBV Coach Craig Bell 
said. "The key to our defense is controlling the run and to get them throwing 
late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns (10-2) limited Point Loma to 213 total yards and intercepted two 
fourth-quarter passes -- one by Mark Pallotto and the other by Eric Borgeson. 
</P>
<P>
Pallotto's interception with 5:48 left in the game came with RBV clinging to a 
13-6 lead. But on the first play after the interception, Markeith Ross dashed 
64 yards and David Leese's PAT made it 20-6. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma (9-2) came back, driving 77 yards in the following two minutes and 
scoring on a 16-yard pass from Toby Gault to Shaunta Baker with 3:43 remaining. 
The two-point conversion failed when Gary Griffie applied pressure to Gault, 
and Fune Moi deflected the pass. 
</P>
<P>
RBV recovered the ensuing onside kick at the Point Loma 46. Six plays later, 
Ross scored from the eight with 1:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
Borgeson then picked off Gault's first pass of the ensuing drive and the 
Longhorns ran out the clock. RBV's offense dominated the game with 385 yards on 
the ground.

With the victory, SDSU Coach Rudy Suwara believes the Aztecs will receive an 
at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. The Aztecs, which finished the regular 
season 23-11 and ranked 19th in the nation, should find out for sure tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident we'll get a bid," Suwara said. "If we'd have lost to Notre 
Dame, we would have been frightened." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
The Gulls, who continue to be one of the International Hockey League's best 
road teams, defeated the Kansas City Blades, 3-1, in front of 10,041 at Kemper 
Arena Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls (11-9-2), second in the Western Division with 24 points, are 6-0-1 in 
their past seven road games, 6-2-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive victory for the Gulls, in the middle of a 
six-game road trip, their longest of the season. Kansas City fell to 4-17-1, 
last in the Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls were led by goalie Alain Chevrier, making his first start since being 
sent down by the Detroit Red Wings, who stopped 18 of 19 shots. Dennis Holland 
had two assists, giving him 18 points in his last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Darrin Smith scored at 2:13 of the first period to give the Blades a 1-0 lead, 
marking the 17th time in 22 games that the Gulls have given up the first goal. 
But Derek Mayer, with assists from Holland and Brent Sapergia, tied the game, 
1-1, later in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Holland then assisted on Robbie Nichols' goal, one of two power-play goals by 
the Gulls in the second period after Kansas City's Troy Frederick received a 
major penalty for boarding. Nichols scored the second goal of the power play 
off an assist from Taylor Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gober scored the other goal at 19:29, getting assists from Mayer and Darcy 
Norton. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls outshot the Blades, 20-5, in the second period and 29-19 in game. The 
Gulls also gained ground on the Peoria Rivermen, who lead the Western Division. 
The Rivermen lost for the second consecutive night, falling to the Milwaukee 
Admirals, 1-0, in overtime.

LONG BEACH PLANS TO DRESS UP ITS BLUE LINE ROUTE; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: LONG BEACH BOULEVARD PROJECT COULD TAKE 35 YEARS TO COMPLETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man lights a cigarette and leans against the wall of a bar called the USS 
Someplace. There is almost no one else on the broad sidewalks of Long Beach 
Boulevard. Every 10 minutes a sleek Blue Line train glides past, and even the 
businesses that are not run down or boarded up seem shabby by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is counting on the light rail to deliver thousands of tourists to 
its reviving downtown shoreline of fancy restaurants and pretty hotels. But the 
transit route that takes them there is a boulevard of neglect -- a sad strip of 
dying car dealerships, an epidemic of fast-food restaurants, several tire 
stores, a string of auto repair shops, a liquor store with barred windows and a 
funeral parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Now the city, driven in part by the Blue Line's revealing spotlight, is 
planning to make the granddaddy of all its streets whole again with one of the 
biggest redevelopment projects ever put together by City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Their first sight of Long Beach is not as pretty as we would like. It should 
be like a nice entry into a beautiful home," said Mayor Ernie Kell, whose 
clearest memory of the boulevard is Nov. 22, 1950, when he stood on one of its 
busy corners waiting for a train, a draft notice in his hip pocket. "We need to 
dress up the boulevard and make her look the way she was." 
</P>
<P>
What city officials envision is something akin to New York's Park Avenue or 
Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, an urban nerve center of apartments, tree-lined 
sidewalks, beauty salons, markets and other amenities, all a short walk from 
one of the most modern light rail systems running today. 
</P>
<P>
The revival would run a jagged four-mile course from the San Diego Freeway to 
the ocean, taking in Pacific and Elm avenues, and several adjacent streets. 
</P>
<P>
A moratorium bans at least until next April the construction of any more 
fast-food restaurants or shopping centers, and workmen are already planting 
towering palm trees along the boulevard's tired sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
It could be a year before it is officially declared a redevelopment area -- a 
designation that gives the city expanded power to move boundaries, create 
designs and exclude businesses and buildings it deems undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
It could be 35 years before the revival is finished. But in the end, city 
officials muse, it will be a sort of resurrection, restoring dignity to a 
stretch of road once so revered it was chosen to bear the city's name. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars abandoned Long Beach Boulevard for the freeway. Now the freeways are 
jammed and people are coming back to Long Beach Boulevard to ride the light 
rail," Councilman Ray Grabinski said. "She's rising up out of the ashes." 
</P>
<P>
It was known as American Avenue until May 1, 1959, when the city gave its name 
to the widest boulevard in town. In its heyday in the 1940s and '50s, Long 
Beach Boulevard was the gateway to this city, studded with car dealerships, 
auto body paint stores and repair shops that brimmed with business as Southern 
California fell in love with the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne's barbershop gave some of the best flattops around. Down the center ran 
the Red Car, packed with sailors and tourists heading for the ocean and the 
famed Pike amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here at 13, Long Beach was the most exciting city I'd ever seen," 
Grabinski remembered. "The boulevard was sprawling and full of excitement. And 
at the end of it was the Pike -- the epitome of what you asked God for when you 
went to bed at night." 
</P>
<P>
Then the state built the Long Beach Freeway and the boulevard was dethroned as 
the city's grand entryway. The Red Car took its final ride in 1961. The Pike 
decayed and finally closed in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The boulevard was looking tattered. Fast-food outlets and strip shopping malls 
sprouted and merchants struggled against graffiti. The advent of the auto mall 
-- a veritable supermarket of automobiles -- sprang up in nearby cities like 
Cerritos, and the once thriving Long Beach dealerships began to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
The last decade has brought to the boulevard mostly uncertainty and confusion. 
Talk of building a new light rail line where the old Red Car had run frightened 
some merchants who thought that years of messy construction would be their 
demise. 
</P>
<P>
They went to court to block construction and lost. Two years of dust and 
disruption began. Some stores pulled out and the ones that stayed had little 
incentive to spruce up, merchants and city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the few auto dealers that remain are leaving for the auto malls and the 
city's grand dame is looking anything but stately. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the boulevard's very death that is giving city officials visions of 
new life. It is the perfect time, they say, to wield municipal powers to 
reshape lots and design the boulevard of their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the Planning Commission and City Council have approved preliminary 
boundaries to declare Long Beach Boulevard and its environs a redevelopment 
area even larger than the ambitious downtown renaissance, said Community 
Development Director Susan Shick. 
</P>
<P>
Such a declaration involves complex legalities that could take 10 months to 
meet, including the creation of a "project area committee," elected by 
residents affected by the project to represent local interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Redevelopment is a graphic statement that change is in the air and that it is 
controversial," Shick said. "It's hard to do something deliberately 
controversial and know it, but in this case I don't see any other way." 
</P>
<P>
Debate already has begun over whether the project should begin at all. The 
boulevard's shallow lots will have to be expanded to accommodate the kinds of 
businesses and condominiums city officials have in mind, meaning some homes 
along adjacent streets will have to be destroyed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows how many houses might go or which ones. But some residents of the 
surrounding neighborhoods -- many of them elderly or retired -- have already 
made it clear that they won't be displaced. 
</P>
<P>
"These are working people and retired. People who have been in their homes 30, 
40, 50 years, and they don't want to be disturbed," said Councilman Clarence 
Smith, whose district encompasses most of the houses that could be threatened. 
"If they don't buy into this, I'm not going to support it." 
</P>
<P>
For some homeowners, though, it could be a bonanza. The city is promising to 
relocate anyone who owns and lives in a single-family home threatened by 
redevelopment. That means, for example, that the owner of a $200,000 home with 
a $30,000 mortgage and a monthly payment of $200 must be restored to the same 
debt and payment in a similar neighborhood, even if the homes there are selling 
for twice the price. 
</P>
<P>
"Financially," Shick said, "they will not be hurt at all." 
</P>
<P>
If it succeeds, city officials say, the redevelopment would not only 
resuscitate four miles of boulevard but an urban lifestyle that fell to ruin 
when Southern Californians headed for the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential is there for people who love to live in the city, " said Don 
Westerland, board chairman of the Long Beach Redevelopment Agency. "This will 
attract people from places like Boston and Philadelphia, people who look at 
apartment living in different ways, who don't want to live 16 blocks from where 
they shop. People who want to get on the light rail and go south to the heart 
of Long Beach or north to the heart of L.A. What a terrific option."

CONSTRUCTION: THE FREEWAY GOLIATH, A FORMER TIRE PLANT, IS BEING RESURRECTED AS 
A $120-MILLION COMPLEX. IT WILL INCLUDE OFFICE BUILDINGS AND A HOTEL.

<P>
For years, the abandoned Uniroyal tire plant alongside the Santa Ana Freeway 
was a shabby monument to an era when a rapidly growing Los Angeles attracted 
the nation's major tire producers. 
</P>
<P>
The plant was boarded up in 1978 after tires were manufactured there for nearly 
half a century. Its windows were broken and its facade was dingy from exposure 
to years of freeway exhaust fumes. 
</P>
<P>
But the imposing factory, built to resemble an Assyrian palace complete with 
turrets, never ceased to turn the heads of the tens of thousands of motorists 
who pass each day. Its stylized facade had done a good job of concealing a 
collection of steel buildings in the City of Commerce, five miles south of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Now the freeway Goliath is being resurrected as a $120-million complex of 
office buildings, retail stores and a hotel. Some of the stores opened for 
business earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists laud the work done by developer Trammell Crow Co. to breathe 
new life into the structure. Its six-story administration building is intact, 
as is all but about 150 feet of its massive wall. Even a portion of the tire 
plant's original metal-truss ceiling has been retained as a decorative cover 
for a food court. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a question of whether it was going to survive in the long run," said 
Jay Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy. "It's a very 
important reminder that Southern California was second only to Detroit as a 
center of the automobile industry for a good part of the century, and second 
only to Akron (Ohio) in producing tires. 
</P>
<P>
"Those industries associated with cars had a great impact on the development of 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
The human-headed, winged bulls surrounding the entrance to the administration 
building have been spruced up, as have the winged genii and kings who grace the 
turrets along the massive wall. Steel reinforcing beams have been added to make 
the building and wall earthquake-safe. A fresh coat of paint covers the royal 
facade. The firm that designed the colors for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los 
Angeles produced the paint scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Newly cast friezes depicting Assyrian warriors in horse-drawn chariots adorn 
the lobby of the tower, which served as the administration building for tire 
manufacturer Adolph Schleicher in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Offices in the tower are being leased, as is space in newly constructed office 
buildings. Construction has not yet started on the hotel. The entire project 
will not be finished for more than a year, a Trammell Crow spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But for the last decade, the plant had been a tombstone marking the death of 
Los Angeles' robust tire industry that sprung up in the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's tire manufacturers were entrenched in Akron in the early part of 
this century. Charles Goodyear, the inventor of vulcanized rubber, established 
his factory there in 1871. 
</P>
<P>
But Southern California was growing, and its longstanding love for the 
automobile made it increasingly attractive to the tire industry. Akron was a 
long way from the growing Western market. 
</P>
<P>
Schleicher had started his Samson Tire and Rubber Co. in a tiny wood-frame 
factory in Compton in 1918. Schleicher chose the name because it symbolized 
strength and endurance, and his future factory would symbolize the same. 
</P>
<P>
In 1920, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. became the first of the four major 
tire companies to open a plant in Los Angeles. The B.F. Goodrich Co. opened its 
factory in 1928, the same year the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. opened shop. 
</P>
<P>
Schleicher decided to make his push for a bigger share of the market, and in 
1928, started developing his new factory, according to Martin Weil, a 
restoration architect who wrote a brief history of the old tire plant. He hired 
the prominent Los Angeles architectural firm of Morgan, Walls and Clements to 
design the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The local tire manufacturer had named his company after the biblical Israelite 
judge, noted for his great strength. His building would embody the same 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently there was one problem: Little archeological research had been 
done in Palestine at the time, and there was virtually no information about the 
architecture of biblical Israel, Weil said. So the designers turned to Assyria 
for architectural style. 
</P>
<P>
Assyria was an ancient empire in Southwest Asia, in the region of the upper 
Tigris River, that reached its height in the 7th Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
Architectural detail in the old tire plant is from three Assyrian cities: 
Nimrud, Khorsabad and Nineveh, Weil said. The administration building and walls 
were based on the ziggurats and fortified walls of Khorsabad. 
</P>
<P>
The plant's groundbreaking ceremony on Jan. 23, 1929, was marked with a parade 
and other festivities. One Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce official declared: 
"Los Angeles now is known as the Akron of the West." 
</P>
<P>
The plant would cost $8 million to build and employ 2,500 people. It would 
churn out 6,000 tires and 10,000 tubes a day. 
</P>
<P>
Schleicher and the rest of the tire czars were looking forward to banner sales 
when the stock market crashed on Oct. 29, 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, the plant opened in May, 1930, with little celebration. 
Schleicher did not weather the Depression for long; in five months, he had 
concluded negotiations to sell his firm. 
</P>
<P>
United States Tire and Rubber Co. took over the Samson Tire factory in 1931, 
becoming the last of the Big Four tire manufacturers to move into Los Angeles. 
U.S. Tire later became Uniroyal. 
</P>
<P>
The plant continued producing mostly tires and tubes. For a short time during 
World War II, the plant made self-sealing rubber gas tanks for military 
aircraft, said Charles Elliott, who was hired by Commerce officials to write a 
city history. 
</P>
<P>
The area's tire industry was thriving, but things began to change rapidly in 
the 1960s. The emergence of foreign-built cars in the United States meant there 
was less demand for new, American-made tires. The Los Angeles factories had 
aging equipment that needed expensive updating. 
</P>
<P>
For those and other reasons, the last of the Big Four tire manufacturers left 
the Los Angeles area in 1980. The Uniroyal plant had shut down two years 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-acre Uniroyal site was then owned for several years by fireworks magnate 
and convicted political corrupter W. Patrick Moriarty. Commerce bought the 
property from Moriarty in 1983, and now leases the site to Trammell Crow. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce officials designated the old factory a cultural and historic landmark 
years ago. The site was never included in the National Register of Historic 
Places even though state officials determined it was eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow won the right to develop the project after assuring city 
officials that it would tread lightly on the landmark. It has spent $6 million 
to restore and renovate the administration building and wall, said Trammell 
Crow partner Hayden C. Eaves III. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born and raised in Los Angeles," Eaves said. "To have done anything less 
than we have done would have been a disaster to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow hired various restoration and design experts to work on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The administration building and wall are designed to look as if they were 
constructed from huge blocks. But the structures are made of reinforced 
concrete, mostly eight inches thick, which was poured into molds at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Structural engineer David L. Houghton came up with a system to reinforce the 
administration building and wall to resist earthquakes. Almost all of the 
original metal manufacturing buildings to the rear have been razed and new 
construction has gone up in their place. 
</P>
<P>
A Gardena firm, which has done work for movie studios, was brought in to 
replicate the friezes and other ornaments that had been damaged over the years. 
Sussman/Prejza and Co. Inc. of Culver City was hired to develop the color 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis indicated the wall had been painted before, a Sussman/Prejza 
spokeswoman said. It was covered by dark, greenish colors that led some to 
speculate that the factory had been camouflaged during the war. But Elliott, 
who is writing the history of Commerce, said he has not encountered any 
evidence of that. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark has been brightened with a subtle combination of ivory, salmon, 
amber and grey-green. The relief work was left unpainted. The Los Angeles 
Conservancy approved the treatment.

PEOPLE: COLLEGE COUNSELOR PEDALS FAST TO KEEP TRACK OF ATHLETES' ACADEMIC 
PROGRESS 
</P>

Virginia Romero rides a bike to get around the 140-acre Cerritos College campus 
and perform her job as athletic counselor. 
</P>
<P>
She uses the bicycle so she can move quickly to solve any academic problems 
involving the 545 student athletes at the school, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have to take a transcript to a coach to let him know immediately how a 
player is doing," Romero said. "I might want to talk with an athlete at the gym 
during a class break." 
</P>
<P>
Other times, Romero can be found huddled in her small, cramped space in the 
admissions office, counseling students or talking on the telephone with coaches 
or counselors from other colleges and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Romero is one of only 12 athletic counselors in the state's 107-community 
college system. She is the only one in the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
The college's seven-member board of trustees appointed Romero to the athlete 
counseling job in August. "The board is committed to ensuring the success of 
our athletes as students," said Mark Wallace, director of public information. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said her job is to make sure athletes are taking the proper classes and 
maintaining a 2.0 grade-point average to graduate from the two-year school and 
transfer to four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"All students are special, but athletes need special attention to achieve as 
students and fulfill their athletic obligation," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
She said athletes need special attention because 90% of them work part time 
while carrying 15 units and practicing three to four hours daily in their 
chosen sport. 
</P>
<P>
In the next couple of months, Romero said she will be setting up a computerized 
program to keep track of the athletes' academic progress. She also plans to 
schedule workshops with high school coaches and counselors to prepare student 
athletes for the rigors of college life. 
</P>
<P>
Before Romero took her present position, she taught health and physical 
education classes at Cerritos College for 11 years. Previously, she coached 
high school athletics in the ABC Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
She attended Cerritos College and has a bachelor's degree in physical education 
from Cal State Long Beach. She also has a master's degree in counseling from 
Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach City College has honored 21 of its 700 part-time instructors for 
having taught at the college for more than 20 years. Five of them were featured 
recently in the school's newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Apfel has been teaching business at the college since 1957. Apfel is 
retired. He was a teacher for 33 years in the Long Beach Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Wulfsberg also teaches business classes at the college. He retired from 
Long Beach Unified in 1987 as a high school counselor. 
</P>
<P>
Math instructor Lois Barth has taught at the 30,000-student college for more 
than 20 years on a part-time basis, while working full time as a junior high 
school math teacher in the Long Beach unified district. 
</P>
<P>
Art instructor Joan Binkoff joined the college in 1966. An art designer, 
Binkoff has exhibited her prints, photographs and drawings throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hopkins is the evening dean at the college. Hopkins is a former 
administrator in the Long Beach Unified School District. He was there for 36 
years, teaching woodworking and math at both the district and the college 
before going into administration. 
</P>
<P>
* Tim Keeler, executive director of local cable TV Channel 53, has been honored 
by the Whittier branch of the American Assn. of University Women. Keeler was 
given a certificate of appreciation for helping the branch produce "Care Giving 
-- You Are Alone," a 15-minute video on health care and convalescent facilities 
for the elderly in the Whittier area. Keeler provided training and editing 
assistance to the branch members during a two-year period when the video was 
being made. 
</P>
<P>
* Whittier resident Deborah Lopez has been hired as an administrative assistant 
in the Personnel and Redevelopment Department for the city of Pico Rivera. 
Lopez has a bachelor's degree in psychology from Whittier College and is 
seeking a master's degree in public administration from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
* Long Beach resident William V. Davidson has been selected chairman of the 
19-member board of trustees for Chadwick School, a small private college 
preparatory school on the Palos Verdes Peninsula that serves kindergarten 
through 12th-grade students. A graduate of Chadwick and USC's law school, 
Davidson is general partner of the Davidson Group, a Long Beach industrial real 
estate development company. 
</P>
<P>
* Cal State Long Beach associate professor Michael Agopian has been appointed 
chief deputy director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics in the U.S. 
Department of Justice by President George Bush. The bureau is responsible for 
collecting, analyzing and disseminating crime statistics. 
</P>
<P>
* Marina Anaya has received the Toastmasters Communication Achievement Award. 
Anaya is the newly appointed assistant superintendent of schools for curriculum 
for the Whittier Union High School District. Anaya introduced Toastmasters 
youth leadership programs to several hundred students at Santa Fe and Pioneer 
high schools, where she was an administrator before being promoted. The 
students received training in public speaking and leadership skills. 
</P>
<P>
* Patrick Wong recently won second place in architectural drafting in the 
community colleges Skills Olympics at Tulsa, Okla. Wong graduated from Rio 
Hondo College in June. He is studying urban and regional planning at Cal Poly 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
* Nine Holmes Elementary School students have received awards and money for 
posters they produced during a recent fire prevention contest sponsored by the 
Los Angeles City Housing Authority for residents of public housing projects. 
The students live at the Pueblo Del Rio Housing Project near Huntington Park. 
First-place winners received $50, second place $30 and third place $20. First 
place winners were Saloeun Srey, Sinoun Von and Saroeum Chan. Kasol Dith, David

COUNTY JOINS WITH CITIES IN TRASH-REDUCTION EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-one cities in Southeast Los Angeles County and the county Department of 
Public Works have agreed to join together in an effort to comply with a state 
law that requires them to reduce the amount of trash generated within their 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, the county 
became the final agency to join the Southeast Area Integrated Waste Management 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
City and county officials said the group will save money by combining to design 
a plan to reduce solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County residents and businesses dump a total of 50,000 tons of 
garbage a day -- enough to fill Dodger Stadium in nine days. Landfills are 
quickly becoming overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 state Integrated Solid Waste Management Act requires local governments 
to reduce the amount of trash they send to landfills 25% by 1995 and 50% by the 
year 2000. Cities and counties that don't meet the trash-reduction goals can be 
fined up to $10,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast group is one of half a dozen in which the county has joined with 
cities to comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday also allocated $94,000 to pay for its share 
of a study by EMCON Associates, a Burbank-based firm that will assess the trash 
that Southeast cities are dumping and how to reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the 21 cities that have joined the Southeast group must still 
approve the contract with the consulting firm, which will be paid a total of 
$538,000, said Mike Mohajer, the county Department of Public Works engineer who 
coordinates recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Cities that have joined the Southeast group are Artesia, Bell, Bellflower, Bell 
Gardens, Cerritos, Commerce, Compton, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, Huntington 
Park, La Mirada, Lakewood, Lynwood, Maywood, Norwalk, Paramount, Pico Rivera, 
Santa Fe Springs, Signal Hill, South Gate and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Cities that are not part of such groups must draw their own plans for garbage 
reduction. The plans must be submitted to the county by July 1 of next year. 
</P>
<P>
EMCON and its subcontractors need to perform several tasks to meet that 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
First, they must assess the types and quantities of garbage that Southeast 
communities are shipping to the county's landfills. Researchers will analyze 
and weigh representative loads of garbage as they are dumped during a one-week 
test period, said EMCON project manager Mike Dean. 
</P>
<P>
The garbage must be broken into 172 distinct categories based primarily on 
types of materials and where they were produced, Mohajer said. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants will then recommend how much of each type of waste can be 
diverted -- either by recycling, composting or reductions at the source. The 
latter, for example, could include encouraging consumers to photocopy on both 
sides of paper or to use cloth diapers instead of disposable ones, Dean said.

RELATIVES LEARN TO COPE WITH ALZHEIMER'S OVER THE HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The elderly Hollywood man was talking about Thanksgiving at a recent workshop 
on helping families cope with Alzheimer's disease during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are great," said the man, 80, who takes care of his 
Alzheimer's-afflicted wife of 51 years. Thanksgiving is not only good for the 
person with the disease, he said, "it's also good for the care-giver because it 
gives them a chance to relax with other people." 
</P>
<P>
The man smiled. And then he burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
The holidays are often hellish for families dealing with Alzheimer's and other 
conditions that produce dementia or loss of cognitive abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood man, for instance, was uncertain whether he and his spouse would 
be able to join their son in San Diego for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
His wife has been suffering from a bladder infection recently, and her 
progressive brain disorder is constantly producing new deficits and 
complications. Since she became ill, the woman is anxious whenever she travels. 
Her husband worried that the unfamiliar pounding of the wheels of the train 
would unnerve her. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost too much to bear, especially alone, the man made clear. When you 
have Alzheimer's in the family, he said before his tears drove him from the 
room in embarrassment, "everybody walks away." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent workshop in Century City, the Los Angeles chapter of the 
Alzheimer's Assn. and the Westside Consortium of Senior Services offered 
Alzheimer's care-givers practical advice and the bitter solace of knowing that 
others are suffering, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are often a very joyful time, but they can also be very, very 
difficult," said Lynn Morishita, program director for the Center for Geriatric 
Health at Century City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The grown-up children of people with Alzheimer's routinely feel cheated, the 
experts said. The children gather around the table, remembering when Mom or Dad 
successfully stage-managed beloved holiday traditions, and they see only loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Holidays carry a lot of emotional wallop," said Nina Luce, a Santa Monica 
marriage and family counselor who specializes in geriatric issues. "We remember 
how it was, and if we don't get it, we're crushed." 
</P>
<P>
Holidays often precipitate a crisis among siblings, the speakers pointed out. 
Family members who live elsewhere often come home for the holidays only to 
discover that a parent or grandparent is much worse than they had realized from 
long-distance phone calls. Brothers and sisters sometimes blame the sibling who 
does most of the care-giving, who in turn typically feels overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed that a good first step in dealing with Alzheimer's is to 
have a family consultation with a caseworker or someone else with expertise in 
dementia and the medical, emotional and legal problems it creates. The earlier 
the family begins to think about these issues, the better, they said. For 
example, the Jewish Family Service, Santa Monica, is a nonprofit agency that 
provides such services to anyone on a sliding fee scale. 
</P>
<P>
The experts also recommended that the family arrange to have the affected 
individual evaluated at a good geriatric health center. Some of the 
deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's are treatable, they said. For example, 
better diet may help a little. "A lot of older people are living on toast and 
tea," Luce pointed out. A complete evaluation will not only reveal what's wrong 
with the affected person, but also help the family take full advantage of those 
abilities that remain, Morishita said. 
</P>
<P>
Two sisters at the workshop admitted they dreaded the thought of Thanksgiving. 
They planned to fly to Arizona, where they were to have a turkey dinner with 
their father, then visit their mother, 66, who has been institutionalized with 
Alzheimer's for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real depressing," the younger sister said. "They have all these (holiday) 
cards and ads on TV, and they just make you feel worse." 
</P>
<P>
Morishita said such sadness is normal. The person with dementia "is here, but 
they are not the person they were." Their loved ones, she said, "are grieving 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
One reason the holidays are so difficult is that they underscore the role 
reversal that is one of the most painful aspects of dealing with dementia. 
</P>
<P>
As Joyce Brunelle, who does public relations for the Westside consortium, said: 
"Two things that life never prepares us for are parenting and parenting our own 
parent." Unfortunately, she noted, the intense emotion that Alzheimer's 
triggers in a family often complicates the coping process, which involves 
making difficult decisions about everything from where the patient will live to 
who will control his or her money. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very practical at this stage," Brunelle said. "You have to be 
very dispassionate about it." 
</P>
<P>
The speakers urged care-givers to give themselves a break over the holidays. 
Less is more, the experts said. Don't try to replicate the lavish holidays of 
the past, but pick a few favorite traditions and concentrate on them. 
Simplified holiday activities are also easier on the person with Alzheimer's, 
who is often unsettled by changes in routine and unusual bustle and clutter. 
</P>
<P>
Start to prepare the affected person for the coming holiday well in advance by 
marking the calendar, having daily discussions of what the family will do, 
playing holiday music and, when feasible, making holiday foods. 
</P>
<P>
As Thanksgiving gives way to Hanukkah and Christmas, gifts become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
People with dementia often enjoy videotapes of family members, the experts 
said. And Brunelle noted that some people like to give a donation in the name 
of the person with Alzheimer's to a charity that was especially important to 
him or her before life changed forever.

Residents will have the opportunity to get rid of unwanted bulky items around 
the house by taking part in the city's fall cleanup program. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are sponsoring the second major cleanup effort this year on Nov. 
30, Dec. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
Shrubs, appliances, furniture, yard debris and other trash not readily accepted 
by the general collection service will be accepted at the City Yard, 21815 
Pioneer Blvd. Public Works Department crew members are scheduled to be on duty 
to accept discarded items from 5 to 10 p.m. Nov. 30, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Dec. 1, 
and 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Spray cans, old paint, lacquer, glue and solvents, petroleum products like oil 
and gasoline, and cleaning agents are considered hazardous waste and will not 
be accepted. A program to discard these materials is currently being developed. 
</P>
<P>
The fall cleanup program is free. Residents must provide proof of residency by 
showing identification and must have the mailer sent by the city. Those who did 
not receive a mailer can obtain one at City Hall prior to the start of the 
program. Participants must provide their own manpower to handle the items to be 
discarded. Senior citizens or handicapped residents needing assistance to 
discard items may contact City Hall at 420-2641 from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Nov. 
30.

YOUR MORTGAGE;

<P>
FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE INCREASE LOAN LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you have been hoping to buy your first home, or if you have been thinking 
about refinancing your existing mortgage, a little-noticed announcement by two 
quasi-governmental agencies last week could provide you with a reason to give 
thanks. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal National Mortgage Assn., commonly called Fannie Mae, and the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, said they would soon begin 
buying mortgages as big as $191,250 -- up from their current limit of $187,450. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a huge increase, but every little bit helps -- especially if you live 
in an expensive housing market like the one we have in California," said Bob 
Garman, senior vice president with Directors Home Loan Mortgage Corp. in 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don't make loans directly to borrowers. Instead, 
they buy loans that have been made by private financial institutions, pool them 
and then sell shares in the pools to investors. 
</P>
<P>
The lenders then take the cash they get from Fannie or Freddie and use it to 
make new loans to other borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the federal Housing Finance Board adjusts Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac's loan limits based on changes in the price of a typical American home. 
</P>
<P>
Because prices in the West and many other parts of the country have been 
falling, some experts had predicted that the loan limit would actually drop 
instead of rise. 
</P>
<P>
But steady appreciation in the Midwest and a few other parts of the country 
offset price weakness in other segments of the U.S. housing market, allowing 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to raise their limits. 
</P>
<P>
The $3,800 increase will primarily help would-be buyers and refinancers in 
California and other high-cost states, Garman said, because that's where most 
large loans are made. 
</P>
<P>
The increase is expected to help 5,000 buyers get a lower-rate mortgage in 
California alone, according to researchers at the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the ceiling won't have any effect on you if you're only 
looking for a $100,000 loan," banker Garman said. "But if you're looking for a 
much larger loan, the higher ceiling could save you some money." 
</P>
<P>
To understand how the higher limit might let you keep a little extra cash in 
your pocket, you need to know the difference between a "conforming" loan and a 
"nonconforming" mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
A conforming loan is a loan that either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac can purchase 
from a lending institution. On Jan. 1, the conforming limit will be raised to 
$191,250. 
</P>
<P>
Since a lender knows that it can sell its conforming loans to Fannie or Freddie 
and thus remove the loans from its books, it's willing to give you a slightly 
lower rate than it charges for nonconforming mortgages -- typically called 
"jumbo" loans -- of more than $191,250. 
</P>
<P>
Rates on fixed-rate, conforming loans currently stand at about 10%. Rates on 
jumbo loans are about 10 1/4%. 
</P>
<P>
If you took out a $190,000 loan today, your monthly payment for principal and 
interest would be about $1,705. That's because you'd be charged the jumbo rate 
of 10 1/4%. 
</P>
<P>
But if instead you waited until Jan. 1 to buy a house or refinance your 
existing mortgage, you'd probably get a 10% rate because it would be considered 
a conforming loan. So, your payment would be about $1,665 -- a monthly savings 
of $40. 
</P>
<P>
Most lenders are already offering the lower conforming rates on mortgages up to 
$191,250. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you're seeking a loan amount that's between the old limit of 
$187,450 and the new limit of $191,250, you probably won't be able to actually 
get the money until at least Jan. 1 -- the date that the new limit officially 
takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether the loan you want is under or over the new limit, you 
might want to wait a month or two before you take the loan out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say rates are going to go down between a quarter-point and half a point 
over the next couple of months because oil prices are dropping and we're 
slipping into a recession," said John Tuccillo, chief economist of the National 
Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't need the cash right away, you might want to hold off a little 
longer before you borrow the money. If I'm right and rates go down, you'll save 
yourself some money." 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, banker Garman said, you could fill out your loan application 
now but instruct your mortgage banker or loan officer to hold delivery of the 
money until mortgage rates have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Maloni, an official with Fannie Mae, said limits on the size of 
multifamily loans that the agency can buy will also increase. 
</P>
<P>
Effective Jan. 1, the Fannie and Freddie limits for a duplex will rise to 
$244,650, up from $239,750. For a triplex, the limit will rise to $295,650 from 
$289,750. 
</P>
<P>
The limit for a four-unit complex will increase to $367,500 from $360,150. 
</P>
<P>
Limits in Alaska and Hawaii will be 50% higher because of their high cost of 
living, Maloni said.

INSURANCE WAR FADES, BUT NEW ISSUES EVOLVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a recent gathering of insurance underwriters in San Francisco, Allstate 
counsel Michael McCabe had a welcome message for the hundreds of industry 
loyalists present. 
</P>
<P>
"The era of unfettered insurance company bashing has come to an end," McCabe 
said. "The next stage of the debate over insurance issues here in California 
and elsewhere in the nation will be characterized by dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
There are signs McCabe has a point. The furor engendered by the 1988 "war of 
insurance initiatives" is fading and demands for rollbacks approved by the 
voters that year in Proposition 103 are getting less attention. 
</P>
<P>
But insurance issues continue to stir emotions in California, and likely 
impending developments -- rate hikes, further restrictions of insurance 
availability, inauguration of a new insurance commissioner -- may ignite new 
controversy, not only in auto insurance but in health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Allstate executive spoke two weeks ago, no less a basher of the 
companies than Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield seemed to validate what 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield has announced that his Voter Revolt organization has failed for the 
second time to get enough petition signatures to put on the 1992 ballot an 
initiative that would lead to the creation of a nonprofit state auto insurance 
company and the ouster of private auto insurers from California. 
</P>
<P>
He said his financially hard-pressed group simply does not have the money to 
gather the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps of more immediate importance, Rosenfield disclosed that he has 
encouraged Insurance Commissioner-elect John Garamendi to try to negotiate 
compromise solutions on auto insurance directly with the insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield acknowledged such talks would have to be private. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield and his longtime mentor, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, had just a 
few days before sent a lengthy report to Garamendi, summarizing the status of 
key elements of Proposition 103 and urging him to notify the companies that 
they will get no rate increases in California until they stop litigation 
against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield said in an interview that in a subsequent meeting he assured 
Garamendi of a cooperative attitude on his and Nader's part while Garamendi 
tries to settle matters with the companies. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi has declared that he is eager to pursue such talks and then perhaps 
seek legislative solutions to the state's insurance problems. He already has 
met frequently with ranking representatives of all three groups most interested 
in the insurance issues -- insurers, trial lawyers and consumers -- seeking 
whatever common ground there is. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean the fire is out in California's insurance crisis after a 
two-year fight? Not exactly, say a number of those close to the situation, 
although the rhetoric may have been replaced by a desire to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Still, impending developments could disturb whatever tranquility exists, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the industry is out of trouble," said Jeff Shelton, chief staff 
consultant to the state Assembly's insurance committee. "I've asked a number of 
persons in recent weeks: 'Has public opinion changed? Has the anger toward the 
companies dissipated?' And all said no." 
</P>
<P>
Shelton said he believes the comparative quiet over auto insurance issues will 
last only until the first new rate increases. There was word last week that 
some readjustment of rates, which will entail big increases for some drivers, 
may be in the works for January. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm officials, expecting approval early next month from outgoing 
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, confirmed that their company intends 
to raise rates by more than a third for the 13%, or more than 400,000, of their 
3.3 million policyholders who are considered "bad" drivers -- those with two or 
more citations or one or more at-fault accidents in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
While the officials said most of their "good" drivers, 87% of their customers, 
will get slight decreases under the new pricing plan, the prospect of such a 
shake-up nettled some State Farm agents. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not get notes of appreciation from those getting the slight 
decreases," said one agent, who asked not to be named. "But we will hear bloody 
screams from those getting the increases." 
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the State Farm readjustments would be to restrict the ability 
of the "bad" or "problem" drivers, and in some cases younger drivers, to 
purchase new policies. 
</P>
<P>
If, as expected, the departing Gillespie authorizes other companies to follow 
the new sales policies of State Farm, many more of these drivers may find 
themselves able to buy auto insurance only through the assigned risk system, 
which offers only liability coverage and not the collision and comprehensive 
coverage that many finance companies require new car buyers to carry. 
</P>
<P>
Some agents warn that such rule changes, which they regard as being highly 
likely to win Gillespie's backing, could so restrict the availability of 
insurance that the new car market will be depressed. They say that bad drivers 
who are unable to buy collision or comprehensive coverage will usually be able 
to afford only older, used cars. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie last week declined to say what she would do. Her special counsel for 
Proposition 103 implementation, Karl Rubinstein, hinted strongly that the 
commissioner would act favorably on State Farm's plan as well as similar ones 
of other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie did not confide her plans to Garamendi when the two met recently, 
leaving the commissioner-elect saying, uneasily, that he could not formulate 
his own policies until he knew "what kind of playing field" he would be left. 
</P>
<P>
Other developments may also roil the waters in auto or health insurance: 
</P>
<P>
* On Jan. 1, stringent enforcement provisions of the state's mandatory auto 
insurance law are being allowed to lapse as a result of legislative inaction. 
No longer will police who stop motorists over violations be required to demand 
proof of insurance. Consequently, no longer will those unable to show such 
proof have their licenses suspended until they buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the law will remain on the books requiring drivers to submit proof of 
insurance when they have accidents, there is still expected to be a 
considerable surge in the numbers of uninsured motorists. The surge eventually 
will bring increases in uninsured motorist premiums for those continuing to buy 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
* Thousands of Californians have been sent scurrying to buy from unlicensed and 
unregulated out-of-state carriers because of restrictions approved earlier this 
year on the ability of good drivers to buy assigned risk coverage and an 85% 
average statewide increase in assigned risk rates authorized by Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
A leading insurance legal expert, Douglas Hallett, recently sued Gillespie for 
stricter enforcement of rules limiting sales by out-of-state firms, contending 
that many such carriers will default on their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
* Recent hearings into health insurance conducted by Assemblyman Burt Margolin 
(D-Los Angeles) have demonstrated, as have numerous published and televised 
reports in recent months, that health insurers increasingly are cutting off 
coverage, or raising the prices for it astronomically, especially for people 
with individual or small group policies who become sick and make costly claims. 
Industry attempts to confine affordable health insurance mainly to healthy 
persons is engendering resentment from the growing number of persons who either 
cannot buy it or cannot afford the costly premiums. 
</P>
<P>
During his campaign and in recent days, Garamendi has stressed his willingness 
to seek compromise solutions to such insurance problems. He also indicated, 
under certain circumstances, a willingness to pursue radical solutions. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Garamendi came out during the campaign in favor of "community 
ratings" in health insurance. This would mean selling health coverage to 
everyone within certain wide regions of the state at the same price, no matter 
what their health or the size of their claims. 
</P>
<P>
The industry, moving the other way toward cost-based coverage or no coverage 
for the very sick, is expected to resist such proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi has also said that should the companies be unwilling or unable to 
provide either minimal auto or health coverage to everyone who wants it, he 
would favor legislation that would set up a state company to provide such 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature did that last year in earthquake insurance," the 
commissioner-elect recently pointed out. "I have 90 days to set up a state 
company that will provide at least $15,000 coverage for every homeowner to be 
financed by a surcharge on their homeowners policies. This could be a precedent 
for the state moving to provide other kinds of minimal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
The period of "unfettered insurance company bashing" referred to by McCabe of 
Allstate thus may be over. But there are indications that major reform 
proposals may lie ahead.

GORBACHEV'S HOPEFUL UNION TREATY UNVEILED

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, fighting to keep his continent-sized 
country intact, unveiled his blueprint Saturday for a new and voluntary union 
of "sovereign" Soviet republics, but his brand of federalism concentrates so 
much power in Moscow that some republics have already rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist and crowd-pleasing president of 
the Russian Federation, continued to steer his own political course, 
single-handedly revoking a Soviet government decree that would have led to 
price increases on a wide array of luxury goods. 
</P>
<P>
A draft constitution that Yeltsin helped prepare for Russia was also made 
public. Echoing the words of the American Founding Fathers, it solemnly begins: 
"We, the multinational people of the Russian Federation . . . ," and declares 
Russia's laws superior to national ones. It also proclaims Russia's right to 
raise its own army. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Foreign Ministry press center, Gorbachev's frustration over 
Yeltsin's independent actions, and those of other recalcitrant republic 
leaders, was plain to see. In a fervent pitch for his political power-sharing 
scheme, Gorbachev told a news conference that the breakup of the Soviet Union 
along ethnic lines would produce "a tragedy for the people, civil conflicts 
with grave consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Major state-run newspapers on Saturday printed the 59-year-old Soviet leader's 
formula for healing the nation's ethnic and economic wounds and ending the 
paralysis of its government -- a proposed treaty establishing the "Union of 
Sovereign Soviet Republics" to replace the Dec. 30, 1922, accord that founded 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 
</P>
<P>
Besides jettisoning the label socialist at a time when the Soviet Union, goaded 
by Gorbachev, has set itself the goal of creating a market economy, the 
23-article treaty contains many provisions that are truly revolutionary when 
compared to the last 73 years of Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
It proposes, for the first time, the creation of a vice presidency, puts 
Gorbachev in control of a Cabinet that will replace the Council of Ministers, 
and creates a Constitutional Court that for the first time in Soviet history 
would exercise independent judicial review over laws to ensure their 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, given the eruption of nationalism and ethnic hatreds in the 
country, the treaty makes significant concessions to the Soviet republics, 
which were long ruled directly from Moscow or by its plenipotentiaries under 
the Leninist concept of "democratic centralism." 
</P>
<P>
"Membership of a republic in the U.S.S.R. is voluntary," Article 1 states, a 
tacit repudiation of the 1922 accord that simply welded other 
Communist-governed territories onto Bolshevik Russia. "Each republic that joins 
the union is a sovereign state enjoying full state power over its territory." 
</P>
<P>
The pact's concessions, however, will be too little for many republican 
nationalists. For the treaty, which is being circulated to lawmakers in the 
Supreme Soviet legislature and the republics, retains a great sphere of 
responsibilities for central authorities, although some republics -- including 
the independence-minded Baltic states -- now claim such powers for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the national government, the treaty says, will defend the 
"sovereignty and territorial integrity" of the U.S.S.R., guard its borders, run 
the KGB and armed forces, declare war and conclude peace. Although the 
republics, along with the Kremlin, would jointly hammer out economic 
development strategy, it would be in the context of a single financial, credit 
and banking system and a common currency. 
</P>
<P>
Such centralization, especially in economics and trade, flies in the face of 
many of the demands for "sovereignty" that have been made by 14 of the 15 
Soviet republics, including Yeltsin's Russia, the biggest and most populous. 
</P>
<P>
Although the republics would be made masters of their lands and natural 
resources, Moscow would have final say over the nation's gold and diamond 
reserves, air and rail service, the pipelines that carry natural gas from 
Siberia to Europe and space research. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to remind you that 12 out of 14 representatives of the republics 
speaking on the Union Treaty did not express their readiness to sign it," 
liberal member of Parliament Alexei Yablokov said, summing up criticism 
expressed in the Soviet legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed pact, which took up about half a page in Moscow dailies, also 
omits any mention of a republic's constitutionally established right to secede, 
a fact that advocates of local sovereignty or independence will find ominous. 
</P>
<P>
As one indication of the jitters now being felt over Gorbachev's intentions, 
Lithuania's President Vytautas Landsbergis warned his countrymen Friday that 
"our motherland, the Lithuanian Republic, is in danger," and charged that 
Gorbachev has become the leader of Soviet rightist forces. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis predicted many Soviet republics would spurn the Union Treaty. 
Lithuania declared outright independence from Moscow in March, the only 
republic so far to do so. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Georgia's Parliament, now dominated by nationalists and 
anti-Communists, declared that republic on the road to "restoration of full 
national independence." Like Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Georgia has 
informed Gorbachev that it will not sign the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Union Treaty did not say how many republics would have to adopt it 
before it went into force. Pressed on the matter Friday, Gorbachev replied: 
"Let the very process of change and life itself answer this question." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a republic could secede, Gorbachev told reporters, "I didn't say 
I wouldn't allow it. I said I had come to the firm conclusion that we could not 
divide." 
</P>
<P>
His tough tone left no doubt that he would continue to combat local 
separatists. 
</P>
<P>
Like some other republican leaders, including Ukrainian President Leonid M. 
Kravchuk, Yeltsin has expressed support in principle 
</P>
<P>
for new and looser union arrangements, but he wants to go about it in a 
different way, by first concluding bilateral treaties with other republics. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving Gorbachev's treaty, Yeltsin wants an agreement with the 
Kremlin defining who will own Russia's gigantic trove of natural resources -- 
the main source of the Soviet government's bankroll -- and guarantees that 
Russia's sovereignty will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin again showed his low regard for the Soviet central government Saturday 
by ordering Russian Federation officials not to obey a Kremlin decree that 
would allow the prices of furs, jewelry, caviar and other luxury goods to float 
to their market level, in many cases 10 or 20 times the state price. 
</P>
<P>
The Yeltsin-sponsored draft for Russia's constitution, to be debated at an 
emergency session of the Russian Congress of People's Deputies which opens 
Tuesday, also makes it clear who should wield power. Russia, it proclaims, 
"independently fixes and manages its domestic and foreign policies, enacts its 
constitution and laws, which take priority on its territory." 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposed constitution, written by a committee that met in a forest 
cottage outside Moscow, allows Russia to cede some powers to the national 
government, it proclaims Russia's right to "control" policies in those areas 
and to take part in their execution, a formula tailor-made to cause endless 
jurisdictional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks to the Supreme Soviet legislature, Gorbachev had already disclosed 
many of the major proposals made by the Union Treaty. Lawmakers on Friday had 
endorsed the restructuring of the executive branch that the plan presupposes, 
and gave Gorbachev 14 days to draw up specific proposals. The Union Treaty 
itself is to be considered by the Soviet Parliament, the Congress of People's 
Deputies, in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, the president would be the nation's chief executive and 
commander-in-chief, as he now is, but would have to be elected in a nationwide 
ballot instead of by the Congress. To win, a candidate would have to receive 
both a majority of votes in the popular election and also carry a majority of 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the Soviet Union, a vice president would also be elected 
to exercise functions assigned by the president and, in the clearest provision 
made yet to ensure the orderly succession of Soviet power, "to replace (the 
president) in the event of his absence or his incapacity to fulfill his 
functions." 
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet of Ministers, headed by a prime minister and under the control of the 
president, would replace the Council of Ministers, although this may be little 
more than a name change. The Federation Council, an advisory body of the 15 
republican leaders chaired by Gorbachev, would take on a major policy-making 
role. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BLUEPRINT FOR A NEW SOVIET UNION 
</P>
<P>
Here are highlights of the Union Treaty published Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
</P>
<P>
Each republic is sovereign, with full state power on its territory. 
</P>
<P>
Republics have the right of self-determination and self-government, resolution 
of all problems of the republic's development. 
</P>
<P>
STRUCTURE OF THE UNION 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the union is voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
A citizen of a republic is a citizen of the U.S.S.R., or "Union of Sovereign 
Soviet Republics." 
</P>
<P>
POWERS OF THE UNION 
</P>
<P>
Protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity; defending state border; 
protecting state security; directing armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Setting foreign policy; regulating union's foreign economic activities and 
coordinating foreign economic activities of republics. 
</P>
<P>
Determining, jointly with republics, strategies of economic development; 
creating market conditions; creating a single fiscal and monetary policy based 
on one currency. 
</P>
<P>
Administering, jointly with republics, power, fuel, transport, defense 
industries, space research, communications, ecological policy; establishing 
guidelines for using natural resourses. 
</P>
<P>
POWERS OF THE REPUBLICS 
</P>
<P>
Ownership of land and natural resources on their territory, and of state 
property except that needed for exercising powers of the union. 
</P>
<P>
Forming own budgets and determining taxes. Union taxes are for the union's use. 
</P>
<P>
Republic laws are supreme unless they cover issues of union's authority. 
</P>
<P>
Disputes are resolved in commissions or the Constitutional Court. 
</P>
<P>
SHUFFLE OF AUTHORITY 
</P>
<P>
The president is the union's chief executive and commander in chief, but must 
be elected nationwide instead of by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
A vice president is elected to exercise functions assigned by the president and 
to replace the president in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council, an advisory body of the 15 republican leaders, takes on 
a major policy-making role.

POLES IN U.S. TAKE PART IN HISTORIC VOTING;

<P>
ELECTION: FROM L.A. TO CHICAGO, THOUSANDS OF EMIGRES CAST ABSENTEE BALLOTS.

<P>
Just weeks after U.S. elections in which apathy seemed the big winner, Poles 
eagerly flocked to voting booths Saturday in several American cities to cast 
absentee ballots in the first free Polish presidential election since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the voters seemed so proud to participate that they took turns snapping 
photographs of each other as they dropped their paper voting slips into ballot 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping for a better future," said 19-year-old Peter Michalski after 
voting at the Polish Consulate here, a place few Polish emigres dared enter 
before the downfall of the Communist government last year. "It's a chance we 
didn't have for over 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
Consular officials in Chicago, who also organized the voting centers in 
Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis and Los Angeles, predicted that as many as 40,000 
Polish citizens -- about half of them in Chicago -- would cast votes for one of 
the six presidential contenders on the ballot. They include front-runners Lech 
Walesa, founder of the non-Communist Solidarity trade union, and Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, the current Polish prime minister and a one-time Solidarity ally of 
Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, election officials expected about 1,500 voters, including some 
from out of state, to cast ballots, based on pre-registrations. 
</P>
<P>
With little experience in conducting elections, the consulate in Chicago 
borrowed voting booths and other materials from the city's Board of Elections. 
Still, Robert Michniewicz, the Polish vice consul, said that the booths were 
the only electoral legacy that would be borrowed from the city. "I don't think 
there will be any tricks even though we're in Chicago," Michniewicz pledged. 
</P>
<P>
Rules were fairly simple. To be eligible, voters needed only to prove that they 
were 18 years old and to provide either documentary evidence or the testimony 
of two witnesses that they were Polish citizens. Many Polish emigres hold dual 
American and Polish citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Although the balloting in Poland will not take place until today, Michniewicz 
predicted that the American votes could be decisive in a tight race. "If it is 
a tough competition, 30,000 or 40,000 votes may have a real impact on the 
results," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vote symbolized just how much things have changed in Poland and the Polish 
emigre community since the June, 1989, parliamentary elections that swept the 
Communist rulership out of office. 
</P>
<P>
Polish citizens were eligible to vote here in that election, too, but many held 
back. "Last election was to vote for either the Communists or vote for 
something new," explained Hubert Romandowski, at the time a college chemistry 
professor who served as a Solidarity observer in the 1989 balloting in Chicago. 
"Many people were hesitant because they didn't really trust the Communists." 
</P>
<P>
Romandowski himself is now a vivid symbol of change. He was recently appointed 
Polish consul general in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has the largest concentration of ethnic Poles outside of Warsaw, and up 
and down Milwaukee Avenue, the northwest-side thoroughfare that cuts through 
the heart of the Polish neighborhood, storefronts were plastered with signs 
boosting one candidate or another. 
</P>
<P>
Both Walesa and Mazowiecki had campaign committees operating in Chicago and, 
earlier this month, Walesa's campaign manager in Poland flew to Chicago to get 
out the vote and raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Many voters said it was difficult to choose between Walesa and Mazowiecki 
because they both have solid anti-Communist credentials. Name recognition 
seemed to be the major determinant, and on that score Walesa appeared to be the 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Eva Betka, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the Polish-American 
Congress, predicted that Mazowiecki would be the choice of the intelligentsia 
in both Poland and Chicago. But "the laborers will be following Walesa. . . . 
That's why Walesa is going to win," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, as Polish music played over loudspeakers, a steady stream of 
voters filed through the polling station in the basement of Our Lady of 
Jasnogora Roman Catholic Church in the West Adams district. 
</P>
<P>
"The Polish people put a lot of hope in the one who wins," said election 
official Chris Ciesiolkiwicz, who looked furtively around the room before 
disclosing that his vote went to Stanislaw Tyminski, a dark-horse candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Apologizing for his hesitancy, he said, "I'm an election official. I don't want 
anyone to think that I am biased. 
</P>

THOREAU'S WORKS ARE BEING THOROUGHLY COMPILED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 24 years, scholars have scoured the nation for notes, essays, poems, 
journals and books written by Henry David Thoreau. 
</P>
<P>
This literary detective work is directed from a wing on the third floor of the 
UC Santa Barbara library, the Textual Center of the Thoreau Edition. 
</P>
<P>
UCSB is roughly 3,000 miles from Walden Pond at Concord, Mass., where Thoreau 
spent two years in a shack writing "Walden." But it is at UCSB that Thoreau's 
unpublished writings are being assembled for publication. 
</P>
<P>
In his own lifetime Thoreau, among the most influential 19th-Century writers, 
was not considered a successful writer. Only a handful of his essays and two 
books, "Walden" and "A Week on Concord and Merrimac Rivers," were published. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his words influenced such reformers as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther 
King Jr. His pioneering theories of natural history paved the way for 
present-day environmental activists. His impact on the civil rights movement 
and the preservation of natural resources continues to this day, 128 years 
after his death. 
</P>
<P>
In his famous essay on civil disobedience written in 1846, after he spent a 
night in jail for refusing to pay poll taxes, he said he could not support a 
government that endorsed slavery and waged an imperial war against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a higher law than the civil one, and the higher law must be followed 
even if a penalty ensues. So does its consequences. Under a government which 
imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison," Thoreau 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He led a simple life, writing in longhand his observations on nature and his 
reflections on important events. Every day for 21 years he expressed his 
thoughts on paper, from age 23 until he died of tuberculosis at age 44 in 1862. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have 90% of everything Thoreau wrote. We're still looking for 
anything we may have missed," said Elizabeth Witherell, 42, editor-in-chief of 
the Thoreau Edition for 10 of her 16 years on the project. "Our plan is 
eventually to publish Thoreau's complete works in 27 volumes. His day-to-day 
journals alone will account for 13 volumes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the project started in 1966, nine hardbacks in the series have been 
published, with the 10th, "Journal 3: 1848-1851," due in December. All are 
published by Princeton University Press. The Thoreau Edition was headquartered 
at Princeton until 1983, when it moved to UCSB. 
</P>
<P>
Witherell expects that it will take another 17 to 25 years before the complete 
works of Thoreau will be in print. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 105-year-old Modern Language Assn., whose 30,000 members are college 
language and literature teachers, that decided to publish everything written by 
15 of the leading 18th- and 19th-Century American writers. In addition to 
Thoreau, the writers include Mark Twain, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, Washington Irving, Herman Melville and Walt Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty literary scholars at universities nationwide have collected, sorted and 
processed the Thoreau material. Nine editors are working on future volumes. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the Thoreau Edition has cost about $2 million. Half of the funding has 
come from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the other half from 
various institutions that provide space, utilities and salaries for researchers 
and editors. 
</P>
<P>
Gathering the Thoreau material has involved a great deal of detective work. 
First, the researchers obtained photocopies of writings from the major Thoreau 
collections: the Concord Public Library, the Henry E. Huntington Library in San 
Marino, the New York Public Library, the Harvard University Library and the J. 
Pierpont Morgan Library. 
</P>
<P>
Then, letters were sent to libraries and to book sections of newspapers 
nationwide, asking for Thoreau material. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a little bit here, a little bit there," Witherell said. 
</P>
<P>
The writings are checked against the author's original manuscripts. "He was a 
miserable scribbler. We use magnifying glasses. The scribbling is photocopied 
and enlarged at times to help in the deciphering," Witherell said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the volumes published so far, 60,000 copies have been sold, primarily to 
libraries and Thoreau buffs. Royalties are reinvested in the Thoreau Edition.

OLD TROUBLES HAUNT NEW NICARAGUA; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: PRESIDENT CHAMORRO IS EARNING DEFIANCE BY FAILING TO CURB ABUSES BY 
SANDINISTAS.

SANTO TOMAS, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hilario Vargas, a slight, soft-spoken agronomist, became mayor of this cattle 
town last May after voters all over Nicaragua swept the Sandinistas from 
office. A month later the local Sandinista army captain had him arrested. 
</P>
<P>
A renegade Contra, defying a post-election peace pact, had shot a Sandinista 
lieutenant to death in a diner that day and escaped. Tension ran high. For an 
hour and a half, Vargas recalls, Capt. Francisco Henriquez held a pistol to his 
head, threatening to kill every government supporter in town. "He was 
hysterical," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Henriquez later apologized, but Vargas and the townspeople didn't forget. 
Joining a popular revolt across southeastern Nicaragua, they shut down the 
country's main east-west highway for 18 days this month to demand removal of 
all Sandinista soldiers and policemen from the region. 
</P>
<P>
The blockade was the first serious challenge to President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro by her right-wing supporters, who question her survival strategy of 
leaving the military under Sandinista command. The protest gained weight when 
Vargas and seven other mayors from the region, where Chamorro ran strongest in 
the election, carried the demand to Managua. 
</P>
<P>
After negotiations failed, Chamorro moved to end the conflict unilaterally. She 
sent an army convoy to clear the highway, then announced last Wednesday that 18 
of the region's 34 army bases would be closed and 500 officers, nearly half 
those on duty there, would be retired by Dec. 31. But the mayors were not 
satisfied and asked local officials elsewhere in Nicaragua to join new 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
"The war is over and the Contras have disarmed, so why do we need the 
military?" Vargas asked. "They are not doing anything but rustling cattle, 
stealing from homes and threatening us. They are nothing but parasites." 
</P>
<P>
During the 8-year-war, the southeastern region embracing Boaco and Chontales 
provinces and southern Zelaya province were the U.S.-backed Contras' most 
secure haven. The frontier ranchers and dairy farmers remained aloof from the 
Sandinista insurgency that seized national power in 1979. Afterward, they 
resisted the arrival of Sandinista teachers, collective farms and army 
recruiters so stubbornly that Chontales became known as "La Vaca Echada" -- the 
cow that lies down and won't move. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chamorro polled 70% of the region's votes and remains enormously 
popular here, her government is earning the same defiance by failing to curb 
abuses by Sandinistas who kept their weapons after nearly 17,000 Contras laid 
down theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Some mayors of her National Opposition Union, or UNO, say that the army or 
police routinely bar them from recovering municipal property stolen by their 
Sandinista predecessors. Forty-four former Contras have been arrested in a 
campaign of harassment, according to international officials supervising their 
resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
"In every town I visit, people who are UNO activists have been arrested, 
tortured and accused of being delinquents," said the Roman Catholic bishop of 
Juigalpa, Pablo Antonio Vega, who joined protesters at the barricades. "There 
is no legal security here. Armed Sandinistas are the only law." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas and other mayors want the region disarmed except for municipal policemen 
chosen by and responsible to them, not to the Sandinista command in Managua. 
Because such forces could include former Contras, the Sandinistas pressed 
Chamorro to resist. 
</P>
<P>
"Their criminal purpose is to dismantle the army so they can get on with the 
pleasurable task of sticking the knife to the hated Sandinistas," declared the 
Sandinista newspaper Barricada. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was sparked by the arrest Oct. 28 of a former Contra commander 
known as Oscar who, as part of the rebels' demobilization accord, had been 
allowed to set up a 30-man rural police force in a small resettlement zone in 
the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
When Oscar decided to expand the force to 79 and refused to take orders from 
Managua, the government sent troops and helicopters to seize him and disarm his 
men. Two protest rallies ended in bloodshed when troops opened fire on Oscar's 
supporters in Yolaina and Nueva Guinea, killing five of them. 
</P>
<P>
Former Contras, also angered by the government's delay in providing land for 
their resettlement, built the first barricades at the eastern end of the Rama 
Road on Oct. 31. But as the protest spread west to Juigalpa -- throwing up 16 
barriers of boulders and parked vehicles along a 110-mile stretch -- it was 
joined by thousands of people who had never picked up a gun. The mayors' 
participation helped keep the roadblock gatherings peaceful and festive. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a rebirth of civilian activism," said Roger Garcia, a Ministry of 
Education official who helped build the barricade here. "There are no more 
Contras. This is the people. . . . After so many years of trauma, we just want 
the Sandinistas to go away." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters' demands for security were backed by Nicaragua's Roman Catholic 
bishops and Vice President Virgilio Godoy. He called their action, which caused 
shortages in Managua of the isolated region's milk and cheese, "a beautiful act 
of civic protest." 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro branded it the work of "extremists." Negotiations broke off when she 
refused to dump Sandinista Gen. Humberto Ortega as army commander and her 
son-in-law, Antonio Lacayo, as minister of the presidency. The crackdown came 
after four policemen were killed by one of their own grenades while trying to 
stop the protest from spreading to the Pan American Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The army cleared the barricades with little resistence last weekend. Police 
arrested former Contra leader Aristides Sanchez and raided the Contras' 
resettlement office, seizing field radios, computers, military uniforms and a 
few AK-47 rifles and grenades. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro promised an investigation of the shootings at Yolaina and Nueva 
Guinea. But so far the conflict has only increased resentment among the 
president's supporters over hers and Lacayo's perceived leanings toward the 
Sandinistas. Said Garcia: "I'm afraid we are seeing the beginning of a new 
dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
As traffic resumed on the Rama Road last week, Sandinista troops and police 
were deployed to prevent new blockades. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that the majority of the people here want us to march out of this 
zone with our heads hanging low," said Lender Aleman, a policeman who was 
guarding a bridge Friday near Santo Tomas. "But it's not their decision to 
make."

U.S. READY TO OFFER U.N. RESOLUTION ON FORCE THIS WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
IRAQ: BAKER CONFERS WITH OFFICIALS OF COLOMBIA AND MALAYSIA IN QUEST FOR 
SUPPORT IN SECURITY COUNCIL.

Strong signs emerged Saturday that Secretary of State James A. Baker III, after 
a remarkable diplomatic odyssey that ended at Los Angeles International 
Airport, will present a U.S. resolution authorizing use of force against Iraq 
to the U.N. Security Council this week, probably Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite noncommittal stands by two nations he consulted Saturday -- Colombians 
in Bogota and Malaysians at the airport -- the Bush Administration feels 
confident that the measure will receive at least the necessary nine votes in 
the 15-nation council, and no vetoes from any of the five permanent member 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
By unofficial tabulation, seven members of the council appear committed to vote 
for the resolution and five nations, including the Soviet Union are likely to 
support it as well. The remaining three -- Cuba, Yemen and Malaysia -- are 
expected either to vote against it or abstain. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has covered five continents in five grueling days in quest of support for 
the resolution, which would authorize a 25-nation coalition with military 
forces in the Persian Gulf region to use them to implement the 10 U.N. 
resolutions that demand Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
From the sophisticated hotels of Paris last Tuesday to the parched lands of 
Yemen on Thanksgiving to the verdant heights of Colombia on Saturday, Baker has 
argued in person to all but one of the council members that Iraq's aggression 
against Kuwait must be reversed with force if peaceful diplomatic means 
continue to show no results. Only Cuba had not yet been consulted on the new 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba has been the only council member to vote against any resolution so far. It 
did so only once, although it abstained on four other measures. Yemen, the only 
Arab nation on the council, has abstained five times. All other members have 
voted for all of the resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all nations consulted by Baker have emphasized their preference for a 
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis, as has Baker himself in presenting the 
U.S. view. His remarks at a press conference in Bogota reflected the case he 
has been making throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly prefer a peaceful and political resolution of this crisis," he 
declared. "But perhaps the best way to achieve it is for us not to rule out the 
option of force. It may be the only thing (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein 
understands . . . and if it (force) is to be a credible option, we must lay the 
appropriate military and political foundations for it," through a buildup of 
forces and a U.N. resolution authorizing their use. 
</P>
<P>
The response of Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Fernando Jaramillo was also 
typical of the stand of the smaller non-permanent members of the council, 
including Finland and Ivory Coast, which have not openly committed themselves 
to the American case so far but who seem inclined to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Colombia really stands for peaceful solutions of conflicts," Jaramillo said. 
"But Colombia cannot accept the fact that, through force, a party has violated 
international order." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Baker met Malaysian Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar, who had 
flown here from Kuala Lumpur. Both used identical language to describe "a very 
good" meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Abu said his country's Cabinet and other officials will meet at midweek to 
decide on the U.S. proposal. He said that he and Baker "discussed it as 
equals," and he said of Malaysia, "We are good friends of the Arab countries, 
both sides -- Saudi and Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are confident of Soviet support, and probably that of China as 
well, in the forthcoming council debate. But the wording and timing of the 
resolution may be subject to bargaining among the five permanent members -- the 
Soviet Union, China, Britain, France and the United States -- as well as other 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Current expectations are that the resolution will have two phases, the first 
calling for a final peace overture to Iraq to which Hussein must respond 
positively by a certain time. If the deadline passes without movement, the 
use-of-force provision would take effect.

IRAQ: SECRETARY CONFERS WITH COLOMBIAN AND MALAYSIAN OFFICIALS, SEEKING SUPPORT 
IN SECURITY COUNCIL.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced Saturday night that the United 
States will go to the United Nations this week for a new use-of-force 
resolution against Iraq which will specify a deadline by which Iraq must 
withdraw from Kuwait or face the military might of the U.S.-led forces in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Consideration of the resolution is expected to begin Monday or Tuesday with a 
formal vote by the 15-nation council coming Thursday or Friday, Baker said in 
an airborne interview with the Los Angeles Times and Reuters news agency at the 
end of his remarkable, five-continents-in-five-days diplomatic odyssey to 
consult on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Baker refused to speculate on the outcome of the vote in the council, where 
nine yes votes and no vetoes are required for passage. U.S. officials have said 
that they would not propose a resolution "unless it had a reasonable chance of 
success." 
</P>
<P>
But a senior U.S. official traveling with Baker said "the secretary is under no 
illusions on this. We are in for a very tough fight." 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial tabulations indicated that seven nations have committed themselves 
publicly to vote for such a move, with another five -- including the Soviets -- 
likely to go along. Cuba and Yemen, which is the sole Arab state on the 
council, were most likely to abstain or vote against the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Baker spoke with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for a half hour 
before arriving in Bogota, Colombia, Saturday morning en route from a visit to 
Yemen and Saudi Arabia. All indications are that Moscow will support the U.S. 
overture and that China, whose foreign minister consulted this weekend with 
Shevardnadze, will also go along. 
</P>
<P>
He also spoke by phone with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas after leaving 
Colombia en route to Los Angeles, where he met the Malaysian foreign minister 
briefly at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The official U.S. two-paragraph announcement, released on the final leg of 
Baker's grueling trip, said the United States as Security Council president 
this month is inviting its members' foreign ministers to a meeting in New York 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, we will consider what additional steps the council might take to 
achieve implementation of the 10 resolutions already adopted (by the Council) 
in response to Iraq's unprovoked invasion and continuing occupation of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
"Those actions must be implemented," the statement declared. "Our determination 
to ensure their implementation should demonstrate to Saddam Hussein the need to 
resolve this crisis peacefully and promptly." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Baker said the council would consider "a resolution that 
would authorize the use of all necessary means to implement the council's prior 
resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. draft resolution, which will be distributed among members on Monday, 
appears to propose a two-step procedure. Iraq would first be given a de facto 
ultimatum to withdraw, after which the use-of-force provisions would come into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The council will want to explore a resolution that would make very clear that 
member states could utilize all necessary means (i.e., use of force) after a 
certain date to implement the prior resolutions," Baker said. "And the clear 
message of such a resolution to Saddam Hussein will be that there is still a 
chance to resolve the matter peacefully within the time frame." 
</P>
<P>
Baker declined to say what time frame the United States would propose, whether 
weeks or months after adoption of the measure. "Further discussions" will be 
held with council members on the point, he said, confirming reports that some 
members, including the Soviet Union, have views different from the Bush 
Administration on the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Indications were that the United States wanted a shorter period in order to 
bring pressure on Iraq earlier, while other nations wanted more time for 
sanctions to bite. 
</P>
<P>
More broadly, "considerable debate" was expected on the resolution, Baker said, 
even though he has consulted personally with the foreign ministers of all 
council members except Cuba in the past three weeks. Whether he or an aide will 
discuss the resolution with the Cubans has not been decided, he indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, his consultations with the Colombians in Bogota and the Malaysians in 
Los Angeles produced non-committal responses. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all states consulted by Baker have emphasized the preference for a 
peaceful solution, as has Baker himself in presenting the U.S. view. His 
remarks at a press conference in Bogota reflected the case he has been making. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United Nations has called for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from 
Kuwait, Baker said, "so far we see no withdrawal and in fact, no inclination of 
Saddam Hussein to withdraw. It is important to the United Nations and the 
international community that U.N. resolutions be implemented," particularly in 
halting aggression of larger nations against smaller ones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly prefer a peaceful and political resolution of this crisis," he 
declared. "But perhaps the best way to achieve it is for us not to rule out the 
option of the use of force. It may be the only thing that Saddam Hussein 
understands . . . and if it (force) is to be a credible option, we must lay the 
appropriate military and political foundations for it," both through a buildup 
of military forces and a U.N. resolution authorizing their use. 
</P>
<P>
Baker dodged a question on whether the United States might use force 
unilaterally if it failed to get U.N. approval for the coming resolution. "We 
would much prefer," he said, "to look to it (implementing past resolutions) 
through the U.N. Security Council." 
</P>
<P>
The response of Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Fernando Jaramillo was also 
typical of the stand of the smaller non-permanent members of the Council, 
including Finland and Ivory Coast, which have not openly committed to the 
American case so far but which seem inclined to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Colombia really stands for peaceful solutions of conflicts," Jaramillo said. 
"But Colombia cannot accept the fact that, through force, a party has violated 
international order." 
</P>
<P>
In the unofficial tabulation of votes for the U.S. resolution, the certain ayes 
are those of the United States, France, Britain, Zaire, Ethiopia, Romania, and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In the likely column are the Soviet Union, China, Colombia, Finland and Ivory 
Coast.

GERMANY PREPARES FOR BIG AIRLIFT OF FOOD FOR SOVIETS

This country is ready to establish an airlift to help transport food and other 
emergency supplies to the Soviet Union, it was reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Welt am Sonntag newspaper said German air force transport planes will be 
used if an airlift becomes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources in Bonn, the paper said Germany is preparing the largest 
government and private aid campaign since the end of World War II to help the 
Soviets avert hunger this winter. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the aid is expected to come from emergency reserves of food and other 
supplies built up in West Berlin over the years to help the city overcome 
another possible Cold War blockade, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been dire predictions of winter food shortages for the Soviet people 
and fears that it could seriously exacerbate long-standing tensions and spark 
civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The German view contrasts sharply with a U.S. assessment that immediate food 
aid to the Soviet Union is unnecessary this year. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed during 
Gorbachev's visit to Germany earlier this month to jointly sponsor the aid 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has made help to the Soviet Union a major theme in recent speeches and 
meetings with world leaders, particularly at last week's 34-nation Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn has already promised $19.5 billion in various forms of aid to the Soviet 
Union since Gorbachev lifted his objections to German unification this summer.

The commander of Soviet forces in Germany said 84 of his soldiers had deserted 
and an equal number had died in eastern Germany this year, mainly in accidents 
or during training. But the commander, Gen. Boris Snetkov, dismissed reports 
that hundreds more soldiers had died in former East Germany under mysterious 
circumstances. Snetkov told reporters it will be virtually impossible to 
withdraw all his 380,000 troops before 1994 -- the date set by treaty with 
Germany.

An Israeli patrol boat sank a vessel off the Lebanese coast, killing five armed 
guerrillas who were apparently on the way to attack an Israeli target, 
according to radio reports and military sources. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known if there were any survivors from the boat, Israeli 
radio reported, and there were no Israeli casualties. Reports variously 
identified the suspect vessel as a dinghy or a speedboat. The Israeli military 
had no official statement on the incident. The Muslim Voice of the Nation and 
the Christian Voice of Lebanon said the craft sank off Saadiyat, about 12 miles 
south of Beirut. They did not identify the victims.

SWISS TO EXAMINE U.S. COMPLAINTS OF 'BRUTAL' TREATMENT

The Swiss government said Saturday it is investigating U.S. complaints that 
Swiss guards had brutally enforced security at the Geneva airport during 
President Bush's brief visit on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington that the United 
States will formally protest to Switzerland because a guard poked U.S. Chief of 
Protocol Joseph Reed with a machine gun as he boarded a plane taking Bush home 
from Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
On Bush's arrival at the airport for talks with Syria's Hafez Assad, security 
officers clashed with journalists and photographers in the President's party. 
The press people were pushed and shoved as they sought to approach the ramp 
where Bush was to leave the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also said White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu was later 
verbally abused by the head of Swiss security. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen that kind of brutal and vicious treatment by a security force 
in the last 10 years," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He said a formal protest will be lodged with Swiss Ambassador Edouard Brunner 
after Bush returns from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Geneva police spokesman Thierry Magnin described the actions of some American 
reporters as "deplorable" and "inadmissible." 
</P>
<P>
One police officer on duty at Geneva airport Friday said the White House press 
corps behaved like "occupying troops." 
</P>
<P>
A Swiss Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Switzerland could not officially 
comment on the incident until the investigation is completed Monday.

A man who served eight years in prison in California for raping a teen-ager and 
chopping off her forearms has been arrested for the second time this year on a 
shoplifting charge, accused of trying to steal a $4 hat. 
</P>
<P>
A security guard at a suburban Wal-Mart called police Friday and said that the 
man, Lawrence Singleton, paid for some diapers but not a white hat. 
</P>
<P>
He was stopped by employees after leaving the store and gave a phony name, 
according to an arrest report. Singleton, 63, gave his name as Bill Johnson 
when a sheriff's deputy arrived.

<P>
The deputy warned the Tampa native that giving a false identity is a crime, but 
Singleton insisted his name was Johnson, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
He was cited on charges of petty theft and resisting arrest without violence. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton was not taken to jail. He was released after signing a misdemeanor 
citation and was ordered to appear in court Jan. 2.

GROUP BOYCOTTS MINNEAPOLIS OVER ABORTION LAW

The American Family Therapy Assn. has canceled plans to hold its 1992 
convention in Minneapolis to protest a state law requiring teen-age girls to 
notify their parents before having an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The group objects to the law that also mandates that minors seek a judge's 
permission if they want to avoid notifying their parents. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in June. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation means a loss of nearly $180,000 to the local economy, 
according to Peter Hedlund, vice president of the Greater Minneapolis 
Convention and Visitors Assn. That figure is based on attendance of 300 
conventioneers. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Mason, a Minneapolis psychologist and a member of the American Family 
Therapy Assn. board, said Friday that the board decided by a "100% consensus" 
to boycott Minneapolis when it learned of the Minnesota law during a retreat in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"Since our organization opposes government interference in the reproductive 
decisions of Americans, especially those that deny poor Americans their right 
to privacy, we cannot, in good conscience, have our convention in Minnesota," 
Mason wrote in a letter to the Star Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Rachael Hare-Muftin, the association's president, told Minneapolis Mayor Don 
Fraser and St. Paul Mayor Jim Scheibel of the cancellation in separate letters. 
</P>
<P>
The law was in effect five years before a challenge by several abortion clinics 
led U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop to declare it unconstitutional in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals later ruled that the law was valid but 
blocked its enforcement pending a U.S. Supreme Court review. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the nation's high court ruled that states do not impose an "undue 
burden" on pregnant girls by requiring them to notify parents or receive court 
permission if they do not want to tell their parents.

Trey Urbahn had his head in the clouds Saturday as the lifelong airplane lover 
soared through the sky in an attempt to fly around the world in three days. 
</P>
<P>
He took off Friday on an American Airlines flight from O'Hare International 
Airport for San Juan, Puerto Rico -- the first leg of a 27,808-mile trek. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to land a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. If Urbahn, 32, 
arrives home as scheduled at 10:16 a.m. Monday on United Flight 44 from 
Honolulu, he will have covered six continents and every time zone. 
</P>
<P>
Urbahn, a United Airlines employee who lives in the Chicago area, said he has 
been considering the global trip by commercial airline for three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed two or three months ago that all the schedules fit like a jigsaw 
puzzle. So I wrote to the airlines and most agreed to sponsor me to some 
extent." 
</P>
<P>
After the stop in San Juan, Urbahn was heading to Caracas, Venezuela; London; 
Cairo; Singapore; Sidney, Australia; Honolulu, and then back to Chicago. In 
all, six different airlines are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Urbahn will have to hope for the best as far as delays are concerned. His 
tightest connection will be in London, where he has 65 minutes to change 
terminals for a flight to Egypt.

BARGE RUPTURES GAS LINE; WINDS STAVE OFF BLAST PERIL

<P>
A natural gas line was ruptured early Saturday by a barge trying to dock in a 
waterway known as the Arthur Kill, raising fears of an explosion off Staten 
Island before winds dispersed the gas, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The barge, owned by the Bouchard Co., was being pushed by a tugboat into a 
Staten Island terminal when its rudder hooked the pipe in about 25 feet of 
water, Coast Guard Petty Officer Howard Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
The broken 16-inch main sent an unknown amount of gas into the air about 50 
feet off the shoreline, creating the possibility of an explosion, Holmes said. 
The city's Fire Department was called in case the leak caused a fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the line was turned off, and stiff winds dispersed the gas without 
incident, authorities said. The rupture did force a shutdown of a section of 
the Arthur Kill for 7 1/2 hours, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries or evacuations, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard is investigating the cause of the leak, which was too minor to 
affect the environment, said Steven Whinham, a Coast Guard marine science 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
The Arthur Kill, a major route for barge and ship traffic in a heavily 
industrialized area, has been the site of several major oil spills this year.

A 19-year-old San Jose man was behind bars Saturday, accused of raping and 
beating a 10-year-old Milpitas girl after the two were left alone. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, police said Emilio J. Brotherton was arrested Friday, a few 
hours after the alleged incidents, in a San Jose trailer. Brotherton was being 
held at the Santa Clara County Jail on suspicion of rape, sexual assault on a 
minor and parole violation. Police spokesman Paul Kiefer said the victim's 
parents returned home early Friday to find Brotherton allegedly assaulting the 
girl. A fight with the girl's father started but the alleged rapist managed to 
escape, running naked into the night, police said.

<P>
A reactor at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was shut down because of 
a problem with the electrical supply for a motor that operates control rods, a 
utility spokesman said Saturday. Plant operators noticed the problem at noon 
Friday and gradually reduced the power level in the unit until it was shut down 
at 9:28 p.m., said Southern California Edison spokesman Dave Barron. 
</P>
<P>
The utility expected to have the 1,100-megawatt unit running again by Monday 
morning. "It's not a serious problem. We'll probably get it fixed by the end of 
the weekend," Barron said. Even if the problem continues into the week, there 
is no risk of a power shortage in Southern California, he said. The plant on 
the coast between Los Angeles and San Diego has three reactors. One has been 
closed down for some time, and the third is operating at normal levels, he 
said.

DUMPED PARK PLAN DRAWS FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILL: NEIGHBORS OF A DUMP SITE IN NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY ARE ANGRY ABOUT A 
DECISION TO EXPAND THE FACILITY. IT WAS DUE TO BE CLOSED AND CONVERTED INTO A 
PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen or so families in the Elfin Forest neighborhood who are neighbors to 
the San Marcos landfill -- the only large trash dump in North San Diego County 
-- have been waiting and wishing for the facility to reach capacity. Then, they 
believed, the dump would be covered and turned into a park. 
</P>
<P>
Their wish is expected to come true by next July -- but its fulfillment has 
turned against them. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of closing the dump by July, 1991, county public works staffers are now 
racing the clock, working overtime to expand the landfill so it will 
accommodate the North County's discards for the next 10 or 11 years. In the 
process, the county is offering -- in some cases demanding -- to buy the homes 
of neighbors who have waited for the end of clattering trash trucks and pungent 
garbage smells. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair," said Evelyn Alemanni, one of the landfill's beleaguered 
neighbors. "They promised us that when the dump was full they would turn it 
into an open space park. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting and waiting for that day to come, hanging on to that 
promise. Now, instead, they are going to build a trash pile 20 stories high 
right next to us and expand the landfill right into our community, right across 
Elfin Forest Road." 
</P>
<P>
She laughs when she calls the county's "vertical expansion" of the present 
landfill "Mt. Trashmore" and refers to the 230-acre "horizontal expansion" as 
"Rancho Basura" (Spanish for garbage), but the laugh is hollow and no smile 
goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
Alemanni's home is within the proposed expansion area -- part of a proposed 
buffer zone to separate the Elfin Forest from the active landfill. The county 
Board of Supervisors, which in 1979 promised residents that they would turn the 
landfill into a park when it was filled, now is offering to buy Joe and Evelyn 
Alemanni's home and land at fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors are looking for a new landfill site in North San Diego 
County but choosing and preparing one will take several more years. The San 
Marcos landfill was supposed to be usable for the next several years, but 
because of rapid growth in the North County, it filled up sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
For Robert Haberman, who came from Illinois and bought a home in the secluded 
valley 4 1/2 years ago, the future is bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Haberman and owners of two new estate homes do not have the choice that the 
Alemannis and a dozen other homeowners have. He must sell his California dream 
home for the price an independent appraiser names or face condemnation and a 
court fight. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't get me out of this in a stylish fashion, I'll fight," Haberman 
said of the county's as-yet-undisclosed offer for his house. "Like the guy in 
that movie, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more.' " 
</P>
<P>
But, he admits, whatever the price, he'll miss the silent nights after the 
bulldozers have shut down. He'll also miss the 200 or so quail that dine on his 
hillside. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the location, I love this house, I love feeding the birds. I thought we 
could hang in here forever until this came along. So much for the economic 
dreams one has of living in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
For Jim and Marcie Malloy, leaving their three-acre plant nursery is 
unthinkable, but the thought of staying is just as bad. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent five years, six days a week, building up our business. I don't 
think we've been away from here together for more than three days since we 
started," Jim Malloy said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just our home, it's our livelihood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Malloys don't have to sell their house, although the county will offer to 
buy it. But Marcie Malloy is concerned about the mound of trash that will rise 
200 feet higher over their land in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
For those within the buffer zone, the 950-foot-high landfill level approved two 
weeks ago by county supervisors will cut afternoon and evening light from the 
west, not to mention cutting out sunsets. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already had problems with freezing in the low-lying areas," Marcie 
Malloy said. "Losing sunlight, even 15 minutes of it a day, could be a 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Magee, a principal civil engineer, said that the open-ended offer to buy 
out all but the three homeowners closest to the landfill was a humane gesture 
proposed by the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a few people 'paying' for what is a public facility -- paying by 
being adversely impacted," Magee explained. "The public should pay for 
acquiring their properties at fair market value and that is what we are 
planning to do, if they want to sell." 
</P>
<P>
And what will happen to the homes that the county acquires? Magee isn't sure 
yet, but he figures that when the expanded landfill is full -- in about 10 
years from now -- the county will probably put most of the property up for 
sale. "None of the land is to be used for actual landfill operations," Magee 
said of the Elfin Forest properties. "When the landfill is closed, it will be 
turned into some sort of a park by the city of San Marcos." 
</P>
<P>
To a person, the property owners who have a choice are undecided as to what 
they are going to do. But they do plan to go on fighting to overturn the 
county's decision to expand the San Marcos landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Marcie Malloy can't decide if she can stand another 10 years of dust seeping 
under her closed windows, of the constant roar of trash trucks and the growl of 
bulldozers seven days a week, of the shuddering roar of blasting and the 
cloying smell of overripe garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the only ones affected," she said. "It's the whole valley and more: 
the heavy trucks on our roads, the trash that they scatter along the roadside, 
the mud they track out of the dump that makes the road dangerous for all of us, 
the accidents that happen almost every week and the views of the Pacific Ocean 
that will be lost as the pile of trash grows higher. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they should honor the promise that they made to us 10 years ago 
and close the dump, and find someplace else to put the dump that is not in 
someone else's back yard."

UCLA: BRUINS OVERCOME CHILLY RECEPTION AT ALASKA ANCHORAGE TO DEFEAT HOST 
SEAWOLVES IN SHOOTOUT TOURNAMENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is a fear that hounds every big-name basketball team that steps into a 
small-time, hometown arena in an early season tournament. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA got away Saturday night, but not by much, finally beating Alaska 
Anchorage, 80-67, to reach the championship game of the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will play 18th-ranked Virginia for the title Monday at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th-ranked Bruins trailed by as many as six points in the first half, and 
led by only two at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Their first double-digit lead did not come until less than six minutes 
remained, when Gerald Madkins' strip-steal and layup made the score 66-55. 
</P>
<P>
The Seawolves then cut their deficit to seven on back-to-back three-pointers, 
but UCLA's zone defense stiffened, and Don MacLean made six consecutive free 
throws for a 13-point lead with 1:42 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We clutched up at the end, " said MacLean, who led UCLA with 27 points and 11 
rebounds. "I thought we hunkered down and got the defense, Keith Owens blocked 
some shots, we crashed the boards." 
</P>
<P>
It took almost all of that to beat the Seawolves. 
</P>
<P>
"They certainly weren't intimidated," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The great traditions of a visit to the Great Alaska Shootout include: A 
dog-sledding expedition, a visit to a glacier, and -- if a team is unlucky -- a 
game against the host team, Alaska Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that the Seawolves are extraordinarily talented. They are a Division 
II team, and Saturday they became the first Division II team that UCLA has 
played since 1961, when the Bruins beat DePauw. 
</P>
<P>
But for visiting Goliaths such as UCLA, there is little to be gained and much, 
much to be lost in a game against the Seawolves amid the shrill, howling, 
wolf-like cheers of their fans. 
</P>
<P>
"The conditions were very difficult to say the least," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA started slowly before a crowd of 7,947, and at halftime, the Bruins' lead 
was only 43-41. 
</P>
<P>
But these fans were no strangers to upset. If Alaska Anchorage had beaten UCLA, 
it would not even have been the the Seawolves' biggest upset. They beat 
Michigan in December of 1988; the Wolverines went on to win the NCAA title, and 
were ranked No. 1 in the nation and unbeaten when they lost to Alaska Anchorage 
in the Utah Classic in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Among other Divison I teams that have fallen: Auburn, Missouri, New Mexico, 
Texas and Washington -- 22 victories in all. 
</P>
<P>
The Seawolves' first half against UCLA was nip-and-tuck. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Anchorage led by as many as six points, UCLA by no more than three. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA sought to go inside to MacLean, and did so with some success. MacLean had 
16 points at halftime, and Madkins had 11. Madkins finished with 15. 
</P>
<P>
But two Alaska players kept making offensive strikes at the Bruins, who looked 
strikingly unable to slow them. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jones, a guard from Santa Cruz, kept pulling up for short jump shots. At 
halftime, he had 13 points -- and three fouls. He finished with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Johnson, a 6-4 forward from Honolulu, scored most of the Seawolves' 
baskets early. At halftime, he had 14 -- and two fouls. He finished with 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Anchorage became the second team in two nights to stay with UCLA for at 
least a half. UC Irvine, coming off a 5-23 season, was tied with UCLA at 77-77 
early in the second half Friday night before losing, 134-101, as UCLA set a 
school scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their enthusiasm, even the Seawolves' fans did not expect the game to 
be close. 
</P>
<P>
"You could give me 30 points and I wouldn't take it," said one Alaska Anchorage 
fan. "You see what they did to the SCI?" 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, he mistook UC Irvine for an imagined school named Southern 
California Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's opponent in the championship, 18th-ranked Virginia, has had to fend off 
upset bids in each of its first two games, beating Siena, 80-77, and South 
Carolina, 65-59. The Cavaliers' best players are junior forward Bryant Stith 
and senior point guard John Crotty. But two other players are not with the 
team. Matt Blundin, a 6-7 senior forward, was starting at quarterback for the 
Virginia football team Saturday, and guard Terry Kirby was starting at running 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Rhett, the South Carolina player who was forced to stop playing last season 
because of a heart problem and later had a pacemaker implanted, has returned to 
the court. He played in an official game for the first time Friday, and said he 
felt fine but was nervous. He scored 11 points in South Carolina's loss to 
Virginia Saturday. South Carolina Coach George Felton said that Rhett's heart 
ailment is not similar to the one that led to the death of Loyola Marymount's 
Hank Gathers.

Iowa lost to Minnesota and backed into the Rose Bowl, but the Hawkeyes aren't 
apologizing. 
</P>
<P>
"We still get to represent the Big Ten and we should," Iowa Coach Hayden Fry 
said after Minnesota beat the Hawkeyes, 31-24, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 13th-ranked Hawkeyes (8-3 overall, 6-2 in the Big Ten) earned a share of 
their seventh Big Ten title and their fifth Rose Bowl berth when Michigan beat 
Ohio State, 16-13. Iowa finished in a four-way tie for the conference title 
with Michigan, Michigan State and Illinois, but the Hawkeyes got the Rose Bowl 
bid by beating the other three teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat the teams we're tied with head-up on the road," Fry said. "We don't 
have any excuses about going. We deserve to be there. Maybe this loss will help 
us in the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Most Big Ten teams going to Pasadena celebrate. Not the Hawkeyes. They were 
subdued after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to feel. I feel terrible that we lost," quarterback Matt 
Rodgers said. "I'm happy we're going, but I'm not happy now. We didn't play 
like Big Ten champs." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bittersweet feeling," said Tony Stewart, who ran nine times for 34 
yards, leaving him 16 yards shy of Owen Gill's rushing mark for a career of 
2,556 yards. "We have to be happy to go to the Rose Bowl. Eventually that 
feeling is going to override the loss. Probably when we get back to Iowa City 
and the fans meet us at the airport, it'll sink in. We know we deserve to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers (6-5, 5-3) lost out on a bowl bid with losses of 28-16 to Michigan 
State and 35-18 to Michigan in the previous two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"After the last two weeks, I didn't know if they had enough left to play this 
hard, but they did," Coach John Gutekunst said. "Our kids rose to the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
They did it with defense and with a running attack. Iowa entered the game 
leading the Big Ten in total offense with 440 yards a game, but managed 303 
against the Gophers. Iowa had allowed 94.5 rushing yards a game and had held 
five teams to fewer than 60 yards this season. Led by Mark Smith's 80 yards, 
the Gophers rushed for 150 yards Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's one-yard touchdown run gave Minnesota a 14-10 lead with 4:23 left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
Then 1:45 later, freshman Omar Douglas blocked Jim Hujsak's punt at Iowa's 28. 
Minnesota's Keswic Joiner and Iowa's Jason Olejniczak both grabbed the ball at 
the two, but Joiner wrestled it away in the end zone to give the Gophers a 
21-10 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Minnesota's Brent Berglund kicked a 33-yard field goal and Rodgers threw 
a four-yard scoring pass to Michael Titley, Marquel Fleetwood hit Joiner with a 
28-yard touchdown pass to give the Gophers a 31-17 lead with 14:08 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota led, 7-3, when news of Ohio State's loss sent about 30,000 Iowa fans 
into a frenzy with 10:52 to go in the second quarter at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
The large visiting crowd created a unique situation when its screaming in the 
third quarter forced officials to stop play twice because the Gophers couldn't 
hear Fleetwood's signals.

SANDSTROM LIKES HAT'S FIT; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS: GRETZKY SETS HIM UP FOR THREE MORE GOALS IN 4-2 VICTORY AT MONTREAL, 
GIVING HIM EIGHT IN THREE GAMES.

<P>
After Tomas Sandstrom had scored a hat trick Saturday night in the Kings' 4-2 
victory over the Montreal Candiens, owner Bruce McNall, a wide grin on his 
face, asked, "Bernie who?" 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, after the Kings made the controversial deal that sent Bernie 
Nicholls to the New York Rangers for Sandstrom and Tony Granato, there was 
another question on most people's lips: "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
Now they know. 
</P>
<P>
Wielding the hottest stick in the league, Sandstrom is using it to obliterate 
any lingering doubts in the minds of those who wondered why the Kings would 
trade a 70-goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to get two men who could skate with Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the idea these days ought to be to make sure they have someone who can 
skate with Sandstrom. 
</P>
<P>
In the last week, he has merely: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Collected two hat tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scored eight goals in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gotten his 200th career goal. 
</P>
<P>
Reached a season total of 17 goals to pass the Gretzky and move into second 
place in the league behind Brett Hull. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say that he's a little hot," Coach Tom Webster said with a grin to 
match McNall's. 
</P>
<P>
There are nothing but grins around the Kings these days. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
The club's victory, coupled with a Calgary Flames' loss to the Chicago 
Blackhawks, moved the Kings into a three-point lead in the Smythe Division with 
a 16-5-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
They bounced back from their defeat at Calgary Thursday night to win for the 
seventh time in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom, Gretzky and Granato have combined for 43 goals and 95 points. 
</P>
<P>
For all of Sandstrom's recent clout, he wouldn't be doing nearly as well 
without Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Since Gretzky came to Los Angeles in 1988, the Kings have been looking for 
someone he could team up with the way he did in Edmonton with Jari Kurri. 
</P>
<P>
The only way Gretzky and Sandstrom could work any closer these days was if 
their sticks were tied together. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes it seems they are. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was the key factor in all three of Sandstrom's goals against the 
Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
On the first, 5:18 into the game, Gretzky intercepted a pass from Montreal's 
Guy Carbonneau just above the right circle. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky skated down the slot, Sandstrom right behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went in there for the rebound," Sandstrom said. "I didn't know if he 
saw me." 
</P>
<P>
He saw. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of shooting, Gretzky, seemingly with eyes in the back of his head, left 
a perfect drop pass for Sandstrom, who drilled it home. 
</P>
<P>
"You get lucky once in a while," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky fed Sandstrom again on the second goal, which came at the 12:44 mark of 
the opening period. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom's shot was blocked by goalie Patrick Roy, but Sandstrom picked off 
the rebound and flipped it over the Canadien goalie. 
</P>
<P>
On Sandstrom's third goal, Gretzky got lucky, again, whipping a no-look pass 
from the end boards to Sandstrom in the slot. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom took care of the rest at 2:19 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' final goal was scored by Dave Taylor, his fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's goals came off the sticks of Denis Savard (his eighth) and Donald 
Dufresne (his first). 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens outshot the Kings, 26-25, but King goalie Daniel Berthiaume came 
up with several clutch saves, much to the dismay of the Montreal Forum crowd of 
17,955. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens dropped to 11-10-3, but are still second in the Adams Division, 
despite a week in which 10 players were injured. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Kings' second victory at Montreal since the 1978-79 season. They 
were 1-14-2 since. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, with three points, moved past John Cullen of the Pittsburgh Penguins 
into the NHL scoring lead with 43 points. 
</P>
<P>
But when playing alongside Sandstrom these days, even a Great One takes second 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The scariest moment of the day for the Kings came in the morning practice when 
defenseman Tim Watters was accidentally knocked down by teammate Frank Breault. 
Hitting the ice head first, Watters was momentarily unconscious. Revived, he 
was taken to a nearby hospital where tests revealed no damage. Watters' only 
aftereffect was a headache. Scheduled to sit out anyway Saturday, Watters is 
expected to be available tonight in Quebec. . . . Missing for Montreal were 
forwards Sylvain Turgeon (stomach surgery), Benoit Brunet (knee injury), Shayne 
Corson (hip pointer), Mike McPhee (groin), Todd Ewen (strained knee), Ryan 
Walter (broken wrist) and Brent Gilchrist (broken finger).

ELLIS HAS GONE FROM A SONIC BOOM TO BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Ellis and the Seattle SuperSonics are finally near splitsville. Like many 
of Ellis' relationships, this one has been stormy. 
</P>
<P>
The king of the post-up jump shooters fought Xavier McDaniel last week after a 
practice in which several teammates taunted Ellis, persuading Coach K.C. Jones 
to shorten the drill. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' rise and fall in the Pacific Northwest mirrors that of the SuperSonics: 
</P>
<P>
July 23, 1986 -- Seattle acquires him from the Dallas Mavericks' bench for Al 
Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Spring, 1987 -- Ellis averages 25 points in the playoffs as the SuperSonics, a 
39-43 team, surprise Dallas and Houston to reach West finals. 
</P>
<P>
March 1, 1988 -- After a victory over the Lakers, Ellis' wife, Monique, engages 
in a fight in public with Bobby Jo Lister, teammate Alton's spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 8, 1989 -- Ellis is arrested after an argument with Monique, charged with 
assault and resisting arrest and fined $346. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 12, 1990 -- Ellis crashes his car into an on-ramp abutment, suffers broken 
ribs and a collapsed lung. He is convicted of drunken driving and sentenced to 
one day in a rehab center. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 20, 1990 -- Ellis, who hasn't played this season because of a nerve 
injury, arrives late for a home game against the New Jersey Nets, doesn't sit 
on the bench but in owner Barry Ackerley's seat at half-court, irritating 
teammates. Says Nate McMillan: "It shows who the big man around here is." 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 21, 1990 -- McDaniel fights Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, it's been routine. 
</P>
<P>
Just asking: The Lakers are a fast-break team, right? 
</P>
<P>
The best way to run is to play good defense, right? 
</P>
<P>
Why not make one more adjustment in the starting lineup -- A.C. Green for Vlade 
Divac -- to field their best defensive team? For all his potential, Divac is 
the fourth option in the offense. His points aren't carrying anyone, and his 
oft-slack defense hurts. Why not let him tear up No. 2 centers now and grow 
into a starter later? 
</P>
<P>
Say good night: After the Atlanta Hawks had lost a second time to the Charlotte 
Hornets, the players held a closed-door meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Said an unidentified Hawk to the Atlanta Constitution: 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty simple. We talked about how we went to management and said we 
wanted the other guy (former coach Mike Fratello) out of here. We wanted a guy 
who would treat us like men. (The Hawks subsequently hired mild-mannered Bob 
Weiss). 
</P>
<P>
"We're mishandling it. I think we all understand, if we don't turn things 
around, we're the ones who'll leave." 
</P>
<P>
Said General Manager Pete Babcock: "Mike Fratello told me it was important to 
make changes in the nucleus of the club. Mike may have been correct." 
</P>
<P>
First on most lists of potential deportees is aging Moses Malone, a poor fit in 
Weiss' passing game. Meanwhile, the Hawks suffered their seventh consecutive 
loss Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to tell the expansion teams anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The worst two records in each conference belong to old-line teams, so the new 
members must be doing something right. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota -- Coups: former UCLA guard Pooh Richardson in the draft, former 
Laker Tony Campbell in the expansion draft. Coach Bill Musselman's slow-down 
style gives everyone trouble, but he's loath to play newcomers (Richardson sat 
half a season behind, honest, Sidney Lowe; where's No. 1B pick Gerald Glass?), 
and uses his starters in more than 80% of games. 
</P>
<P>
Is this win-a-little-now stuff the way to build a team? 
</P>
<P>
Musselman is eerily intense; Pat Reusse of the Star Tribune in Minneapolis 
wrote that he has eyes "like a guy driving down a dirt road in Kansas after 
just killing a farm house full of people." 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte -- Coup: getting Armon Gilliam for Kurt Rambis. Original mistake: 
passing up erratic big man Rony Seikaly for erratic guard Rex Chapman. Chapman 
is catching fire at last, making 59% of his three-point attempts. However, 
Seikaly is still 6 foot 11. Problem: owner George Shinn is Atlantic Coast 
Conference-happy. He pressed for drafting North Carolina's J.R. Reid and 
reportedly had to be talked out of dealing for former Virginian Ralph Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando -- More of a veterans approach but strong drafts (rising star Nick 
Anderson last year, Dennis Scott this time) offer hope. A sensation when the 
Magic started 7-7 last season, but then the team went 11-57. Problem: desperate 
for a big man. Greg Kite starts. 
</P>
<P>
Miami -- Indifferent early results but Heat is doing it right, with young 
players. Coups: Seikaly; Sherman Douglas, nabbed in '89's second round. 
Cleverly crafted front-end-loaded offer sheet for John (Hot Rod) Williams might 
have had Cleveland wondering if it was worth it to match. If the Heat had 
pulled that one off, it might be close to making a run for the playoffs. 
Problem: Coach Ron Rothstein is up-tight. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento General Manager Jerry Reynolds on the Golden State Warriors: "They 
probably could beat the Lakers for third in the division." . . . After a loss 
at Boston, Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz said: "You look down at (the Celtics') 
bench and you see players who are hungry. You look down at ours and see players 
who don't belong in the league." 
</P>
<P>
He'll be sorry: Detroit's John Salley continues to illustrate Piston balance by 
taking shots at Michael Jordan. Said Salley: "It would be hard for Michael 
Jordan to play on this team." . . . Add sorry: Seattle's Gary Payton had a good 
exhibition game against Jordan and announced: "I can play defense on anyone, 
even Michael Jordan." In their first real meeting, Jordan stole the ball from 
Payton the first two times the rookie brought it up and went for 33 points. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey Nets' Sam Bowie, before the team ended its record road losing 
streak at 34 games: "The most obvious problem is we're not a good ball team, 
whether we're at home or on the road." . . . Isiah Thomas, warned that another 
poke in the eye might cost him his sight, threw away his goggles in frustration 
over his shooting and scored 32 points at Indianapolis. Included were a short 
jump shot with six seconds left in regulation to tie the game and two 
three-pointers in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Did Alex English retire and forget to tell anyone? The former Nugget, 35, is 
averaging 18 minutes, 6.5 points and shooting 33% in Dallas. . . . Maybe 15's 
the charm: The Philadelphia 76ers signed Andre Turner and Jim Farmer to shore 
up the backcourt after Johnny Dawkins' loss. Between them, Turner and Farmer 
have been waived or left unprotected 14 times.

GAME OF PASSION, WITHOUT MEANING; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: THE 49ERS ARE UNBEATEN AND CAN CLINCH NFC WEST TITLE WITH VICTORY. THEIR 
TRADITIONAL RIVAL IS 3-7 AND PLAYING THAT WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throw out that nasty 3-7 record, which the Rams surely will volunteer to do, 
and this could be a decent football game. 
</P>
<P>
And while we're at it, throw out those four Super Bowl rings, and Joe Montana 
hasn't done anything but film a few thousand commercials. 
</P>
<P>
It's temporary selective amnesia time in the Bay Area. The San Francisco 49ers 
want to forget that they are 10-0 and about to play a dreadful football team. 
The Rams simply want to forget that in 1990 they are a dreadful football team. 
</P>
<P>
This is still one of the most passionate rivalries in the NFL, and so what if 
the Rams' chances of victory are about as relevant to the playoff race as Coach 
John Robinson's choice of game garb? These teams have waited months for this. 
Relevance is nothing compared to sheer intra-state dislike. 
</P>
<P>
"You never forget the times you lost against these guys," said Ram defensive 
end Doug Reed, who has lost his share, among them the Rams' 30-3 NFC 
championship game defeat last year, to the 49ers. "They're arrogant, their fans 
are probably the nastiest fans in the world. And we're down right now but we're 
not out." 
</P>
<P>
Four Super Bowl titles, the last two in succession, could give a team reason to 
be a little cocky. The 49ers are 24-1 since losing to the Rams at Candlestick 
Park early last season and are barreling down their schedule with a realistic 
shot at a perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
As San Francisco inside linebacker Matt Millen said: "I have yet to run across 
a 10-0 team that wasn't playing well." He could probably have added: "Or a 3-7 
team that wasn't playing poorly." 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams, who -- if you throw out the championship game -- have beaten the 
49ers the last two times at Candlestick, aren't quite in the mood to be 
reminded of such things. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see it's going to be a physical football game, no matter what," Reed 
said. "And when we go down, we're going to go down hard and there's going to be 
a lot of people sore." 
</P>
<P>
While the Rams are whipping themselves up to find meaning in this meaningless 
season, the 49ers are just trying to stay on balance. Already the nation's 
attention is focused on next week, when the New York Giants, also 10-0, come to 
San Francisco for a Monday night super team summit. 
</P>
<P>
So is it hard to feel as intense about a game with the suddenly sad-sack Rams 
when the 49ers are used to squaring off with their Southern California rivals 
for division titles? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but at the same time, when Los Angeles comes up here to play this 
ballgame, it will be as if it's for the world's championship, I'm sure," 49er 
Coach George Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why they've been such tough games year in and year out. Los Angeles 
wants to beat us, probably in the absolute worst way, and we don't want to 
become embarrassed. So really, the fact of the playoffs or division 
championship or anything, it really almost is a side issue right now." 
</P>
<P>
It really almost has to be a side issue, because the Rams have been 
mathematically eliminated from the division race and because the 49ers have 
logically eliminated about everybody else. A victory by San Francisco would 
clinch the NFC West title. 
</P>
<P>
But Seifert does have reason to be concerned, if only because of the 49ers' 
four losses in their last 38 games, two have been to the Rams. So when they 
lose, it's a good bet it's to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the 49ers probably rank first over my time as the best team in the 
league in terms of number of wins," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "We rank 
fifth. (In) number of times getting into the playoffs, we rank second. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're a good team. And over the period of years, we are. If you took those 
seven years going into this year, we're one of the better teams. We play them 
twice, and we play them good." 
</P>
<P>
But competing with the 49ers is something totally different from beating them, 
as they have proved time and again this season. The 49ers haven't blown the 
league away, just played well enough to go 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
And as always, the man who leads them is Montana, who seems to enjoy strafing 
the Rams. In the 21 games Montana has played against the Rams, he has thrown 
for 5,178 yards (246.6 a game) and 34 touchdowns while completing 65.3% of his 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
He has completed more passes, played more games and thrown more passes for more 
yards and more touchdowns against the Rams than any other quarterback, by far. 
And you thought you were just imagining it. 
</P>
<P>
Montana also happens to lead the NFC in pass yardage this season, and already 
has thrown for more than 3,000 yards for the seventh time in his career. 
Against the Rams' next-to-last pass defense, Montana's next-to-first pass 
offense should find some openings. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also are playing pretty mean defense, ranking No. 7 overall and No. 1 
against the rush. But they have been vulnerable against the pass, having 
allowed 274.8 yards a game. Blitzing linebacker Charles Haley is their 
point-man, and he leads the NFC with 12 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, through most of the year the 49ers play close games," Robinson said. 
"The 49ers play a lot of games where the other guy is in it until the end. A 
year ago, it was the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The season's all over and they kill Minnesota and they kill us and then Denver 
(in the playoffs), and you think, 'Wow! They kill everybody.' That's not true." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson is 5-10 against the 49ers. 49er Coach George Seifert is 
27-2 overall, 2-1 against Robinson's Rams. . . . Ram quarterback Jim Everett 
has played seven games against San Francisco and never has passed for more than 
250 yards. . . . The Rams have been outscored in the fourth quarter this 
season, 81-37.

CONTROL OF AFC WEST RACE AT STAKE; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: THEY'LL BE OUT TO AVENGE 9-7 LOSS AT KANSAS CITY IN TODAY'S GAME AT 
THE COLISEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks and seven Derrick Thomas sacks ago, the Raiders tried to pass 31 
times into a Kansas City cold front. They fought the storm and the storm won, 
9-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders aren't usually much for tricks, yet they threw the kitchen sink at 
the Chiefs in the sleet Nov. 4. Do you remember three deep incomplete passes on 
first down at the Kansas City 49 in the fourth quarter, when 20 yards and a 
field goal would have meant the lead? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders followed up the next week with their worst performance to date, a 
13-point home loss to the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Time for some rare oratory from Coach Art Shell. He took the podium before last 
Monday night's game in Miami and redefined with his fists the Raiders' theory 
of simplicity: Don't jump over a wall if you can run through it, he said. Leave 
the cute stuff for the run-and-shooters. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders then opened the game by giving the ball eight straight times to 
Marcus Allen. The defense played make-a-wish with Dan Marino's legs. Jay 
Schroeder passed 19 times. The Raiders won, 13-10. Point made. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they made a very specific statement at the outset of the Dolphin 
game," Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
Shell isn't much for words, but he picks his spots. Miami seemed the right 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the first time this year I did that," Shell said. "I kind of 
felt we lost that edge, the mental edge where you believe you're going to knock 
their block off every time you walk on the football field. It got to the point 
where I felt they might have lost a little of that edge. I challenged them to 
get it back." 
</P>
<P>
That mountain conquered, the challenge this week is to box whatever it was the 
Raiders took to Miami and unload it on Kansas City, which storms the Coliseum 
gates today with a chance to redefine the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs (6-4) can take control of the division race with a victory, which 
would mean a sweep of the season series, a first-place tie, and the upper-hand 
on any head-to-head tiebreaker decisions involving the Raiders, come playoff 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, of course, understand the stakes, and would like nothing better 
than to avenge their two-point loss in Kansas City and prove they are the true 
monsters of power football. 
</P>
<P>
The teams are remarkably similar in substance and style. Put a mirror up to the 
Chiefs and you might see a reflection of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
If the Raiders never had to throw a pass to win, they'd do it. Kansas City, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"I think basically it's going be one of those games that could conceivably end 
in two hours and 15 or 20 minutes," Schottenheimer said. "Because they're going 
to run it and we're going to try to run it." 
</P>
<P>
Let both defenses try to stop it. There's more arrogance involved here than 
strategy, as witnessed in Miami, where the Raiders made no secret that Allen 
was getting the ball every down on the first series. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything's working, why should we try to fix it?" fullback Steve Smith 
asked. "Stick with it until they stop it. A lot of times in this game, everyone 
is so sophisticated, there's so much high technology, that everybody's trying 
to out-think everyone else. Sooner or later you've got to say 'Screw it, let's 
play football. Let's line it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders prefer to exercise mental powers on specific concerns, such as 
devising schemes to stop an opponent's defensive superstar. Today it's outside 
linebacker Derrick Thomas, who leads the NFL with 15 quarterback sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, of course, set an NFL single-game sack record against Seattle two weeks 
ago with seven. 
</P>
<P>
In the Raider scheme, such a one-man act is intolerable. In their loss to the 
Chiefs, they threw various combinations of blockers at Thomas and limited him 
to a single sack.

"The best way to see how people control Derrick is to look at the Raiders," 
Schottenheimer said. "What they do is put one or two guys on him and, if it 
becomes necessary, sometimes they put three over there. (Shell) is going to 
make somebody else put pressure on the quarterback. Quite frankly, it's 
obviously sound coaching." 
</P>
<P>
The list of opposing quarterback sackers who have taken their shots at the 
Raiders this season include Miami's Jeff Cross, Green Bay's Tim Harris, Kansas 
City's Thomas, San Diego's twosome of Leslie O'Neal and Lee Williams, Chicago's 
Richard Dent and Buffalo's Bruce Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Those six players recorded a total of four sacks of quarterback Jay Schroeder. 
Harris led the way with two, and it should be noted he got his on consecutive 
downs after the game had been decided. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to that is designing a pass protection scheme that takes away, as much 
as possible, the big-time player of that particular defensive unit," Shell 
said. "You can't allow guys to take over the game." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who has two good runners of his own, 
said he can't believe the wealth of talent in the Raiders' backfield. "It's 
hard to imagine they've got a guy like (Greg) Bell on injured reserve," he 
said. "They probably have more quality runners on that team than certainly any 
team in our division, and maybe as some divisions in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Chief linebacker Derrick Thomas on the simplicity of the Raider offense: "They 
don't think anybody can stop them. I don't think they're going to change very 
much." . . . The Raiders are 6-1 against the Chiefs at the Coliseum. The 
Raiders are 10-1 at home under Coach Art Shell. . . . The Raider defense has 
allowed only one rushing touchdown this season, a two-yard run by Seattle's 
John. L. Williams on Sept. 16.

WHITTINGHAM COLT UNDERTAKES THE GROUNDWORK FOR DERBY BID

<P>
Long before Excavate was ready to make his debut, trainer Charlie Whittingham 
said he was the horse who was going to take him to the Kentucky Derby next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
After watching the $1.1-million yearling perform Saturday at Hollywood Park, it 
is easy to see why. 
</P>
<P>
Bet down to 7-10, the Mr. Prospector colt -- a half-brother to Desert Wine -- 
won the sixth race by five lengths without ever feeling Chris McCarron's whip. 
After breaking poorly, Excavate moved up powerfully while wide to join the 
leaders around the turn, then coasted home while covering the six furlongs in 
1:10 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
"He does everything right," said Whittingham, who owns Excavate in partnership 
with Dick Duchossois and Arthur Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though he didn't break well, I didn't expect him to. I buzzed him out of 
the gate. You don't win many races out of the gate. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, he can get moving so quick. This is a good horse. He's big, he's 
strong, he strides from here to there and you've got his pedigree. He's got 
everything you need." 
</P>
<P>
Excavate is already one step ahead of Sunday Silence and Ferdinand, 
Whittingham's two Kentucky Derby winners. Sunday Silence was beaten in his 
first start and Ferdinand didn't break his maiden until his fourth race. 
</P>
<P>
There's a possibility Excavate could return in the $1-million Hollywood 
Futurity in two weeks. "It might be a little quick to run him back, but I 
wouldn't rule it out," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron, who also rides another promising 2-year-old, General Meeting, was 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"That sent a chill up my spine," he said. "When I looked back at the eighth 
pole and he was rolling, I think Charlie could have rode that one. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad that we were lucky enough to draw outside because he broke a little 
slow. He always gave us the impression that he had quality, and I think he 
proved that today. At this stage, I think we can consider him a Derby 
prospect." 
</P>
<P>
Two races after Excavate's debut, McCarron was right back in the winner's 
circle after Frost Free led wire-to-wire in the $110,300 Vernon O. Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-1 shot, the 5-year-old It's Freezing gelding popped the gate, shook off 
Thirty Slews, then drew away to beat favored Timebank by almost two lengths in 
1:08 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
This was the third stakes victory and fourth victory in 11 starts this year for 
Frost Free. It will come as welcome news to owner Jim Vandervoort, the man 
behind Triple Dot Dash Stable. 
</P>
<P>
"This was nice," trainer John Sadler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim's been in intensive care for about six weeks in La Jolla after he had a 
heart attack. I spoke to his wife (Joyce) this morning, and I told her that 
hopefully I'd be able to call her with some good news. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that surprised me was that he was such a big price. He's a proven 
stakes-quality horse. Those other horses are very good horses and will win a 
lot of stakes, but Frost Free is already a multiple-stakes winner." 
</P>
<P>
This was the first victory in three starts on the Hollywood Park main track for 
Frost Free, who is one of three crack sprinters Sadler trains. Olympic Prospect 
is prepping for a return during the first week of racing at Santa Anita, and 
Valiant Pete upset Sensational Star in the California Cup Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he had excuses in both of those losses," Sadler said of Frost Free. 
"He ran second and I thought he had a bad trip when he ran fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Timebank, the 8-5 choice even though he has never won a stake, finished two 
lengths ahead of 10-1 shot Sam Who without any excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved to Frost Free at the end there, and it was unreal how hard my horse 
was going," jockey Kent Desormeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the catbird seat, only the cat was faster than the bird today." 
</P>
<P>
One 2-year-old who will be in the Futurity is Best Pal, whose four-race winning 
streak ended in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely going to run," trainer Ian Jory said. "Most of the best 
(2-year-olds) ran in the Prevue (Friday) and, while they've gotten better, he's 
still a better horse." 
</P>
<P>
A winner of three stakes at Del Mar, including the Futurity, before winning the 
Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita, Best Pal finished sixth in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela has been the gelding's regular rider, but with his status 
pending, Best Pal might have a new pilot in the Futurity. The California Horse 
Racing Board will meet in executive session later this week to discuss 
Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had plenty of calls, but I want to wait and see how Patrick's hearing 
comes out to know whether he's going to ride," Jory said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in action 10 days after suffering a broken right elbow in a five-horse 
spill, Gary Stevens won with the last of his five mounts Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye spoiled Stevens' first race back when he rode Marsha's 
Dancer to victory over Somethingmerry, but America's leading money-winning 
rider came back to win the ninth on Breakfast Table. 
</P>
<P>
"The first race I rode, I felt real comfortable all the way," said Stevens, who 
has the mount on Cuddles in today's $500,000 Hollywood Starlet. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't feel like I'd been away at all. I've ridden five races in a row, and 
I feel better than I did when I started." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron had three winners Saturday and holds a 23-20 lead over Alex 
Solis in the Hollywood Park standings. Julio Garcia also had a triple Saturday, 
sweeping the double with Aegean King and Slewrena and taking the seventh on 
15-1 shot Copelan's Game. 
</P>
<P>
Fly Till Dawn, who was scratched from last week's Citation Handicap to wait for 
the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup Dec. 16, worked six furlongs in 1:14 1/5 
Saturday morning for trainer Darrell Vienna. . . . Cuddles is the 3-1 favorite 
on Russ Hudak's morning line. Next is Lite Light (4-1), Garden Gal and 
Theresa's Pleasure (9-2), Far Out Nurse (6-1), Miami Vacation (8-1), Dorky 
(12-1), Present Moment (15-1) and Scorpio Marjorie and On Final (30-1).

DIVERSE PERSONALITIES YIELD DELICATE ALLIANCES

<P>
Alliances on the Los Angeles Board of Education are fluid, delicate and often 
unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
For example, while Leticia Quezada has counted Jackie Goldberg on her side when 
it comes to bilingual education and year-round schools, it is a different 
matter when the issue is whether to change superintendents or how to lop $220 
million from the Los Angeles Unified School District's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the most consistent allies are Rita Walters and Quezada, who often 
stand together on matters they believe reflect inequities in the treatment of 
black and Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
That was not always the case. Quezada said Walters did not trust her when she 
first joined the board, and the two engaged in some public feuding. Eventually, 
they worked out their differences during several private meetings, including 
one at the home of Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
"We broke down the barriers between them," Alatorre said of the afternoon 
session. "We had two strong-willed women very committed to issues. They had the 
same concerns, but they weren't communicating." 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 60, a fiery veteran of school desegregation battles, has long believed 
that the district's black youngsters get a raw deal. She is openly suspicious 
of the other board members' motives. She refused to vote for fellow liberal 
Goldberg for president, and sometimes needles Warren Furutani, whose 
dramatically diverse board district stretches from the poor black and Latino 
neighborhoods south of Los Angeles to the suburb of San Pedro: "Warren, you act 
like you don't represent Watts." 
</P>
<P>
Quezada, 37, came to California as a child, a Mexican immigrant struggling to 
learn English in schools that had little help to offer her. She graduated with 
honors from UC Santa Cruz, and earned a master's degree in education and a 
teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
High on her priorities list are bilingual education and more Latino parent 
involvement in the schools. A diplomat who talks about "process," she refrains 
from personal criticism of other board members and tries to get along with all 
her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, 46, an articulate, longtime liberal activist, is philosophically 
aligned with Quezada and Walters, but she often positions herself to be more 
open to compromise, especially on the kind of trade-off issues she calls 
"tweeners." She sided with the majority (and against Walters and Quezada) in a 
vote to relax the district's tough academic requirements for participation in 
sports and other after-school activities because she felt the activities' 
incentives for youngsters to stay in school outweighed the need for maintaining 
strict achievement rules. 
</P>
<P>
Furutani, 43, shot into the spotlight in 1987 when he reversed his vote on a 
plan to relieve overcrowding by putting all the district's schools into 
year-round operation. His reversal forced the board to delay its plan. Fellow 
board members criticized his "flip-flop," some contending that he had not 
understood what he had voted on. 
</P>
<P>
Furutani said his constituents did not know about the vote and had not been 
given the opportunity to "register their feelings." This year, he voted for the 
proposal -- after holding six neighborhood meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1987 flap, he has kept a relatively low profile, viewing himself as a 
"mediator" and putting few controversial measures on the table. He is sometimes 
a swing vote, and sides more often with the suburban members. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Korenstein, 47, elected with strong union support, has found common 
ground most often with another union ally and the board's newest member, Mark 
Slavkin, elected in 1989 to represent the Westside. They sit next to each other 
at board meetings, and she often seems to consult him before she speaks out or 
moves to amend others' motions. 
</P>
<P>
A former special education teacher, Korenstein has carried the ball on 
successful drives to toughen the district's punishment of students who bring 
weapons to school and to soften its academic standards for students who 
participate in extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
An avowed fiscal conservative, she has set herself up as a watchdog of district 
spending, and often questions even small amounts for building projects or field 
trips. She has been dismissed by some as a lightweight, in part because her 
questions are often simplistic and appear to reflect a lack of understanding of 
district procedures. She is lauded by others for not being afraid to question 
"sacred cows" or challenge conventional notions, such as her suggestion earlier 
this year that the district's busing-for-integration program be disbanded 
because its students were not showing achievement gains. 
</P>
<P>
Many board watchers expect Slavkin, at 29 its youngest member, to go the 
furthest in carving out a political career. A former aide to county Supervisor 
Ed Edelman, his political sophistication shows in his demeanor and the broad 
approach he has taken in his short time on the board. 
</P>
<P>
He chooses not to respond to Walters' frequent public attacks. He works closely 
and visibly with parents and schools in his district and offers far-reaching -- 
if short on specifics -- ideas to address such district problems as 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
His critics are suspicious of his ties to United Teachers Los Angeles, and he 
did nothing to assuage them when he carried a motion, approved by the board, 
for requiring non-member teachers to pay the union for its contract bargaining 
and other services. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of the current board members won their first terms in large part 
because of union support. However, a pattern has emerged that board members 
tend to loosen their ties to UTLA as other groups and pressures exert 
themselves. Now, the union usually finds itself in the opposite camp from 
Walters, and its leaders have split often enough with fellow teacher Goldberg 
that it did not endorse her when she sought her second term in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Walters has been the union's most outspoken critic. She was the only one to 
vote against the contract that ended a 1989 teachers' strike with a hefty pay 
raise and an accord that paved the way for a transfer of power from district 
headquarters to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Her contentious spirit over what she calls "issues of equity" for the 
district's black students and employees has won her many loyal admirers in the 
11 years that she has been on the board. 
</P>
<P>
As her single-mindedness leaves her more and more isolated from her colleagues, 
some black community leaders worry that her unwillingness to build bridges with 
more of the other board members undercuts her effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The length of her tenure on the board is matched only by Roberta Weintraub's 
and, during the long fight over busing, the two women engaged in some of the 
most strident exchanges of that time. Weintraub, not realizing the mike was 
open, once referred to Walters as a "bitch" on a radio interview program. 
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two are far more civil now, although it is clear that 
scars from the blows exchanged a decade ago remain. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, 55, has tempered the excitable, rather naive nature she exhibited 
when she was elected in 1979 by anti-busing forces. She once told a reporter 
she had spent most of her life in affluent, middle-class Jewish circles before 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got on the board, then came the full spectrum. I discovered what the 
city was really like," Weintraub said in a 1985 interview in which she 
acknowledged that she had made mistakes early on. 
</P>
<P>
Since mandatory busing ended in spring 1981, Weintraub has concentrated on 
pushing for equitable pay for women and for better opportunities for their 
advancement. She joined Goldberg in winning controversial health clinics for 
three of the district's most needy high schools. A health and fitness buff, she 
has campaigned for more nutritious meals and for a while succeeded in banning 
"junk food" from campus vending machines. She often gets up at 4 a.m. to fit 
daily workouts into her schedule. While she was school board president a couple 
of years ago, she insisted on adding bottles of a trendy mineral water -- with 
labels removed so as not to provide free advertising for the company -- to the 
peanuts, M &amp; Ms and other goodies board members munch during meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her colleagues find her alternately irritating and endearing. 
</P>
<P>
"One day Roberta drives you crazy with something she does at the meeting," said 
one, "but the next day she's on the phone to you, worried because she noticed 
you weren't feeling well, and you realize she really cares. You just can't stay 
mad at her."

MAN SAVED WHEN BEEPER DEFLECTS BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A belt-clip beeper deflected a bullet and may have saved the life of a man who 
became locked in a deadly struggle with a masked gunman who was attempting to 
rob the man's girlfriend in Long Beach, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was shot and killed during the struggle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were not seriously injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker was identified as Vernon Justice, 23, of Inglewood, Lt. Philip 
King said. Justice was pronounced dead at Long Beach Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to identify the two victims, saying that a second suspect may 
have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
King said the 19-year-old woman was walking to a car in the underground garage 
of an apartment building in the 200 block of Nevada Street around 9 p.m. Friday 
when she was grabbed from behind by a man wearing a ski mask and rubber gloves. 
King said the man put a gun to her head. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, as the woman's 25-year-old boyfriend came into the garage, the 
gunman released the woman and charged at the boyfriend, firing a shot as he 
approached, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet was deflected by the man's beeper, which was attached to the front 
of his belt. 
</P>
<P>
Other shots were fired as the two struggled for the weapon, and the boyfriend 
managed to point the gun back at his attacker as another shot went off, 
striking the gunman in the chest, King said.

2 DIE AS CRASH ENDS CHASE, BATTLE WITH DEPUTIES IN EAST L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: FOUR ALLEGED GANG MEMBERS ALSO ARE PULLED FROM BURNING WRECKAGE OF 
CAR BY PURSUING OFFICERS.

<P>
A drive-by shooting by six suspected members of an East Los Angeles gang 
erupted into a rolling gunfight with Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies that 
ended in a fiery crash and the deaths of two of the suspects, authorities said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The four survivors were rescued from the flaming wreckage of their car by 
deputies who had chased them across East Los Angeles. The alleged gang members' 
vehicle flipped over after slamming into the car of another set of deputies who 
had joined the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really ironic how it turned out, that these guys were saved by the people 
they were trying to kill," said Sgt. Bob Olmsted. 
</P>
<P>
No deputies were wounded. Two received minor injuries in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
The battle started around 10:45 p.m. Friday, Olmsted said, when three deputies 
from the sheriff's East Los Angeles substation, driving an unmarked car, saw 
the occupants of another car firing into a home in the 3200 block of Winter 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting apparently was part of an ongoing conflict between two gangs, 
Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the suspects realized the deputies were behind them, they then shot at 
the deputies," Olmsted said. After deputies fired back, the suspects sped away, 
triggering the five-minute chase that spanned 13 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
At the intersection of 1st and Mott streets, the suspects' car overturned and 
burst into flames after it smashed into a marked sheriff's patrol car that had 
joined the chase, Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
When the deputies ordered the occupants out of the car, more shots were fired 
as the suspects began climbing out of the overturned vehicle, Olmsted said. The 
deputies returned the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Two suspects, Ismael Garcia, 19, and Alejandor Luevano, 20, both of Los 
Angeles, collapsed and died after staggering across the intersection, officials 
said. Both had gunshot wounds, although an autopsy will be conducted to 
determine the exact cause of death, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies then ran to the burning car, pulling four of the gang members to 
safety, Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect, Angel Esparza, 20, of Los Angeles, was listed in critical 
condition at County-USC Medical Center. Victor Gomez, 21, of West Covina, Otto 
Sanabria, 19, of Los Angeles, and an unidentified 16-year-old were listed in 
good condition. They were booked for investigation of murder at the hospital's 
jail ward. 
</P>
<P>
One deputy in the patrol car that was struck suffered a dislocated shoulder, 
and another sustained head and leg injuries. They were treated at Santa Marta 
Hospital in East Los Angeles, Olmsted said. The names of the deputies were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated shooting involving a sheriff's deputy, an alleged gang member 
was shot and wounded after authorities said he attempted to rob an off-duty 
deputy at a Willowbrook gas station. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy William Buss was uninjured in the 6 a.m. shooting at an Arco gas station 
in the 1330 block of Imperial Highway, Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
Buss was pumping gas when the suspect, identified as Morris Barnes, 26, of Los 
Angeles, approached from behind, pulled out a gun and demanded the deputy's 
money and wallet, Olmsted said, adding that Buss complied. 
</P>
<P>
As Barnes started to run, the deputy identified himself as a law enforcement 
officer and ordered him to halt, Olmsted said, adding that the alleged robber 
then spun and pointed a gun at Buss. The deputy shot Barnes once in the leg 
with his off-duty service revolver, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes was treated for his wound and booked at the Men's Central Jail on 
suspicion of assault on a police officer and robbery.

THE BRASH, BRIGHT BRANFORD MARSALIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, Zan Stewart writes about jazz regularly for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ubiquitous Branford Marsalis operates in so many fields -- as a jazz tenor 
saxophonist and composer, as a pop saxman for Sting, contributing to movie 
soundtracks, even acting in movies -- you never know where he'll turn up. 
</P>
<P>
If you were flipping TV channels on a recent evening, you might have seen 
Marsalis on Roy Firestone's ESPN "SportsLook" interview show, speaking with 
considerable authority on the New Orleans Saints, and other topics of the 
sports world. 
</P>
<P>
"Firestone's a jazz buff, and me, I'm like the sports junkie of doom," explains 
the brash, bright Marsalis, a 30-year-old whose resume also lists husband and 
father, the following afternoon. He's sitting on a couch in an upstairs 
dressing room on a Paramount Studios soundstage before appearing on "The 
Arsenio Hall Show" with his quartet, and enthusiastically offering opinions on 
a number of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly Marsalis, whose quartet plays Orange County Performing Arts Center 
Thursday, Royce Hall Friday and the Wadsworth Theater, next Sunday, talks about 
jazz. Despite his forays into pop and film, he says in a soft, tender voice 
that his life "has always been about the music, it was never not about the 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz has treated Marsalis, a mercurial improviser and astute contemporary 
composer who has played saxophones with bands led by his brother, Wynton, Art 
Blakey, Herbie Hancock and Miles Davis, extremely well and he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at the top of the quote-unquote jazz world," he says with a 
straight-forward, no-nonsense look on his face that contrasts with an animated 
see-saw swaying of his thighs. He's dressed in Reebok bike shorts, a gray Nike 
T-shirt that blares "High Flyin' 360 Slam Dunk" alongside Spike Lee's face, a 
pair of scuffed-up Puma basketball shoes and a red baseball cap. "I live a 
charmed life. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz is affording me everything else," he continues. "If it wasn't for jazz 
and the conception of what jazz demands from a musician, there wouldn't have 
been the movies, there wouldn't have been (the tours with) Sting. I would be 
like any other pop saxophone player, squeaking out those same worn out King 
Curtis licks." In addition to his work on two Sting albums and extensive tours, 
Marsalis has had roles in the movies "Throw Momma From the Train" and "School 
Daze," and has played on the soundtracks of several Spike Lee movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz has allowed me to be really creative. How can I turn my back on that?" 
</P>
<P>
His current success in jazz is well documented. He is touring steadily with his 
quartet -- Kenny Kirkland, piano, Bob Hurst, bass and Jeff "Tain" Watts, drums 
-- and his two latest albums have placed as high as Number One on the Billboard 
Jazz charts. The records, both on CBS, are "Crazy People Music" with the 
quartet, and the soundtrack for Lee's film about a group of young jazz 
musicians, "Mo' Better Blues," which was released on CBS under Marsalis' name 
but also features other artists, including singer Cynda Williams. 
</P>
<P>
These are two distinctly different albums, the hornman points out, and they 
have garnered disparate sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The music for 'Mo' Better' is obviously not all jazz even though people say it 
is," he says. "We simplified it so that the average person can understand it. 
It has one quasi-jazz ballad, a rap tune and a Les McCann-Eddie Harris type 
tune that everybody can sing to. The quartet record is hard-core jazz with not 
a lot of easily recognizable melodies. They both have my name on them. 'Crazy 
People' has sold 70,000 to date, 'Mo' Better' has sold 270,000. There you have 
it," he says, opening his palms, indicating the relative fate of a 
straight-ahead jazz record, even by someone with the name Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
Then he quickly adds, "Oh, I have the choice. I could be making another kind of 
music that would make me a lot more money." He did with Sting, but insists that 
"I legitimately like his music. If more pop musicians were like him, the 
(scene) would be cool. Even though everyone finds him arrogant and unbearable, 
I think he's a reasonable person." 
</P>
<P>
But a let's-get-rich scenario holds scant interest for him. "Me, be a 
millionaire, nah, I don't give a damn," he says, wrapping his hands under 
thighs. "I don't need a million dollars to be happy. I just want to play music 
and be with my family and have enough to pay for my house and car." 
</P>
<P>
One of Marsalis' definitions of happiness is a good neighborhood, and he 
recently moved from Brooklyn, where he lived for nine years, to New Rochelle, a 
quiet suburb just north of New York City. "I dreaded going home. Hearing gun 
shots at night, people screaming, trucks rumbling down the street at three in 
the morning, I don't find any of that romantic." 
</P>
<P>
To keep himself and his family -- his wife Teresa and four-year-old son, Reese 
-- comfortable, Marsalis is on the road a lot these days, a situation he both 
relishes and abhors. 
</P>
<P>
The downside is the time away. "It's safe to say I'm not home a lot, about five 
days a month," he says with an ironic laugh. "Going on the road is not fun and 
if I didn't have to, I wouldn't be out here that much. But I really don't have 
an alternative. If I worked less, I might be able to spend a lot more time with 
my family but then I couldn't afford my home. So would I rather be in a two 
bedroom apartment in East Manhattan and spend ten years with Reese and Teresa? 
No." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he says his relationship with Reese has not suffered by his absences. "I 
don't have any problems with my son. I speak to him like an adult. My dad was 
like that. He just laid the law down once and it was over." 
</P>
<P>
The positive side of Marsalis' travels is that he's spending all this time away 
from home working with his quartet of a year and a half, a band that includes 
his favorite players and which nurtures his musicality. But before spring, 
1989, the saxophonist only teamed up with his cohorts occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the change," he says, leaning back and locking his hands behind his 
head. "It's my band, we don't just come in to do a record. Now we're a band and 
working out things the way bands can. The only record (of the five CBS solo 
dates) before 'Crazy People Music' that approaches it was 'Random Abstract' 
(1988-CBS), and that's because that was also a working band (with Kirkland, 
bassist Delbert Felix and drummer Lewis Nash). The new record's tight, not full 
of guesswork, like a lot of the others. Still, the record is not as good as the 
band is live, but isn't that the way it always turns out?" 
</P>
<P>
Just how good is the quartet, which, as heard on "Crazy People Music," embodies 
exemplary characteristics of contemporary jazz, with the playing going from 
inventive, hard-boiling swing to free-wheeling essays? 
</P>
<P>
"We're out there now, we're playing the stuff," Marsalis says. Then he pauses, 
closes his eyes, looking for the right words, finds them, opens his eyes and -- 
shooting a look at a visitor -- says, "We're the best band out there," with a 
slight nervous chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not be the best musicians, but we're the best band," he continues, 
firmly committed to this tack. "I can say that now. I wouldn't have said it 
before, because it wouldn't have been true. I always use baseball analogies. 
What did they used to say about the Boston Red Sox? Twenty-five players, 25 
cabs. That's the difference. We have a working band and we all understand each, 
complement each other very well." 
</P>
<P>
When the topic turns to his own playing, the slim, dynamic Marsalis' opinions 
take on a self-effacing toughness. "I don't really like my tone or my 
technique, though I do like my approach," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He will go so far as to say that after nine years as a professional, he's 
"becoming a good musician. Becoming," he emphasizes. "Playing feels good now. I 
know I'm growing when I go back and listen to my old records. I can listen to 
them now. A year ago, I couldn't. I was too close to them but now that I don't 
really play like that, I can listen now. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's different, it just is," he says. "It's like I've said all 
along, for me to play, for me to get my voice, I need the right personnel. And 
the only personnel I've met that can make me play my best are the guys I have 
now." 
</P>
<P>
As to why Marsalis didn't have more of a individual voice at a younger age, he 
says with a wicked smile, "I was having too much fun. Jazz music is like 
baseball. It's a very, very, very rare thing when a young, young player walks 
in and makes an immediate impact. There are all these little things that take 
years to learn how to do." 
</P>
<P>
There are many colleagues who feel that, contrary to his own perception, 
Marsalis has had something to say for quite awhile. One is Herbie Hancock, with 
whom Marsalis has played at various times. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had the fortune of working with some of the greatest saxophonists in 
the world, and as far as I'm concerned, he's in that line, he's one of the 
best," Hancock says. "He plays like his personality, with a lot of heart. He's 
a very intelligent player, and respectful, meaning he has the awareness to be 
open and respond to what happens in the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Another salute comes from Billy Childs, the Los Angeles-based keyboard ace who 
has worked with Marsalis' quartet and recently took part in sessions with the 
saxophonist for the upcoming film, "The Russia House." 
</P>
<P>
"Branford's one of my favorites of our generation," he says. "He has a handle 
on all styles of saxophone from all jazz periods and its obvious that he's 
really serious about his instrument. At the same time, he doesn't have a false 
sense of himself, or get carried away with his ability. And even though he's 
egotistical, he has a sense of humility that allows him to get even better." 
</P>
<P>
His brother agrees with Childs. "He is getting better," Wynton Marsalis says. 
"It's just a matter of (his) maintaining the seriousness. But he's definitely 
dealing with the music." 
</P>
<P>
Even though jazz was all around him as a child, it didn't make much of an 
impression on young Branford Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
True, he grew up in a musical city -- New Orleans -- and in a musical family -- 
his father, Ellis Marsalis, is a fine jazz pianist and a respected educator, 
and Wynton was a prodigy who was performing with the New Orleans Symphony at 
14. But music did not intrigue him. 
</P>
<P>
"I never applied myself when I was younger," Marsalis says. "I mean, I knew 
stuff, cats would play me records, my Dad played me records, I used to copy 
solos, like those by Clifford Brown, 'cause Wynton did it, but I was never 
really diligent." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz became his heartthrob when the saxophonist heard his brother playing 
trumpet with Art Blakey's band in Boston in 1979. "I said, 'This is it. I'm 
going to play it,' " he recalls, his face brightening. "And for the next six 
months I jumped in and started practicing. I even stopped watching TV and 
buying pop records. I must have bought 200-300 jazz records during that 
period." 
</P>
<P>
It took a while for Marsalis to get where he somewhat approved of his work. 
"For many years, even when I was with Wynton's band (1982-83), I had bad 
technique," he admits. "I still have to work on it. I need to practice, like an 
hour a day consistently. That's the only way I'll get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Does he practice on the road? "Nah," he says, slowly rubbing his face as if he 
suddenly remembered how tiring the life of a traveling musician is. "If I had 
three days off, I'd go to a game or to the movies. I've seen one movie since 
June, and I love movies. I'd eventually practice but it wouldn't be at the top 
of my list," he adds, smiling mischievously."

<P>
HOW A 45-YEAR-OLD ROCK 'N' ROLLER STAYS TUNED IN TO TODAY'S VIDEO GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The impression as Neil Young strolled onto the set of his video shoot in 
Hollywood wearing tattered jeans, an old baseball cap and a ragged leather 
jacket was that here was a man who was dressing down for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who refers to himself good-naturedly as "the oldest guy on MTV," was 
collecting royalty checks for gold albums before many of today's youthful rock 
mavericks were in grade school. But he's competing with them for record sales 
and he wants to look like he fits in. Right? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Young was dressing up for the shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before, as he surveyed the site, Young's clothes were even funkier: the 
same tattered jeans, but an even older baseball cap worn unceremoniously 
backwards and a wrinkled shirt that looked as if it had been on a closet floor 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
"Got to look good for TV," Young responded later with a broad smile when a 
visitor on the set pointed out the change of clothes. "Those young bands dress 
pretty well these days." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the accompanying wink, the line sounded like yet another jab at the 
video emphasis on today's pop world. The impression that Young, 45, is aligned 
with other veteran rock artists -- and quite a few young ones -- who hate 
promotional videos was reinforced a few moments later. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a trace of a breeze in the air as Young and the three members of 
Crazy Horse, the trio with which he has done some of his finest work over the 
years, moved in place behind the microphones on a small wooden stage in the 
courtyard of the Cat &amp; Fiddle restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
However, the script called for a balmy, tropical atmosphere, so a wind machine 
was switched on as soon as Young began playing. The gusts were so strong that 
they not only blew away Young's baseball cap, but also almost knocked the 
musicians over. 
</P>
<P>
As Young struggled to maintain his balance, he started laughing even though the 
song, a tale of obsessive love called "Over and Over," was not meant to be 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
To anyone who argues that videos ruin the integrity of a song by forcing a 
single interpretation on a viewer, the laughter was a commentary by Young on 
the ridiculousness of the whole situation. 
</P>
<P>
But Young was laughing because he was having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"All that wind felt great," he said during a break in the shooting. "It kind of 
pushed us around and made us battle back, and added a spirit to the whole 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the secret of making a good video. You've got to tap some real emotions 
. . . the same way you have find real emotions when you are writing and 
recording a song." 
</P>
<P>
The strains of "Over and Over" could be heard through the windows of the 
restaurant shortly after 7 p.m. on a recent weeknight as Young ate dinner 
before the video shoot. 
</P>
<P>
The crew engineer was playing a tape of the song in the adjacent courtyard to 
test the sound system that had been brought in for what would be a marathon, 
15-hour affair. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the night was set aside for shooting "Over and Over" -- a track from 
Young's new "Ragged Glory" album -- with a second song from the album, whose 
feisty title can't be printed in a family newspaper, to be shot the following 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Young is a rarity among veteran rock stars: He considers videos a challenge and 
an opportunity, and he looks forward to working out the concepts for them. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, Young has always been a rarity among rock stars -- a restless, 
independent spirit who fearlessly follows even his most radical musical 
instincts. 
</P>
<P>
"People complain a lot about videos, but the problem isn't with videos -- it's 
with the people who make them," Young said, nibbling at a plate of shepherd's 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, they're what's happening today. I hate it when people go around 
complaining that the music business isn't like it was . . . because if it was, 
it'd be boring. I think what we did in the '60s and '70s was great, but it's 
gone and I'm glad. Let's move on." 
</P>
<P>
These are good times for Young, the Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, 
Nash &amp; Young alumnus who is rivaled only by Bob Dylan as the most 
consistently challenging of the still-active members of rock's great class of 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
With a series of erratic, impersonal albums during the '80s -- in styles as 
varied as techno-pop and rockabilly -- Young left even some of his longtime 
fans wondering if he would ever regain the artistic touch he exhibited in a 
marvelously introspective series of albums in the '70s, including the 
accessible and evocative "After the Gold Rush" and the dark and disillusioned 
"Tonight's the Night." 
</P>
<P>
But he bounced back brilliantly in 1989 with a socially conscious collection, 
"Freedom," that re-established him as one of rock's most gifted performers. 
</P>
<P>
For all its emotion and craft, however, there was one thing missing from 
"Freedom": Young's classic guitar excursions. Those resurfaced in Young's 
latest album, the equally acclaimed "Ragged Glory," which reunited the 
singer-songwriter with Crazy Horse. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason there's so much of the guitar on the new album is that I missed it 
physically," Young said. "I had a yearning to do it. But you can't do it with 
just anyone. I can only do that with Crazy Horse. I can't play like Steve Vai 
and those guys. They are all over the place. They play this metal stuff in a 
very classical manner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"My things are excursions. . . . These lumbering, sand worm type of things that 
move over a long scope. That's my thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Ragged Glory" is also different in tone. Rather than look outward as many of 
the songs in "Freedom" had done, Young looks inward in many of its key songs. 
One of the most gripping, "Days That Used to Be," is a virtual self-inventory, 
an examination of values and goals that includes these lines: 
</P>
<P>
 Are you satisfied with your new car 
</P>
<P>
 And your seven year warranty 
</P>
<P>
 Does it get you everywhere you want to go 
</P>
<P>
 Or just another 100,000 miles 
</P>
<P>
 From the days that used to be? 
</P>
<P>
 Young -- who lives on a 2,000-acre ranch near Santa Cruz with his wife Pegi 
and their two sons, nodded knowingly at the mention of the word self-inventory. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really me talking to myself in the song," he said, before leaving to 
change clothes for the video shoot. "I wrote it after MTV wouldn't play the 
video for 'This Note's for You' (in 1988). 
</P>
<P>
"I can see now why they wouldn't play it. . . . The video was making fun of a 
lot of things that MTV does. . . . Sponsorship, using music to sell products. 
But I thought the video was going to be so funny that everyone would love it. 
When MTV didn't play it, I thought, 'How could I be so wrong?' I was confused. 
Here I was this guy from the '60s in the '90s and wondering how I fit in. I was 
a lost duck." 
</P>
<P>
Young's original thought for the "This Note" video was for his band to be 
playing the song in a room with money falling from the ceiling until there was 
so much money in the room that you couldn't see the band anymore. 
</P>
<P>
But Julien Temple, the widely admired British video and film director, came up 
with an idea that Young liked better -- the one involving look-alikes of 
Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston that, ironically, was voted video of the 
year in the MTV Video Awards competition even though the channel hadn't aired 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Temple was directing tonight's shoot too, and after dinner, as Young headed 
through the Spanish-style courtyard to a trailer to prepare for the video 
shoot, the director checked last-minute camera angles. 
</P>
<P>
"Some artists have more ideas coming into a video than others," said the 
articulate Temple, whose film credits include the classic Sex Pistols movie, 
"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle," and "Absolute Beginners," a splashy musical 
about the early days of England's rock era. 
</P>
<P>
"With Neil, we tend to work together on the concept. . . . Very collaborative. 
Neil will say, 'Here is the track. Listen to it and see what your ideas are and 
then we'll talk.' In that way he is very much like David Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
"I find a lot of veteran rock artists, including Mick Jagger, enjoy playing 
with their image in videos. They have enough confidence that you can have fun 
with the images. They are willing to take risks." 
</P>
<P>
Young has frequently played characters in his videos, including a street person 
and a nerdy TV reporter at the scene of a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
For the "Over and Over" video, however, he just wanted to sing the song and 
have the action going on around him. "This is a love song and I'd rather 
someone else act it out," Young had said over dinner. "I don't want to be 
standing there with my guitar singing to some chick. That's just too lame. The 
song is too personal to do that." 
</P>
<P>
So Temple came up with a concept that combines elements of two classic films. 
As Young sings the tale of an obsessive relationship, two young lovers squabble 
in the background -- a la Stanley and Stella from "A Streetcar Named Desire" -- 
while various neighbors, including a man doing karate exercises, look on in 
"Rear Window" fashion. In the true spirit of rock 'n' roll, the neighbors yell 
at the band to be quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Temple enjoys the immediacy of videos -- the way they are done quickly, 
sometimes getting on TV within a week of shooting. But he is critical of most 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
"They are usually too concerned with fashion and creating a kind of moving 
series of still photographs or album-cover art," he said, lighting another in a 
series of almost constant cigarettes. "They worry about haircuts and fashion 
rather than deconstructing the song in the video and trying to put it back 
together in a more ambiguous way.

"I love it when you can make a video that has different meanings when you are 
in different moods. That's the trick with a video. . . . To create a kind of 
riddle, something that releases information like a cold capsule over a period 
of time. You see it again after a few weeks and you get more things or at least 
different things from it." 
</P>
<P>
By 9 p.m., Young and Crazy Horse were on stage and the wind machine was on full 
blast. As they started playing, the Stanley character in the video rode up on a 
motorcycle in the background, as Stella gazed down from a balcony. As with most 
videos and films, the scene was shot over and over. 
</P>
<P>
By 10 the following morning, there was no sign of the video equipment in the 
courtyard. Temple and the crew had moved to a second-floor room of an adjacent 
building that was being remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than the stylish, theatrical aura of "Over and Over" the idea this time 
was to portray Young and Crazy Horse in a raw, garage-band environment -- much 
like the atmosphere Young established on stage during his acclaimed 1986 tour 
with Crazy Horse. 
</P>
<P>
At that time the stage was filled with such garage-rock symbols as discarded 
tires and old license plates. This time, the props included an abandoned toilet 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
The idea in the video was to focus on the intensity of the music, and after the 
long night, everyone was hoping that things would move along quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Young, too, appeared pleased with the way "Over and Over" felt and was looking 
forward to breezing through the second video. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the music began playing, however, it was clear that something was 
wrong. Young looked around at guitarist Frank Sampedro and grimaced. 
</P>
<P>
Young stepped back from the microphone and looked past the cameras for Temple. 
"The music's not loud enough," he said, spotting the director. "Weren't there 
more speakers here last night?" 
</P>
<P>
An assistant said some of the speakers had been returned to the sound company 
because it hadn't been expected that they would all be needed for the inside 
shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've got to feel the music if it's going to look real," Young said. "We 
need more sound. We've got to feel it physically." 
</P>
<P>
So Temple told some aides to go get some more speakers immediately. 
</P>
<P>
During the break, Young again reflected on videos. "It's important that you get 
a feel of the artist in the video," he said. "That's the secret to me. It 
doesn't matter whether the singer is just singing or acting a part. . . . The 
video should have a spirit that is true to the artist and the music. You get a 
mismatch and you are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Guns N' Roses make good videos because you really feel the band. . . . You 
feel they are real people. The problem with too many videos is that there is no 
feeling in them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand these people who just turn themselves over to a video 
director and say, 'Do something with my song.' 
</P>
<P>
"You shouldn't turn your video over to someone else any more than you should 
turn your song over to someone else. You've got to protect your song, even if 
it means eventually killing the video. I've made some bad videos, but you've 
never seen them because I ended up eating them (financially)."

ESA-PEKKA SALONEN DOESN'T TAKE OVER AS MUSIC DIRECTOR OF THE L.A. PHILHARMONIC 
UNTIL 1992, BUT HIS PERIODIC VISITS ARE WHIRLWINDS OF PROFESSIONAL AND SOCIAL 
ACTIVITY GEARED TOWARD PREPARING FOR A NEW MUSICAL ERA

<P>
Esa-Pekka Salonen had barely arrived at LAX when an immigration officer asked 
him just what he was planning to do in the United States of America. 
</P>
<P>
He was here to conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Salonen replied. 
</P>
<P>
Glancing over at the small, casually dressed Finn who looks even younger than 
his 32 years, the official laughed: "You? Tell me the program." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen must have been convincing, because four nights later, he's telling the 
story to friends over a post-concert dinner at Spago. Behind him is opening 
night, an evening that began and ended with calls of "bravo" and which set the 
stage for a demanding but rewarding visit here. 
</P>
<P>
He may look undistinguished after a long international flight, but his stature 
alters significantly in front of an orchestra. After his closing performance, 
the intense, handsome young maestro takes so many curtain calls that he 
actually blushes, placing his hand over his heart. 
</P>
<P>
The attention continues backstage, where middle-aged concertgoers wanting 
autographs have to get in line behind orchestra members waiting to thank him. 
"The first time he came was in 1984, and I remember we were absolutely bowled 
over," Philharmonic principal flutist Anne Diener Giles said a while earlier. 
"The fact he's here this week and at various times over the next couple years 
helps get us comfortable with him. It sort of eases the transition." 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic's Music Director Designate is on a roll. Everybody's fussing 
over him, from critics to colleagues. But he doesn't take over officially until 
the fall of 1992, and like the bride whose wedding is two years away, Salonen 
has to maintain all that good will and momentum for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen is slightly more than a third of the way through his engagement period. 
He just finished his second round of concerts since his appointment was 
announced in August, 1989, and he won't be back on the Pavilion stage again 
until next April. He was marched around so much last fall to dinners, meetings, 
press briefings and such that he snuck back last spring to do business without 
performing. 
</P>
<P>
Each time he's here, Salonen works on programming plans, meets new people and 
checks in with Frank Gehry, the architect on the orchestra's coming Walt Disney 
Concert Hall. During his visit earlier this month, Salonen did manage to work 
in some private time with his fiancee, but once she went back to London, the 
pace intensified. He was out visiting Gehry, dining with Philharmonic 
executives and attending receptions, press conferences and meetings. He led a 
recording session at Royce Hall and dropped in on orchestra auditions. 
</P>
<P>
To get a sense of what life is like for Salonen at this stage of the game, The 
Times asked for and received unusual permission to trail the conductor through 
all that activity. And whether visiting with reporters, arts leaders or other 
people the Philharmonic management throws in his path, Salonen is remarkably 
consistent. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the constant attention and watching of his every move, Salonen 
calls it "an ambivalent situation, because if there weren't expectations and 
positive hopes, there would be no point in starting this. I'm full of hope and 
expectations. I'm also watching people very closely. It's a two-way thing. If I 
didn't believe in the potential of the orchestra and my own potential, I 
wouldn't take on something as big as this. It would be just madness." 
</P>
<P>
Although Salonen has been to Los Angeles on and off since making his American 
debut here in 1984, he has simultaneously developed a grueling international 
schedule. He has long been principal conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony 
Orchestra and principal guest conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, 
touring and recording with both orchestras. He is also principal guest 
conductor of London's Philharmonia Orchestra, and makes continuing guest 
appearances with other U.S. and foreign orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
At his first rehearsal with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in late October, an 
orchestra he hasn't conducted for nearly a year and which greets his coming 
onstage with applause, Salonen simply walks to the podium and says, "Hello 
everybody, nice to see you again." Then, amenities over, he picks up his baton 
for Debussy's "La Mer." 
</P>
<P>
His standard dress for rehearsals is a dark designer T-shirt, jeans and black 
loafers. He keeps his score open but he rarely looks at it except to turn 
pages. His jacket is draped over a chair he doesn't use, and his posture is 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
But even in rehearsal clothes, he is a conductor for the video age. Not unlike 
former Music Director Zubin Mehta or the late Leonard Bernstein, Salonen is 
physically animated. He crouches, lunges, raises his arms toreador-like, moves 
his body like a cat. "There's a feline quality to Esa-Pekka," says one 
orchestra member. "He's sensual, like a panther -- there's a softness but with 
a rippling muscle underneath." 
</P>
<P>
"La Mer" is one of the first pieces he ever conducted professionally, and he 
knows it well. But, he says later, he decided to start over this time, even 
throwing away his old score and buying a new one. 
</P>
<P>
He has the orchestra play straight through the familiar warhorse before 
stopping the musicians with comments. But that done, he takes "La Mer" apart 
almost as if it were a new piece, thanking the orchestra when it works, 
stopping, starting and stopping again when it is too loud, too slow or simply 
sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played 'La Mer' dozens of times," says violist Irving Manning, a man who 
was playing in the Los Angeles Philharmonic before Salonen was born. "It's a 
part of our repertoire. But as so often happens, certain passages are taken for 
granted. The big secret is that he allowed us to play. What each of us 
possesses was able to get out -- it was like releasing a bird from a cage." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen's technique is quite different on Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho's "Du 
Cristal," which is having its U.S. premiere here. On that piece, the orchestra 
truly is dealing with a new piece, and Salonen works first with only the string 
sections, then the rest of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he and Saariaho take the orchestra through the piece. Through much of 
the rehearsal, the 38-year-old composer has her score plopped on the edge of 
the stage and is reading along with Salonen and his musicians. Often he turns 
to ask her a question in Finnish, and both composer and conductor make 
suggestions to the musicians in English. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Salonen even asks associate conductor David Allan Miller to take 
over, then jumps off the stage to hear how it sounds in the auditorium. The 
string section is very strong, Saariaho explains later, and the conductor was 
worried that the winds would not be heard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've known each other 15 years and he knows my music well," Saariaho says. "I 
trust him as an interpreter -- he knows what I'm looking for. And because he is 
a composer himself, he can imagine what the work is about before it is played." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen barely has time to recover from his Thursday evening triumph before he 
is thrust into a press conference Friday to announce the appointment of Peter 
Sellars as Philharmonic "creative consultant." 
</P>
<P>
A small group of radio and print reporters are nibbling on snacks in the 
Pavilion's Founders Room when Salonen and Sellars arrive separately. The two 
men -- who are about the same size as well as age -- embrace in greeting, then 
head off to the corner to chat for a minute before taking on the media. 
</P>
<P>
Philharmonic executive vice president and managing director Ernest Fleischmann 
starts the press conference. Among the first things he says is that "orchestras 
are in trouble partly because they've become dull, boring and repetitive. We're 
doing something about it." 
</P>
<P>
While the Old World Fleischmann, eccentric-looking Sellars and GQ-worthy 
Salonen appear cut from very different cloth, their notions of revitalizing an 
orchestra's role in society do seem very compatible. All three of them are 
concerned about attracting new and younger concertgoers, programming new music, 
and reaching out more to the city's many ethnic communities and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
There's also been other news at the Philharmonic since Salonen's appointment. 
The orchestra was barely back from opening New York's Carnegie Hall centennial 
this September when Fleischmann announced a new Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, 
complete with recording contract. Coming up are a European tour next spring 
with Kurt Sanderling and a residency at the Salzburg Festival in 1992 with 
Salonen. 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann says later that Salonen's "coming on board provided new impetus and 
enthusiastic support to our planning." The new Bowl orchestra will give some 
breathing room to Salonen's Philharmonic, for example, while the Sellars 
appointment came about in part when the impresario saw how well the two men 
"related to one another at various meetings over the past year. . . . While I 
may have originated the ideas, Esa-Pekka has contributed to them a great deal 
and enthusiastically blessed them." 
</P>
<P>
Back to the conference, where at one point a writer points out that the 
combined ages of the "thirty something" Sellars and Salonen don't add up to 
Fleischmann's age -- 66 in December. And while the formidable Fleischmann 
laughs aloud at references to his age, he is in fact almost paternal in his 
willingness to yield Salonen center stage, at least at this point. And he is 
visibly emotional about audience and backstage reaction to the young conductor. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars and Salonen, meanwhile, say they will talk on and off in future months. 
Salonen says he's looking forward to their "continuous master-minding," and 
both say until 1992 they expect much of that to take place in London. Their 
responsibility, summarizes Sellars, is to bring to classical music a generation 
"that looks before it listens." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Salonen comes to town, Fleischmann and friends bring around a few more 
people to meet. This time there's a reception after the Friday evening concert, 
and among the guests are J. Paul Getty Trust president Harold Williams, set 
designer Robert Israel, County Museum of Art curator Stephanie Barron, 
playwright Shem Bitterman and performance artist Rachel Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
After people have been mingling awhile, Fleischmann and Salonen appear and head 
straight for the podium. A clearly jubilant Fleischmann introduces Salonen, 
then prods the shy conductor by saying, "They don't believe you speak English." 
</P>
<P>
So what does Salonen -- who speaks absolutely perfect English -- say? He 
praises his new colleague: "This is a very special day in the history of the 
orchestra as an institution because of the appointment of Peter Sellars." 
</P>
<P>
Many well-wishers come by to meet Salonen, who hangs behind the podium most of 
the evening. He politely greets each person -- from KCRW-FM general manager 
Ruth Hirschman to L.A. Theater Works producing director Susan Loewenberg -- but 
doesn't seem to relax until composers William Kraft and Roger Reynolds come by. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, formerly a timpanist with the Philharmonic, says that upon hearing of 
Salonen's appointment, Reynolds sent a cable to the conductor saying, "You 
could change the music scene in America." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Kraft: "I said I'd be happy if he could concentrate on Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen is more relaxed day by day, becoming more of a participant and less of 
an observer. At this month's final reception -- with some of the high school 
and college students who distribute Philharmonic materials on their campuses -- 
he even jokes that one advantage to working with living composers is that you 
can actually talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
"What we can't do is keep on playing our concerts exactly as we did without 
paying attention to how the world around us is changing," he says later. 
Pointing to "alarming statistics" about aging American symphony audiences here 
and elsewhere, Salonen says that bringing in new and younger audiences is among 
his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Chiat/Day/Mojo advertising company last month began pro bono work for the 
orchestra, backing up plans being developed by Fleischmann and Stephen Belth, 
the Philharmonic's new director of marketing and communications. Coming up, for 
instance, is the recently announced "Philharmonic Style" series -- three 
Saturday nights, starting in February, which will take participants from 
viewings at the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art through discounted dinners at 
neighborhood restaurants, pre-concert talks, concerts and post-concert theme 
parties in the Grand Hall with dancing to Big Band, rock or Latin music. 
Salonen will be conducting one of those three concerts, and says that in 
Stockholm, for instance, his concerts attract many young people. And the 
conductor sees nothing wrong with self-promotion if it helps attract attention 
to the orchestra. He readily uses both programming and media to convey an image 
that he calls "slightly more adventurous and less stuffy." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen frequently appears on TV in Sweden via concerts, talk shows and 
teaching series like one starting next month on Sibelius symphonies. He also 
hosts a New Year's "Gala Spectacle" on TV and acknowledges that in doing such 
things, "I've become, for the young people, the symbol of classical music. I 
don't necessarily enjoy this sort of cult thing, but so many people (felt) 
classical music was faceless." 
</P>
<P>
For his "Gala Spectacle," Salonen invites in "a gang of young artists and 
(they) do a crossover thing with contemporary classical, rock/pop and Broadway 
classics." Last year's event included composers Messiaen and Sondheim, plus 
work from Kurt Weill's Broadway period. And this year's show may add rock or 
pop, Salonen hints. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen is staying in a Westside hotel a good half-hour from the Music Center, 
and he doesn't drive. Different Philharmonic people are taking him back and 
forth, as do his hosts in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
He currently divides his time between London, Stockholm and Los Angeles. He 
considers London his home -- "that's where I pay my taxes" -- and plans to 
maintain a base there even after 1992. He also hopes to find a hideaway in 
Italy -- a "composer's cottage" in the hills of Umbria or Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Salonen has guest-conducted most of the major American orchestras. 
He once spent a couple weeks in New York "just for fun." He has yet to do that 
here, and the situation seems to be getting worse rather than better. 
</P>
<P>
"Did he tell you about when we met at Gladstone's and walked all the way to 
Malibu?" asks Philharmonic violinist Michael Nutt. "He wouldn't have the time 
now. I can't even get him over to the house for a beer and I live a mile from 
here." 
</P>
<P>
He may only be 32, but he was "discovered" at 25 -- when he replaced the ailing 
Michael Tilson Thomas to conduct Mahler's Third Symphony with London's 
Philharmonia Orchestra in 1983 -- and has been careening through the 
international celebrity circuit ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen's schedule next season, in fact, has eight months worth of rest 
programmed right into it. And sharing that "sabbatical" will be his fiancee 
Jane Price. Sometime between his arrival and departure at LAX earlier this 
month, Salonen became secretly engaged to Welsh-born Price, 31, a Philharmonia 
violinist who resembles Jane Fonda. Price will resign from the Philharmonia 
effective Dec. 1, Salonen says matter-of-factly, "because our schedules 
wouldn't have allowed us to spend any time together." 
</P>
<P>
Their main home will be here. Although his contract with the Philharmonic 
stipulates only a minimum of 16 weeks, he figures recording and planning 
responsibilities will require his being here at least five months a year. He 
has spent some time "vaguely" looking for a house, but wants to get an idea 
first of different neighborhoods. And he's planning to learn to drive. 
</P>
<P>
He's looking forward to the move, he says. "Things are possible in Los Angeles 
because of the lack of heavy tradition. I like the openness of this part of the 
world. You very seldom hear somebody define something by saying, 'This is the 
way we always do it.' Here, there is no always." 
</P>
<P>
His concerts over, Salonen simply moves his band to the Westside. With not even 
a day's rest in-between, the Philharmonic musicians haul their instruments and 
music to UCLA's Royce Hall for an afternoon recording session of Saariaho's "Du 
Cristal" for the small Finlandia label. On and off for three hours, Salonen 
takes the musicians through the piece they had just learned the week before for 
its American premiere. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor and musicians move back and forth from the Royce Hall stage to 
the recording area backstage. Onstage, Salonen has his baton in one hand, a 
telephone to the recording engineer in his other. Backstage, composer Saariaho 
sits directly behind the engineer, both asking and answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen later says he received several offers from record companies back in '84 
and '85 and looked first for freedom of repertoire. Sony Classical (then CBS) 
"was by far the most flexible and open, indeed, so I went for it." He is 
recording for Sony, has agreed to a three-year extension of his last contract, 
and plans to record more with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
He and Sony choose repertory "by mutual understanding" and his choices have 
been fairly adventuresome. One of Salonen's best-sellers is the Messiaen 
"Turangalila-Symphonie," says Sony sales representative Thomas Yotka, and 
Salonen is currently turning out a Stravinsky cycle. He just recorded last 
month two Rachmaninoff piano concertos with Yefim Bronfman and London's 
Philharmonia."I like the idea of being able (to program widely) -- little 
lullabies by Sibelius and a monstrous symphony by Messiaen," Salonen says. 
</P>
<P>
While Salonen is here, Yotka is traversing the city -- his car's back seat and 
trunk are full of recordings, photographs and posters bearing Salonen's name. 
Heading in and out of record stores with his CDs and posters, checking 
inventory and schmoozing with salesmen, Yotka figures he'll hit maybe 15 or 20 
local record shops before Salonen leaves town again. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very definitely an artist we're trying to promote," Yotka says. "The 
older artists are dying off -- Bernstein, Horowitz, Karajan all died within a 
12-month period -- and we have to invest time and money with (younger artists), 
particularly with someone as talented as Salonen." 
</P>
<P>
A programming meeting is called for the following afternoon in Fleischmann's 
office. Philharmonic general manager James Donahue, artistic administrator Ara 
Guzelimian and marketing chief Belth are in the entryway outside Fleischmann's 
inner sanctum when Salonen rushes in, late from returning phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the round conference table is set with china, real silverware and bowls 
of pasta, salad, fresh fruit and chocolate-chip cookies. Dishes are passed 
around the table and food consumed while everyone takes notes. 
</P>
<P>
This particular meeting has to do with a few programs that Salonen himself will 
conduct in February, 1992 -- they were added following Salonen's appointment 
last year -- and it is one in a series of ongoing meetings about future 
programming. The conductor has already waded through 10 years worth of 
Philharmonic programs and has some very clear ideas of what the next few years 
should look like. 
</P>
<P>
Concertgoers can expect more Haydn and Mozart but also considerably more 
contemporary music. "There isn't that much left of this millennium," says 
Salonen. "The music of this century will in nine years be the music of the last 
century." 
</P>
<P>
Such well-received visitors as principal guest conductor Simon Rattle and 
conductors Kurt Sanderling and Pierre Boulez are likely to remain on the 
Philharmonic's dance card, but encouraging local ethnic and folk ensembles is 
also "a major political and ideological goal." And expect surprises: The young 
conductor is considered so inventive at mixing old and new music that one 
European orchestra manager compares his programming to nouvelle cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Typical is the program Salonen put together earlier this month of Debussy's "La 
Mer," Ravel's "Ma Mere l'Oye," Sibelius' "En Saga" and Saariaho's "Du Cristal." 
Salonen brought together "a young Sibelius (who was also Finnish) and a young 
Kaija," he said at the student reception a few days earlier. "She's been living 
in Paris, so there is French music. I wanted to create a frame around the 
piece. I hoped the rest of the music would show why her music sounds the way it 
does." 
</P>
<P>
It is a theme he comes back to again and again. "Obviously, there has to be an 
artistic reason behind how and why you combine things," Salonen says later. 
"But I don't see this contemporary business as such a monstrous problem. It 
isn't such a big deal. If you put right things together, it will work . . . I 
don't like the idea of presenting contemporary music out of context, (like) 
this is the medicine you have to take and then you can listen to real music." 
</P>
<P>
He also plans annual theme festivals built around 20th-Century music. The first 
of these two-week festivals, in the 1992-93 season, will be structured around a 
religious theme, he says. Its centerpiece will be the previously announced 
Messiaen opera "St. Francois d' Assise" (which will be directed by Sellars), 
probably complemented by such works as Ligeti's Requiem, Debussy's "Le Martyre 
de St. Sebastien" and Stravinsky's "Symphony of Psalms." 
</P>
<P>
While Salonen says he doesn't see himself "as some sort of salesman of Finnish 
music in California," both more Sibelius and more Salonen works are in the 
cards. The Philharmonic's New Music Group has scheduled Salonen's piece "Floof" 
next spring, and, says Salonen: "I feel Los Angeles audiences have the right to 
see what kind of music I write -- to see what they bought." 
</P>
<P>
There will also be more commissions of new music, especially new American 
music, an area he readily acknowledges he still needs to study further. "It's 
clearly one of my most important responsibilities, and it's one of the things I 
feel most insecure about, because of sheer lack of knowledge. Americans know so 
much about European music, but it's shocking to realize how little we know in 
Europe about American music." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen does appear willing to do his homework, however. He leaves a long 
meeting here with Philharmonic composer-in-residence Steven Stucky with lists 
of scores or tapes to acquire, and later Stucky says he just shipped off to 
Salonen in London the tapes and scores for at least a dozen pieces. "What 
impressed me," says Stucky, "was how wide the range of things was that he was 
willing to consider further. We closed off very few stylistic avenues during 
that meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen's ideas are equally wide-ranging at the programming session. At one 
point, when a piece by Purcell seems a likely candidate for a given program, 
Salonen says he'd like to consider the Purcell piece used in Stanley Kubrick's 
film "A Clockwork Orange." He can remember the music but is blanking on the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
When nobody else at the table can recall the title either, Salonen picks up the 
phone and calls a composer-friend overseas who tells him it is "Music for the 
Funeral of Queen Mary." The conversation is entirely in Finnish and when he 
hangs up, Guzelimian jokes that Salonen's speaking Finnish gives him an 
advantage: "He could say he's sitting here with a bunch of idiots and we'd sit 
there smiling." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen won't be particularly idle until he gets back here next April. He just 
completed his tenure as guest conductor of the Oslo Symphony, saying "there 
weren't enough weeks in the year," but he is contractually obligated to 12 
weeks a year with the Swedish Radio Orchestra until June, 1993. And coming up 
this January and February is a guest stint with the Israel Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen's London-based manager Joeske van Walsum says the conductor's schedule 
has been as full as he wants it since autumn of '84. But Salonen is limiting 
his workload much more these days, adds Van Walsum: "It's not a question of 
finding work for him. We could book his diary 25 times over. Everybody wants 
him." 
</P>
<P>
The conductor, however, wants some time off. Salonen started planning his 
coming sabbatical three years ago, he says, because "I felt that by the '91-92 
season, I would have been conducting internationally for eight or nine years. I 
have been traveling a lot and giving a lot of concerts. I wanted to be able to 
stop and think about things and get a clearer idea of what has gone well, what 
has been a problem, what I screwed up . . . to look back, study and listen to 
tapes and recordings and see what weaknesses to get rid of." 
</P>
<P>
Talking about how planned his life is -- he knows where he'll be and what he'll 
be doing far into 1992 -- he says, "When I start my sabbatical, I won't plan 
anything. I'll go somewhere and stay there until I feel ready to move on. I 
have absolutely no plans." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen's visit next April was in fact carved out of his sabbatical, says 
Fleischmann, and will be his last round of concerts here until February, 1992. 
But he will be visiting on and off during the next year. And in 1992, after 
those three weeks in February, there will be a week in April and two weeks in 
July at the Hollywood Bowl before he takes the Philharmonic to Salzburg for a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Coming up soon is a concert version of "Cosi fan Tutte" in Stockholm, but 
stardom changed his plans there, too. Rather than "expose" himself in a major 
opera house, he says, he'd originally hoped to do the Mozart opera "privately." 
Then, he smiles, he learned the production would be broadcast live to 22 
countries, "so I will have a couple-million witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen's smile disappears: "A problem of early international success is that 
you can't hide anything. No corner is remote enough. Somebody finds you 
musically. So I feel more pressure than five or six years ago, and I find no 
way to cope with it other than to work harder."

<P>
If you were Steven Soderbergh, what would you do? 
</P>
<P>
Your first movie, "sex, lies, and videotape," becomes a massive commercial and 
critical hit after coming from nowhere to win two major prizes at the Cannes 
Film Festival of 1989. You bring the movie in for a paltry $1.2 million; it 
goes on to recoup its costs several times over. You are just 26 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Now two of America's best-known filmmakers, Robert Redford and Sydney Pollack, 
are knocking at your door. They want to produce your all-important next film 
from stories you have personally selected. These are commercial projects that 
will justify big budgets; a major studio, Universal, has already promised to 
distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
So you murmur your gratitude for the nice things being said about you, take the 
money, the office on the lot with the parking space, buy a little place in the 
hills and go to work in the sunshine. Right? 
</P>
<P>
That's what you do. But you're not Steven Soderbergh. 
</P>
<P>
Cut instead to a dark, bone-chilling night on a Prague side street called 
Misenska, where Soderbergh is braving the elements to make a modestly priced 
film, in black and white, about the imagined life of a gloomy, paranoid Czech 
novelist. And he is doing it at a fraction of the director's fee he can now 
command. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's try it again," says Soderbergh, in a comical fur hat with ear flaps, his 
nose bright red from the cold. He is unhappy about a sinister but comic scene 
in which Kafka (Jeremy Irons) is dragged down the street by two bowler-hatted 
assistants from his insurance office. Irons nods curtly and resumes his mark. 
Crew members sigh resignedly, blow on their hands and silently pray for a swift 
return to their warm hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Though Franz Kafka was a real person, the film is by no means a "biopic." 
Instead, writer Lem Dobbs has fashioned a thriller about a cover-up by 
officials in a totalitarian state of the murder of Kafka's friend and colleague 
Eduard. A knowledge of Kafka's work is not essential to enjoying the film -- 
though Dobbs' script has incidents that almost playfully speculate how Kafka 
may have been inspired to write novels such as "The Castle" and "The Trial." 
</P>
<P>
Soderbergh describes the film as "a challenging entertainment." It's certainly 
quite a statement of intent, and one that has raised many eyebrows in Hollywood 
-- where much interest and speculation has centered on which way Soderbergh 
would jump after "sex, lies, and videotape." 
</P>
<P>
Here is the answer. Pollack and Redford and Universal Pictures have been 
politely but firmly placed on hold, while Soderbergh comes to Prague to make 
"Kafka" for another distinguished admirer -- Barry Levinson, whose Baltimore 
Pictures is producing it. He is shooting the film for just under $12 million. 
It all suggests remarkable self-confidence on the young director's part. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, there is a break from shooting "Kafka" in a Prague city 
center office building used during World War II by the Gestapo. Soderbergh, 
whose close-cropped hair, beard and big, round glasses make him resemble an 
earnest divinity student, sits himself down on a rough wooden crate and 
concedes he is an object of attention on this, his second movie. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't feel too much pressure about that," he says. "In many ways it's to 
my advantage that initially there will be some interest in this film. The only 
pressure I feel is: Will the film be any good?" 
</P>
<P>
The smart money says it will, because "sex, lies, and videotape," which won the 
Palme d'Or and the international critics prize at Cannes, was such an assured 
piece of work. It dealt with the relationships between two men and two women, 
ranging from the adulterous to the duplicitous, and it made a major detour past 
the voyeuristic. Clear-eyed, sharply observed and filled with low-key humor, it 
unexpectedly struck a chord with audiences and critics alike. 
</P>
<P>
Its very title entered the vernacular and was adapted for a hundred headlines. 
The Soderbergh story became legend; a movie fanatic from Baton Rouge, La., he 
started shooting his own Super 8 films as a teen-ager. His relationships with 
women, he says now, were stormy and prone to deception. "sex, lies, and 
videotape" was written on an eight-day road trip between home and Hollywood. 
Now he describes the screenplay as "an act of contrition" for his scheming and 
double-dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are hyperbolic praise and instant celebrity bestowed as readily as at 
Cannes. But by the time "sex, lies, and videotape" burst on the world almost 
two years ago, Soderbergh's life had become sufficiently grounded for him to 
handle the distractions of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd grown up," he says in his faint Southern drawl. "If it had happened three 
years sooner, I'd have gotten really screwed up. There were a lot of people 
coming at me, wanting to give me things I wanted. You have to be very cautious 
and deliberate in your responses." 
</P>
<P>
Within a year of his Cannes triumph, Soderbergh had quietly married actress 
Betsy Brantley, who co-stars in Robert Redford's upcoming "Havana." "That's a 
perfect example of growing up," he says. "Everything's great, we don't fight, 
and she's enabled me to focus even more on work because there's a level of 
security there that I never had personally." 
</P>
<P>
Betsy is on the set in Prague, contentedly pregnant, knitting clothes for the 
baby, who will be born around Valentine's Day. (Tests show it is a girl, and 
the Soderberghs have already chosen a name, Sarah). Between takes, Betsy shows 
around photos of the 40-acre farm the couple have recently bought in rural 
Virginia. "This," she says, teasingly, "is Steven's editing room." It looks 
like a small garden shed. 
</P>
<P>
It's also another statement of intent; Soderbergh clearly means to keep 
Hollywood at arm's length and make movies the way he wants. "I just don't find 
Los Angeles a comfortable place to live," he says, defensively. 
</P>
<P>
But he also admits to tremendous relief that "Kafka," like "sex, lies, and 
videotape" before it, is being made through independent financing and only 
after completion will be shown to major movie studios that might want to 
distribute it. It's one way of keeping meddling studio executives away from the 
set. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain way I like to work," he says. "It goes -- this is the 
script, this is the budget, this is the schedule. Assuming these things stay as 
they are, I want to be left alone to make the movie." 
</P>
<P>
For all this, Soderbergh does not come across as a spoiled brat. Says "Kafka" 
producer Stuart Cornfeld: "When I first met him, I was struck by what he 
wasn't. He was not arrogant or self-centered, not full of himself or 
antagonistic. But he did love movies." 
</P>
<P>
Another Soderbergh fan is Jeremy Irons. "I saw 'sex, lies, and videotape' in 
New York with my wife and liked it tremendously," he recalls. "I came out of 
the cinema feeling spoken to. I said to my wife -- I must work with that man." 
</P>
<P>
Soderbergh was about to start on "The Last Ship" for Sydney Pollack at 
Universal -- a story set aboard a destroyer in the aftermath of a nuclear 
holocaust. "Then I decided to switch," he recalls. "I was unhappy about my 
first draft, and it wasn't a matter of doing four more drafts to get it right. 
I needed to come back to it from a totally different angle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was also getting very anxious to make another film. It had been 18 months 
since I'd finished 'sex, lies,' and I didn't want to get rusty. The 'Kafka' 
script was in shape, and I felt the movie would work. 'The Last Ship' was not a 
movie to go into with doubts. So I asked Universal if I could switch. They said 
sure. They were very nice about it." 
</P>
<P>
(After "The Last Ship," Soderbergh will film a coming-of-age story called "King 
of the Hill" for Redford.) 
</P>
<P>
The span between his films is likely to remain long, because Soderbergh edits 
them himself. "There's not much time to be prepping another film during 
post-production," he muses. "But I'm going to continue to edit myself. It's the 
best part, the most fun. I'd hate to turn it over to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
He felt no pressure about the success of "sex, lies, and videotape." It was 
disorienting because it was so unexpected, but I just tried to cultivate a 
healthy disbelief about what was happening. Just as in this case, it seemed 
like everybody I came in contact with seemed to like it, I'm sure there'll come 
a time when the opposite is true. At that point, I'll have to not take that 
seriously either." 
</P>
<P>
As for working hand-in-hand with a studio, Soderbergh foresees few problems. "I 
know a lot of people at Universal, and our dealings there have been more than 
trouble-free," he says. "It's not an easy thing for a studio to say yes to 
somebody who's supposed to be making a film for them, then decides to go off 
and do something else. Someone who says -- well, I'll be back later when I'm 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a responsible filmmaker. I'm as aware as anyone coming out of a guerrilla 
filmmaking background of the balance between the movie, the money and the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The director thinks luck plays its part in a film's success, and he recalls the 
casting problems in "sex, lies, and videotape": Andie McDowell's audition, he 
said, unexpectedly "blew me out of my seat." He added: "Laura San Giacomo was 
someone who had done no movies. Another actor who was cast dropped out, so I 
got Peter Gallagher. Jimmy (Spader) got hold of the script by accident and 
liked it. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been a totally different movie. It's a crap shoot. You just do 
what you can to increase the odds in your favor." 
</P>
<P>
To this end, Soderbergh has surrounded himself here with a clique of crew 
members who know him from Baton Rouge and worked on "sex, lies, and videotape." 
They include sound editor Paul Ledford, sound effects men Larry Blake and Mark 
Mangini and electrician David Jensen, who also has a small acting role. Walt 
Lloyd, cinematographer on "sex, lies," and Cliff Martinez, who composed its 
score, have also rejoined Soderbergh. 
</P>
<P>
So do he and these guys share common attitudes? "We've certainly all managed to 
get into this business with strong ideas of quality, integrity and working 
responsibly," he says. "For me, it's having five or six people around who'll 
give it to you straight when you need it given you straight." 
</P>
<P>
If "Kafka" seems at first glance to be a questionable commercial project, 
Soderbergh has certainly assembled a fine cast. Apart from Irons, the players 
include Sir Alec Guinness, Ian Holm, Joel Grey and Armin Mueller-Stahl. The 
female lead was to be played by French actress Anne Parillaud, currently 
enjoying a hit in Europe with Luc Besson's "Nikita," but she withdrew after 
shooting one scene, citing difficulties with English. Theresa Russell was 
quickly drafted to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
Happily for Soderbergh, his leading man is currently on a hot streak. Irons has 
received rave reviews for his work in "Reversal of Fortune," in which he plays 
socialite Claus von Bulow, who was accused (and acquitted) of murdering his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"This does seem to be a good time," agrees Irons, in the warmth of his trailer, 
pausing from his English newspaper crossword. "But careers go in waves. I 
always wait to see what comes out of it. I have no idea what I'm doing next." 
</P>
<P>
He admits to eccentric reasons for choosing his roles: "Filming for an actor is 
quite a boring occupation. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy it or I don't think 
I'm lucky. But there's a lot of hanging around. So I try to pick films which 
involve me a lot, or which won't be that easy to do." 
</P>
<P>
Irons never read Kafka as a young man, "which is when I think he speaks to you. 
I regret it greatly. I'm not very well read. I always had the notion that if I 
was reading, there was always something better I should be doing. Now that I 
have read Kafka, he doesn't excite me greatly. I want him to get on with 
things, open the windows of his mind." 
</P>
<P>
They don't seem much of a fun couple, Irons and Soderbergh; the sensitive, 
refined Englishman and the owlish, scholarly looking American director. Yet 
Irons says: "We laugh a lot together. That's important to me, because the 
person an actor is closest to is the director. And if you're together for 10 
weeks, it has to be someone who excites and amuses you." 
</P>
<P>
Especially in a location like Prague, one would think. The city's baroque 
beauty makes it an intriguing place to spend time, and its winding cobbled side 
streets make it a perfect place to film a story set in 1919. Then there is the 
factor that shooting here is probably twice as cheap as in America or Western 
Europe. "And the great thing about working with a central bureaucracy," says 
Stuart Cornfeld, a little tongue-in-cheek, "is total cooperation. They promise 
a location's available -- and they deliver." 
</P>
<P>
But production sometimes is slowed because of translation problems between the 
Czech crew members and the people who supervise them, mainly British. Then 
there is the morale of the Czechs -- which is decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant director/translator Miroslav Lux explains that as a part of Premier 
Vaclav Havel's "velvet revolution," Czechoslovakia's state-run studio Barrandov 
is about to change fundamentally. Its state subsidy has been slashed by 75% to 
about $600,000 next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The new director, Vaclav Marhoul, is going to give notice to maybe 90% of the 
studio's staff, including the people on this film," says Lux. "Until now they 
were on a permanent regular payroll. Now they will have to go free-lance. It 
goes hand-in-hand with a tendency of increasing efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
The decision has clearly caused gloom on the "Kafka" set, though Lux says: 
"Many people are looking forward to the new deal, especially those with 
confidence in their abilities." 
</P>
<P>
Barrandov has had a decidedly checkered past. In World War II, it was used as a 
center for making Nazi propaganda films. Renowned filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl 
had an office there; Goebbels ran the entire operation from afar. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the studio produced several classic Czech films, including Milos 
Forman's "Loves of a Blonde" and "The Firemen's Ball," and Jiri Menzel's 
"Closely Observed Trains." But after the Soviets overthrew the Dubcek 
government in 1968, Barrandov was used for making films deemed acceptable to 
the Communist regime. "It was a painful process," recalls Lux. "There had to be 
a lot of official approval of scripts." 
</P>
<P>
Now Czechoslovakia is welcoming joint ventures with the West, and its film 
industry is no exception. Prague may be at an economic crossroads, but its 
sense of itself as an artistic capital is undeniable. Enormous excitement 
surrounds an Andy Warhol retrospective at a major Prague museum; a sense of 
free expression and liberation is strong. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the cafes and bars seems to be an artist, poet or writer. The scene 
being shot on Misenska street drew a crowd not only because of the filming but 
because of a man who, with his daughter, was peering from a upstairs window; he 
turned out to be a member of a popular Czech rock group called the Precedents. 
</P>
<P>
One supporting actor in "Kafka" was Ion Caramitru, who served for five months 
as vice president in Romania after the Ceaucescu regime fell. 
</P>
<P>
Can a genuinely popular movie be fashioned from these unlikely beginnings? 
Stuart Cornfeld thinks so, citing Soderbergh's presence as the key element. 
"Steven has a definite vision of what he wants the film to be," he says, "and 
he's very good at communicating it." 
</P>
<P>
Soderbergh says "Kafka" is entertainment. "Nothing is inaccessible about it. 
It's not some highbrow exercise." 
</P>
<P>
He agrees it may be hard to market, but adds: "I feel that if a film is good, 
you can find a way to sell it. Or you don't need to sell it so aggressively. 
Maybe I'm naive. But 'sex, lies, and videotape' wasn't high-concept, either. 
</P>
<P>
"People said it was amazing I got to make 'sex, lies," and kept control of it. 
But I thought, well, here's this movie about four white, attractive young 
people that was somewhat drenched in sexuality, even though it was 
non-explicit. It would seem to me not a huge gamble to spend just over a 
million dollars on it." 
</P>
<P>
But on "Kafka," he is reminded, his budget is 10 times more. On his next two 
films, budgets will be even higher. 
</P>
<P>
Soderbergh frowns, adjusting his glasses. "Yeah," he says finally, "but the 
problems are just the same. You walk on the set, bring the actors on, the 
scene's working or it's not, and you decide where to put the camera. And the 
days go by."

DANA PARSONS: PICKLER PONDERS: SHOULD ANAHEIM CUT LOSSES ON ARENA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of his movies, Woody Allen's character is reproached by a friend for 
being an atheist. "No," Allen says. "To you, I'm an atheist. To God, I'm the 
loyal opposition." 
</P>
<P>
In a society where rassling and roller derby can draw crowds, trying to stop 
the sports bandwagon is tantamount to heresy. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Irv Pickler is that kind of a heretic, the lone Anaheim 
councilman who hasn't gotten religion over the proposed sports arena the city 
wants to build. 
</P>
<P>
But to Pickler, utterly convinced about the rightness of his position, he's 
merely the loyal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a real strong sense that I'm 100% right," Pickler, 69, said over a cup 
of coffee Friday, dressed in de rigueur Southern California retirement garb of 
slacks and a funny T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Pickler, a councilman for 8 1/2 years, was on the arena bandwagon early on but 
has since bolted. The city has broken ground on a $100-million arena in hopes 
of luring a professional hockey or basketball team, or both. Santa Ana is 
planning a similar-size arena but also has no commitment for a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter said he's certain that Anaheim is going to get the 
pro franchises, but he hasn't named any names so far. 
</P>
<P>
Pickler said Hunter is basically full of hot air. 
</P>
<P>
"If this thing were signed, sealed and delivered, I'd be behind it 100%," he 
said. "But we have no control over whether we get an NBA team or a hockey team. 
And hockey isn't even a Southern California sport." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim clearly has the bug. In several other "on-the-move" cities around 
the country, such things as sports arenas and big-time convention centers are 
on the standard laundry list of necessities to make the cities appear to be 
major league. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose, for example, persuaded voters in 1988 to approve building an indoor 
arena -- without the promise of landing a pro sports franchise. The city since 
has been scheduled to get a National Hockey League expansion team in the next 
couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Anaheim and Santa Ana. Hunter has included the arena in his vision of an 
increasingly dominant Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Pickler has become increasingly concerned that civic pride, not to mention ego, 
may goeth before the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Anaheim already has the prestige," Pickler said. "We have the Rams, we 
have the Angels, we have Disneyland, we have the Convention Center. When we 
built Anaheim Stadium, we knew we had the Angels. When we enhanced it to take 
football, we knew we had the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a gambler. I go to Vegas quite often, I don't mind throwing my money 
around, and for $10 million this was worth it to me, but when you get up to the 
figures we're talking about. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Although no one can say for sure, Pickler is afraid that the city could be left 
holding a very large bag if it doesn't get a franchise or if the management 
group that plans to run the arena or its financial backers run into problems. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Pickler is predicting such dire events. It's just that he isn't 
sure what the future holds, and that's why he doesn't like the smell of this 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a fast track, and I don't think we need to be," he said. "If it 
costs $60 million to get a franchise and you're an owner and you have a choice 
of Anaheim, or, say, Sacramento or San Jose or San Diego, are you just going to 
walk in or are you going to say, 'Make me a good deal.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Raiders," he said, referring to how owner Al Davis pitted 
several potential cities against each other in a competition to get that 
National Football League team. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's entirely possible that Pickler is just being a 
stick-in-the-mud. Not visionary enough to get with the program. 
</P>
<P>
"From John Q. Public, I don't get that remark," he said. "I've gotten the 
remark, 'Why are we doing this?' " 
</P>
<P>
As a guy who has been to Vegas plenty of times, Pickler said he'd take a walk 
right now, even if it means the city would forfeit the several million dollars 
it has already gambled on the arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you take your losses and come back and fight another day," he said. 
"It's just like a war -- you know when you're going to lose, you back away and 
regroup and come back later." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for us spectators, there will be a resolution to all this. History 
will eventually reveal who was right. Will it be the grand visionaries of 
municipal machismo who wanted to catapult Anaheim into a totally different 
league, or will it be the guy whose lone cries of "Not so fast!" were drowned 
out by the roar of the crowd?

SANTA ANA FREEWAY WIDENING BEDEVILS NEARBY HOMEOWNERS WITH CLOUDS OF DUST, 
NOISE; 'THERE IS NO WAY TO KEEP ANYTHING CLEAN,' ONE SAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Armed with a garden hose, Renate Foote was tackling what has become almost a 
daily ritual. But instead of aiming the spray at some shrubs or flowers, Foote 
was giving her mobile home a bath. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. Any workday of the week, the tidy little home is engulfed by clouds 
of dust stirred up by bulldozers and other earth-moving equipment busily 
carving up the terrain a few dozen feet from Foote's front door to widen the 
car-clogged Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at this dust! It's terrible!" Foote hollered over the roar of the 
freeway one recent afternoon. "You wash your car today and it's dirty tomorrow. 
The roofs, the house, it all gets covered." 
</P>
<P>
It is a decidedly Southern California dilemma. While any seasoned commuter 
welcomes the long-overdue effort to widen Interstate 5 up the spine of Orange 
County, residents along the traffic-choked corridor are left to deal with the 
inconveniences of living side by side with a giant construction project. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been hell, constant hell," said Leonard Coleman, a Marine Corps 
sergeant who shares a Tustin apartment overlooking the widening project with 
his wife, Michele, and two young children. "There is no way to keep anything 
clean. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the California Transportation Department, which is overseeing 
the $180-million widening project, sympathize with the plight of such residents 
and say they're trying hard to ease the impact, doing everything from adjusting 
the hours of work crews to ensuring that more water trucks are on hand to keep 
down the dust. 
</P>
<P>
But some hardships are unavoidable. They are the price of progress as Orange 
County tries to renovate a 1950s-era freeway that had been hopelessly 
overburdened with traffic for decades, Caltrans officials maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not the Autopias at Disneyland," said Albert Miranda, an Orange 
County spokesman for Caltrans. "This is the real world. We cannot shut down the 
system and rebuild it overnight. We have to do it while we try to keep people 
moving in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the mess promises to get worse before it gets better. The effort 
to widen the Santa Ana Freeway between the Costa Mesa Freeway and the El Toro 
Y, which is formed by the confluence of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways, 
is merely the first flush of construction work along the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Early next year, work begins in earnest north of the Costa Mesa Freeway, 
pushing into crowded neighborhoods in Santa Ana and affecting vastly more homes 
than it has during the current phase to the south. During the coming decade, 
bridges will be torn down and the road will be widened to 12 lanes from its 
existing six as far north as the Riverside Freeway. Officials hope to 
eventually widen the freeway all the way to the San Gabriel River Freeway in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
With all that work looming, Caltrans officials say they plan to redouble their 
efforts to assuage the concerns of residents up and down the busy route, which 
is traversed by about 225,000 vehicles a day, 25% more than it is designed to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has already unveiled a special AM radio station that broadcasts 
updated traffic reports along I-5, introduced a special free towing service for 
stranded motorists, littered the neighborhoods straddling the corridor with 
information updates and provided a telephone hot line (768-4CAL) for residents' 
complaints, Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can try to accommodate the needs of residents as best we can," he said. "We 
can try to expedite work that creates problems. We can water down dusty areas. 
But then you have to draw the line. This work is going to go on for several 
more years and people have to be tolerant." 
</P>
<P>
But some homeowners say their tolerance can stretch only so far. In the Irvine 
neighborhood of Northwood, residents have flooded City Hall with complaints 
about freeway ramps being shut down without warning, nearby roads being reduced 
to a single lane and other construction-related troubles that have snarled 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"With the off-ramps, it's a case of sometimes they're open, sometimes they're 
closed," said Jerry Gaston, a computer programmer who lives near the freeway in 
Irvine. "All you can do is figure the best way around. It's pretty bad. I'm 
eager to see it finished." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine homeowners also have complained about the throbbing, late-night noise of 
pile-driving equipment. During the summer, the pile driving was handled between 
11 p.m. and 5 a.m. to avoid busy times on the freeway, according to Irvine City 
Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But after the city complained to Caltrans, the noisy work was halted promptly 
at 1 a.m. and shifted more to weekend nights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to have to be patient," Brady said. "All this construction 
work is not going to go away for some time." 
</P>
<P>
While many of the homes lining the freeway in Irvine are shielded from the 
project by thick block walls, residents along stretches of highway in Tustin 
haven't been nearly as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck and Diane Patterson once had a respectable view of a row of mobile homes 
across the street. Two years ago the units were uprooted. Then the state took 
down the block wall that helped buffer the noise. Now the couple have a nice 
view of 5 p.m. traffic jams and banana-colored tractors the size of their home. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't at all bad before," Diane Patterson said. "We live on the freeway 
now." 
</P>
<P>
"There were trees and roses over there before," her husband mused, pointing 
across the street to where a wide gash has replaced the row of mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're good sports," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses, of course, have also been affected by the snarled traffic, and 
nearby Tustin High School has been hit by a spat of problems stemming from the 
construction work. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the school lost 75 of its 300 parking spaces in the student lot. 
Work crews also broke water mains a couple of times, turning the dust into 
gooey mud that teachers named Lake Lantz after the school's maintenance 
manager, Assistant Principal Brad Lantz. 
</P>
<P>
Just up the road at the Orange Garden Apartments, a 160-unit complex 
overlooking the construction work, the managers were forced recently to 
relocate one family to another apartment because the daughter was troubled by 
allergies apparently caused by dust kicked up during construction. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Coleman and her family have stuck it out in their apartment with a 
front-row view, but she sometimes wonders why. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't open up the windows anymore," said Coleman, hugging her 4-month-old 
daughter, Kalin, as she gazed at the gravelly path hugging the apartment 
complex. "If you open your balcony door, which is your only real source of air, 
your furniture is ruined. You can't dust enough." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman also complained that she has had to wait upwards of a half hour to get 
out of the complex while some earth-moving equipment finished grading the dusty 
road that is the only access to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents griped about getting 5 a.m. wake-up calls, courtesy of 
construction crews unloading heavy equipment. At that hour, the ding-ding-ding 
of a tractor's back-up bell can drive even the most stoic person batty, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
While some residents along the route have dumped their homes on the real estate 
market in an effort to escape the cacophony of problems caused by the 
construction work, most feel such forays would probably prove futile. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people who would like to sell, but who can sell in this 
mess," Foote groused. "My daughter, she doesn't want to come in here anymore, 
her car gets so dirty. . . . We've been in this mess since May. I'm beginning 
to think it will never end."

COUNCIL MAVERICK BECOMES A TEAM LEADER; 
</P>
<P>
CITY GOVERNMENT: ROBERT A. CURTIS WAS ONCE A LONE DISSENTER AND FOE OF MISSION 
VIEJO CO. AS A POTENTIAL MAYOR, HE'S TALKING CHANGE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The biggest victor in the recent Mission Viejo City Council elections was not 
even on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only a few months ago, Councilman Robert A. Curtis was battling for 
his political life when he faced a recall effort backed by nearly $500,000 in 
contributions from the Mission Viejo Co. and other real estate interests. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis survived the February recall effort -- it was defeated by more than a 
2-to-1 margin -- and two of his supporters, Sharon Cody and Robert Breton, went 
on to capture seats on the council. On Monday, when the new council takes 
office, Curtis will likely be elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
For Curtis, who has become accustomed to being on the losing end of council 
votes, the turnaround is equivalent to moving from court jester to king. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a triumphant transition," Curtis said in an interview last week. "It's 
going to be much nicer to be known as the Honorable Bob Curtis than the 
recallable Bob Curtis." 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of a Curtis majority has raised numerous questions about the 
direction of the new council and the future of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Curtis has indicated that he will ask the new council to reconsider 
and possibly reverse several major decisions taken by the previous council. He 
also has made it known that it will "not be business as usual" for the Mission 
Viejo Co., which planned and built the community of 75,000. The events have 
left political observers wondering whether Curtis will use his position to make 
life difficult for the company, which openly used its personnel and money to 
try to oust him from the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Mission Viejo is very much like a sumo wrestling match," said 
political consultant Harvey Englander of Newport Beach. "The two giant 
wrestlers -- Mission Viejo Co. and Curtis -- are circling and waiting for each 
other to make the first move." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Curtis and his supporters owe part of their most recent success to 
the company. Not only was Curtis' anti-recall victory a stinging rejection of 
the company's role in the campaign, but it also bolstered his political 
standing and created a grass-roots political organization that was credited 
with the election of Cody and Breton. 
</P>
<P>
After the recall effort was defeated, Curtis' supporters targeted three council 
members -- Christian W. Keena, Victoria C. Jaffe and Norman P. Murray -- in 
November. Keena and Jaffe did not file for reelection. Murray, the city's first 
mayor and considered Mission Viejo's elder statesman, finished eighth in a 
field of 14 candidates. The other new council member is Susan Withrow, who 
Curtis said has promised "to work together for the benefit of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Cody, who led Curtis' counter-petition drive during the recall campaign, said 
the anti-recall organization helped generate the victories. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those same people who came forward to help against recall also helped 
us campaign and walk precincts during the election," Cody said. "The 
anti-recall sentiment sort of spilled over and continued on. The people feel 
that the developer should not take control of our government and they want 
someone who would be a tough negotiator with the company." 
</P>
<P>
While many people are aware of the constant scuffles between Curtis and the 
company, few know about their recent rapprochement. Mere weeks after Curtis' 
anti-recall victory, both parties sought to mend fences when they met to 
discuss development on Naciente Ridge, a planned development of 700 houses on 
the city's eastern boundary. 
</P>
<P>
After several sessions, the company agreed to reduce future citywide density by 
26% and donate 7.2 acres of land along Crown Valley Parkway -- valued at $5.5 
million -- for a city hall. In return, Curtis pledged his individual support on 
the council for the Naciente Ridge development. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission Viejo Co. is delighted that Bob Curtis' leadership is making it 
possible to return to the spirit of cooperation and mutual support that has 
been the history of our community relations," company President Jim Gilleran 
said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
Added company spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel: "The recall is over, and we hope we are 
going to work together." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the council rejected the city hall deal, but Curtis said he 
plans to ask the new council to amend the developer's agreement to accept "this 
better growth-management approach which brings public benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis' critics charge that he has made an about-face in his dealings with the 
company. "As far as I am concerned, he's in bed with them," said Helen Monroe, 
who, as leader as the pro-recall Coalition to Recall Councilman Curtis, 
accepted nearly $300,000 in contributions from the company. "He wants us to 
accept their piece of ground. He and they are good buddies." 
</P>
<P>
While Curtis declares that "the era of company rule is over," he is equally 
quick to point out that the new council is constrained because its predecessors 
forfeited the city's right to challenge the validity of the developer's 
agreement signed between the county and the company. The agreement was signed 
13 days before Mission Viejo became a city and, among other things, included 
provisions on housing density and parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticisms by Monroe and others, Curtis said: "This is the time 
for the city to disregard petty politics of personality and concentrate on 
reducing residential density and obtaining other public benefits. . . . For 
first time, the City Council will be equal partners in meaningful negotiations, 
instead of being yes-men. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot harbor false expectations that this council is going to bring 
changes overnight," he continued. "We have forfeited our right to sue. If we 
want to change anything, we have to be tough negotiators." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from asking the new council to amend the developer's agreement, Curtis 
and the new council are expected to deal with the question of a permanent site 
for a city hall. The city now rents office space on La Alameda for $400,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, the city purchased a building on Chrisanta Drive for $3.1 
million and is planning to spend $1 million more in renovations. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot undo the purchase," said Curtis, who voted against the deal, "but I 
hope the new council will take a serious look for both interim and permanent 
facilities. With the company's offer of free land, we have an opportunity to 
build from the ground up to suit our own needs." 
</P>
<P>
The city hall building is not the only decision of the previous council facing 
reversal. Curtis said the new council may ask the city attorney whether it can 
cancel a multimillion-dollar residential waste-hauling contract awarded without 
a competitive bid. 
</P>
<P>
For many citizens, Curtis' most pressing challenge is whether he can return a 
sense of order and dignity to the council. The dogfights on the previous 
council sometimes became comical, with council members badgering one another 
during public sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis' potential opposition in the council was former Mayor William S. 
Craycraft, who supported the anti-recall campaign but broke with Curtis shortly 
after, apparently over their ambitions to run for a future state Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said he and Craycraft met Friday at a Mission Viejo restaurant and 
agreed to bury the hatchet. At that meeting, Curtis said he agreed to support 
Craycraft's offer to represent the council on the Foothill/Eastern Corridor 
Transportation Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill wants to be a team player," Curtis said. "Having served on the short end 
of a divided council for three years, I have pledged to protect minority views 
and ensure that every member of the council has an opportunity to shape public 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea what's going to happen in 1992," he continued, referring to 
reapportionment. "If we all pull together and start achieving meaningful 
benefits for the city and people of Mission Viejo, we will have ample credit to 
go around. The rancor and scorn are things of the past. This is a new era."

HOME INVASION SHOTS STILL REVERBERATING; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: NEIGHBORS OF A MAN WHO FIRED ON THANKSGIVING INTRUDERS FEAR RETALIATION. 
ONE OF THE THREE WOUNDED TEEN SUSPECTS HAS DIED.

<P>
Two days after a retired police sergeant opened fire on armed intruders inside 
his home, a burglar alarm salesman Saturday was peddling his wares on North 
Hanover Street. 
</P>
<P>
Probably nowhere else in Orange County could the salesman have found a more 
receptive group of potential buyers. There, on Thanksgiving night, their 
neighbor, Earl Swoap, used his 12-gauge shotgun to shoot down three of four 
intruders who allegedly had broken into his home. Nearby residents said 
Saturday they fear the quiet neighborhood might be the target of a violent 
retaliatory action in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear stays with you," said one neighborhood woman who declined to be 
identified. "I'm glad he (Swoap) did what he did. I think it's a smart idea to 
get a gun. I don't want to give my name because I'm afraid they'll come back." 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed against Swoap, but Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael 
R. Capizzi said Saturday that his office will review the incident to determine 
whether the 53-year-old man acted properly when he fired on the intruders, 
killing a 16-year-old boy and wounding two others. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who was not identified by authorities, was pronounced brain-dead 
Friday; he later was removed from life-support systems and died that night. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said the case "would be treated like any other incident." 
</P>
<P>
"It's routine when there has been a shooting for a review of the legal 
implications of the shooting," the district attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The wild events of Thursday night began when the Hughes Aircraft security 
guard, who retired from the Yakima, Wash., police force 13 years ago, was 
startled by a loud crash in his home. He told police that he grabbed his 
shotgun and found four intruders inside his home, three of them armed. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of events still under investigation, police said Swoap blasted away 
at the intruders as they attempted to escape out the back door. Police said he 
chased the intruders outside and fired again as they attempted to escape in a 
car parked in the man's driveway. The shotgun blasts blew out the car's rear 
windows and two of its tires. 
</P>
<P>
The two wounded suspects, a 17-year-old Garden Grove boy and 19-year-old 
Phouxay Vanhnarathof Costa Mesa, were in critical but stable condition at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange, police said. The two have been arrested on suspicion 
of attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth suspect, Sayavong Nanthavongdouangsy, 18, of Anaheim, was not injured. 
The names of the juveniles were withheld because of their ages. 
Nanthavongdouangsy, also arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery, was being 
held at the Anaheim Temporary Detention Facility. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police declined further comment on the case Saturday, saying only that 
it was still under investigation. Police are trying to determine whether the 
incident was one in a number of so-called home invasions in Orange County 
involving teen-agers recruited by Asian gangs. 
</P>
<P>
At Swoap's home Saturday, a relative who would not identify herself said 
neighbors have been offering support for the man's action. The woman said Swoap 
had not been at home for some time but was staying at an undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes me feel bad is that others seem to feel sorry for the ones who held 
them up," the woman neighbor said. "It's a shame for their parents, but we all 
wonder why they picked his house. I'm afraid they might come back by and shoot 
at the house like they do in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, Adela Castenada said she had been afraid to return to her home 
shortly after the incident and now will lock the iron gate that shields her 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
"We just moved here one year ago," Castenada said. Her family was returning 
home and had just turned the corner to North Hanover Street after celebrating 
Thanksgiving out when they saw the police lights and the wounded suspects lying 
on the ground, covered with blood, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible," she said. "I hope it never happens again." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview Friday, Nanthavongdouangsy's father, Donechanh 
Nanthavongdouangsy, claimed that his son was not involved with the break-in and 
was falsely arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Through an interpreter, the Laotian immigrant said his son was at home about 10 
p.m. when he got a phone call from Vanhnarath, who reportedly told young 
Nanthavongdouangsy that he was wounded and needed a ride to the hospital. The 
shooting took place about 9:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police have declined to comment on the father's claim.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: THE FRENZY OF CHRISTMASES PAST MAY BE GONE, BUT THE 
HOLIDAY SPIRIT REMAINS.

<P>
It was the first two days of the Christmas shopping season. There were the 
sights (Santa Clauses), sounds (holiday music) and smells (freshly made popcorn 
and pastries) that kick off this shop-till-you-drop retail season. 
</P>
<P>
Parking lots were near-to-bulging, and customers, armed with credit cards, 
checkbooks and gift lists, were numerous. 
</P>
<P>
But, to many shoppers and retailers, the post-Thanksgiving Day mall mania last 
week lacked its most telling characteristic: frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
As one salesman put it: Shoppers "are just not as gung-ho as last year. They're 
really tight. They shop a lot more and buy less. There's more window shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Ingerson of Rolling Hills Estates is one shopper who says she is avoiding 
a "buy, buy, buy" mind-set. She purchased bedsheets Friday morning at the Del 
Amo Fashion Center, but was planning to make other Christmas gifts from 
materials she bought at an arts and crafts store earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the time to be a little more practical," she said, adding that fears of a 
recession have curbed her impulse buying. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Mattera, a Hemet resident who was visiting her two daughters in San Pedro, 
said she noticed a lot of empty-handed people Friday at Del Amo. She said fears 
of a recession might work to her advantage closer to Christmas, if panicked 
retailers slash prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a $500 comforter for $150," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Danscuk of Redondo Beach was at Del Amo on Friday to get her two 
children's picture taken with Santa and maybe to buy a few gifts. Her son 
Nicolas, 2, and daughter, Karissa 10 months, were given paper reindeer antlers 
to wear on their heads after sitting with St. Nick. Over at The Galleria at 
South Bay on Saturday, Judith Byard of Los Angeles said she plans to buy gifts 
this year that are less expensive but just as meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Byard said she and her family spent a fortune buying gifts for 
relatives and friends. Now, she said, "I don't seem to be making as much, or 
the gifts are higher." As for the impact of a possible recession on shoppers: 
"I think the spirit of giving is still there and people will still buy, but not 
as much." 
</P>
<P>
But sales haven't been meager for all retailers. Liz Ochoa, a clothing store 
saleswoman at the Galleria, said sales have been as good so far this year as 
they were last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same to me," she said. "There are buyers this year; they don't just 
come to look around." 
</P>
<P>
Shopper Darlinn Lucas, however, said her family has gone back to a "secret 
pals" system, in which everyone picks a single name from a hat to buy a gift 
for. Such an exchange is less expensive than buying presents for everyone, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Crosby of Gardena, who has seven children and 16 grandchildren, said his 
holiday shopping was finished four or five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, grandparents have this ability, and most younger people will wait 
almost till the day," of Christmas, he said. Crosby, tending to a stroller, 
said he was at the mall Saturday to accompany his daughter and baby-sit as she 
shopped. ANTHONY MILLICAN

A religious dance will be performed by students as part of a Mass marking the 
Feast of Christ the King at 8 p.m. tonight in Sacred Heart Chapel at Loyola 
Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
The public is invited to the free event, which is sponsored by the Visiting 
Artists and Lecturers Series of the College of Communication and Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The dance was choreographed by John West, a graduate of the university and 
founder of the Valyermo Dancers, who express faith, prayer and ritual through 
dance. The troupe is named after the Antelope Valley community of Valyermo that 
is the home of St. Andrew's Priory. 
</P>
<P>
Students who will dance at the Mass are Danielle Hooper, Beth Howard, Lori 
Mira, Joy McClelland, Jennifer McDowell, Erica Schneider and Bridget Amato.

PARAGON CABLE TO TAPE FAMILY MESSAGES FOR U.S. TROOPS; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: THE COMPANY PLANS TO SEND VIDEO GREETINGS TO THOSE SERVING IN 
SAUDI ARABIA IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. THE FIRST TAPING IS THURSDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bothered by the thought of U.S. soldiers in the Persian Gulf having to spend 
the holidays away from home, Paragon Cable community television manager John 
Webber decided it was time to do something to show support. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this week, Paragon Cable will start videotaping messages from family 
members and friends who have loved ones overseas. Though final authorization 
has yet to be given by officials with Armed Forces Radio and Television Service 
network, the intent is to broadcast the videos to troops in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We see so much of the troops on television -- different guys saying hello to 
their wives, children, mothers and fathers," Webber, 28, said. "I thought it 
would be nice if we could return some of that, to send a little bit of home out 
to the desert." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Paragon Cable, which serves about 60,000 subscribers in Torrance, 
Hawthorne, Lawndale, Gardena and El Segundo, will hold a day of taping 
sessions, Webber said. Depending on the response, an additional session may be 
scheduled for Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Paragon officials will help families figure out what they want to say and will 
provide a videotaped copy of their message if they want one, Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
Paragon will edit the messages together and send them to the Armed Forces' 
television network, the Department of Defense agency that provides U.S. 
television programming to 1 million military personnel and their families 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Marotta, television programming manager of the network, said he will 
review the tapes for "quality control" and tastefulness before deciding whether 
to send them to military programming officials in Saudi Arabia, who will 
ultimately decide whether to use them. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen groups nationwide have expressed an interest in sending 
messages to the troops overseas, Marotta said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gotten a lot of calls from cable companies, video clubs and local 
television stations, all wanting to do something to let the guys and gals in 
Operation Desert Shield know they're thinking about them," Marotta said. 
</P>
<P>
But although many groups have made inquiries about it, few have supplied him 
with any tapes, he said. He said he couldn't guarantee that the messages will 
be shown, but said it would be more likely if they are well-produced. 
</P>
<P>
The shorter the messages are, the more likely they would be aired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its regular broadcasts of ballgames and news programs, the Armed 
Forces network sends taped material, including movies and children's programs, 
around the world to its outlets, where local program schedules are put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
During the World Series in October, more than 100 messages were broadcast 
during commercial breaks, and several National Football League players have 
recorded 10-second greetings to the troops that are shown before and after 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
The cast and crew of the television show "Knot's Landing" did a one-hour video 
postcard that included behind-the-scenes interviews with the stars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But because of a delay in getting permits from the Saudi Arabian government to 
put up a satellite link, only about one-fifth of the military personnel in the 
Persian Gulf are getting the Armed Forces' television broadcasts, Marotta said. 
Most of the Navy ships are receiving the signal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it is unlikely that a soldier would see his own family's message, 
Webber said: "Maybe someone else's son is going to see it. And during 
Christmas, that's going to help."

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the command of the drum major's whistle, the bowed heads of Spring Valley's 
Mount Miguel High School marching units snapped up, and hand-held fans flew 
open to spell the school's mascot name -- Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to the strains of "British Eighth," the baton-twirling soloist, the 
mascots with matador capes, the flag corps and band members clad in black and 
red marched Saturday past the 12 judges, hoping to retain the band sweepstakes 
award won last year at the annual California Band Review in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, bands and marching units from 17 state high schools filed by the 
reviewing stand at the 19th annual competition sponsored by the Santa Ana Winds 
Youth Band. In addition to the marching contest held around the Civic Center, a 
separate field show of halftime performances featured 10 of the 17 competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The field show sweepstakes trophy went to Foothill High of Santa Ana, the only 
Orange County school to win a top award. 
</P>
<P>
Crooked lines, sour notes and dropped batons were taboo in the first stage of 
judging for each of the units, such as percussion squads, I.D. units (marchers 
with signs spelling out the schools' names), rifle teams, drill teams, twirlers 
and drum majors. 
</P>
<P>
Each unit offered sharp salutes as it passed the reviewing stand. The Los Banos 
I.D. unit danced as it performed a routine with letters spelling the school 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Montebello drill team performed shoulder-high kicks as they 
marched down the street. Montebello went on to win the drill team sweepstakes 
award; the school's entire marching ensemble captured the directors' award for 
overall showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better, it's a lot better," Mount Miguel junior cymbalist Jennifer Horn 
said after the first round of judging, comparing this year's performance to 
last year's. 
</P>
<P>
But Mount Miguel would not keep the championship trophy, which was awarded this 
year to Riverside's Rubidoux High. The latter's precision and performance of 
"March of the Mitten Men" was solid enough to win the top rating. 
</P>
<P>
Then the military marches gave way to showmanship on the field, where some 
schools abandoned traditional school colors to add pizazz. The Claremont High 
dance team, for example, changed from their gray-maroon-and-white marching 
uniforms to white-and-turquoise costumes for the field show based on the 
musical, "Starlight Express." 
</P>
<P>
Claremont band director Gary Iida and drill team director Michele Allen said 
the contest helps them learn the latest trends in halftime shows, including the 
increased use of stationary backdrops, colored flags and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's real exciting, but of course it puts a lot of pressure on groups to 
start raising more money to try to keep up with the Joneses, so to speak," 
Allen said.

THREE SOUTH BAY GOLFERS SCORE HOLES IN ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three South Bay golfers recorded holes in one recently at Harbor Park Golf 
Course in Wilmington. Lindy Comstock of Torrance used a wedge on the 140-yard 
sixth hole to record his first ace. Dick Jones of Rancho Palos Verdes also 
chose a wedge on the 110-yard eighth hole. Richard Grelle of Carson went with 
an eight-iron on the eighth hole and it, too, went the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Two American Youth Soccer Organization teams from the South Bay won Central 
Southern California Section I championships in Redlands Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
They were The Green Machine, a girls' Division 2 team from Rancho Palos Verdes, 
and The Young Guns, a boys' Division 2 team from San Pedro. Both were composed 
of youths 14-15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Machine, coached by Tom Nagle and Mary Corrough, included Tami 
Perrault, Amy Ezell, Jennifer Meehan, Claudia Molter, Kim Roman, Julie Brown, 
Brandy Nagle, Kelly Olsen, Shana Wallace, Shannon Corrough, Kristie 
MacAllister, Wendy Johnson, Kerry Murray, Jamie Nagle and Coleen Thibodo. Their 
record was 16-0, according to Area Director Nick Lincir. Their championship was 
the first title won by a team from Region 10. 
</P>
<P>
Playing for the Young Guns were Sean Jose Perez, David Suarez, Richard Cooper, 
Thomas Martinovich, Anthony Crovello, Kevin Spangler, Stacy Martin, Daniel 
Kordich, Kevin Bryant, Chris Barley, Robbie Bryant, Cesar Salazar, Bob Elliott 
and David Barley. The team, which finished with a record of 14-1-1, was coached 
by Gabriel Perez, Robert Elliott and Ante Martinovich. The team mother was 
Patricia Spangler. It was the second title in eight years for Region 6. The 
titles are the highest awards possible in AYSO inter-region play.

ON THE PREP PATH: FORGET THE B MOVIES AND CHECK OUT THE GRADE A FOOTBALL

<P>
Mater Dei stunned Eisenhower. Tustin trounced Pacifica. Valencia outwitted La 
Quinta . . . 
</P>
<P>
Still, you say that you spent Friday night watching a herd of giant, 
carnivorous rabbits attack Arizona? ("Night of the Lepus," 1972 horror flick 
starring Janet Leigh, cable). 
</P>
<P>
For shame. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section football playoffs are entering their third week, Orange 
County, and 11 local teams remain. Semifinals start Friday, so get thee to a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Need reasons? Here are 10: 
</P>
<P>
1. Running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has some exciting ones: Mission Viejo's Marcellus Chrishon, Mater 
Dei's Derek Sparks, Rancho Alamitos' Ulysses Trammell and Tustin's Visko Ancich 
and Ron Goods. 
</P>
<P>
Goods, a cartoon junkie, is speedier than a revved-up Roger Rabbit. Friday, he 
outraced defenders to touchdown runs of 93 and 45 yards, the first score 
stunning even his teammates. Ancich, at 5-9, 180, slam-dances his way through 
defensive lines like an elephant with an attitude. 
</P>
<P>
2. Quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's Rob (Son of Bob, Brother of Bret) Johnson is the name in a big-name 
football family. 
</P>
<P>
When he's hot, he's fun to watch. And when he's not? Well, just watch 
father-coach Bob the next time Rob throws an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Also note Capistrano Valley's Tony Solliday and Mission Viejo's Tim Snowden -- 
they combine with Johnson to make the South Coast League the best quarterbacked 
league in the section. 
</P>
<P>
3. Perfect records. 
</P>
<P>
As in Esperanza (12-0), Santa Margarita (12-0), Tustin (12-0) and Whittier 
Christian (11-0). They didn't get that way by playing Magnolia every week, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
4. Cross-training. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's Garrick Emry, Jarod Smith, Mark Parlin and Mike Burns are among 
many Aztec players who compete on the county's top boys' track and field team, 
which has won the past two section 3-A titles. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this significant? The Aztecs' next opponent, Hart, employs a 
no-huddle, run-and-shoot offense that should test their fitness level. 
</P>
<P>
5. Redemption. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro will play top-seeded Paramount on Saturday. Last year, El Toro lost to 
Paramount in the final. Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
6. Coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, they come in all varieties, but Tustin's Marijon Ancich is 
one of a kind and one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich, who works as a longshoreman in Long Beach during the off-season, is 
sort of a cross between Rodney Dangerfield -- listen for the way he says, 
"Oooooh, oooh!" when he's really impressed by a player -- and Fred Flintstone. 
No offense, coach. 
</P>
<P>
7. Unlikely buddy-buddies. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo. The once-bitter rivals will meet Friday in 
a Division II semifinal as . . . friends? 
</P>
<P>
Capo Valley receiver David Poltl says it's true. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it's weird, but in the last few weeks, we got to be friends," Poltl 
said. "Tim Snowden, he's a cool guy. He's cocky, and he knows it, but that's 
OK. And (linebacker) Beau LeBreton and all those guys are so cool . . . we're 
starting to do stuff together, and after the game, we're planning on going out 
together, no matter who wins." 
</P>
<P>
8. Snickers. 
</P>
<P>
Not the candy bar. El Modena Coach Bill Backstrom, whose team was knocked out 
of the playoffs by Hart last Friday, says it's his favorite thing to do once 
his season comes to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what most old coaches do -- go to the games, watch everyone else on the 
hot seat and snicker about it," Backstrom said. "During the day, you think of 
all the good things that happened during the year, then at night, you can't 
sleep because you remember everything you did wrong. But mostly, you snicker." 
</P>
<P>
9. Santa (Margarita) Claus 
</P>
<P>
Christmas seems to be coming quickly for Santa Margarita, which plays Baldwin 
Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The undefeated Eagles, in only their third year of operation, have started to 
become what every other school in Orange County hoped they would not become: a 
powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Come out and watch the birth of a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
10. Finally, why not? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were awful. The Rams are done for. And Cal State Fullerton football 
is a national punch line. Good high school football might be what you're 
looking for, Orange County.

<P>
Gish Biomedical Inc. of Santa Ana was something of a Wall Street wall flower 
until early this year, when company executives were deluged with calls from 
curious securities analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The courting came fast and furious in response to several small events that put 
the company in the limelight: Craig-Hallum Inc., a securities brokerage in 
Minneapolis, published a glowing recommendation of Gish in January, and 
Business Week put Gish on its list of small "hot growth" companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is, we were discovered," said Jeanne M. Miller, Gish's vice 
president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock responded by soaring from $7.38 a share in January to 
$16.13 on June 13, just before splitting three-for-two. The stock closed Friday 
at $11, up $0.87 1/2 in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gish is a small, 14-year-old, well-managed company that has prevailed in a 
tough industry -- disposable surgical cardiovascular products -- against much 
larger competitors by paying close attention to its customers' demands. 
</P>
<P>
And Gish has the fundamental attributes that Wall Street likes: steady growth, 
good cash flow and low debt. In the last five years, Gish's revenue has grown 
steadily from $7.2 million to $18.3 million; net income has gone from $1,000 to 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
In its first quarter of fiscal 1991 ended Sept. 30, sales were $5 million, up 
29% from the previous year's $3.9 million, while net income for the quarter was 
$435,000, up from $246,738 for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone is sold on Gish. Jeff Kilpatrick, an analyst with Newport 
Securities, a Costa Mesa brokerage firm, said the company has done a good job 
of exploiting its market niche. But he said the company's potential is limited 
by heavy competition and the nonproprietary nature of its technology. 
</P>
<P>
"To say it is among the top growth companies in the United States may be 
something of an overstatement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the accolades keep coming. Last month, Forbes listed Gish as one of the 
"200 best small companies in America." The magazine said the company's 
five-year average return on equity was 12.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the company's strong balance sheet has made it more attractive to 
investors and stock analysts who have been burned by their fascination with 
highly leveraged high-technology businesses over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
A major driving force behind Gish's growth -- adding pizazz to its image among 
investors -- is its role in combatting the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gish's key products are designed to recover blood that otherwise would 
be lost by patients during and after open-heart surgery -- a function that has 
gained importance as a way to reduce viral infection from AIDS and hepatitis 
that is contracted from donor blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
Gish, located in a 44,000-square-foot building in Santa Ana, makes the tubing, 
filters and other parts of a system that suctions blood from a patient's chest 
cavity, cleans it and then puts oxygen in it before returning it to the body. 
</P>
<P>
The company tailors such "packs" of blood-handling equipment to the design 
specifications of individual heart surgery teams. The packs are then labeled 
any way that is requested by the medical technician in charge of a patient's 
blood supply during surgery. One fan of Ohio State football, for instance, has 
his pack labeled "Buckeye." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gish has introduced a number of new heart surgery products and has 
been diversifying into other surgical areas -- including the labor and delivery 
and emergency rooms -- to ensure continued growth of sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
Gish, which has 260 employees, has increased its market share despite 
competition from much larger and better financed players, such as Bentley 
Laboratories, a division of Baxter Corp., Shiley Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer 
Corp., and Sarns Inc., a subsidiary of 3-M. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that Gish works hard to respond to the demands of the surgeons 
who are its principal customers, said Dr. Bradley Harlan, chief of 
cardio-thoracic surgery at Sutter Memorial Hospital in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan said that during the 1970s, when he had an idea for a device for cooling 
the heart during surgery -- thus reducing the risk of heart damage -- he took 
it to Gish. Some of Gish's larger competitors, he said, either wanted him to 
sign over too many of his rights or were not interested, he said. But he was 
able to strike a deal with Gish. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the company made an important modification in the heart 
cooler that simplified it and increased its marketability. The product has been 
one of Gish's major sellers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (Gish) are very responsive to changing needs," Harlan said. "So 
when an individual such as I comes to them and expresses an idea for a new 
product, they listen." 
</P>
<P>
It is generally agreed that the person most responsible for Gish's success is 
Jack Brown, the company's 50-year-old president and chief executive. Larry 
Selwitz, health-care analyst at Cruttendon &amp; Co., a Newport Beach 
securities firm, said Brown is "a good guy who put together a good organization 
that is highly regarded by distributors and by its clients." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Henos, vice president and a principal of the Newport Beach office of 3I 
Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests heavily in the medical industry, 
likened Brown to a "pit bull" for his tenacity in building Gish despite 
difficult odds. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is praised for having worked hard to develop personal relationships 
within the medical community. One result: About half of Gish's new products are 
suggested by surgeons, who receive royalties for their contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also is credited with rescuing Gish from early financial disaster. The 
company was founded in 1976 by Paul Gics (pronounced Gish), an entrepreneur who 
manufactured high quality products, Brown said, but underpriced them and spent 
extravagantly on corporate operations. 
</P>
<P>
When Brown arrived as vice president of marketing in January, 1980, Gish was 
ending a year in which it lost $1.5 million on $1 million in sales. It also had 
accumulated about $500,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the company's board of directors, Gics resigned and Brown 
took on the job of chief executive with a mission to put the enterprise back on 
its feet. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who joined Gish after being Bentley's director of marketing and new 
product development, responded by raising prices and slashing overhead. He cut 
the staff to 28 from 55 and moved to less spacious quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of survival," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that when he took command of the company, he had to reassure 
customers that, contrary to what competitors said, Gish was not going bankrupt. 
"I did a lot of handholding and talked to all our customers personally," he 
said. "We didn't have many. So that wasn't difficult." 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1982, Gish made its first public offering of stock and bonds to raise 
cash to satisfy numerous creditors who were demanding immediate payment. 
</P>
<P>
The investment wasn't exactly attractive, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"In polite legalese, the prospectus said this is a junk bond gamble," he said. 
"Do not buy the stock unless you have money to lose." Nonetheless, the offering 
raised $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The new funds also fueled Gish's efforts to develop a broader product line. 
Starting with one product -- plastic tubing to support a blood oxygenation 
system during open heart surgery -- Gish has expanded its line to 30 different 
medical products, each of which is offered in a variety of models. 
</P>
<P>
Among the company's product successes was the development of a cylinder-shaped 
"reservoir" to hold and filter blood shed by patients recuperating from open 
heart surgery so the blood can be recycled back to their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Gish noticed that hospitals were increasingly concerned about spreading AIDS 
and other diseases through blood transfusions. So the company adapted a blood 
reservoir that had been routinely used during surgery so it also could be used 
in recovery rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In moves to diversify into non-cardiology areas, Gish also has developed 
long-term implantable catheters used for intravenous feeding and chemotherapy 
and a different kind of catheter device for detecting and alleviating a 
high-risk condition during labor in which the umbilical cord may become 
squeezed shut, blocking off the infant's blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the company's moves have been winners. Brown confesses that after he 
got Gish into the ophthalmic or eye laser business in 1985, he made a series of 
management mistakes that stunted the operation's growth. 
</P>
<P>
The experience taught him that a company such as Gish that is organized to sell 
disposable medical products does not have the expertise to market large pieces 
of capital equipment such as lasers. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say one of Gish's weaknesses is that its success depends too much 
on Brown's experience, making it vulnerable if he were to leave. In response, 
Brown said that in the last two years he has been trying to increase the 
company's management depth. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown admits that he has his fingerprints on every part of Gish and 
performs functions that would be shunned by most chief executives. "I've done 
everything from plumbing to (repairing) the roof," he said. He recalled that 
one Saturday several years ago when a hospital in Los Angeles ran out of heart 
surgery packs needed for emergencies, he delivered some personally. "That is 
customer service and with a company this size, that's what it takes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But being small also has the advantage of enabling Gish to respond more quickly 
to changes in customer demands than larger competitors, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Gish's greatest challenge is to continue to develop new specialized 
surgical products at a brisk pace. Another goal, he said, is to expand the 
company's market share in Southern California where it is particularly soft. 
</P>
<P>
Brown noted that Gish faces especially intense competition in its back yard 
because Orange County is also home for several other major cardiovascular 
companies, such as Bentley and Shiley. 
</P>
<P>
Steven F. Crowley, the securities analyst who "discovered" Gish and wrote last 
January's report for Craig-Hallum, said Gish still has a lot of growth in its 
cards. He is not advising investors to buy Gish's stock at its current price, 
but believes the company is a good long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
"The tone of the news continues to be very good," Crowley said. "We continue to 
follow it (Gish) very closely because we see the operating momentum continuing 
and a better product mix developing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AT THE HEART OF GISH BIOMEDICAL'S SUCCESS 
</P>
<P>
Although much smaller than its competitors, Gish has been successful as a maker 
of disposable cardiovascular products by tailor-making its equipment to the 
specifications of individual heart-surgery teams. The system shown below is 
used during open-heart surgery to circulate and provide fresh oxygen to the 
blood while the heart itself is stopped. Of the components shown, only the 
oxygenator is not made by Gish. 
</P>
<P>
Heart-Lung Bypass Circuit 
</P>
<P>
During open-heart surgery, the patient's body temperature is lowered and the 
heart itself stops beating. Circulation is maintained by pumping blood through 
special tubing to a device that mixes in oxygen. The blood is then filtered and 
returned to the body. 
</P>
<P>
Blood Recovery Reservoir 
</P>
<P>
A reservoir made by Gish collects blood that leaks into the patient's chest 
cavity during surgery. Recovering blood that was once lost helps to reduce the 
need for transfusions and the likelihood of infection from tainted blood. 
</P>
<P>
Oxygenator 
</P>
<P>
The oxygenator replaces the function of the lungs during surgery, mixing oxygen 
and venous blood in preparation for its return to the patient. 
</P>
<P>
Arterial Filter 
</P>
<P>
The filter removes tiny air bubbles and any undesirable particles that may be 
present in the blood before it is returned to the patient. 
</P>
<P>
Cooling Solution 
</P>
<P>
A special reservoir is used to chill a solution that is injected directly into 
the heart to lower its temperature. Cooling the heart reduces its need for 
oxygen and helps to prevent damage to the heart muscle while the heart is 
stopped during surgery.

THE MYSTERY OF SAN MARINO'S EERIE MANSION COMES TO LIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ESTATE: MANY DETAILS ABOUT THE HOME AND LIFE OF HELEN MORGENTHALER REMAIN 
HIDDEN. BUT THE STRUCTURE CLEARLY WAS A MIX OF THE WILDLY ECCENTRIC AND THE 
SURPRISINGLY ORDINARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orville Houg followed a flashlight beam through the daytime darkness of the 
boarded-up San Marino mansion that for decades has fascinated schoolchildren, 
baffled adults and irritated officials in this affluent enclave. 
</P>
<P>
The mysterious structure has now been unmasked, its Mediterranean-style, 
pastel-stucco front discovered to be an exaggerated facade masking a crumbling, 
two-story stucco and wood-frame house with a leaky tar-paper roof and a shaky 
river-rock foundation. A small wood-frame structure, not much bigger than a 
shack, is melded onto the rear of the house. 
</P>
<P>
A local real estate agent, Houg was doing what many people in this small town 
confess they have always wanted to do: He was taking a peek around the estate 
of Helen Morgenthaler, a reclusive eccentric whose father made a comfortable 
living in the wall-covering business. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Helen Morgenthaler's recent death, local and county officials, 
citing property maintenance statutes, had begun cutting away jungle-thick brush 
and trees that covered the nearly two-acre site and blocked all but the front 
view of the home. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Public Guardian agency, which had been handling Morgenthaler's 
affairs since January, put the 3,000-square-foot house on the market in August. 
And with her death Oct. 29 at the age of 88, Morgenthaler and her home have 
become the talk of the town. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a fabulous, big mansion like everybody else," said real 
estate agent Kim Atkinson-Melin, who is handling the property's sale with Houg. 
</P>
<P>
She was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
On his recent tour, Houg turned the flashlight on an intricately carved wooden 
fireplace mantel. "This is the only thing that has value . . . and it's 
downhill from there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The structure now standing on the property apparently came together in a 
piecemeal fashion, with some parts dating from just before the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
According to the skimpy historical material available, the original structure 
was a house on stilts that was later replaced by the stucco house. It is not 
clear how, when or why the facade front came to be. 
</P>
<P>
Morgenthaler apparently told one friend that her mother cruised the streets of 
San Marino and Beverly Hills looking for housing ideas and then added the 
facade while her father was out of town. But some local historians have cast 
doubt on that theory. 
</P>
<P>
At one time the two-story home was said to be quite nice, but it never matched 
the majesty of its front. 
</P>
<P>
Now this tear-down house on a 400-by-200-foot lot has become one of the hottest 
properties in the Western San Gabriel Valley. The lot is large enough to allow 
for construction of three to five houses selling for up to $1.5 million each, 
Houg said. 
</P>
<P>
The asking price is $4 million, but a new -- perhaps lower -- figure will 
likely be set. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a housing downturn, Houg and Atkinson-Melin said, they have been 
astonished by the number of calls they have received on the property. "I've had 
well over 180 inquiries since August," Houg said. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents, probate attorneys, developers and heirs are sorting out the 
intricacies of the estate in the 1700 block of West Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the woman who lived there -- behind electrified barbed-wire fences, 
alone, except for her snapping guard dogs -- remains an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong San Gabriel Valley resident who was married briefly but had no 
children, Morgenthaler grew up in the house with her sister and parents. 
</P>
<P>
Morgenthaler's own words, in a rambling oral history filed at the San Marino 
Public Library, reveal a few odd details of her life. She said her 
great-grandfather was an Austrian prince and a grandfather "owned the first 
large building in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
She described her father as "king to the decorator trade" who "only got the 
very finest things in the house," such as the hand-painted French furniture and 
"the most beautiful cut glass chandeliers you ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
In its prime, she said, the grounds surrounding her house had a grove of 50 
orange trees, Concord grapevines, blackberries, "persimmons that made the best 
persimmon pudding" and "Chelsea plums that were out of this world." 
</P>
<P>
But the once-fine gardens became chaotic, and officials of San Marino 
repeatedly asked her to trim back the growth. 
</P>
<P>
In recent times, Morgenthaler lived in retirement homes. Through a court order, 
officials with the county's Public Guardian, part of the Department of Mental 
Health, took over her affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Citing privacy laws, Christopher Fierro, deputy director of the department, 
said he could only say that his office enters a case "when someone is 
substantially unable to manage financial affairs or is subject to undue 
influence or fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Through a county intermediary, her heirs -- a niece in Florida and one in 
Virginia -- declined a request for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
But through friends and acquaintances a picture -- albeit a fuzzy one -- 
emerges. 
</P>
<P>
"She was quite a mysterious lady . . . a crusty lady," said Sydney Baxter, 
administrator of Casa La Villa, a Pasadena retirement home where Morgenthaler 
lived. "I probably knew her better than anyone here, but I don't have much 
light to shed." 
</P>
<P>
"She knew people thought of her as (eccentric)," added Thomas W. Sullivan, a 
Pasadena real estate agent who lived four blocks from Morgenthaler and, out of 
curiosity, visited her from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
She told him that she patented a process of dying grasses used in wallpaper, 
that she was married briefly, and that as a child she played with the children 
of railroad and real estate giant Henry Huntington. Her home's front door 
archway -- carved to resemble a cascading grapevine -- came from a movie set, 
she told him. 
</P>
<P>
"She admitted she wasn't very friendly with her neighbors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, as Houg and Atkinson-Melin walked the parched grounds filled 
with the stumps of fruit trees, Atkinson-Melin said: "It's going to be sad when 
the house goes, because San Marino has been talking about it for 50 years."

CITY HALL SEISMIC STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $44,000 contract with a structural engineering firm for further seismic 
studies of City Hall was approved last week by city directors. 
</P>
<P>
An initial $14,000 study by the firm, Dames and Moore, found that most of the 
1927 building is made of reinforced concrete and steel and wood framing that 
would stand up well under an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But the eastern ends of office wings facing the courtyard have unreinforced 
masonry walls, and the dome tower and some decoration on the building may not 
withstand temblors, the firm found.

HIKING TRAIL TO BE REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hiking trail that has been closed since World War II will be restored and 
reopened with a $50,000 state environmental grant funded by fees on 
personalized license plates. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the Ben Overturff Trail project has just begun, said Daniel Iwata, 
manager of the city's Community Services Department, and many details are still 
being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for volunteer workers to restore the trail on the city's northern 
edge, along Sawpit Canyon Wash near Monrovia Canyon Park and the border of 
Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Owens, a member of a city committee overseeing the grant, said the 
restoration is important because "we'll be opening up a trail alongside a 
riparian area that has been closed for virtually 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
No date for the reopening has been set.

FIRE SPRINKLER STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has agreed to meet soon with business owners and the Chamber 
of Commerce to study a proposal for tougher city fire sprinkler standards. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, places of public assembly, such as restaurants and theaters, must be 
outfitted with sprinklers if they are 5,000 square feet or larger. Other 
businesses must install sprinklers if they are 10,000 square feet in size. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Mark Foote recommended Tuesday that sprinklers be required for 
buildings half as big -- 2,500 square feet for places of public assembly and 
5,000 square feet for other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Foote stopped short of urging that sprinklers be required for homes and 
apartments, saying smoke detectors and non-combustible roofs do an adequate job 
of preventing fires there.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: HOW TO HANDLE THE PROSPECT OF BEING LAID OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In these harder economic times, more people are facing what may be their worst 
job-related nightmare: getting laid off. 
</P>
<P>
If that's a possibility for you -- or you're already a pink-slip victim -- be 
sure you know what's available in the way of outplacement help, severance pay, 
employee benefits and other help. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips to help soften the financial blow of a job loss: 
</P>
<P>
* Bolster your employability. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still working but fear you could be dumped, act now to boost your 
chances of getting hired elsewhere. Call friends and colleagues about 
opportunities. Expand your network. Attend conferences and seminars. Update 
your resume. 
</P>
<P>
Also, perform well in your current job. "If I do the best job, someone's going 
to give me a good recommendation," suggests Fred Sher, a partner at Hewitt 
Associates, an employee benefits consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
* Use your employer's job services. 
</P>
<P>
Many employers will help laid-off workers find jobs. Some provide job 
information and counseling. A growing number of companies offer outplacement 
help, either in-house or through an outside agency. Some employers might even 
allow you to use office space and phones to find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
* Review health plan options. 
</P>
<P>
Companies, generally, are required to allow departing employees -- whether laid 
off or leaving voluntarily -- to continue health coverage for 18 months, 
provided employees pay for it themselves. Coverage must be offered at the 
company's actual per-person cost, plus 2%. 
</P>
<P>
This can be extremely valuable. You may not get another job right away, and 
when you do, your new employer's health plan may carry a pre-existing condition 
clause that prevents you from getting coverage for certain health problems 
until a waiting period has passed. Keeping your former employer's plan also is 
usually cheaper than buying a plan on your own. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you may not need to continue your employer's plan if you are 
included under your spouse's health plan. 
</P>
<P>
But some employers will offer to continue subsidizing your life and health 
benefits for as long as you receive severance pay, Sher says. 
</P>
<P>
* Find out about severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
Under the typical severance package, you'll get one week of pay for each year 
of service, Sher says. In some cases, you may get a minimum of one month's pay, 
regardless of service. 
</P>
<P>
Higher-level employees often get more -- as much as a month of pay for each 
year of service -- up to a maximum of six months or a year of pay, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Most employers require laid-off workers to take severance pay in regular 
intervals, as with a paycheck. But some may offer the option to take it in a 
lump-sum, Sher says. You might be better off with this option, if you have the 
discipline to invest the money right away, instead of spending it all, or if 
you are worried about your former employer's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you accept a lump-sum payment, the company may no longer 
subsidize your health plan and you might have to foot the bill yourself, Sher 
says. 
</P>
<P>
* Apply for unemployment compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Many laid-off employees are too proud. But if you are laid off, you are 
entitled to benefits. Bear in mind that payments can vary, and won't start 
until after your severance payments end. 
</P>
<P>
* Protect your nest egg. 
</P>
<P>
Most companies will distribute to departing employees their vested funds in 
401(k) company-savings plans. Unless you absolutely need the money, roll it 
over into your individual retirement account within 60 days. That way you will 
avoid income tax on the untaxed amount, plus a 10% penalty tax if you are 
younger than 59 1/2. You also will continue to accumulate earnings on a 
tax-deferred basis. 
</P>
<P>
And if you use a self-directed IRA, you'll have many options for investing your 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, if you find a new job within 60 days, you might be able to roll 
over your money into the 401(k) of your new employer. 
</P>
<P>
You also might be able to keep your 401(k) with your old employer. As long as 
your balance is greater than $3,500, employers must give you the option to 
maintain your 410(k) there indefinitely, says Jim Warner, a principal at A. 
Foster Higgins &amp; Co., an employee benefits consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers impose restrictions on 401(k) money of former employees that 
make this option less desirable, Sher says. 
</P>
<P>
What about your pension? If the present value of your benefits is less than 
$3,500, the company can pay you unilaterally. (Present value is the value today 
of your future stream of benefits.) Again, roll the money into your IRA. 
</P>
<P>
If the present value of your pension is more than $3,500, the company may give 
you the option of receiving the money now, Sher says. But most companies don't; 
instead, they keep your pension until you retire, so be sure to keep records of 
your pension benefits.

Q&amp;A

Q: As a conservative, 35-year-old first-time investor, I'd like advice on 
something. Changing Times magazine said the value of Coca-Cola stock is 
expected to rise substantially in the next few years. What does Wall Street 
think? -- Amherst, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A: Joseph Frazzano, one of the top beverage analysts on Wall Street, likes 
Coca-Cola as both a short-term and long-term investment. "I think it's one of 
the better worldwide players, and it will generally outperform the stock 
market," says Frazzano, who works at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Frazzano is predicting that Coca-Cola's stock, now selling at around $46, will 
be 50% to 75% higher within the next two years. And you'd have a hard time 
finding any expert right now who thinks the overall market will perform 
anywhere near that level. 
</P>
<P>
Coke's near-term outlook is also bright. With the dollar much weaker this year, 
the revenues from the ocean of soft drink that Coca-Cola sells overseas will 
get translated back into the dollar at a favorable rate. Keep in mind, however, 
that when the economic condition of this country improves, the dollar will 
rally and Coke will have to contend with poor currency translations. Coca-Cola 
now gets 80% of its profits from overseas sales. So it is truly resistant to a 
U.S.-only recession, Frazzano says. Its earnings would be hurt only if 
economies of the rest of the world followed the U.S. down. 
</P>
<P>
Frazzano believes that Coke will earn $2.05 a share this year and $2.40 in 
1991. That compares to a profit of $1.68 a share in 1989. The average 1990 
estimate from all analysts is $2.10 a share, $2.37 a share for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a 1923 Sears, Roebuck catalogue called "Thrift Book of a Nation." It 
originally sold for $2.95 and is in fair condition. Is it worth anything? -- 
North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
A: The Chicago retailer started issuing its catalogues in 1888. That first one 
featured only watches and jewelry. The first full-sized general merchandise 
catalogue came out in 1896. Sears says it doesn't have any idea what old 
catalogues are worth. But Gary Garland, an expert on such things at Swan 
Galleries in New York City, says that if the catalogue is genuine (and not one 
of the many replicas) it could be worth anywhere from $150 to $250 "in decent 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
The "decent shape" part of his answer is problematic since Sears didn't design 
these catalogues to last long. After all, they were put out twice a year in the 
1920s. A catalogue that is "not in good shape," says Garland, might only be 
worth $50. "It depends on the extent of the damage," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any collectible is only worth what you are able to get someone to 
pay for it. And the first step is making contact with potential buyers. Garland 
and several other experts said so-called paper shows -- antique fairs for paper 
documents -- may be the best way to hook up with would-be buyers. 
</P>
<P>
These shows can be difficult to locate. They tend to be small and poorly 
advertised. There is a monthly trade publication called the "Paper and 
Advertising Collector" that lists "paper sales." And maybe the Ephemera Society 
could be of help at P.O. Box 37, Schoharie, N.Y. 12157. It specializes in paper 
collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I have 10 utility stocks, with both of us as the owners. Upon my 
death, would she have to send certified death notices to all the firms' 
registrars? Also, we have only one heir -- a daughter. How would my wife go 
about creating a joint-tenant survivorship with her? Could she request that the 
registrars add our daughter's name as a joint owner? Or would she have to sell 
the stock and repurchase it in her name and my daughter's? This, of course, 
would involve capital gains and broker fees. -- Hemet 
</P>
<P>
A: If you die, your wife should send a letter to the transfer agent named on 
the stock certificates stating that she is interested in making your daughter 
the co-owner. Your wife should sign the letter, include her Social Security 
number and have the letter notarized. She'll also have to prove you are 
deceased. 
</P>
<P>
You can also change the ownership on the stock right now. Both you and your 
wife would sign the letter and have it notarized. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q: In today's economic environment, with the deficit, recession, inflation and 
the Middle East crisis, how will gold fare in the next couple of years? I was 
told that gold is very undervalued now, and I have invested in the precious 
metal. -- Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
A: How will gold do? Who knows. There are as many opinions as there are people 
who wear jewelry. But here's one person's view. 
</P>
<P>
August Arace, a gold expert at Tucker Anthony Inc., does not think gold will do 
well in the next few years. Arace, who is the portfolio manager for the Freedom 
Gold &amp; Government Trust mutual fund, says "the outlook is bearish." 
</P>
<P>
Arace has been down on gold for 10 years. He says that ever since the U.S. 
government deregulated banks in the early 1980s, real interest rates (after 
adjusting for inflation) have been high. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a hammer on gold," says Arace, who advises his clients to keep 
no more than 5% of their assets in gold.

MARKETS: A NOTE OF CAUTION: TIMING UPSWINGS ISN'T EASY

<P>
If you believe that the recession you've been hearing so much about is a 
typical one, you had better hurry and give your broker a call. Stock prices 
should start to rally this winter. 
</P>
<P>
But if you are one of the growing number of people who feel deep down that this 
recession will be longer and more severe than most postwar downturns, hold off 
making that call. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule of thumb has always been that a new bull market begins halfway into 
the recession," says Allen Sinai, chief economist for Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the stock market always tries to anticipate events. In this 
case, Wall Street is attempting to figure out when the Federal Reserve Board's 
loosening of interest rates will begin bolstering the economy. 
</P>
<P>
So if you believe the conventional wisdom that says the U.S. entered a 
recession on Aug. 2, the day Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, and will start 
pulling out of a recession in late spring, you'll want to start loading up on 
stocks before you start loading up on New Year's champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this time around the rule of thumb could turn out to be just a dumb 
rule. For one thing, only with hindsight have experts learned that stocks start 
rallying halfway through a recession. 
</P>
<P>
When the nation is actually in a recession, the experts usually can't even 
agree on when the downturn began, much less when it will end. And the peculiar 
problems this time around -- like the 1980s surge in personal and corporate 
debt, the fragile banking system and the unstable Middle East situation -- are 
making it even more difficult for reasonable economists to agree. 
</P>
<P>
Making the situation even tougher to scope out is the fact that a recession 
hasn't even officially been declared, even though most experts would now agree 
that one is under way. 
</P>
<P>
A recession is commonly defined as having occured when the nation's output of 
goods and services (gross national product) declines for two straight quarters. 
So far there hasn't even been one quarter in which the gross national product 
has declined. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the government's data-gathering system say the GNP numbers can't be 
trusted. H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., 
recently told his clients that the 1.8% increase in GNP that the government 
reported for the third quarter of 1990 was "as phony as a $3 bill -- artifacts 
of an arcane algebra that bore no relation to economic reality." 
</P>
<P>
That 1.8% gain followed a 0.4% improvement in the second quarter, a 1.7% gain 
in the first quarter and a gain of just 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 1989. 
That fourth quarter figure reflects a sharp downward revision by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe Washington will eventually adjust all of this year's GNP 
numbers lower -- maybe enough to show that a recession began in early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to calculate the mid-point of the recession that hasn't been declared 
yet, keep in mind that the average post-World War II recession has been 11 
months long. But the 1970 and 1982 recessions each lasted 16 months. And 
according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group, 
recessions during this century have lasted as long as two years (excluding the 
Great Depression of the 1930s). 
</P>
<P>
The middle of an 11-month recession that began in August would be mid-January. 
But if an investor is trying to pick the mid-point of an 11-month recession 
that began last January, he should have been buying stocks about the time 
Saddam Hussein was causing trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But what if this recession turns out to be one of the 18-month variety? Or 
maybe the excesses of the 1980s together with recent tax increases and the 
deliberate inflation-fighting style of the Fed will make this recession a 
record breaker? Or maybe . . . 
</P>
<P>
You get the picture. Picking the midpoint of a recession is about as difficult 
as determining what Bo Jackson will do for a midlife career change. 
</P>
<P>
But Wall Street experts say that's just what a lot of professional investors 
have been trying to do. They contend that some of the stocks market's bounce in 
recent weeks can be attributed to aggressive investors trying to anticipate the 
economic recovery and events in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal &amp; Co., is one of 
those bulls. Seagle isn't trying to time the recession, but he does have 
another angle on this whole "when-to-buy" question. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices have generally fallen 28% to 30% during post-World War II 
recessions. In the past year, says Seagle, more than half of all stocks listed 
on the New York Stock Exchange are down at least that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"The market, for all intents and purposes, has hit bottom," claims Seagle. So, 
this bull says, buy stocks now. 
</P>
<P>
The bulls, of course, are playing in dangerous territory. Only four months ago, 
blue chip stocks were at record levels. Is it possible that the stock market 
could be at its bottom after so short a time? Or is it possible that, like last 
spring's fake rally, this recent upturn could be a trap that will cost 
investors dearly? 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden we have a lot of bulls coming out of the woodwork," says Peter 
Eliades, who writes the newsletter Stock Market Cycles. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone thinks the recession is going to end in the first quarter of next 
year, you'd want to be buying here," says Eliades. 
</P>
<P>
But Eliades does not concur with that assessment, although he does agree with 
the rule of thumb. "You should buy (stocks) three to six months before the end 
of a recession. I just disagree when it will end," says Eliades, who thinks 
this recession is going to be deeper and more severe than any postwar 
recession. So no sense buying stocks just yet. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Boston Co.'s Sinai: "Myself, I think the safer time to invest in stocks is 
when 1992 is in sight." 
</P>
<P>
As far as I'm concerned, I agree with a trader friend named Bill, who says: 
"What's the hurry? Stocks are too dangerous right now. People aren't buying 
stocks rationally." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meaning of NCR Talks Is Unclear 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street has paid Charles Exley the ultimate compliment. No matter what type 
of deal Exley's company, NCR Corp., happens to be negotiating with AT&amp;T 
Corp., traders say they are certain that it will be beneficial to NCR 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
That confidence, however, may be based on a faulty interpretation of some past 
Exley statements. If that is so, Wall Street could be in for another big 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
NCR's stock began rising a few weeks ago when the Wall Street Journal reported 
that NCR and AT&amp;T were in some sort of negotiations. The paper said the 
talks might involve AT&amp;T buying NCR. 
</P>
<P>
But the Journal also mentioned the possibility that the two companies might 
only be discussing a merger of their computer businesses, or some other 
less-desirable transaction. 
</P>
<P>
As would have been expected, NCR's stock rose on the idea that the company 
would be acquired. But, ordinarily, NCR's shares might have retreated as 
investors mulled the possibility of one of these lesser transactions occuring. 
But NCR's stock has generally remained strong. Why? 
</P>
<P>
Traders said it is because of the reputation of Exley as a proponent of what he 
calls "stakeholder rights." The feeling on Wall Street is that whatever the 
60-year chairman decides, it will benefit NCR shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen K. Smith, the computer analyst at Paine Webber Inc., says Exley 
"wouldn't be doing it unless it was good for stakeholders." 
</P>
<P>
But Exley has said on numerous occasions that NCR has several stakeholders -- 
the company's customers, suppliers and employees, as well as its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
What if the best interest of NCR's customers, suppliers and employees doesn't 
jibe with the interests of its stockholders? In other words, is Wall Street 
being too cocky by placing so much faith in Exley? 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Wall Street doesn't really think AT&amp;T wants to buy NCR. But 
nobody would be surprised if AT&amp;T somehow put its troubled computer 
business into the hands of NCR in some sort of joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
And while that prospect would ordinarily worry Wall Street, Exley's presence 
seems to have calmed everyone's nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"He does have an excellent reputation," adds Wendy Abramowitz, who follows NCR 
for Argus Research. "He's a good financial man. He's very different from the 
other computer executives. Some of the others say, 'I don't care what Wall 
Street thinks.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Wall Street is reading Exley's mind correctly, it can make a lot of money. 
But if it isn't -- watch out. Exley wasn't available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Utility Shares May Yet Prove Electric 
</P>
<P>
Want a hot investment idea? Buy shares of electric utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, this isn't the takeover-crazy 1980s. The investment motto that'll get 
you furthest these days is: Stay conservative. 
</P>
<P>
You can't get much more conservative than investing in electric utilities. They 
don't usually get taken over. But they also don't make a product that goes out 
of fashion. They aren't, in short, prone to highs and lows like other 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
But experts say electric utilities can be pretty sexy when you look at them in 
a certain way. Falling interest rates could boost utility stocks. In fact, 
Prudential-Bache Securities figures that every 50 basis point drop in interest 
rates (that's one half of 1%) would push the average utility stock up 7%. 
</P>
<P>
The experts also say that utility stocks are still cheap. And several electric 
utilities may actually be raising their dividend in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Abramson of Prudential, in fact, says the electric utility industry is in 
its best shape in the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Belosic, of Bear Stearns &amp; Co., says: "We've been recommending 
utilities because of their defensive characteristics. They tend to do well in 
this type of market environment." 
</P>
<P>
Despite uncertainty over the state of the economy, Belosic expects electric 
utility dividends to rise 2% to 3% annually for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Belosic is recommending New England Electric Systems, Scana Corp. 
(formerly South Carolina Electric and Gas), Florida Progress Corp., Dominion 
Resources, Cilcorp (formerly Central Illinois Light), and Kentucky Utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that could go wrong, the analysts say, is a sudden pickup in the 
economy and a sustained stock market rally. Even though electric utilities will 
actually be helped by a healthier economy, investors will start ignoring these 
conservative havens again. And their stocks might go down.

U.S. SUING 2 TEXANS OVER AN EMPTY PENSION FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all that Bernard Mass may have done to Whiteworth, so far it is only the 
two Texans who gave him control of the company who have been held accountable 
for Whiteworth's woes. 
</P>
<P>
Don M. Sweatman and Larry V. Locke chose not to defend themselves against a 
civil complaint filed in April by the U.S. Labor Department accusing them of 
violating federal pension laws by raiding Whiteworth's pension plan in March, 
1987, a few months after they took over the firm. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the government 
charged that the brothers-in-law deposited more than $1 million from the plan 
in the San Antonio branch of a Bahamian bank, then got $980,000 back as a loan 
to Whiteworth. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that they are the objects of a parallel criminal investigation by 
the FBI, the Texans cited the Fifth Amendment in refusing to respond to the 
civil charges. The government lawsuit alleges that they violated their duty to 
operate the pension plan for the sole benefit of its participants -- 
Whiteworth's employees. 
</P>
<P>
Only after the transaction with the Bank of Nassau did Sweatman lay out the 
details to the outside directors of the public company that he and Locke 
controlled, which in turn owned Whiteworth. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You probably will want to resign when you hear this,' " recalled 
Royce Diener, former chairman of American Medical International, the big 
hospital management company. "At that point I felt I was involved with 
something I had insufficient knowledge about and shouldn't have anything to do 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the roughly 100 former Whiteworth employees who are due benefits from 
the pension plan -- either now or as they get older -- complain that quicker 
government action could have prevented the problems. 
</P>
<P>
A. D. White, the company's founder, had taken steps to terminate the plan and 
distribute its assets to covered employees before he sold Whiteworth early in 
1986. But it wasn't until April, 1988, that the Internal Revenue Service 
approved the termination. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, the money apparently was long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, responsibility for the plan has been batted back and forth by the 
Labor Department and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the government-owned 
agency that insures private pension plans. The PBGC now is moving to place the 
plan in trusteeship and begin making payments to the five former employees who 
already qualify for benefits, an agency spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the assets are missing, all payments will come from the guaranty 
corporation's already overtaxed coffers. 
</P>
<P>
"The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing," said Thomas R. 
White, the brother of A. D. White and former vice president of purchasing at 
Whiteworth. The Fountain Valley man said he is owed more than $63,000 in 
benefits. JIM SCHACHTER

BERLE AND BALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Milton Berle, a.k.a. Uncle Miltie, a.k.a. Mr. Television, recently was going 
through the 390 hours of his legendary TV se ries, specials and shows and came 
across a real treasure: a one-hour special he did for NBC starring Lucille Ball 
and Desi Arnaz and not seen since it first aired in 1959. The special, "Milton 
Loves Lucy," features Lucy and Desi as themselves, not as Lucy and Ricky 
Ricardo. 
</P>
<P>
TV viewers will get the opportunity to see the comedy for the first time in 31 
years Tuesday night on KTTV Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still in good shape," Berle said the other day. "It has nothing to do 
with 'I Love Lucy.' We shot it in Las Vegas. I was appearing there at the time 
at a hotel called El Rancho Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very, very funny. If you notice, the writing is completely different 
than the writing is today for sitcoms. They had more time, and it's Lucy, 
myself and Desi. It is a story of intrigue. And she is the brilliant Lucy. I 
think it is one of the best shows we ever did together." 
</P>
<P>
Arnaz also directed the comedy. "I have to compliment Desi a lot," Berle said. 
"He was really the big brain behind the Desi-Lucy setup. He was a wonderful 
comedy director, and when I did the Lucy shows he directed a few. So I said, 
'Hey, Desi, I want you to direct this show,' and he did an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
Berle met Ball during the mid-'30s when both were under contract to RKO. "She 
was gorgeous," Berle said. "We met each other at parties and we had a few 
dates, but nothing serious. She is basically the funniest woman I have ever 
known and a wonderful actress." 
</P>
<P>
And how many times did the two work together? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God," Berle said, laughing. "I guested on 'I Love Lucy' about nine times 
and then I did 'The Lucy Show' about 10 times. And I don't know how many times 
she guested with me." 
</P>
<P>
Ball, Berle said, was a tremendous perfectionist. "She had to do it right," he 
said. "She would rehearse and rehearse and rehearse. When you see the show, you 
will notice the glibness and rapport between Lucy and myself." 
</P>
<P>
After "Milton Loves Lucy," KTTV Tuesday night is airing "Lucy Hides Milton," an 
episode of the one-hour "Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show" that followed "I Love 
Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
"That is the one when I was in drag," Berle said. 
</P>
<P>
"Milton Loves Lucy" airs Tuesday at 8 p.m., followed by "Lucy Hides Milton" at 
9 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11.

VIDEO FOR THE TRENCHES

<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnam was dubbed the 'living room" war because it was the first time 
television graphically covered combat involving Americans on the nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you can bring the Vietnam conflict back into your living room in ways 
never before thought possible. Whether it's a big-screen piece of fiction about 
the war or a documentary tracing Vietnam's history in painful realistic detail, 
home video has images and sounds that fascinate and overwhelm. 
</P>
<P>
More than two dozen fictional films fill the home video shelves. They include 
such categories as: 
</P>
<P>
World War II clones: The Boys in Company C (green Marine recruits are whipped 
into shape for combat in Vietnam, 1977, "CA/Columbia tape, Image Entertainment 
laser video disc); The Green Berets (John Wayne's 1968 patriotic clunker, 
Warner tape and disc), and The Last Hunter (one man fights behind enemy lines, 
1980, Vestron tape). 
</P>
<P>
Docudramas: Don't Cry, It's Only Thunder (about the true story of an Army medic 
in Vietnam, 1981, RCA/ Columbia tape) and A Rumor of War (Keith Carradine as a 
lieutenant charged with killing two Vietnam civilians, 1980, USA tape. 
Superhero attempts to free missing American prisoners still trapped in Vietnam: 
Rambo: First Blood, Part II (with Sylvester Stallone, 1985, HBO tape, Image 
Entertainment laser video disc); the two Missing in Action films (with Chuck 
Norris, MGA/UA tape and disc); Uncommon Valor with Gene Hackman, 1983, 
Paramount tape and disc), and G.I. Executioner (Vestron tape). 
</P>
<P>
Returning Vietnam veterans crying out of vengeance: Sylvester Stallone in First 
Blood (1982, HBO tape) and Chuck Norris in Forced Vengeance (1982, MGM/UA tape 
and disc). 
</P>
<P>
Returning Vietnam veterans still haunted by their experiences: Cease Fire 
(1985, HBO tape) featuring Don Johnson suffering nightmares and delusions 15 
years after the war. 
</P>
<P>
Television series: China Beach (1988, the pilot, Warner tape), the ABC-TV 
series set in Vietnam in the late 1960s focuses on Nurse McMurphy (Dana 
Delaney) approaching the end of a year's service in Vietnam. The program 
manages, through a series of vignettes, to convey the nightmare the medical 
personnel shares with the young soldiers (shades of the Korean War "M*A*S*HS). 
</P>
<P>
Many of Hollywood's elite directors have been fascinated and horrified with 
Vietnam and have taken some of our best actors with them on their odysseys: 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986, Vestron tape and Image Entertainment disc) and 
Born on the Fourth of July (1989, MCA tape and disc). Both films attempt to 
capture personal visions of Vietnam, and they translate well to the small 
screen. Both were no-nonsense, painfully realistic accounts of the war. The 
first captured Stone's own experiences on the line, with Charlie Sheen as the 
character based on the writer-director, and Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe as 
unforgettable soldiers. The second chronicled Ron Kovic's life story from 
gung-ho recruit to the paralyzed anti-war activist. Tom Cruise played the role 
to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalpyse Now (1979, Paramount tape and disc) and 
Gardens of Stone (1987, CBS-Fox tape and disc). The first is an eerie, 
fictional account of Vietnam capturing the emotional bankruptcy and horror of 
the war. Special agent Martin Sheen journeys up the river to find and kill 
corrupt officer Marlon Brando. Extraordinary Oscar-winning photography. The 
second was an overly sentimental account of life in Arlington National 
Cemetery's home guard during the war and one soldier's determination to go into 
battle. James Earl Jones and James Caan are effective. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987, Warner tape and disc) offers a 
searing look at Marine basic training and the baptism of fire the young 
recruits go through in Vietnam. Drill sergeant D.I. Erney isn't acting and his 
real-life performance rips through the film. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978, MCA tape and disc) is the melodramatic 
account of three young steelworkers before, during and after the Vietnam War. 
Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep head the cast of this Academy Award-winning 
film that seems artificial on the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989, RCA/Columbia) focuses on one patrol 
and its atrocious treatment of an innocent Vietnamese girl. It's based on a 
real incident and is scripted by playwright David Rabe, a Vietnam veteran. Sean 
Penn is the half-crazed leader, Michael Fox the voice of reason and Thu Le the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Levinson's Good Morning, Vietnam (1987, Touchstone tape and disc) is 
Robin Williams' tour de force as an Army disc jockey in Saigon. It's based on 
real-life Army deejay Adrian Cronauer, but the monologues are all vintage 
Williams, outrageously funny. The rest of the film suffers by comparison. 
</P>
<P>

Q &amp; A: GEORGE PEPPARD: READY, SET, ACTION CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of his career, George Peppard has been a superstar waiting to happen. 
He co-starred with Robert Mitchum, Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Julie Harris, 
Paul Newman, yet his own professional status never quite rose to their level. 
</P>
<P>
Peppard, 62, became best known for his arsenal of action and military films, 
several of them classics, including "Pork Chop Hill" (1959), "How the West Was 
Won" (1962) and "The Blue Max" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
He found it tough escaping those roles. And the battles in his personal life 
were often as tumultuous as his war films -- conflicts on the job, drinking 
problems, four marriages, four divorces. 
</P>
<P>
After a period of B movies in the 1970s, Peppard was cast opposite Linda Evans 
in the pilot of "Dynasty" but was then asked to leave the series to make room 
for John Forsythe. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not surprisingly, Peppard came back in a flash of gunpowder in 1983 as 
the dapper Col. John "Hannibal" Smith, the machine gun-toting leader of ABC's 
demolition-derby series "The A-Team." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Peppard is at war again in "Night of the Fox," an ambitious 
miniseries based on Jack Higgins' best seller, airing on KTLA. Peppard plays a 
British secret service agent during World War II whose mission is to rescue -- 
or kill -- a shipwrecked American in German territory before he has a chance to 
give away plans for D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
Peppard spoke with Daniel Cerone about "Night of the Fox" in a midnight phone 
interview from his hotel room in London, after two exhausting performances of 
the play "Love Letters" with Elaine Stritch. 
</P>
<P>
Is "Night of the Fox" a return to the old-fashioned war movies you used to star 
in? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it is. We have a huge cast of soldiers and tanks and fortifications and 
ships and explosions and action. But it's not hurried. We're used to a 
cut-cut-cut feel from films and television now. Higgins wrote a story that 
unfolds. The show is a good old-fashioned melodrama. It's a spy story with 
double identities, an illicit love affair and lots of plot twists. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever want to escape those old military roles? 
</P>
<P>
(He laughs) Are you kidding? Look, an enormous amount of my film work has been 
spent charging up a hill saying, "Follow me, men! This way!" Even though I did 
"Breakfast at Tiffany's," nobody seemed to think I could do comedy. I always 
played the man of action. And men of action are not terribly deep characters, 
and not real vocal characters. Martineau (from "Night of the Fox") is a 
delightful departure. He's a thinking man, and he talks. 
</P>
<P>
You found prominence with a new generation of fans on "The A-Team." How do you 
regard that experience? 
</P>
<P>
I love it. It's the first time I ever had money in the bank. Four California 
divorces and 25 years of alimony will see to it you have no money in the bank. 
It was a giant boost to my career, and made me a viable actor for other roles. 
</P>
<P>
You never worried that "The A-Team" might hurt your career? 
</P>
<P>
Hurt my career? (Before "The A-Team") I couldn't get arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Well, this business has a short memory for one thing. People want to know, 
"What did you do yesterday?" Another thing, in some areas I had gained a 
reputation for being, quote, "difficult." And a lot of people are of the 
attitude, "Who needs it?" 
</P>
<P>
Are you difficult? 
</P>
<P>
I don't think most of the people I'm actively involved with believe that I am. 
Well, I shouldn't say that. I did have some very highly publicized 
disagreements with executives, both with studios and prominent television 
executives. I've more or less quit three different television series. 
</P>
<P>
What was the lowest point of your career? 
</P>
<P>
The 10 years just before "The A-Team." I had no money. I moved out of my house 
and leased it. I got an occasional job, in New Zealand, in Spain. I had a nice 
role in a Roger Corman movie, "Battle Beyond the Stars." I played a character 
called "Space Cowboy." But there weren't enough roles to live on. 
</P>
<P>
Was that also when you had a drinking problem? 
</P>
<P>
I haven't had a drink in 12 years. I turned into my own enemy. I finally 
recognized the snake that bit me, and the fact that alcohol is poison for me. I 
was very ashamed. I talk about it purposefully...I don't mind being used as an 
example if it can do somebody some good. Life was great after I quit drinking. 
My career was in the toilet, but I felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
Any more marriages in your future? 
</P>
<P>
Are you kidding? Getting married and having a bad divorce is just like breaking 
your leg. The same leg, in the same place. I'm lucky I don't walk with a cane. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of actor would you like to be regarded as today? 
</P>
<P>
Well, remember I trained for seven years before I started getting screen work 
as a stage actor. I love working for an audience. Aside from that, despite all 
the uniforms and the guns, I think I am at my base a character actor. 
</P>
<P>
So you're not concerned that you never became a superstar? 
</P>
<P>
Being a star has never interested me. Stars, per say, are a pain. Stars to me 
are in the sky. The important question is, "How good an actor are you?" And now 
I have some hope, because I'm of an age where I could be considered for 
character roles. 
</P>

For the second consecutive game, Corona del Mar flirted with disaster. And for 
the second consecutive time, the Sea Kings found a way to win. 
</P>
<P>
Middle blocker Tahlia Wagner had 16 kills, and outside hitter Tracy Schriber 
added 12 as the top-seeded Sea Kings rallied in the final two games for a 
15-12, 10-15, 13-15, 15-3, 15-6 win over unseeded Poway in a second-round 
Division I regional game at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (26-1) advanced to the regional final against the winner of the 
San Jose Lynbrook, which defeated the Sea Kings in last year's regional final. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Burke and Shana Purvis each had 10 kills to lead Poway (23-6). 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings, who struggled in a four-game victory over Notre Dame Academy in 
the first round, extended their winning streak to 24 games despite 36 hitting 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the third time this season Corona del Mar has been pushed to five 
games. The others were a win over El Toro and a loss to La Habra in the 
semifinals of the Orange County Championships. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't on tonight," Corona del Mar Coach Dale Flickinger said. "But we 
came right back and found a way to win." 
</P>
<P>
"Poway has the best offense we have seen this year. They have strong hitters 
outside and in the middle." MIKE REILLEY

<P>
Gleen Bermundo had 22 kills to lead St. Joseph's of Lakewood to a 9-15, 15-17, 
16-14, 16-14, 15-13 victory over University of San Diego High School in the 
Southern California girls' volleyball Division II semifinals at USDHS. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph's (18-1) battled back from a two game deficit to defeat the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Hofmans had 37 assists for St. Joseph's. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an exciting match," St. Joseph's Coach Michael Hinton said. "I think 
both teams showed a lot of character. Neither team quit. When I came down here, 
I didn't know what to expect. USDHS is a fine school." 
</P>
<P>
USDHS's Michelle Rico had 37 kills and Rose Dowling had 89 assists in the loss. 
Defensively, Rico had 14 digs and Christina Alvarado had 19. 
</P>
<P>
USDHS led in the third game, 14-10, before Bermundo reeled off several kills to 
seal the match for St. Joseph's. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't ashamed of how we played out there," Dons Coach Rob Gorney said. "I 
told them that when you set a goal, go ahead and finish it. It seemed we were 
the stronger team and all we had to do was finish it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dons finished the season 22-3. TERRY RATHER

<P>
One remark Donna Langlois always heard at Thanksgiving dinner was: Mom, why did 
you make all this food? And sure enough, she had done it again. 
</P>
<P>
There was the 23-pound turkey, two kinds of stuffing, mashed potatoes, sweet 
potatoes, cranberries, dinner rolls, parsnips, turnips, squash, peas, creamed 
onions, beets, asparagus, three kinds of pie and cranberry bread. 
</P>
<P>
But this year the big spread was not such a big deal. The world intruded on the 
holiday, distracting from it with a shadow dance of war. Donna wanted to think 
America was right to send troops to the Persian Gulf. But who knew? 
</P>
<P>
Her mind did flips about it. Iraq can't be permitted to take over Kuwait, she 
reasoned. But did America get involved to defend principles or oil? The answer 
almost depended on which network news program she tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
What do Americans really know of these places, anyway? Donna's idea of the 
Middle East came from "Lawrence of Arabia." Recently, she found out that Kuwait 
was not even a democracy. "Bottom line, we're going to turn that country back 
into the same monarchy it was before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And is that worth losing a son over? No, of course it isn't. But would she feel 
differently if her son was not there in the midst of it? Well, maybe yes. This 
whole thing is so full of contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
The only sure thing may be the evil of that man Saddam Hussein. He has the look 
of the devil. Donna thinks she has seen it only twice before. "Moammar Kadafi 
was one," she said. "And Charles Manson the other."

<P>
The way the President sometimes comes across, he must think there is nothing 
wrong in the Persian Gulf that a little war won't cure. To those at the 
Langlois' table, George Bush at times seems a little trigger happy. 
</P>
<P>
They hope he will be patient. Or at least send some of his own sons over there. 
</P>
<P>
Didn't America learn anything during the Cold War? Donna asked: "We won that 
one with our endurance. If that one took 40 years, I don't see why we have to 
win this one in four months." 
</P>
<P>
Donna's friend Sue Bini had come by for the Thanksgiving meal. She is a parent, 
too. The whole crisis reminds her of the way children play in a sandbox. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to teach them," Sue said. "You tell them, 'C'mon, don't fight. You 
have to learn to share.'

IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA, THE U.S. AND SOVIET UNION ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER

<P>
As Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III were in Irkutsk, 
enjoying a soft Siberian summer and a fishing holiday while they wrapped up yet 
another session in their continuing efforts to negotiate an end to the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, on the streets of Irkutsk, the mood was not so relaxed. The city's 
630,000 inhabitants, like those elsewhere in the Soviet Union, were desperate. 
Earlier that week, riot police had been called to disperse a crowd of about 
1,000 shoppers shoving to get into a store that had managed to come up with a 
shipment of imported men's boots. Across Uritsky Street, Siberian consumers 
participated in a kind of lottery in hopes of winning prized items such as 
razors, cigarettes and toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze were nearing the end of their talks when Lt. Gen. Howard 
Graves, a representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was in the secretary 
of state's delegation, informed Baker of the Iraqi invasion. Baker immediately 
told Shevardnadze. The Soviet foreign minister was stunned. The previous day, 
he had told the Americans he was convinced that Saddam Hussein would not invade 
Kuwait. "This is what 40 years of our policies in the Middle East have come 
to," Shevardnadze later would tell an aide. 
</P>
<P>
It was too early to know exactly what was happening. Baker left the Soviet 
Union for Mongolia, while Shevardnadze flew back to Moscow. Aboard 
Shevardnadze's Aeroflot jet were two of Baker's top aides -- Dennis Ross, 
director of policy planning, and State Department counselor Robert Zoellick. 
They had intended to sit down with Soviet officials at a dacha outside Moscow 
to work out the agenda their two governments should confront in the coming 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But as their plane soared across the Urals, talk turned quickly to the Iraqi 
invasion. Ross' Soviet counterpart, Sergei Tarasenko, bitingly disparaged the 
brutality of Saddam Hussein, a longtime Soviet ally. Ross and Tarasenko began 
talking about the possibility of a joint U.S.-Soviet statement condemning the 
invasion and embargoing arms sales to Iraq. In Moscow, Ross rushed to the 
American Embassy and called Baker in Mongolia. The Soviets might agree to a 
joint statement on Iraq, Ross said, if Baker would fly to Moscow and deliver it 
alongside Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Baker liked the idea. A joint statement would show the world that a new era had 
arrived, one in which the two superpowers had a new relationship. Such a 
statement would make it difficult for the other major nations of the world to 
lag behind in condemning Iraq. And it would put the lie to any claim by Saddam 
Hussein that he had international support for his invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, ever-cautious, Baker instructed Ross: "Make sure the statement is a good 
one." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for a quiet weekend at a dacha was abandoned. Tarasenko invited Ross 
to an office in an annex of the Soviet Foreign Ministry compound. He told Ross 
they should get the latest news from Iraq. The American visitor thought his 
Soviet colleague was about to pick up the phone and call some Mideast 
specialist in the Soviet Foreign Ministry, or perhaps the KGB. Instead, 
Tarasenko moved over to an office television and turned on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
Tarasenko phoned Shevardnadze and got tentative approval for a joint 
U.S.-Soviet statement on the invasion. Ross' aide, Andrew Carpendale, was 
assigned to begin work on the drafting. All the typewriters in the Soviet 
Foreign Ministry offices had the Cyrillic alphabet; finally, after a frantic 
search, Soviet officials located an electric typewriter with the Latin 
alphabet, and Carpendale went to work. 
</P>
<P>
His draft included an explicit Soviet-U.S. condemnation of Iraq and a demand 
that Hussein pull his troops out of Kuwait. But on Aug. 3, as Baker and his 
party were already flying from Mongolia to Moscow, this draft came under 
attack. Traditionalists in the Soviet Foreign Ministry thought that the 
statement was too strong. The Soviet Union had not aligned itself with the 
United States in the Mideast for decades. Wasn't this going too far? 
</P>
<P>
The haggling and uncertainty among Soviet officials continued until just before 
Baker landed. In the end, Tarasenko, Shevardnadze and, ultimately, Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev won out. On Friday night, Aug. 3, soon after 
Baker's Boeing 707 touched down at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport, the Soviet foreign 
minister and the U.S. secretary of state appeared before television cameras to 
read the prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The two superpowers made clear that their efforts would extend beyond the mere 
rhetoric of condemnation. "The United States and the Soviet Union believe the 
international community must not only condemn this action," the two superpowers 
said, "but also take practical steps in response to it." 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis shows how the superpowers hope, in the future, to work together 
to solve conflicts, and why the Soviet Union has become a staunch champion of a 
stronger U.N. Security Council -- even one able to deploy multinational forces 
against aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to restrain Iraq, the United States and the Soviet Union are working 
together in an area of the world where Americans and Soviets have been at odds 
for more than three decades, virtually since the beginning of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
"A major event in the Near East is no longer a subject for confrontation 
between the Soviet Union and the United States, whereas before now it had 
always been a subject of confrontation," observes former French President 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing. A senior Bush Administration official terms the gulf 
crisis "the first major military operation or conflict which hasn't almost 
immediately taken on East-West overtones." 
</P>
<P>
But the crisis also has underscored one of the paradoxes inherent in what 
President Bush and others call the "new world order:" As the two superpowers 
cooperate, they may have less influence on the clients they subsidize and 
support around the world. "The end of the fear of a global conflict may have 
lifted a restraining force on regional disputes," says UC San Diego professor 
Lawrence B. Krause. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the crisis illustrates how a strengthened Security Council 
could serve the interests of Soviet foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union has learned firsthand the dangers of military overextension, 
particularly because of serious economic crises at home and in Eastern Europe," 
wrote Thomas G. Weiss and Meryl A. Kessler in Foreign Policy magazine last 
summer. "As a result, the Kremlin has become perhaps the most active and vocal 
advocate for a more dynamic United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders have been motivated by more than a belief in 
world federalism, Weiss and Kessler say. By relying on the United Nations, they 
argue, "the Soviets are able to extricate themselves abroad and cut the costs 
of military assistance elsewhere, while using multilateral diplomacy to prevent 
the United States from taking advantage of this retreat." 
</P>
<P>
A stronger United Nations, they conclude, could help give the Soviet Union "an 
increased diplomatic role in Central America and the Middle East," two areas 
from which the Soviets have long been excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the gulf crisis, Soviet officials have been reluctant to authorize 
the use of force by the U.S.-led forces in the Persian Gulf. When President 
Bush met with Gorbachev in Paris early last week, the Soviet leader balked at 
approving a United Nations resolution that would explicitly authorize military 
action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Gorbachev said he felt the solution to the gulf crisis "must be 
political." 
</P>
<P>
The need for Mideast oil prompted both the quick American response and the 
determined U.S. effort to enlist Soviet backing. 
</P>
<P>
"While we are concerned about aggression or violation of the U.N. charter and 
the rest of it, if it were only carrots or wheat that were being produced in 
the Middle East, rather than the oil on which the world depends, I'm not sure 
that our reaction would have been as immediate, " says James R. Schlesinger, a 
former secretary of defense, energy secretary and CIA director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INSIDE CHINA 
</P>
<P>
While Baker and Shevardnadze were reading their joint denunciation of the Iraqi 
invasion, Assistant Secretary of State for Asia Richard H. Solomon sat 
furtively with U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Jack F. Matlock in a small reception 
room at Vnukovo Airport, hidden from the reporters in Baker's traveling party. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon had been aboard the secretary of state's plane from Mongolia; now he 
was waiting for a midnight flight that would carry him back across the Urals. 
</P>
<P>
He was about to make a hurried, secretive visit to China. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few minutes before Baker's plane landed in Moscow, the airborne 
secretary of state had gotten a call from the White House, giving the 
President's approval for Solomon's trip. Its principal aim was to ensure the 
Chinese government's cooperation, or at least its tacit acquiescence, in the 
diplomatic effort against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
China had an extremely active policy in the Mideast and had, in recent years, 
been one of the most important arms suppliers to Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
More important, China was one of the five permanent members of the U.N. 
Security Council, meaning that Beijing would have the power to veto any 
resolution imposing an embargo or other collective international action against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
International revulsion against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has marked a 
significant turning point in China's campaign to restore ties with the West. 
Although few could have predicted it, the invasion has offered a possibility 
for China's gradual return to a modicum of global respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since its crushing of the democracy demonstrations at Tian An Men Square 
in 1989, China had been treated virtually as an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
Sending Solomon to Beijing itself marked a small step forward for the Bush 
Administration. After two unsuccessful trips to Beijing by National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft the previous year, the Bush Administration had 
maintained a ban on official contacts with Beijing at the level of assistant 
secretary or higher. Nonetheless, Solomon was not part of the top inner circle 
of the Administration's foreign policy team. And the United States kept his 
contact with the Chinese government at a relatively low level, requesting a 
meeting only with Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, following his all-night flight, Solomon rested and showered at the 
residence of U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley. Then he went to see Li 
Peng. Solomon pointed out that not only the United States and the Soviet Union, 
but also other major countries, including Japan, already had condemned Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait. China should not be left out, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, China joined in the U.N. Security Council resolutions 
condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and imposing international sanctions 
against Iraq. In September, China also went along with the crucial Security 
Council resolution that implicitly authorized the use of force on behalf of the 
U.N. embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, China joined in the diplomatic effort. And its cooperation won results. 
</P>
<P>
A few months after the Iraqi invasion, the European Community lifted some of 
its economic sanctions against China. The World Bank prepared to clear the way 
for some new loans to China. And Secretary of State Baker met twice this fall 
with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen -- thus increasing significantly the 
frequency of high-level talks between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INSIDE JAPAN 
</P>
<P>
If it weren't for the curtain of thick clouds, Japan's famed Mt. Fuji would 
have formed a majestic backdrop to a very odd ceremony. On Sept. 8, in the town 
of Gotemba, Japan's defense Establishment was celebrating the 40th anniversary 
of the founding of its postwar military -- taking time off on a Saturday 
morning for target practice with tanks, helicopters, 203-millimeter artillery 
and Stinger missiles. 
</P>
<P>
In any other nation, such troops would be called an army. In Japan, which has 
the third-largest military budget in the world, they are labeled the 
Self-Defense Forces (SDF), a name intended to underscore the passive nature of 
their mission. But at these ceremonies in Gotemba, the Japanese troops were 
flaunting their destructive abilities before an enthusiastic crowd of more than 
20,000 civilian spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheered as formations of tanks roared across the foreground, swiveled 
their turrets and blasted small targets stuck to the hills some 10 football 
fields distant. A narrator with a loudspeaker described the hardware as it 
rolled onto the field, and in the background a high-pitched voice screamed 
commands to fire. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting went on for nearly two hours. There was a short intermission so 
the spectators could buy beer, box lunches and military souvenirs -- SDF key 
chains, posters and tractor caps -- from stands behind the bleachers. Soldiers 
in green fatigues milled about. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Yuka Komiyama, 26, said she enlisted six years ago and wants to make a 
career out of the military, even if she marries and rears children. She said it 
never occurred to her that she might be sent overseas, but added that many of 
her colleagues are disappointed that Japan had all but ruled out any form of 
SDF deployment in the Persian Gulf until laws can be revised. 
</P>
<P>
She was ambivalent about the idea herself. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was ordered to go, I'd go. Maybe I should say I'd be glad to," she said. 
"A lot of the others would like to go, but we're aware that there are voices in 
the public that would be opposed." 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Persian Gulf casts new doubt upon the seriousness of Japan's 
professed aspirations to be a major power, to exert its own independent 
influence in international affairs. And, more than ever, the crisis calls into 
question the future stability of Japan's alliance with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, it has exposed all the underlying contradictions of Japan's 
role in the world and in its relations with the United States: 
</P>
<P>
* Japan's economy, now the world's second-largest, obtains 70% of its oil from 
the Persian Gulf, yet Japan long has relied on the United States to safeguard 
such supplies. 
</P>
<P>
* Japan's pacifist constitution, which says the Japanese people "forever 
renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation," had been all but imposed upon 
it by the United States. Yet now, 44 years later, the United States was asking 
Japan to send its own military forces -- minesweepers, military transports, SDF 
logistic personnel -- to help out in a possible war against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
* Recently, as Japan has grown into one of the wealthiest nations in the world, 
the United States has encouraged Tokyo to develop its own, more assertive and 
independent foreign policy. Yet in the gulf crisis, U.S. officials scathingly 
criticized Japan for not following the American policy line. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, the United States and Japan worked in tandem. The United 
States supplied troops, security and diplomatic leadership, while Japan 
provided money. The aftermath of Saddam Hussein's invasion shows that in cases 
where there is a potential for war and American casualties, the United States 
will ask Japan to share a new, different, non-financial burden -- the burden of 
risking the loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset of the gulf crisis, Administration officials had made it plain 
that cash would not be enough. The United States wanted Japanese personnel and 
equipment -- personnel for support, logistics and other noncombat roles; 
equipment to transport troops and supplies. Otherwise, U.S. officials said, the 
American forces might be seen as mercenaries, defending Japanese interests in 
exchange for payment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the ones whose asses are on the line, and they're getting 70% of their 
oil from the area," said one State Department official. 
</P>
<P>
But in Japan, there was intense resistance. 
</P>
<P>
One nationwide poll by Tokyo Television indicated that 78% of the Japanese 
public opposed sending any SDF forces to the Persian Gulf. Ultimately, none 
were sent. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute about the use of SDF personnel undermined Japan's position in 
Washington. And Japan's standing with the Bush Administration was further 
eroded by additional wrangling and delays about the amount of money Japan 
should contribute. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bush Administration first asked Tokyo for financial help toward the 
effort against Iraq, Japan seemed to act as though it were in the midst of yet 
another business negotiation. Tokyo made some initial low bids, tested the 
reaction, then came up with a new, higher offer. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu initially offered $10 million toward the relief 
effort in Jordan. A day later, Japanese officials volunteered $1 billion toward 
the costs of the multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, President Bush dispatched Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to 
Japan to ask for more money. But Brady seemed to get nowhere. Kaifu made no 
commitments or promises of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Sept. 13, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution 
demanding that Tokyo pay more money or risk a pullout of 5,000 U.S. troops a 
year from the American bases in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, Japan found more money. Kaifu's government offered another $1 
billion for the multinational forces in the Mideast and $2 billion to help 
countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. That brought Japan's total 
financial contribution to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said it was satisfied. Others were not. For the first time in 
years, biting criticisms of Japan could be heard not only in Congress but also 
in the State Department and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
If sufficiently irked by continuing American criticisms and pressure, Japan 
could reduce its reliance on the United States and bolster its own independent 
military power. Such a development would alarm Japan's neighbors in Asia, 
including China, South Korea and the nations of Southeast Asia.

INSIDE EUROPE 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, the day of Iraq's invasion, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
happened to be in Aspen, Colo., preparing to give a speech to the Aspen 
Institute on the subject of "Shaping a New Global Community." President Bush, 
too, flew to Colorado to address the symposium. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, as the two leaders stood on the grassy lawn of a ranch owned by 
U.S. Ambassador to Britain Henry Catto, reporters asked them about the 
unfolding events in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush temporized. He listed the foreign leaders that he had telephoned. He said 
he was "concerned about the situation" and was "hoping that a peaceful solution 
will be found." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher was much more forceful. What Iraq had done, she said, was "totally 
unacceptable -- and if it were allowed to endure, then there would be many 
other small countries that could never feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
To onlookers, it appeared as though Thatcher knew that the Iraqi invasion would 
require a tough response, while Bush still wasn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Bush would say he had been "comforted" by the fact that, in the 
first days of the invasion, "the prime minister was there with me, answering 
the tough questions and standing shoulder-to-shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion has changed relations between the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout most of the Cold War, Europe had been the prime battleground, and 
the United States and its Western European allies had worked primarily on joint 
endeavors in Europe itself. Now, in this first post-Cold War crisis, the 
battleground is outside Europe -- in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
And what counts most is the extent to which Western European countries are 
willing to support and join American military initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans have lined up alongside the Americans to an extent that would 
have been unimaginable during the Vietnam War era. At the same time, the gulf 
crisis has spurred efforts by the European powers to develop their own, united 
foreign policy in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has led the way among the Europeans in supporting the American military 
effort against Iraq, in effect reviving its old special relationship with the 
United States. In the first weeks after the invasion, the British sent naval 
and air units to the gulf, and by mid-September, it agreed to send ground 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Such efforts put Britain once again in a leadership role within Europe. 
Britain's old rival, Germany, had no desire or ability to play a leading role 
in the European efforts in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
No one in Europe wants to spur the remilitarization of Germany. And the Germans 
can plausibly argue that they have been preoccupied, both emotionally and 
financially, by the changes in Europe over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Germany -- which eventually donated $2 billion to the gulf effort -- has been 
wrapped up in the very first stages of reunification. Moreover, earlier this 
year, it pledged to contribute more than $10 billion to get Soviet troops out 
of Germany and to build housing for them back home. And Germany has promised 
other, smaller amounts to the new governments of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the year before the Iraqi invasion, Thatcher and other British officials had 
looked on with dismay as the Bush Administration devoted ever-increasing 
attention to Germany. The gulf crisis, a British diplomat recently observed, 
"has given us a chance to be blue-eyed in Washington once again." 
</P>
<P>
And support has come from other European nations, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after a meeting with President Bush, French President Francois 
Mitterrand announced that he would support a United Nations resolution that 
explicitly authorizes the use of military force against Iraq, and he predicted 
that such a resolution will be approved by the Security Council by 
mid-December. Since August, France has contributed about 15,000 troops to the 
Persian Gulf forces, including 5,500 in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, we've seen a level of support for the American activities in the 
Mideast that is unprecedented. It's not just the British, but the French, the 
Italians, the Dutch," says David P. Calleo, a specialist on Europe at the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INSIDE THE THIRD WORLD 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Aug. 16, two weeks after the Iraqi invasion, the lights in Ramna 
Park in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, went off early in the evening. They 
would do so for the foreseeable future. "It looks as though we are at war or in 
some kind of emergency," said one unhappy stroller as he headed for the gates. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of drivers lined up outside gas stations to fill their cars in advance 
of a newly imposed nationwide ban on oil and gas sales each Friday, the Muslim 
holiday. That Thursday night, and on succeeding nights, the shops in Dhaka and 
other cities in Bangladesh closed their doors at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammed Ershad had ordered these new austerity 
measures to conserve energy. Ershad and his government were desperate, because 
they knew that for countries like Bangladesh, the crisis in the Persian Gulf 
was a crushing economic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had about 85,000 workers in Kuwait and Iraq, from among its 400,000 
Bangladeshis employed throughout the Middle East. The earnings these Middle 
East workers sent back home was Bangladesh's largest single source of foreign 
exchange, about $477 million a year. Bangladeshi workers in Kuwait sent home 
$89 million last year, and those in Iraq sent home another $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
As if all of this were not enough, Iraq and Kuwait had served as one of the 
principal markets for Bangladesh's two leading exports, jute and tea. Iraq 
alone had bought a quarter of the 40,000 tons of tea auctioned in Bangladesh 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this valuable export income was gone. Even if the crisis were short, the 
government estimated that Bangladesh would lose $17 million in sales to Iraq 
and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis raised other costs as well -- higher rates for shipping and 
insurance, loss of income from air flights to Kuwait and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bangladesh government added it all up, it figured that even a 
short-term crisis, without a war, would cost Bangladesh from $1.5 billion to $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis is proving once again the hard lesson that the Third World 
learned during the oil crises of the 1970s: When the rich get a little poorer, 
the poor get much poorer. 
</P>
<P>
At times of world crisis, the most impoverished nations in the world find 
themselves paying higher prices for oil. They are forced to move ever further 
into the future their slim hopes for paying off their international debts. 
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh cannot afford the luxurious, tree-lined surroundings of Washington's 
Embassy Row. Its embassy in Washington is perched on the third floor of a 
functional office and residential complex, just above the Gold Star Cleaners 
and the A &amp; A Fine Wine &amp; Spirits. Inside, Ambassador A. H. S. Ataul 
Karim and his staff of 15 spend their days trying to find the money and 
resources to keep their homeland afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Before the gulf crisis, Karim admits, he and other Bangladeshi officials had 
hoped that the end of the Cold War would bring about a series of changes that 
might benefit the poorest nations in the world. There might be some sort of 
worldwide peace dividend, he thought. "If the world spent less on armaments, 
there may be more for development." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, that was only a fond hope. 
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had been working hard to promote an international meeting known as 
the United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, the first session 
of its kind in nearly a decade. Its purpose would be to draw attention to and, 
perhaps, some new financial help for what are called the LDCs -- the least 
developed countries in the world, those at the very bottom of the heap. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. conference began Sept. 3, just a month after the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait. And delegates from the LDCs quickly found that the gulf crisis had 
wrecked whatever chance they had of getting more economic help. 
</P>
<P>
A delegate from Saudi Arabia bluntly warned that there would be less Arab aid 
available for the poorest nations. The Iraqi invasion had wiped out any 
possibility of money from Kuwait, he noted, and Saudi Arabia would be required 
to pay billions of dollars toward the cost of multinational troops in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Richard McCormack, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, told the 
conference that the United States would resist committing itself to a specific 
target for aid to the poorest nations. The most important factor, McCormack 
said, was not the level of aid but having "democratic, accountable governments 
and market-based economies." 
</P>
<P>
At midpoint in the conference, Iraq's Saddam Hussein publicly offered the 
poorest nations free oil -- so long as they could collect it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein apparently intended his offer as little more than a joke and a 
political ploy. However, officials from the poorest nations, desperate for 
cheap oil, took Hussein's offer literally -- and were outraged by it. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you bring the oil back through a blockade?" asked Thomas Chery, Haiti's 
delegate. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Saddam Hussein not know before that we needed oil?" asked Botswana's 
representative, F. G. Mogae. "If he wanted to help developing countries, he 
should not have attacked (Kuwait) in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Consequences 
</P>
<P>
What Next Around the World 
</P>
<P>
Look for: 
</P>
<P>
More discussion about cooperation in regional conflicts by the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
More support for the United Nations Security Council by the Soviet Union, which 
has learned that a stronger U.N. can help them. 
</P>
<P>
China's return to more normalized relations with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
More testiness in the U.S.-Japan relationship. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis is hardly four months old, but already it has troubled 
Americans in special ways, making them a people anxious about war -- the people 
in the 4400 block of North Oakland Avenue, for instance, in Shorewood, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
There, along a strip of storefront offices, is the Military Families Support 
network -- a group of unlikely foot soldiers in this country's reawakening 
peace movement. Hardly political radicals, these are solid Middle Americans. 
Even their headquarters bespeaks the heartland. Tucked in alongside a 
picture-framing shop and a tanning salon, it is flanked by a bank and a 
barbershop. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a tangle of wires and stacks of mail, conservatively dressed and mostly 
middle-aged men and women staff telephones, fax machines and personal 
computers. Far from the college students who first protested the Vietnam War, 
they are the parents and wives of soldiers -- like Alex Molnar, founder of the 
group, who has a Marine son in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
They do not want their children -- or their husbands -- to risk their lives in 
a conflict whose rationale they either oppose or find troublingly obscure. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Judy Davenport in Charleston, S.C. Her husband, Larry, is a boiler 
technician chief on a Navy ship in the Middle East. Judy, 39, and her youngest 
son, an eighth-grader, live in military housing at the Naval Weapons Base in 
Goose Creek, S.C. She drives a pickup truck. Painted on the back window are the 
words: "No War." It gets her and her son a ration of grief. They have been 
ostracized. 
</P>
<P>
"We support our troops no matter what," she declares. "They took an oath to 
defend our country and uphold the Constitution. But they didn't take an oath to 
keep gasoline at $1.29 a gallon." 
</P>
<P>
Judy runs a temporary-employment business. Nonetheless, her husband's absence 
is a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
So is opposition to her activities. Officials at the weapons base have told her 
to quit giving interviews on military property. 
</P>
<P>
Harassment is a hardship, too. Sometimes it comes when the going gets toughest. 
</P>
<P>
But she tries to buck up. "It hasn't been too bad -- just some 
middle-of-the-night nasty phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
There is a tiny note of scorn in her voice reserved for college students, who 
were at the forefront of the anti-war movement during Vietnam but are hardly 
heard from now. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd see a different reaction," she snaps, "if they were draftable." 
</P>
<P>
As for the telephone calls and the military who will not let her speak on her 
husband's base, she is adamant. "My activities are my personal business," she 
says. "My husband's in the military to protect my freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
Some women who oppose war say their kin, far away in the Middle East, feel the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't oppose the multinational defensive role," says Tracy Meyer, a 
28-year-old Falls City, Neb., woman whose cousin is a U.S. commander in Saudi 
Arabia. But she and others criticize what they see as the Administration's 
absolute refusal to consider non-military alternatives until Iraq withdraws 
from Kuwait. They fear that President Bush has locked their husbands and their 
sons onto a course -- without sufficient public debate -- that will lead to a 
bloody conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer refuses to give the name of her cousin, the commander. She cites concern 
for his well-being. 
</P>
<P>
But she adds: "He feels the way I do." 
</P>
<P>
Nor are all of these dissenters women. Bill White in San Antonio, who flew 136 
missions over Vietnam and prosecutes narcotics cases in Bexar County, Tex., 
thinks Congress has been "laying behind the log." 
</P>
<P>
Congress, White said, should be challenging Bush to define and explain his 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to have an open debate and see where our objections are," 
White says. He has both a son and a daughter in the gulf region. "We started 
out in Vietnam approving the policy -- and then wound up condemning our troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not let that happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Like Bill White, Brenda Jarmon has two kin in the gulf: her daughter and her 
daughter's husband. Their names are Lynette and Isaac Guthrey, and they, too, 
have a daughter. She is one of a number of youngsters in America who are 
calling this crisis "mom's war." 
</P>
<P>
Because Lynette and Isaac are both in the Army, daughter Ikea, 2 1/2, has been 
shipped off to Tallahassee, Fla., to live with her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad when military mothers are taken away from their children and sent to 
a potential war zone," Brenda Jarmon says. 
</P>
<P>
"My granddaughter has the potential of losing both parents." 
</P>
<P>
Donnita Cole, too, is worried about war. 
</P>
<P>
She has festooned her modest home in Odessa, Tex., with yellow ribbons. Her son 
is an American soldier in Saudi Arabia; her husband is a human shield somewhere 
in Iraq. And she is about to defy her government by going to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, 48, wants to see her husband -- and hopes to gain his release. 
</P>
<P>
A 60-year-old oil field worker, he got trapped in Kuwait at the time of the 
Iraqi invasion. Donnita Cole and about a dozen other wives of hostages will 
travel in a group, undaunted by the President's admonition not to go because 
they might be used by the Iraqis for propaganda. Their feelings are clear. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's helping us," says Kim Edwards, 38, of Carson City, Nev., who is 
heading up the women's delegation. "And so we have to help ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In the Persian Gulf crisis, America has deployed an all-professional armed 
force for the first time in this century. 
</P>
<P>
Not a single U.S. serviceman in the Middle East is there because he has been 
drafted. And what is happening in the United States today reveals the domestic 
consequences that will follow from that fact in this and other situations to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
All-volunteer forces tend to attract people without other means to make a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, for instance, include a disproportionate 
number of young men and women from "a cross section of lower-middle class 
America," says Charles Moscos, a military manpower specialist at Northwestern 
University. This lower-middle class armed force is not only disproportionately 
poorer white, but also disproportionately black and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
More than 25% of last year's U.S. Army recruits, for example, were black -- 
about twice the percentage of blacks in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
Since the United States adopted its all-voluntary military force in 1973, more 
often than not the men and women who have joined have been like Ikea Guthrey's 
mother and father, lured by the promise of vocational training, educational 
benefits -- a chance to "be all you can be" and, maybe, escape from poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"When your kid signs up, you think it's a nice opportunity," says Brenda 
Jarmon, Ikea's grandmother and now her sole guardian. "I just never thought 
about this (combat) aspect of the military for Lynette. 
</P>
<P>
"Never once did anything like this cross my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Jarmon is not alone in her realization of the danger. A recent Los Angeles 
Times Poll showed that U.S. opposition to war in the Middle East was strongest 
at the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder. Fifty-eight percent of the 
respondents from American families with annual incomes of $20,000 or less said 
they did not want to see a war. 
</P>
<P>
That was a far larger percentage of opponents than from any other income group. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, far fewer blacks and Latinos than whites said the United 
States should wage war. When asked whether the United States "should go to war 
against Iraq," only 24% of the black respondents to the poll said yes. 
Thirty-two percent of the Latinos said yes, and 40% of the whites. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to war is playing a significant part in a precipitous decline in 
popular approval of Bush's handling of the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The President enjoyed an immediate increase in support during the first days 
after he sent troops to the Middle East. Most Americans traditionally back 
their commander-in-chief immediately after a foreign dust-up. What happens to 
that support, however, is what counts in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
It went into a sharp dive in early autumn. 
</P>
<P>
A Gallup Poll on Sept. 10 showed that support for Bush's handling of the crisis 
had fallen from a high of 80% in early August down to 76%. 
</P>
<P>
By Nov. 11, support had fallen to 61% 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Bush's general popularity rating had fallen from 76% to 58%. 
</P>
<P>
The drop is breathtaking, says Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips. 
"The sharpest decline anyone can remember without a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ON THE TRADING FLOOR 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wilner was shaving about 5 a.m. on Aug. 2 when a radio newscaster 
reported that Saddam Hussein's tanks had crossed the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
Shocked, the 35-year-old president of Hilltop Trading Co. dashed to the door of 
his Manhattan apartment. He grabbed the Wall Street Journal, then dialed the 
London markets, where he learned that oil prices had already soared to the 
maximum increase allowed in a day's trading. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I came to the trading floor, the floor was abuzz about it," he 
says of his arrival a few hours later at the New York Mercantile Exchange. "It 
was like you might imagine in a hurricane or a blackout. Everybody was asking 
each other: 'What's happening? Who's been hurt?' " 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars were riding on the answers to those questions. By the 
opening bell, the floor was a frenzy of shouting and shoving. At day's end, 
prices had jumped by $2.12 a barrel to $23.71, heading over $40 a barrel by the 
end of September. 
</P>
<P>
Like other commodities markets, this one is a fantasy, a casino for people who 
bet on future prices. Over and over, these traders -- "Wall Street refiners," 
they are called -- buy and sell barrels of crude without ever having to dip 
their tasseled loafers into oil field mud. What they own are paper promises to 
deliver 42-gallon barrels of a specific crude at a defined price on a certain 
date. 
</P>
<P>
But the paper promises have a very real effect on the world beyond. The oil 
futures market, which didn't even exist a decade ago, has revolutionized the 
system, unseating OPEC and the major oil companies as the dominant force in 
setting the price that consumers pay for gasoline and heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
Recent months have seen oil prices take a Mr. Toad's wild ride up and down. 
While economists like to speak of markets as efficient and orderly, the daily 
melee on the trading floor of a commodity market is anything but. 
</P>
<P>
Along with major world events, the strangest of rumors suddenly found eager 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
Hear that Hussein had dispatched a herd of "kamikaze camels" loaded down with 
weapons? Buy! That the Iraqi leader had fled his country dressed as a woman to 
open a pastry shop in France? Sell! Sell! 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices took their sharpest drop ever on news that Mohammed had come to 
Hussein in a dream and told him to turn his rockets around. 
</P>
<P>
Critics insist that retail prices, which have jumped more than 30 cents a 
gallon for gasoline and doubled for jet fuel, would not have soared so high 
during the gulf crisis if not for the futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts say the public is best served by the free and flexible markets 
that have transformed the delivery and pricing of energy in the 1980s. They say 
the key to preventing gas lines, rationing and shortages is making sure that 
buyers and sellers are free to sort out supply and demand without hinderance. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody blames the speculators," says David Wood, director of energy policy 
research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But it seems to me the 
market has played a really remarkable role in managing this supply 
interruption." 
</P>
<P>
The oil futures market was introduced in the early 1980s as a direct outgrowth 
of the breakdown of market control by the major oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
As long as prices were held artificially low, consumers had little incentive to 
conserve and oil companies had no reason to bring more fuel onto the market. 
The inevitable result: regional shortages, gasoline rationing and lines at the 
pump. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was President Carter's domestic policy adviser, 
concedes that failing early in the Carter Administration to urge the lifting of 
gasoline price controls was "maybe the most serious policy mistake that I made. 
If we had deregulated gasoline in 1979, there would have been no lines -- 
higher prices, but no lines." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Carter recognized the problem and began dismantling the oil-price 
regulations. One of Reagan's first acts in office in 1981 was to abolish the 
few oil-price controls that remained. From there on out, his approach was to 
let the market take care of the market. 
</P>
<P>
By reflecting fears, predictions, even hunches, today's futures markets help 
ensure a global balance of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who think the futures market should not be tampered with is William 
Hogan, a former energy official under the Ford Administration who is now at 
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," he says, "the optimal national policy is: 'Don't just do 
something. Stand there.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN HOUSTON, THE OIL CITY 
</P>
<P>
Oil built Houston. 
</P>
<P>
This is where George Bush, after striking it rich in the Midland oil fields of 
Texas, launched the political career that 30 years later led him to the White 
House. And this is where two oil price shocks in the 1970s, so disastrous to 
much of the rest of America, fueled a feverish, decade-long oil boom that 
produced thousands of instant millionaires and spread wealth like a gusher. 
</P>
<P>
Oil ruined Houston. 
</P>
<P>
When the boom finally collapsed in the mid-1980s, as prices plunged to as low 
as $10 a barrel, the dreams of this area's more than 3 million people turned 
into nightmares. The downtown skyline of empty office towers stood as a mocking 
monument to failed hopes. Its banks fell into outsiders' hands. This was where 
the nation's $500-billion savings and loan disaster had its ignominious start. 
</P>
<P>
So it was perfectly apt that this still-crippled city, just beginning to stir 
from its economic devastation, was where OPEC Secretary General Subroto came 
last Feb. 6 to deliver a message that most of the world ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Standing before a conference of 500 energy executives, the Indonesian oil 
minister warned that demand for OPEC oil was rising faster than the cartel 
could deliver it. Sure, the oil was out there, with big new discoveries 
boosting known OPEC reserves to their highest levels in decades. But the 
world's appetite for oil also was growing again; without an investment of a 
staggering $60 billion in new production capacity, the Organization of 
Petroleum ExportingCountries would lack the pipelines, refineries and tankers 
to transform crude oil into gasoline, jet fuel, heating oil and other petroleum 
products. That meant OPEC and other oil exporters around the globe simply could 
not meet the demands of ever-thirstier consumers. 
</P>
<P>
If everything ran smoothly, of course, prices would edge up gradually. But the 
slightest disruption in oil supply, Subroto warned, could mean a full-scale 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
With all the world's oil producers already pumping at dangerously high levels, 
there was no room for a slip-up. As leading energy analyst Daniel Yergin, 
president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, puts it, the complex system 
that delivers petroleum from oil wells on the other side of the globe to 
gasoline pumps around the corner had become "accident prone." Moreover, oil 
itself, Yergin notes, "more than any other commodity, is intimately intertwined 
with nationalism and national power, subject to political and military 
struggles for its control." 
</P>
<P>
Not content to wait for an accident, Saddam Hussein prepared the snare that 
would create the world's third -- and by far its worst -- oil supply 
interruption. 
</P>
<P>
But this time it would be different. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, America has been forced to give up its fantasy of energy 
independence. It now confronts the future much more realistically -- but with a 
renewed sense of dread. It is a future that holds dwindling oil reserves 
outside the Middle East and a growing concentration of production in a few 
vulnerable countries within that perpetually unstable region. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the immediate confrontation with Saddam Hussein will not mark 
the last such challenge for Americans, whose economy runs on oil. 
</P>
<P>
With the United States the biggest hog at the energy trough, the first 
challenge will be to use energy more efficiently -- and to boost the 
availability of North America's vast supplies of natural gas. Another will be 
to help insulate the economy from the worst ravages of the sudden oil price 
hikes that have struck the world three times in the past 20 years -- and now 
are as inevitable as earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
By many measures, the Persian Gulf crisis has triggered the most spectacular 
oil shock the world has seen since World War II. The international embargo of 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil has taken more than 4 million barrels a day, or roughly 
8% of total output, off the world market. That's more than half again as big as 
the disruption that occurred during the 1979 Iranian revolution and more than 
the amount lost in 1973, when the Arab countries imposed an embargo during 
their war with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, prices shot to record highs, not so much because of actual 
shortages, but on fears that war in Saudi Arabia could lead to chaos if the 
world's most important oil fields were destroyed. The price explosion almost 
certainly helped push an already shaky U.S. economy over the brink into its 
first recession in almost eight years. 
</P>
<P>
But in crucial ways, the adjustment this time has gone much more smoothly than 
during past oil crises. There have been no shortages, no 1970s-style lines at 
the gas pump. Prices at gasoline stations jumped sharply, but for all the 
complaints of oil company price gouging, the increase was not nearly as much as 
consumers might have expected from speculative levels of more than $40 a barrel 
on the crude oil market. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, compared with what consumers were paying a decade ago, oil is still a 
bargain. Taking into account the reduced buying power of today's inflated 
dollar, gasoline prices would have to reach almost $2 a gallon before they 
would hit driver's pocketbooks as hard as they did in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons that the country has made a relatively easy 
adjustment to what would have been a paralyzing crisis only eight years ago. 
But every bit of good news underscores the difficulties ahead. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the easier adjustment is that major discoveries have bolstered 
the world's oil reserves, reassuring most industry officials that any sharp 
price increase is likely to be temporary. Just five years ago, it was believed 
that world reserves could last only another 34 years; now that estimate is up 
to a half-century. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all those new supplies, however, are in the Middle East. Elsewhere, 
reserves are dwindling, particularly in the United States. In the early 1950s, 
America pumped more than half of all the oil consumed on Earth. Now the United 
States needs to import about 7.5 million barrels a day to meet just half of its 
own demand. 
</P>
<P>
While no big fields have been found outside the Persian Gulf since the early 
1970s, Saudi Arabia continues to stumble upon new oil finds with disarming 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
"They look for water there and they find oil," says William Hogan of the 
Kennedy School of Government. "As far into the future as anyone can see, the 
world's industrial powers are going to be dependent on oil from the Middle 
East." 
</P>
<P>
A second reason for the easier adjustment is that consumers and businesses are 
using oil far more wisely. This country uses only two-thirds as much oil as it 
once did for every dollar it generates in gross national product. Without those 
savings, the United States would be burning 23 million barrels every day, 
rather than the roughly 17 million it now consumes. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison, for example, relied on oil for 46% of its 
generating power in 1975 and once expected to be using up to 100 million 
barrels of oil a year by the mid-1980s. Instead, the power company now burns 
less than 5 million barrels even in the worst years and depends on oil for at 
most 4% of its needs. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the prices of some forms of energy no longer are tied closely to 
oil prices. The costs of electricity and natural gas, for instance, have barely 
budged despite the spike in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, consumers and businesses have backslid in the past few years. With 
only 2% of the planet's population consuming a quarter of its oil, the United 
States still uses up about twice as much energy to produce a dollar's worth of 
goods or services as Western Europe or Japan. They tax gasoline heavily and 
encourage conservation through a variety of other means. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, what the gulf crisis has proved is that there is no such thing as 
cheap oil. In the future, the price for inexpensive, abundant energy could be 
human life itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The hidden cost of cheap energy," says Unocal Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier, 
"is the military option." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN THE OIL FIELDS 
</P>
<P>
Along the hilly western rim of Kern County, Calif., more and more oil pumps are 
bobbing up and down these days, like big, clumsy birds. 
</P>
<P>
"People are starting to put their equipment back to work," Bakersfield oilman 
Rod Nahama says. "You only have to go out to the oil fields to see that things 
are happening." 
</P>
<P>
Just last spring, Nahama shut down 20 wells in McKittrick, 35 miles west of 
Bakersfield. Even in good times, the thick, tarry crude -- a stone won't sink 
in it in cold weather -- was hardly the champagne of petroleum. And when prices 
plunged below $10 a barrel, he started losing money. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed when prices soared following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
Nahama started the 20 wells up again -- plus three more. The McKittrick 
property now yields 100 barrels a day -- and Nahama may bring several more 
wells on line by year's end. Nonetheless, he doubts that today's higher prices 
will be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
In Parachute, Colo., "For Sale" signs sprout among the weeds in the vacant lots 
and on the fronts of faded buildings. Yet within a 100-mile radius of this 
down-and-out little town lie riches beyond measure -- more oil than in the 
entire Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, when almost everyone was expecting $100-a-barrel oil before 
the end of the century, Parachute and nearby Rifle were boom towns. But the oil 
is locked in rock known as oil shale -- and no one ever came up with a way to 
retrieve it at a price that would generate a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Dave Beasley did all right running a gift shop, until a highway bypass 
was built back in 1982. One month, the only business he got was a $200 bad 
check from someone leaving town. So he closed up and moved closer to the 
traffic. He started selling cider from an empty lot across from the access 
ramp. 
</P>
<P>
People wondered if things would pick up when Iraq invaded Kuwait. But ordinary 
oil, climb though it did, remained cheaper than Parachute oil. Beasley went on 
selling cider. 
</P>
<P>
These are mere stirrings. Barring a catastrophe in the Middle East, there will 
be no huge domestic oil rush -- or any rush to develop domestic oil or 
alternative forms of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the oil that is left in the United States is difficult and costly to 
extract. The average well in the United States produces only 15 barrels a day, 
compared with an average of 9,000 for each Saudi well. Even the giant Prudhoe 
Bay field in Alaska is slowly petering out. 
</P>
<P>
With only one truly promising oil province remaining to be explored -- the 
environmentally sensitive Alaskan Natural Wildlife Refuge -- the United States, 
at best, can only hope to maintain its current production of about 7 million 
barrels a day. Big increases seem to be unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the alternatives to oil propounded in the 1970s went against the grain 
of the Reagan Administration's philosophy: Let markets work without the hand of 
government giving them a push. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1980s, the Reagan Administration had all but killed the federal 
government's programs to develop synthetic fuels, solar energy and other oil 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The future for synthetic fuels looks no better now than it did then. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, with oil prices hovering above $30 a barrel, alternative energy 
sources -- schemes that may have seemed the wisest of investments only a few 
years ago -- look like folly. 
</P>
<P>
The battered nuclear power industry, too, shows no signs of rising from the 
mat. 
</P>
<P>
Few experts think the gulf crisis can overcome the public mistrust of nuclear 
power that had begun taking shape long before the harrowing 1979 accident at 
Three Mile Island. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is difficult for utilities to justify the huge investments 
necessary for the big central power stations powered by nuclear energy -- 
stations that take a decade to build. At the same time, a fast-growing 
independent power industry that barely existed a few years ago is able to 
build, in a mere two or three years, more reliable and less costly generators 
that rely on natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long run, electric cars hold out one of the few promises of making a 
dent in oil usage. Seen today as primarily a clean-air alternative to 
gasoline-driven cars, electric automobiles may be able to start competing on 
more equal economic terms late in the decade if current plans to produce them 
in quantity pan out. 
</P>
<P>
Batteries can be charged at night, when demand for electricity is lowest. 
Southern California Edison, for example, estimates that it could supply the 
power for roughly 1 million electric vehicles without having to add to its 
current capacity. 
</P>
<P>
But it will take more than the gulf crisis to put electric cars on Southern 
California freeways. 
</P>
<P>
So far, its only legacy is disruption and a deep disquiet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Consequences 
</P>
<P>
What Next on the Home Front 
</P>
<P>
Look for: 
</P>
<P>
More restive worry about oil prices, more pressure to bring energy prices down. 
</P>
<P>
A higher-profile anti-war movement. 
</P>
<P>
More political pressure for diplomatic alternatives.

Three of four South Bay teams won coin flips Saturday allowing them to play at 
home for next week's CIF-Southern Section semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In Division VIII, second-seeded Morningside will face South Bay nemesis 
Temecula Valley at Sentinel Field in Inglewood and surprising Palos Verdes will 
meet top-seeded Cabrillo of Lompoc at North Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula Valley has advanced to the semifinals with victories over Rolling 
Hills and West Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
In Division VII, top-seeded Serra will be at home against Arroyo Grande in a 
rematch of a 1989 playoff game. The Cavaliers needed a last-minute touchdown to 
beat Arroyo Grande, 32-25, in the quarterfinals last year. It turned out to be 
their closest call on the way to the Division VII title. 
</P>
<P>
All area teams will play Friday night, except Hawthorne. The Cougars lost their 
flip and will face St. Paul in a Division III semifinal Saturday night at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KNOCKOUT PUNCH 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza running back Jarod Smith shredded the Leuzinger defense Friday night. 
He ran through it. He ran around it. Most of all, though, he smashed the 
Olympians' spirit. 
</P>
<P>
And all he needed was a play. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger had just completed what might have been its most impressive drive of 
the season. Taking the second-half kickoff, the Olympians marched 80 yards in 
16 playas to score on a seven-yard run by quarterback Gary Mumin. 
</P>
<P>
It pulled Leuzinger within three points, 10-7, of the top-seeded Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
But on Esperanza's first play from scrimmage following the kickoff, Smith got 
it all back. He burst through the line and scored on a 66-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
So, after taking nearly nine minutes to score, Leuzinger watched as Smith wiped 
it out in a matter of seconds. The Olympians never recovered, going on to lose, 
31-7, in the CIF Division III quarterfinals at Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that hurt 'em pretty bad," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. "They drove 
the ball down 80 yards on us and physically got after us. We were in shock. Not 
too many people do that to us. And then when Jarod broke that run, that just 
broke their back. If they would have stopped us on that next series, then I 
think they would have been in the ball game." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them off the hook," he said. "I thought when we scored, we may have 
gotten some momentum back. But when (Smith) popped that one, that hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who finished with 278 yards in 16 carries, went on to score two more 
touchdowns, including a 71-yard run with seven seconds left to play. He had 
four carries in the second half for 159 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help that Leuzinger's best defensive player, linebacker Manny 
Gonzalez, was hobbled with a sprained ankle that hindered his mobility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
(SEMI)FINAL FOUR 
</P>
<P>
All four of Leuzinger's losses this season came against teams advancing to the 
CIF semifinals: Paramount (12-0, Division II), Canyon of Canyon Country (11-1, 
Division I), Hawthorne (10-2, Division III) and Esperanza (12-0). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'AN EXPLOSION' 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, as it has frequently this season, benefited from the big play 
Friday night in a 32-14 Division VIII quarterfinal victory over Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 14-13 early in the fourth quarter, the Monarchs took control with two 
quick touchdowns on a 42-yard punt return by Kenny Birdine and a 45-yard run by 
quarterback Stais Boseman. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little explosion," Morningside Coach Ron Tatum said. "That's a good 
term for it -- an explosion." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, it was the explosive running ability of Boseman that did the most 
damage. The rangy 6-foot-3 sophomore carried the ball 18 times for 142 yards 
and two touchdowns and passed for another TD. 
</P>
<P>
"Stais runs the option extremely well," Tatum said. "Once those legs pick up, 
that boy can get out there. That stride makes a big difference. That separates 
him from the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Morningside is capable of winning the division title, Tatum said: "I 
believe we need to work on our passing. But if we get that improved and our 
running continues to do the job like it did tonight, we should be on course." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GETTING DEFENSIVE 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne rallied for 17 points in the fourth quarter Friday night to pull out 
a 17-9 Division III quarterfinal victory over Loara in Anaheim, but Coach Goy 
Casillas gave most of the credit to his defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense played its best game of the year," he said. "We had two nice 
goal-line stands." 
</P>
<P>
Casillas singled out linebackers Troy Fain and Danda Goodnight for their 
exceptional play. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars figure to need another strong defensive effort Saturday night, when 
they meet St. Paul in the semifinals at Cerritos College. The Swordsmen have 
given up only 15 points in two playoff games, and routed Beverly Hills, 42-7, 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIR JUDY 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes, among the South Bay's weaker passing teams during the regular 
season, suddenly is airing it out in the Division VIII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Tim King completed nine of 18 passes for 193 yards Friday night in 
a 21-7 victory over Bloomington at North Torrance High to give him 388 yards 
passing in two playoff games. He threw for only 428 yards in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
What's made the difference? 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving him pass protection and his arm is fine now," Coach Bill Judy 
said. "He had some shoulder problems around midseason. Now he's fine. He has no 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line has contributed to King's health. In two playoff games, he 
has yet to be sacked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TURNAROUND 
</P>
<P>
Kudos to Mira Costa Coach Larry Petrill and his staff for another fine job. 
</P>
<P>
When Petrill took over the Mustang program in 1989, the team was coming off a 
1-9 season. In the two years since then, Mira Costa has posted back-to-back 
winning records (6-5 and 6-5-1) and reached the playoffs twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs lost in the first round last year and went a game farther this 
season, losing in the Division VIII quarterfinals to Cabrillo of Lompoc, 14-10, 
Friday night. Mira Costa led top-seeded Cabrillo at halftime, 10-0, but gave up 
two fourth-quarter touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WEST'S WOES 
</P>
<P>
The final three minutes of the second quarter proved to be West Torrance's 
undoing Friday night in a 31-17 Division VIII quarterfinal loss to visiting 
Temecula Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A fumbled kickoff at the West 14-yard line led to a quick Temecula Valley 
touchdown and a 24-10 lead with 2:40 left in the half. Then, after West drove 
to the Temecula Valley two, the Warriors were stopped short of the end zone on 
four consecutive running plays by running back Alex Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
"The second quarter killed us," co-Coach Mark Knox said. "That was the 14-point 
difference right there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Serra quarterback-linebacker Alex Marcellin suffered a sprained ankle in the 
third quarter of a 34-6 victory over La Mirada and did not return. He was 
assisted from the field after the game and is questionable for Friday's game 
against Arroyo Grande. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
* Serra defeated La Mirada, 34-6, to extend its winning streak to 24 games 
overall and six games in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
* Morningside defeated Torrance, 32-14, for its eighth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
* Palos Verdes defeated Bloomington, 21-7, for its third consecutive victory 
after it had lost four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Torrance receiver-defensive back Antone Williamson, on his team's 32-14 loss to 
Morningside: "They're just a quick team. They can break one in a second. They 
broke a couple of tackles and exploded. Speed conquers." 
</P>
<P>
 Morningside receiver-defensive back Kenny Birdine, on his 42-yard punt return 
for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter that gave the Monarchs a 19-14 
lead: "I was thinking end zone . . . I saw an opening right away. Nobody 
covered real hard, so that gave me some space to do what I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Coach Bill Judy, on defensive tackle Charlie Hitchcock, who had 
three of the team's nine sacks in a 21-7 victory over Bloomington: "He was in 
the backfield like a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes, on a roughing-the-punter penalty that kept alive 
an Esperanza scoring drive early in the fourth quarter: "That just wiped us 
out." 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance co-Coach Mark Knox, after his team's 31-17 loss to Temecula 
Valley: "We played hard and had a good year, although there were a couple of 
disappointments. We would have liked to have beaten Torrance and we'd like to 
be playing next week." ROB FERNAS and DAVID RAATZ

BIAS CASE ENHANCED TRIBBLE'S DRUG CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acquitted three years ago on charges he supplied the cocaine that killed 
University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias, Brian Lee Tribble didn't feel 
chastened. Or lucky. By all accounts, Tribble walked away feeling invincible. 
</P>
<P>
He was a headliner at East Side, a now-defunct Southwest Washington club, where 
the taped telephone message said, "Every Tuesday, you're invited to a dance 
party with Brian Tribble." 
</P>
<P>
Last July, he was mobbed at his 10-year high school reunion by classmates who 
wanted to be photographed with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly every time I turned around, he was having his picture taken again," 
said Fred Hammond, a fellow member of McKinley High School's class of 1980. "He 
left with a stack of Polaroids in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
Old classmates weren't the only ones seeking Tribble's time. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Len Bias case, Tribble really came up in the drug world," said 
Veronica Baker, a federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug dealers thought he was safe -- he was a dealer who wouldn't turn. He had 
people calling from all over the country to make deals." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 6, Tribble was arrested and subsequently pleaded guilty to conspiracy 
to distribute cocaine. Law enforcement agents call him a major Washington area 
drug supplier and attribute that career development, ironically, to the 
national publicity surrounding the death of Bias, the promising young 
All-America forward. 
</P>
<P>
Tribble's conviction puts this final twist on the Bias case, say those who knew 
him: The man who most likely could have been scared straight by the episode 
instead came away with his popularity and his credibility among drug suppliers 
wildly enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents are uncertain when Tribble began selling drugs, but his lawyer, 
Thomas C. Morrow, maintains it did not happen until after the Bias case. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression was that, pre-Bias, he was not really much involved in drugs at 
all, except for recreational use," Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Tribble's big break apparently came a year after the Bias verdict, 
when he went to Miami and made an important drug connection. 
</P>
<P>
After that, he essentially was a wholesaler who sold cocaine in large 
quantities rather than packaging it for street sales, a federal law enforcement 
source said. It was an approach that lowered Tribble's profits somewhat, but 
also reduced his risks. 
</P>
<P>
"He would get three kilos for 20 grand apiece, and he had buyers for them for 
25 grand apiece," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
But what really allowed Tribble to move into the top echelons of the drug 
trade, according to his lawyer and law enforcement officials, was the cachet 
his name acquired from the Bias case. 
</P>
<P>
"People were willing to front him large quantities of cocaine and he could pay 
later," the DEA's Baker said. "The Len Bias thing . . . made drug dealers have 
more respect for him and in his own mind, he was maybe accused wrongfully and 
he had beat it." 
</P>
<P>
"After (the Bias incident) is when I started to hear more about Brian Tribble 
and his lifestyle," said Hammond, who knew Tribble in high school but only 
peripherally afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"People would say, 'I saw Brian Tribble; he was driving a 450 SL or he was 
driving a Nissan 300ZX; he must be doing pretty well.' " Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
Many young people in Tribble's old Northeast Washington neighborhood think 
Tribble was accused wrongly and speak of him, in the same breath with D.C. 
Mayor Marion Barry, as a kind of martyr to a white conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
"They figure, 'We spent too much money on him once, we've got to get him 
somehow,' " said a man in the playground of Woodridge Elementary school, who 
said he knew Tribble well and did not want his name used. "This arrest was a 
setup." 
</P>
<P>
The man did not deny Tribble's involvement in drugs, but said "he was not that 
big a dealer, he was out here struggling like the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Tribble is being held in a jail in Maryland, pending a January sentencing, DEA 
officials said. He faces a minimum of 10 years without parole under federal 
sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials said Tribble is being protected while they question him about 
other drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligent, popular, fashion-model handsome, the first child to go to college 
from a good family in a modest neighborhood of well-kept houses in Northeast 
Washington, Tribble seemed to have a lot going for him. 
</P>
<P>
"His life should not have been so disheveled and disruptive as it was," said 
James McMullen, a physics teacher at McKinley High School, which Tribble 
attended from 1976 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Tribble's mother, Loretta, helped lend her son much of whatever credibility he 
had during the Bias trial. 
</P>
<P>
She told any reporter who would listen that then-Prince George's County State's 
Attorney Arthur A. "Bud" Marshall Jr. was exploiting the incident for political 
gain. She spoke of setting up a "Brian Tribble Defense Fund." She steadfastly 
declared that her son was a victim. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she says "she doesn't consider him a victim of anything but his own 
stupidity," Morrow said. Reached at home last week, she said, "I don't want any 
part" of another story on her son. 
</P>
<P>
That Loretta Tribble and her husband, Thomas, are now silent comes as no 
surprise to those who were close to the family during the trial. The couple 
view the 1986 incident, Morrow said, "as Brian being given a new lease on life 
and being born again." 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing they could possibly imagine is this deja vu situation," he 
said. "When she heard, she was shocked, just devastated." 
</P>
<P>
It was natural that on the night of June 18, 1986, after Len Bias learned of 
his selection by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the National 
Basketball Association draft, he would celebrate with Brian Tribble. Although 
Tribble had dropped out of the University of Maryland, he still hung around the 
College Park campus. Tribble and Bias had developed an easy friendship, friends 
said, sharing interests in basketball, music and the club scene. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Tribble, according to police, who called them panic-stricken when 
Bias began going into convulsions from the cocaine in the early hours of June 
19. 
</P>
<P>
As the case evolved, it took on larger proportions, calling into question 
Bias's character, the conduct of the State's Attorney's Office and the 
integrity of the university's athletic department. But the focus of the furor 
remained Tribble, cast alternately as a Mephistopheles who enticed Bias and his 
teammates into drug abuse or an innocent bystander in a tragic accident 
involving a famous man. 
</P>
<P>
Tribble admitted in a television interview after the trial to 
"recreational-type usage" of cocaine and to taking drugs with Bias on the 
morning he died, but he and defense attorneys were adamant in their denial that 
he had supplied the cocaine that killed Bias. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI kept tabs on Tribble after the verdict and began building a case 
against him, law enforcement sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The final stroke came last summer, sources said, after DEA agents arrested a 
Bahamian citizen who had arrived at Dulles International Airport on a flight 
from Miami with four kilograms of cocaine -- drugs he was delivering, he said, 
to Tribble. 
</P>
<P>
A sting operation was set up in a hotel parking lot in New Carrollton in which 
a Tribble supplier, cooperating with federal agents, arranged by telephone to 
sell him 8.8 pounds of cocaine for about $100,000. When agents moved in for the 
arrest, Tribble fled, first by car, then on foot. He turned himself in Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
In pleading guilty last month, Tribble acknowledged that he and a loose group 
of associates sold more than 110 pounds of cocaine over an 18-month period, 
making hundreds of thousands of dollars. At one point, he was selling as much 
as 22 pounds a month, according to prosecutors, who called him a central figure 
in a major Washington area drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
Most people who recall Tribble as a youth say he was smart. A woman who 
baby-sat with him, Flora Hill, described him as "very polite." At the time of 
his arrest, shocked teachers at the schools he attended said he was articulate 
and a good, though not exceptional, student. "He was," said May Wright 
Covington, a former typing teacher, "the kind of son you would want." 
</P>
<P>
Tribble's father, a drummer who traveled on the jazz circuit under the name 
"TNT," later operated a small furniture repair business. His mother was a 
teacher and took care of his sister, Priscilla, who is mentally retarded and 
prone to seizures. Tribble has another sister, Gloria, and a brother, Tom Jr., 
who was convicted in 1988 on drug and weapon charges. 
</P>
<P>
Tribble worked during college as a warehouse laborer, mail handler and clerk at 
Howard University Hospital, and played basketball when he cold. Although he 
loved the game, participated in Boys Club tournaments and played on the high 
school's junior varsity team. Tribble was known more for his enthusiasm than 
for his promise. 
</P>
<P>
"He was more interested in the cheerleaders than the team," classmate Deitra 
Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't someone like Tribble, with his personality, wits and family, make 
it? 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew the answer to that," McMullen said. "How does this happen to a 
kid so early? For a physics teacher, it's a strange thing to say, but all I can 
think of is, the seed went bad; the devil got him."
