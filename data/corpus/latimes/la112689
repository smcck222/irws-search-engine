When Bernard Malamud died in March, 1986, he was hard at work on a new novel. 
Entitled "The People," it was to tell the unlikely story of a Jewish immigrant, 
a peddler, who becomes chief of an Indian tribe. At the time of his death, the 
author had nearly completed a first draft of the book. Now Robert Giroux, 
Malamud's longtime and only editor, as well as friend and one of his literary 
executors, has combined this unfinished novel with 16 short stories. The latter 
span the years 1943 to 1985, and five of them are published here for the first 
time. While the result is uneven, it provides a fascinating testament to 
Malamud's complex and ingenious creativity. 
</P>
<P>
In "The People," the hero, Yozip, is making his way across the Pacific 
Northwest some time after the Civil War. Through peculiar circumstances, he is 
noticed and recognized by the chief of an Indian tribe as the one man who can 
argue the Indians' cause with the American government. Although he fails in his 
diplomatic efforts, Yozip is nevertheless chosen to succeed the old chief upon 
the latter's death. 
</P>
<P>
When a decree of exile comes, Yozip -- now renamed Jozip -- elects not to fight 
(he is a pacifist and a vegetarian) and instead attempts to lead the tribe to 
safety in Canada. The gamble fails and, at the point where Malamud's narrative 
breaks off, Jozip has surrendered and the Indians, moaning with grief, have 
been loaded onto freight cars headed for their new place of incarceration. 
Malamud's notes for the subsequent chapters of the novel show Jozip pursuing a 
degree in law, so that he can help the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly -- disguise and mythic trappings notwithstanding -- "The People" is 
some sort of comment on Jewish history. The original chief is called Joseph, 
the novel was to end with a " 'Hasidic' dance of the recovered self," Jozip 
never forgets his Eastern European roots. Even the freight cars resonate with 
Jewish persecution. Jozip wrestles in his sleep and is given a new name, much 
like the Biblical Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
The character in Jewish history whose position Jozip's most resembles, however, 
is Moses: the outsider, if Freud is correct; the reluctant leader; the 
inarticulate, peaceable man who must fight his own people to make them pursue 
the proper path. Jozip even finds an Aaron in young Indian Head, who becomes 
his grumbling mouthpiece and rival. But Moses has God to rely on, Jozip is on 
his own, save for an omen here and there. The old chief tells him to soften the 
U.S. Commissioner's heart, but Jozip cannot accomplish such a feat. Nor can he 
protect his people during their exodus. In the end, though he loves them, he is 
not their Moses. 
</P>
<P>
Is this novel an ironic comment on Jewish wandering? Perhaps, but there is more 
to it than that. Giroux tells us that Malamud routinely subjected his work to 
multiple rewritings. "The People," which lacked the benefit of this scrutiny, 
remains rough and sketchy, in marked contrast to the collected stories -- even 
the earliest ones. Jozip is rather more spare than he might ultimately have 
become. Still, there is enough in these pages to suggest that the author's 
final words concern his own literary and psychological struggle for 
self-expression. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, there is a superficial biographical resemblance: Malamud's 
parents were immigrants from Russia; and he himself made the trip from East to 
West Coast, residing for some years in Oregon, where, as an outsider, he 
researched the indigenous Nez Perce tribe. 
</P>
<P>
"The People" contains a deeper evocation, however, having to do with issues of 
voice, mission, responsibility, and self-revelation. The clearest hint appears 
in Malamud's notes for the completion of the book: "More on the business of 
language and making himself understood. What shall I say to them? Tell them who 
you are and what you've done with your life . . . Tell them what you found 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the question of language and comprehension plays a powerful, if subtle, 
role in the novel. Yozip the immigrant speaks English with a Yiddish accent, 
yet Chief Joseph cannot discern any irregularity in his pronunciation. 
Moreover, as Jozip, he speaks to his people in their language, which he has 
mastered to a remarkable degree. To the U.S. officials, however, what he says 
sounds like "Jew talk." 
</P>
<P>
In his notes for the novel, Malamud stated explicitly that he was seeking to 
recover a needed, presumably hidden, voice. With its mixture of tongues, 
nationalities, histories, even gods, "The People" represents the author's final 
grappling with the many, sometimes contradictory influences he had had to 
contend with in the attempt to balance his celebrity with the memory of all 
that had led him to it. Like Jozip, he may have felt that he could not rise to 
the ultimate occasion. Still, this volume reveals his continually integrative 
and inclusive process. His own words sum it up: "What does a writer need most? 
When I ask this question, I think of my father."

THE ART OF FLORENCE BY GLENN ANDRES, JOHN M. HUNISAK AND A. RICHARD TURNER;

The Art of Florence" is an extraordinarily handsome book, full of superb color 
plates taken especially for this publication, printed on fine, heavy paper, 
well bound and boxed. However, this is emphatically not a book intended to be 
seen only. "The Art of Florence" has a major text of impeccable and 
up-to-the-minute scholarship and, happily enough, it is written with great 
clarity and a minimum use of technical terminology. The text is not only full 
of information, but a joy to read. Its analyses of the various works of art are 
full of insights and comparisons that make it clear why Florence was in the 
forefront of the Renaissance. For anyone who loves Florence, Renaissance art 
and architecture, or fine book making, this work is worth every penny of its 
somewhat formidable price. 
</P>
<P>
The way the book is set up is particularly interesting and valuable. It is 
divided into sections historically, usually about a generation in length, 
opening in each case with a lucid account of the history of Florence for that 
period, stressing the political, social and economic events that play a major 
role in the patronage of art in that period. This is followed in each case by 
separate accounts of the architecture, sculpture and painting done in that 
period. It is a system that allows one to follow very clearly not only the way 
in which the arts are related to the history but also the ways in which they 
influence each other in a given period. In the cases of long-lived artists, 
their works may appear in two sections, a division that helps us to understand 
their development and stylistic changes. Since Florence was fairly small by our 
standards, with a population of under 100,000 through most of the period 
covered, the interplay between the arts and the constant awareness of exactly 
what was being done were particularly intense. 
</P>
<P>
This is a fresh approach. So many books deal with only one of the arts or only 
one artist that it is easy to lose sight of this rich and exciting interplay 
and particularly to lose sight of how all of it is constantly influenced by the 
events of the time. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone interested in cultural and intellectual history this book is a must. 
It gives an extraordinary immediacy to the particular climate in Florence that 
made it the artistic leader for all of Europe. Though three authors are 
involved, writing on their individual specialties, the tone of the book is 
remarkably uniform, arguing that they worked closely together and share similar 
points of view. 
</P>
<P>
The book restricts itself to dealing only with artists who are Florentine, or 
in a few cases who lived for some years in Florence, and only to those works by 
them that are now in Florence, so the concentration is always on the city and 
what can be seen there. There are, of course, references to other works, but 
they are minimal. For example, Michelangelo as a painter is discussed in terms 
of the Doni Madonna, the only painting by him in Florence. His work in the 
Sistine Chapel is mentioned, but only just. What is surprising and fascinating 
is how fully most of the artists can be discussed within those restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The period covered extends from the 13th Century to the beginning of the 17th, 
the period in which Florence is at its peak artistically and politically. The 
last monument it discusses is, fittingly enough, the massive, oppressively and 
richly gloomy Burial Chapel of the Medici Grand Dukes, begun at the beginning 
of the 17th Century and only completed in the 19th. Florence did not, of 
course, die with the Medici; but its days of unique creativity did, at least in 
the arts covered in this work. Within that long period, all of the major 
artists and architects are discussed in full detail with one rather odd 
exception: Piero di Cosimo is never mentioned at all, though there are enough 
works by that strange and rather enigmatic painter still in Florence to make it 
possible to have included him. Still, if that is the only oversight, the flaw 
is a small one in a book that covers so much so brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
There is a particular nicety in the production of the book that deserves 
special mention. The stunning color plates are gathered in groups scattered 
through the two volumes; but small black-and-white pictures of the works being 
analyzed appear in the margins of the text where they are discussed. The reader 
can follow very precisely what is being said and can then turn to the color 
plate for a fuller view, a system that is a boon and a delight to the reader. 
</P>
<P>
Works such as the painted interior of the dome of the cathedral of Florence 
were specially lit to be photographed for this work, which allows one to see 
what is there in a way you will never manage on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
I think it is only fair to add that the two volumes are among the heaviest I 
can think of. This is not a book to be read happily in bed, or even trying to 
hold on your lap. It has to be put on a desk or a very sturdy table in order to 
be read. A small robot to carry it around, say a cousin of R2D2, would have 
been a useful and happy addition to the package deal.

<P>
The 1986 TV movie Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry (Channel 9 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is 
another welcome step in consciousness-raising concerning the elderly. The key 
word is dignity, and Katharine Hepburn and Harold Gould have exactly that as a 
couple whose romance is being met by opposition. George Schaefer directed from 
James Prideaux's script. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Window (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is that Alfred Hitchcock classic in 
which James Stewart, laid up with a broken leg, witnesses a murder in the next 
building. Grace Kelly is his elegantly sexy leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
Top Gun (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the wildly popular 1986 picture, a 
male-bonding adventure that's both mind-boggling and vacuous. Allegedly based 
on the Navy's crack fighter pilot program at San Diego's Miramar Naval Base, it 
sucks us into a high-tech world of multimillion-dollar aircraft and 
hell-for-leather fliers. Tom Cruise is Maverick, an egotistical hotshot pilot; 
others involved are Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
In the new TV movie Blind Witness (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) Victoria Principal 
plays a blind woman obsessed with vengeance after intruders murder her husband. 
</P>
<P>
In one warming stroke Rocky (Channel 5 Monday at 7:30 p.m.) revived the 
tradition of the modestly budgeted movie that creates new stars (and new myths) 
and commands the arousing affection of its audiences by proclaiming the 
possibilities of love, hope and triumph in the lives of ordinary men and women 
-- a description that would never fit Sylvester Stallone's more recent efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Candles (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is an uneasy mix of the 
sympathetic and the synthetic, the raucous and the racist -- pity poor Gedde 
Watanabe, cast as a sex-starved exchange student. It also asks us to believe 
that an entire family would forget Molly Ringwald's 16th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
In the new TV movie Little White Lies (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) a policewoman (Ann 
Jillian) and a doctor (Tim Matheson) swap fibs on a flight to Rome, where 
romance blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky II (Channel 5 Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.) preserves the emotional wallop of 
"Rocky." It is better set up than most sequels because the original epic fight 
between Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) demanded a 
rematch. The film also works because Stallone, who has written and directed 
this film, knows the terrain -- the lows after the highs of phenomenal success. 
Talia Shire is the shy girl who becomes Mrs. Rocky Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
None of the "Police Academy" movies were funny after the hilarious original; 
the premise of the grim Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (CBS Tuesday at 9 
p.m.) involves training citizens at the Police Academy to serve as auxiliary 
corps. Steve Guttenberg stars. 
</P>
<P>
Three O'Clock High (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is an enjoyable 1987 
nightmare comedy about a hapless student (Casey Siemaszko) facing after-school 
extinction at the hands of a newly transferred psychopath (Richard Tyson), the 
leather-jacketed terror of every school he's ever attended. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Project (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a sophisticated yet 
hopelessly implausible suspense film in which a brilliant Ithaca teen-ager 
(Christopher Collet) builds his own atom bomb, triggering a major manhunt and 
bringing most of the northeastern United States close to annihilation. 
</P>
<P>
Director Hector Babenco and scenarist Leonard Schrader's profoundly moving film 
of Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) finds 
William Hurt's homosexual and Raul Julia's political prisoner stuck in the same 
Latin American jail cell, where Hurt's endless descriptions of a '40s movie are 
not always appreciated by Julia. As we enter that '40s movie, whose star is a 
slinky Sonia Braga, "Kiss of the Spider Woman" becomes a duel between two very 
different worlds, that of Hurt's campy imagination and the grimly real world of 
Julia, who nevertheless comes to respect Hurt's special brand of heroism. For 
his flamboyant yet touching performance, Hurt won an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Although tedious and stagnant, Perry Mason Returns (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 
p.m.), in which Raymond Burr's Mason comes to the rescue of his former 
secretary Della Street (Barbara Hale), was so popular as a two-hour movie it 
has led to a seemingly endless series of Perry Mason TV movies.

Of Human Bondage (Channel 28 Sunday at 2 p.m.): This is the 1934 film that once 
and for all made Bette Davis a star, playing Somerset Maugham's Mildred, the 
vulgar, cruel waitress who has only contempt for the gentle Leslie Howard, who 
loves her. (1:30) 
</P>
<P>
The Window (TNT Tuesday at 12:45 a.m.): This is the 1949 sleeper in which 
little Bobby Driscoll won a special Oscar as a boy who witnesses a murder but 
can't make his parents believe him. (1:30) 
</P>
<P>
The Palm Beach Story (Channel 5 Wednesday at 3:30 a.m.): One of the great 
Preston Sturges screwball classics, starring Claudette Colbert, Joel McCrea, 
Rudy Vallee and Mary Astor. (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
Rope (Channel 11 Thursday at 3:30 a.m.): Shot in 10-minute takes, Hitchcock's 
stunning and intense 1948 film was inspired by the Leopold and Loeb murder 
case. John Dall and Farley Granger are the spoiled young killers. James Stewart 
stars. (1:30)

As weekly viewers of "Murphy Brown" (we haven't missed an episode), we want to 
express our thanks to the producers and writers for having Fred Travalena as 
the guest star on the Oct. 30 show. His portrayal of Don Sarasota, the absolute 
worst lounge performer, was a classic. The prime-time exposure given Travalena 
was long overdue.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: PRIVATE DANCING; 
</P>
<P>
WITHIN A CIRCLE OF ANNA PAVLOVA DEVOTEES, AUNTIE RITA WAS A STAR

THIS IS A STORY about the last month or so in the life of an Englishwoman who 
died recently at the age of 92. It has nothing to do with the Southern 
California scene, but it is so upbeat that I think its appeal may be universal. 
</P>
<P>
The story is told in a letter from an English friend, Kay Donovan, to Sue 
Schafrath of Santa Monica, about Donovan's great-aunt, Auntie Rita Samson. 
</P>
<P>
"She was 92 on her last birthday," Kay Donovan wrote, "so she had a good, long 
life, and the last month was a very exciting one for her." 
</P>
<P>
(Kay and Sue were best friends in Purley, Surrey, until 1976, when they were 14 
and Sue's family moved to California.) 
</P>
<P>
Auntie Rita lived in Exeter, Devon, and she had seen a notice in the Exeter 
Express and Echo asking any persons who remembered anything about the 
celebrated Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova, who died in 1931 at the age of 46, 
to write in, even if they had only seen her dance. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the best letter about Pavlova would receive two tickets to "A 
Portrait of Anna Pavlova," to be danced by Ballet Creations at the nearby 
Teignmouth Carlton Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Auntie Rita had not only seen Pavlova dance, but as a young ballerina, Auntie 
Rita had actually danced with her. She wrote a letter about their experiences, 
describing the clothes Pavlova wore and the places they had danced. (Pavlova 
had come out of St. Petersburg (Leningrad) to conquer the capitals of Western 
Europe.) 
</P>
<P>
The judges were incredulous. None of them had expected to hear from anyone who 
even knew the famous dancer personally, much less danced with her. Auntie 
Rita's letter was judged the best. 
</P>
<P>
"They were so interested that they wanted to meet her, so Richard Slaughter and 
his wife, Ursula Hageli (former stars of the Royal Ballet), and the company's 
ballet master all went to Auntie Rita's house. The newspapers went and took 
pictures. She made the headlines. Showed them her scrapbook and the bits and 
pieces she could find relating to Pavlova. . . . They were only going to stay 
for a short time, but they stayed for hours in the end." 
</P>
<P>
They invited her to the ballet, but Auntie Rita declined, saying she was afraid 
to get in and out of cars for fear of breaking something. So they hired an 
ambulance to take her there. They put her and five of her friends in six choice 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
"And at the end of the performance, Slaughter, still in his dance gear, made an 
announcement that they had someone very special in the audience, and all the 
spotlights went on Auntie." 
</P>
<P>
Auntie Rita was presented with a great bouquet. Slaughter went down to sit on 
the floor beside her. People queued up to meet her. The press took more 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
She was asked to conduct a master's class, which she declined. So they asked 
Auntie Rita just to sit in and advise on Pavlova's style. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently the archives on Pavlova were thin. "Auntie was amazed at the things 
they didn't know." The only remaining film of Pavlova at work was damaged and 
of little use. She told them that Pavlova had come on backwards as the dying 
swan, instead of forwards as they were doing it. Then Pavlova would turn around 
to show a large bloodstain on her dress. 
</P>
<P>
"So, she made stardom at the end of her life, and for her nothing could have 
been better than the last month of her life. On her birthday, her living room 
was absolutely full of flowers. They ran out of vases, bottles, everything to 
put them in. 
</P>
<P>
"By the sound of what she said to people, she was ready to die and was happy; 
she'd done all she had wanted to, led an interesting life and had really gone 
full circle back to her dancing days, the love of her life." 
</P>
<P>
Auntie Rita lived alone in Exeter with her poodle. Donovan's parents have moved 
all her things to their house in Purley. Donovan notes that the top floors of 
the house are so "absolutely packed" with Auntie Rita's furniture and 
belongings that she expects it will take years to sort out. 
</P>
<P>
"So my Wednesdays with Mum from now on, I think, will be spent sorting and 
organizing family photos and letters and dancing books and music and old '20s 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry to tell you bad news, but as I say, she was 92."

THE GENIUS OF BELLINI THE ELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bernard Barryte, Barryte is curator of European art at the Memorial Art 
Gallery of the University of Rochester. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Integral to the pleasures of this season are the sumptuous art books with which 
publishers tempt the holiday shopper. One of the best of this year's treasure 
trove is THE GENIUS OF JACOPO BELLINI: The Complete Paintings and Drawings 
(Harry N. Abrams: $195; 496 pp.), an extraordinary achievement for which both 
author and publisher deserve praise. Colin Eisler offers an extensive, urbane 
and richly nuanced text that elucidates the 581 high-quality reproductions. 
Clarifying Jacopo's artistic contributions and providing insight into the 
context and content of individual works, this lavish volume is an exemplary 
vehicle for restoring this influential painter to his rightful status among the 
paramount artists of the early Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
Though he is generally acknowledged to be the founding father of Venetian 
Renaissance painting, Jacopo Bellini (c. 1400-c.1470) has been overshadowed by 
his heirs. The existing literature focuses on his sons, Gentile and Giovanni, 
and his son-in-law, Andrea Mantegna. They exploited Jacopo's legacy so 
successfully that his work was substantially neglected. Although Jacopo enjoyed 
the patronage of the church, state, and patricians of Venice, today only about 
40 paintings (including one gem recently acquired by the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art) are attributed to him in the catalogue raisonne appended to this 
volume. This situation, combined with the paucity of documents (also published 
in an Appendix), accounts for the somewhat uneven character and frequent 
recourse to conjecture in Eisler's introductory survey of Jacopo's 50-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
If the paintings provide an insubstantial armature for an overview, remarkable 
evidence of Jacopo's genius survives in two sketchbooks preserved today in the 
British Museum, London, and the Louvre in Paris. They are almost unique 
examples of the portfolios vital to an active quattrocento workshop and their 
298 drawings constitute the largest cohesive representation of early 
Renaissance draughtsmanship. The reader's access to this fragile material has 
been facilitated by modern technology. The now muted beauty of the leadpoint 
London drawings has been almost magically revealed by infrared photography; new 
color photography enhances our appreciation for the exquisite intricacy of the 
Paris sheets, drawn as they are in a most delicate medium, silverpoint on 
vellum, with some subsequent ink embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
Considered together, the albums reveal Jacopo's influential fusion of the 
Byzantine and Gothic traditions prevailing in Venice with the new classicism 
emerging in Florence. In the Paris book Jacopo "cherishes the wisdom of the 
panorama and revels in chivalric narrative" whereas the "breakthroughs of the 
early Renaissance" achieved through an "intense understanding and unrivaled 
exploration of landscape and cityscape" are revealed in the London volume. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous scholars who discuss the drawings chronologically, Eisler 
examines them thematically, studying Jacopo's successive versions of such 
traditional subjects as "St. Jerome in the Wilderness" and "St. George and the 
Dragon." This strategy enables the author to trace the emergence of a new 
pictorial language in landscape, portraiture, the nude, and architectural 
rendering while his exegesis of individual images reveals much that is 
distinctive in Venetian iconography. In addition, Eisler's allusions to social, 
political, and related artistic developments (e.g., scenography and 
perspective) can be explored by reference to the extensive footnotes. 
Suggestive appendices invite further speculation on Jacopo's contribution to 
manuscript illumination and printmaking. 
</P>
<P>
Though he implies that Jacopo effected a revolution in Venetian painting by 
harmonizing the Gothic and Classical in altarpieces of humane piety and 
landscapes that can inspire acts of spiritual or physical courage, Eisler 
refrains from summarizing the significance of Jacopo's career, and this is 
perhaps the wisest decision. If specific elements of Jacopo's accomplishment 
were carried to fruition by Gentile Bellini and Mantegna, the limited surviving 
work suggests that the full scope of Jacopo's innovative genius may be 
understood only in the lyrical paintings of Giovanni Bellini. 
</P>
<P>
"The Genius of Jacopo Bellini" will certainly become the standard monograph on 
this important artist and it is therefore an essential acquisition for 
libraries. However, because the drawings especially are endlessly fascinating, 
it is to be regretted that the understandably exorbitant price will inhibit all 
but the most ardent from having a copy at home for perpetual delectation. 
</P>
<P>
Although no comprehensive catalogue raisonne of the work of Giovanni Bellini 
(Jacopo's son) has yet appeared in English, Rona Goffen has written a useful 
new book on this influential Italian artist, a welcome addition to the 
literature on quattrocento painting.

100 VIEWS OF A MISCHIEVOUS OLD PRINTMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alex Gibney, Gibney is a documentary film producer who writes frequently on 
Japan. He is currently at work on a 10-part series for PBS entitled The Pacific 
Century.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is a long-enduring myth that the United States "opened" Japan when Commodore 
Perry guided his smoke-belching black ships up Uraga Bay in 1853. According to 
this gospel, Japan was a closed country, guided by ancient traditions, and 
ruled by Confucian shoguns who enforced a rigid class system that contained the 
social dynamism that would explode in the latter half of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing could be further from the truth. Notes Japan scholar Chalmers Johnson: 
"Japan (in the early 19th Century) was a country that was going to explode 
whether the West came there or not." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most beautiful evidence of this impending explosion is contained in 
Peter Morse's HOKUSAI: ONE HUNDRED POETS (George Braziller: $80; 224 pp.), a 
collection of woodblock prints and line drawings by the master Japanese painter 
and woodblock artist Hokusai (1760-1849). The last of the artist's great print 
series, it was an attempt to illustrate Japan's famous "Hyakunin Isshu" -- 100 
poems by 100 poets. This is a collection of traditional Japanese court poetry, 
which, according to Peter Morse's introduction, has come to represent a body of 
popular wisdom in Japan similar to that of "Aesop's Fables" in the West. But 
Hokusai was an irreverent man, and he had little interest in chronicling the 
priggish manners and rarefied aesthetics of Japan's 12th-Century nobility. He 
was determined to reinvent the images of the ancient poems in a contemporary 
context. So he turned his view away from the palace and toward the roiling 
activity in the towns, villages and countryside, in the words of critic 
Ichitaro Kondo, to "portray humanity, unpowdered and unadorned." 
</P>
<P>
In part, this was just business. Despite the highbrow allure of Japan's 
woodblock prints in Western art salons, these works were made by and for 
Japan's emerging bourgeoisie. The ukiyo-e, or "pictures of the floating world," 
were part of a new chonin culture (literally, "culture of the townspeople") 
that was emerging in Japan in the 18th and 19th centuries, as the financial 
success of merchants and artisans -- and the seductive charms of the 
courtesans, actors and artists who entertained them -- was undermining the 
traditional power and culture of the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
Hokusai's predecessors -- artists like Utamaro and Sharaku -- catered to the 
rich merchants by composing images of beautiful women, actors, and life in the 
pleasure quarters of Edo (old Tokyo) and Osaka. But Hokusai captured a larger 
audience by turning his attention to more common folk. Ichitaro Kondo notes 
that Hokusai's sensuous portrayals of farmers, pearl divers and carpenters -- 
working, drinking and making love -- "gave his countrymen a new evaluation of 
ordinary man and his everyday activities." 
</P>
<P>
To do this in "The 100 Poems," Hokusai's challenge was to find a way to break 
free of the stilted sentiments and rigid, traditional form imposed by the 
31-syllable tanka. Hokusai's solution was to title the collection: "Pictures of 
100 Poems by 100 Poets, Explained by the Nurse." He invented an old woman to 
serve as a "narrator." Hiding in the skirts of this "nurse's" rather batty 
interpretations, Hokusai found a way to tease new meanings from the old verses. 
With the help of the many homonyms in the Japanese language, Hokusai delighted 
in irreverent puns or total misreadings of the text, and composed pictures that 
interested him and his contemporary audience more than did the stale 
connoisseurship practiced by idle 12th-Century courtiers. 
</P>
<P>
When Hokusai's nurse sees the phrase Ama no Kagu, normally translated as 
"heaven's perfume" -- she misreads it in a more earthy context: "the stench of 
flax." A fragile "node of reed" multiplies in Hokusai's picture to a huge 
cartful, hauled by three sweaty, half-naked men. 
</P>
<P>
Hokusai mocks the idle musings of nobles through their grooms and attendants. 
In a maudlin poem about the sadness of the passing of the night, Hokusai and 
his nurse see a gaggle of palanquin bearers hustling their masters home from 
the Yosiwara brothels before they are recognized in the light of day. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere in these pictures, poetic stillness is usurped by tawdry hustle, 
aesthetics by sexual athletics, contemplation by sweaty work. A scene of three 
elegant ladies by a river becomes a flatulent joke: They are nearly obscured 
from view by a farmer tugging at a huge, stubborn ox. And Hokusai steams up a 
rather dry poem about enduring love with a scene of three men and three women 
lounging around a hot bath by a cool blue river. What Hokusai and his nurse do 
to the "Hyakunin Isshu" is subvert them in the same way that Chonin culture 
eroded the foundations of the austere world of the Samurai, a warrior class 
with no wars to fight, rapidly collapsing of its own dead weight. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's easy to get carried away with this kind of armchair social 
analysis. It can dim the power of Hokusai's aesthetic vision. After all, this 
"painting-crazy old man," as Hokusai called himself, was an artist, not a 
sociologist. A prolific creator who churned out more than 30,000 images in his 
lifetime, including book illustrations, notebooks and greeting cards, he was 
most recognized for his collection of landscape woodblocks, "Thirty-Six Views 
of Mt. Fuji," which includes one of the most famous ukiyo-e prints, "Great Wave 
Off Kanagawa." 
</P>
<P>
His striking style emerged from a personal fusion of three painting traditions 
-- Chinese, Japanese and Western. And the paintings in this collection show his 
unique sense of balance between people and nature, from the foamy tentacles of 
one of Hokusai's waves engulfing a boat to the picture of a woodcutter dwarfed 
by a tree that he is slowly sawing into house beams. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that remain unclear, only 27 of the "100 Poems" were ever printed 
in full color. The others exist in key block prints, or line drawings, of which 
Morse has hunted down all but a handful. The reproductions are beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
One of my few quibbles with this book is that Morse puts too much weight on the 
poems, their original meanings and their reinterpretations. This can reduce the 
power of the pictures to one-joke cartoons -- which they're not. They're like 
the photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson, capturing "decisive moments" when 
human action and natural settings combine to evoke mysterious emotions and 
reveal hidden meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Morse has, however, been modest enough not to impose the text on the paintings 
graphically. In the book's layout, he has peppered the left-hand pages with 
text -- the poems, their translations, background notes and interpretations -- 
and devoted the right-hand leaves to full-page reproductions of the prints. 
Those not interested in the poems can ignore them. His introduction is terse 
and clear, offering a quick study in Japanese poetry and the business and 
mechanics of woodblock printing. I only wish that he had not assumed so much 
expert knowledge on the part of the reader and included a biographical sketch 
of Hokusai as well as some discussion of his art and its influences. And I hope 
someone releases a paperback edition that costs less than $80. 
</P>
<P>
"Hokusai: 100 Poets" will be of equal value to the academic and the passing 
fancier. Personally, I like it for its portraits of everyday life: abalone 
divers cavorting in the sea, a floating restaurant on the Sumida River, women 
in hanging baskets gathering rock mushrooms, villagers burning seaweed for 
salt, a courtesan followed by her servant balancing boxes of makeup, boat 
builders with torches searing woodpitch into hull seams. These are beautiful 
pictures and they offer a glimpse of Japan, before Perry's black ships, when 
the zealous greed of merchants, the creativity of artists, and the drive of 
farmers and townspeople, were pushing aside ancient traditions and setting the 
stage for something new.

THE DEFECTORS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY TOOK A FEW CLOTHES, SOME PHOTOGRAPHS AND THEIR CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINES -- 
AND WENT OVER THE EMBASSY WALL

<P>
WANG SHENHONG TOOK the first nervous step one day last June when he slipped 
away from the Chinese Embassy in a European capital to call friends in Hong 
Kong from a pay telephone. In his panic, he fumbled with his coins and the 
receiver. "It was the first time in my life I had ever used a pay phone," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 o'clock one morning later that week, when his fellow Chinese diplomats 
were asleep, Wang jumped over the embassy's 5-foot wall to hand a large old 
suitcase to a man in a waiting car. The bag was stuffed with his and his wife's 
clothes, the family pictures of a lifetime, some Chinese herbal medicines and 
several cartons of cut-rate embassy cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after agonizing over their next move for three days, Wang and his wife, 
Li Mingming, also a Chinese diplomat, walked out of the embassy. Carrying no 
baggage, the couple looked as if they were out for a Sunday stroll. Instead, 
they hailed a taxi and defected to the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Any dream or hope we had for the Communist regime had been dashed thoroughly" 
by the Tian An Men massacre, explains Wang (not his real name). "It made us not 
want to continue serving the regime. . . . This is not an ideological struggle 
taking place in China right now. It's just a struggle between factions. People 
are fighting for their own power and self-interest, and that's all. In China, 
you haven't the right, the power, to speak and think. I enjoy very much the 
freedom here (in the West). Because freedom cannot be bought, not even with 
gold." 
</P>
<P>
AS WANG TALKED, HE SAT in the dining room of a modest row house on the 
outskirts of the city where the Wangs had worked as diplomats. It is the home 
of an ethnic Chinese artist, a friend of the Wangs' contact in Hong Kong. The 
artist had never met the Wangs until they decided to defect. Responding to a 
plea from Hong Kong friends, the artist agreed to shelter the two Chinese 
diplomats for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the days have turned into months, and still the Wangs are living in the 
artist's home. They have nowhere else to go. Wang, a well-educated 
intellectual, hasn't found a job, and the couple isn't sure yet in what Western 
country they will be able to make their future. The artist who houses them is, 
by turns, amused and exasperated by these odd, idealistic defectors who have 
gradually taken over his life. 
</P>
<P>
The defection of the Wangs is not an isolated case. Since their government 
cracked down on the pro-democracy movement in June, about 70 Chinese diplomats 
around the world, by unofficial estimates, have fled to the West -- the largest 
number since the days of the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. These defections 
are a serious embarrassment for the Chinese government -- and a potential boon 
for Western intelligence agencies, which have carefully debriefed the former 
diplomats for details about Chinese embassy and consulate operations. 
</P>
<P>
The largest number of defections has reportedly been from Chinese embassies and 
consulates in Canada and Australia. At least a handful of Chinese diplomats in 
the United States also have defected. In one dramatic and well-publicized 
incident in June, a couple who had been working at the Chinese consulate in San 
Francisco showed up unannounced at a rally for those killed during the violence 
in Beijing. The two diplomats told the crowd of about 5,000 that they could no 
longer support their government's actions and announced that they were 
defecting. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials won't provide any details they might have about Chinese 
defectors in this country. The FBI, which handles the Chinese defectors here, 
is said to have helped some of them to relocate. "We just can't discuss 
defectors in any way," one U.S. official says. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Wang and Li provides insight into some of the motivations, hopes, 
fears and confusion of the defecting Chinese diplomats. The pair agreed to talk 
about how and why they defected, but only on the condition that I not reveal 
their names or the country where they had been working. Despite these 
assurances, Wang and his wife were still nervous about being interviewed. 
Because they have been granted political asylum, they are seemingly safe. But 
they fear they may jeopardize the safety of their relatives and friends in 
China. Even if the Chinese government succeeded in guessing their identities, 
the Wangs explained, the regime might not be so insulted if I used fictitious 
names for them in my story. I didn't quite follow this logic, but Wang knows 
the Chinese government much better than I do. He worked for it for most of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Wang, thin and graying, is a careful person, a man seemingly born to worry. A 
friend says that Wang weighs every word he utters, then stays awake at night 
wondering what he should have said, calculating what he will say tomorrow. His 
dark-haired wife is a strong-willed, tenacious survivor whose support helps to 
keep Wang going. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese Embassy, Wang says, the other diplomats considered him naive and 
otherworldly. Early last spring, Wang told a fellow Chinese diplomat he was 
certain Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping would negotiate with the students 
demonstrating for democracy and accept at least a few of their demands. 
</P>
<P>
His colleague told Wang he was being foolish and unrealistic. "A politician 
doesn't have any humanity," the other diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
EACH NIGHT LAST SPRING,the Wangs and the other envoys had gathered in front of 
television sets, watching the escalating drama of the student protests in 
Beijing. Cable television carried inside the self-contained world of the 
embassy the sort of information the diplomats could never have gotten from the 
telexes and coded messages of their government. Impatiently, the Wangs and 
their colleagues would switch from one TV channel to another, always looking 
for more news, more pictures from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, June 4, Li went out to visit an overseas Chinese woman she 
had met. The woman told her that on Saturday night the government had moved 
tanks into Beijing and that it appeared many people had been killed or injured. 
</P>
<P>
Li was stunned. "We never thought the government would use tanks to crush this 
movement," she says. "Millions of Beijing civilians supported this movement." 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the Chinese Embassy, where, at the same time, Wang and the 
other diplomats were learning from television the news from Beijing. "That 
day," Wang says, "we cried." 
</P>
<P>
For the Wangs, the regime's decision to crush the outpouring of dissent brought 
back memories of past repression. "We had had the experience of all the U-turns 
of the past years," says Wang, now in his 50s. "You could say we are old 
sportsmen, old spectators of China's political movements. We knew very clearly 
all the next steps, how everyone would be asked to report to their bosses and 
so forth." 
</P>
<P>
"We smelled the (political) atmosphere we have recognized so often in the 
past," Li adds. "All the movements the Communist Party launched, we 
experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Their bad memories go back more than three decades. During the so-called 
"anti-rightist" campaign against Chinese intellectuals in 1956 and 1957 -- a 
campaign in which Deng, then general secretary of the Communist Party, played a 
leading role -- Wang's brother committed suicide after he had been accused of 
ideological errors. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Wang and Li were university students, eagerly studying the 
natural sciences they thought would benefit China. Li recalls that for nearly a 
year she was required to devote every school day to writing denunciations of 
people accused of having "rightist" political tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
Li says she was a youthful believer in the Chinese Communist Party. "In the 
1950s, I was very (politically) active," she explains. "I wanted to be part of 
the Chinese peasant tradition. I thought if I could drive a (tractor) combine, 
that would be great. My father was a capitalist, and the first step for me 
toward becoming a (Communist) Youth League member was to struggle against my 
father." 
</P>
<P>
For political reasons, Li left her father and the city in which she was raised 
in 1957, when she was barely 20. She did not see her father again for 15 years, 
in the midst of the Cultural Revolution. She and Wang married in the late 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Like millions of other Chinese, the couple was separated and sent to different 
areas in the Chinese countryside during the Cultural Revolution. However, in 
1972, Li was allowed to return to her hometown for a brief visit. After seeing 
her, Li's father became so excited and agitated, Li says, that he died of a 
heart attack within a day after she returned to the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, three years after the death of Mao Tse-tung, Deng consolidated his 
control over the Chinese Communist Party. And until recently, Wang says, he 
looked upon the past decade as the most hopeful in China's recent history. 
"After 1979, it seemed like a golden age," he says. "People had a chance to go 
abroad, to attend international conferences, to travel to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the United States five years ago, Wang says, a 
Chinese-American relative offered to help him arrange to stay here, but Wang 
declined the overture. After all, life in China seemed to be both good and 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
WANG AND HIS WIFE began their Western European posting in 1986. They found 
embassy life extraordinarily comfortable. The embassy supplied the diplomats 
with food, cigarettes and other items at discount. A special barber from China 
was even assigned to the embassy so that the diplomats would not have to endure 
European haircuts. Their embassy section of eight people had three cars and one 
chauffeur reserved for them. Until they defected, the Wangs did not know the 
cost of a taxi ride in the city in which they had lived for nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
Before last June, they say, the political atmosphere in the embassy was not 
particularly oppressive, although their movements were somewhat restricted. A 
few days after they first arrived, they were required to hand over their 
passports to higher authorities for permanent "safekeeping." They had a nightly 
curfew of 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Their salaries were low -- no more than $260 per month, of which they had to 
pay $72 for food. In China, such income would be a fortune; in Western Europe, 
it puts an ordinary person below the poverty level. Still, their needs were so 
few that they were able to save more than $100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a few days after the bloody assault on Tian An Men Square, one of 
Wang's superiors told him that the embassy would soon begin a new policy of 
having embassy staff inform on each other. "He warned us: 'From now on, you 
should pay more attention to what you say. Keep your real thoughts to 
yourself,' " Li recalls. "I think, not all of our colleagues in the embassy 
would betray each other. But if there were only one or two, it would create big 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Ministry sent the embassy about 60 copies of the 
government's official account of what happened in Beijing. All the diplomats in 
the embassy were instructed "to stick to this document" in their conversations 
with foreigners, Li says. And there were signs that the embassy would start 
having internal party meetings and political study sessions, a return to 
practices of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Over a period of days, Wang and Li, who had been scheduled to return to China 
late this year, concluded that they should flee to the West. But once they made 
the decision, the couple's defection turned into a series of furtive moves, 
false starts and slip-ups. "It was like a really bad grade-B movie," says the 
artist who ended up housing them. 
</P>
<P>
First, the artist met briefly with Wang. Next, he picked up their suitcase in 
the pre-dawn tryst outside the embassy. He and the Wangs worked out a coded 
telephone message that would signal they were about to flee: "We are coming 
over for tea." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the artist picked up the bag of belongings, the phone rang at 
his home. It was a quiet Saturday afternoon. "We are coming over for tea," Wang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, the artist's phone rang a second time. It was Wang again. 
He and his wife had changed their minds, he said. They loved their country, 
they couldn't bring themselves to leave it. The tea party was off. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked out of the embassy, and then we came back," Wang recalls. "I thought 
we should consider it more carefully." Wang was prepared to go, but his wife 
was hesitant. They argued. She was particularly worried about the effect their 
defection might have on their relatives. Li says she was also afraid that 
"maybe we are too old to have a new start." 
</P>
<P>
Trained in the old Confucian virtues, the Wangs even debated how the timing of 
their defection might affect their boss at the embassy, whom they liked. Would 
he get into more trouble if they defected while he was at work, or should they 
vanish while he was out of town? 
</P>
<P>
In those hours of indecision, they called friends overseas for advice. They 
thought about it once again overnight. They argued some more. "We had quite a 
lot of struggle, I think," Li says. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 2 p.m. the next day, a Sunday, Wang called the artist to say the 
tea party was back on. This time, Wang was able to persuade his wife to go with 
him. "He told me, 'Go ahead, just put one foot in front of the other,' " Li 
says. 
</P>
<P>
They hailed a taxi and, when they got to their friend's house, were stunned by 
the high fare. Defecting to the West cost more than $15 -- much more than they 
had ever spent for transportation in the protected, chauffeur-driven world of 
the Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
THAT NIGHT, THE Wangs and the artist notified authorities of the West European 
government, which agreed to help protect them. It, in turn, notified the 
embassy, which had already reported Wang and Li missing, that the couple was 
seeking political asylum. A few days later, Chinese officials passed on a 
request to meet with the Wangs. The couple turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
Wang and Li admit that they were afraid the Chinese regime would try to get 
them back. They rarely ventured outside their protector's house. Whenever the 
phone rang or the front door was opened, Wang jumped. At one point, he wore 
sunglasses when he went out for a brief nighttime walk, in a seemingly futile 
effort to conceal his identity. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks, Wang was subjected to four grueling debriefings, totaling about 
20 hours, by intelligence officials of the European nation's government. Wang 
says they did not even allow him to go to the restroom without an escort. The 
officials seemed especially interested in efforts by the Chinese government to 
obtain Western technology, a subject about which Wang claims he knows very 
little. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the couple received political asylum. The lawyer who represented 
them says their request was granted with extraordinary speed. "They had 
produced cogent evidence as to how they would fear for their lives or liberty 
if they were to return to China," the lawyer says. "Their seeing the 
intelligence people helped, too, I suppose." 
</P>
<P>
TALKING TO Western intelligence officials did not solve all the couple's 
problems. Wang says one official suggested that he and his government could 
help the couple to find jobs. Instead, Wang and Li received only a form letter 
telling them to report to a government office that provides routine welfare, 
housing and employment services to immigrants and refugees. When they visited 
the office, they discovered that it was about to be closed for budgetary 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us political asylum, and then they didn't want anything to do with 
us," Li says. 
</P>
<P>
Wang says that, in his naivete, he expected it would be only a matter of weeks 
before he found work. "I have a deep understanding of China," Wang says. "It's 
worthwhile. They (Western officials) don't know how to use me." 
</P>
<P>
After four months, Wang remains unemployed, though he did serve a two-week 
stint as a translator for a television program. This fall, Wang and Li have 
been exploring their chances of emigrating to Australia or United States. To do 
so, they would have to find jobs that would entitle them to obtain visas. So 
far, they have had no luck. 
</P>
<P>
However, Li has found a job in a hospital, where she is learning to answer 
telephones. She leaves the house early in the morning, rides public 
transportation to and from the hospital, returns home tired at night, and still 
manages to cook dinner. In contrast to her embassy job, the hours are longer 
and the work more demanding. Nevertheless, she says, she does not regret the 
decision to defect. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was back in China, I worked harder," she explains. But "I didn't have 
to use my mind. Now, you see, I use my mind every day, to struggle for life." 
</P>
<P>
Wang has no regrets, either. "Even if I have some difficulties now, I am glad 
for what I did," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, Wang says, he is happy to have stopped working for the Chinese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"During the last 10 years, we Chinese could hold up our heads to foreigners," 
he says. "China had a bright future. After what happened in June, even people 
from the Third World looked down on us. They would say, 'Even South Africa 
didn't use tanks to kill its own people.' Our government lost the respect of 
the world."

JACKETS FOR SPRING, 1990, WILL HAVE A SLENDER SILHOUETTE FOR BOTH DAY AND NIGHT 
</P>

<P>
The short skirts, wide pants and sleek little dresses of last summer will look 
quite all right next spring. But jackets are another story. They've undergone 
the most striking changes in all of Spring, 1990, fashion. And recent runway 
shows in Paris, Milan and New York prove that the new shapes, proportions and 
fabrics are unlike those of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's slightly boxy, man-tailored jackets do lend themselves to an easy 
update. Wear them over bare bra tops and miniskirts to be young and daring. Or 
put them with long, sweeping skirts for a fanciful, romantic effect. 
</P>
<P>
But among the latest jackets, the leading choice is the fingertip-length 
version, often fitted through the waist and flared at the hem. In New York, 
Calvin Klein called it the riding jacket and combined it with narrow pants. In 
Paris, Karl Lagerfeld featured a similar rendition, curvier than most and worn 
over skirts only an inch or so longer. In Milan, Romeo Gigli paired elongated 
jackets in spice-colored silks with ankle-length pants to wear for evening. 
</P>
<P>
More-conservative dressers might prefer the new long-over-long proportion. 
Emmanuel Ungaro in Paris offered a particularly pretty arrangement -- long, 
awning-stripe jackets over garden-print, ankle-length skirts. For a younger 
look, long jackets top very, very short skirts such as those by New Yorker 
Charlotte Neuville, who gave pizazz to a white wool suit when she teamed the 
streamlined jacket with a knife-pleated mini. In Paris, Claude Montana focused 
on a practical solution, substituting shorts for miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
The elongated jacket is a fresh look for spring, but it's not the only choice. 
Alternatives are boleros, Eisenhower jackets and cocoon shapes, often 
embellished with gold embroidery, beadwork or even jewel-like baubles. Gigli 
likes the richly embroidered cocoon worn with pants in day or evening fabrics. 
Oscar de la Renta prefers shimmering, tapestry evening jackets above taffeta 
ball-gown skirts. 
</P>
<P>
Among more casual wear, ethnic themes enhance some styles. For added interest, 
most designers are presenting jackets with skirts or pants in unmatched but 
complementary fabrics. In Milan, Giorgio Armani mixed tapestry-like fabrics. 
New Yorkers Adrienne Vittadini and Isaac Mizrahi mixed plaids. 
</P>
<P>
Elongated jackets are fitted at the waist and flared at the hem. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic-looking jackets are colorful covers for new midriff-baring bra tops. 
</P>
<P>
Unlikely fabric combinations: tapestry over pleated plaid, polka dots atop 
stripes. florals with diagonals. 
</P>
<P>
Fingertip-length jackets cover dramatically abbreviated skirts, shorts or 
skimmer dresses.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: MYTH-MAKING, CHILD-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Olson Fakih, Fakih, the author of this article and the four Children's 
Bookshelf articles on pp.28-29, is a children's book editor and reviewer based 
in New York City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in the land of unfailingly blue skies and perennially flowering trees, 
people notice, come fall, an indefinable shift in the season as clearly as if 
they had walked through a dusty, crackling pile of dead leaves. Stories are a 
part of this season: family gossip, legends, well-loved and oft-recited poems, 
spectacles like the theatre or the ballet. To all of these a child will listen, 
with eyes wide, ears attuned, listen and remember forever. 
</P>
<P>
With images that are uniquely childlike and primordial, Veronique Tadjo's Lord 
of the Dance (Lippincott: $12.95) asks children to listen to the voice of the 
ancestors. In her tribute to the Senufo culture of the Ivory Coast, Tadjo 
invokes the power of still, abstracted forms that live outside time and place. 
Sacred objects -- masks of many faces and other incarnations of spirits -- 
float in a flat, two-dimensional space, accompanied by an inspired text: "I, 
the Mask / Dance in the forest / . . . To announce the next sowing / I dance to 
call the rains." The poem, describing how people have turned their backs on the 
Mask, ends on a redemptive note: "Child, let me tell you / A secret / Don't 
forget me / If you get lost / In the city." A work that shimmers with old 
truths and points the way toward new ones. 
</P>
<P>
A child's impulse for rhythm and free, joy-filled motion often resonates with 
nature's dance of creation and destruction. Tiddalick the Frog by Susan Nunes, 
a tale derived from stories of the Australian Aborigines' dreamtime and 
illustrated by Ju-Hong Chen (Atheneum: $13.95), inspires this ticklish thought. 
Tiddalick wakes up with great thirst; in few slurps he takes in all the water 
on the earth. Despite the pleas and antics of the other animals to try to get 
Tiddalick to open his mouth, the engorged hopper is unmoved. Only when an eel 
ties himself up in the knots of a frenetic dance does Tiddalick give a great, 
wet guffaw. Chen's puddles of watercolor add authenticity to the locale, and 
the mad jig of Noyang the eel is a picture that will itch any child's funny 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Saint George constitutes a fundamental part of the western world's 
own mythology of good and evil. Saint George and the Dragon by Geraldine 
McCaughrean, illustrated by Nicki Palin (Doubleday: $13.95) treats only the 
legendary aspects of George's feats, taking little account of the historical 
events that made him patron saint of England. Palin's paintings are 
semi-realistic settings of architectural ruins, and alert readers will find 
that they don't always match the descriptions of the text. Stiff human faces 
give each action the staged look of a passion play, artificially frozen in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Illuminations (Bradbury: $16.95) by Jonathan Hunt, is an alphabet that makes 
the Middle Ages and Arthurian lore accessible to young readers, with enough 
gore and glory for older ones as well. From alchemist to zither, through 
entries about falconry, the Grail and the troubadours, this stellar work is 
embellished in the style of illuminated manuscripts. Hunt's dazzling colors and 
intricate arabesques, together with an original format, command the attention 
of the most ambivalent reader. Try this on the scoffer who is "too old" for 
picture books. 
</P>
<P>
In The Ballad of Biddy Early by Newbery Medalist Nancy Willard, illustrations 
by Barry Moser (Alfred A. Knopf: $13.95), set in the 19th Century, exotic 
Maureen, the tinker-town queen, is but one of the myriad characters. Moser's 
paintings carve light out of darkness and bring into being the subject of 
Willard's incantatory poems, the wise woman of the Irish County Clare. 
Vitriolic Biddy, with "spells on each finger," is friend to all, "bird, beast, 
or fish." The images conjured by words and paintbrush will press this sublime 
work upon the reader: "Little tiger in God's eye / remember Biddy's lullaby." 
</P>
<P>
Another biography of mythic proportions is that of the lord of dance himself, 
Nijinsky (Doubleday: $13.95). Inspired by his costume and shoes for his 
performance in "Le Spectre De La Rose," Catherine Brighton stages in a picture 
book format the dancer's early life. Each frame, cloaked in the brooding, moody 
hues of a Russian winter, captures the sparks of brilliance and the melancholy 
in the child. The text is compact, each page like one act in the theatre of 
Nijinsky's life. The pictures highlight characters or landscapes with light and 
shadow; a shaft of light illuminates the children's faces the night their 
father leaves their mother. 
</P>
<P>
You can hear a French horn sounding a lone anticipatory note as you gaze at the 
first painting in Swan Lake by Mark Helprin, illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg 
(Houghton Mifflin: $19.95; 80 pp.). The author wraps a story like spun silk 
around the familiar elements of the ballet. An elderly man relates in humble 
terms to his young female charge how he came to be a friend of the emperor and 
tutor to the prince. The tutor's destiny is unalterably linked to the young 
girl's, just as their stories are tragically bound to that of the prince and 
Odette. Helprin's dulcet prose, compassionate characters, and mythic adventure 
provide immense reassurance that there is still good old-fashioned storytelling 
with the power to stir our deepest emotions. Van Allsburg's paintings hang, 
like fine brocade, among the beautifully designed pages. 
</P>
<P>
In Ernst by Elisa Kleven (Dutton: $11.95) an alligator named Ernst wonders 
about big and little things: what if sand were fudgy, what if everyone traveled 
in magic carts? He moves blissfully through his day, wishing for many worlds, 
but ultimately content with his own -- the real, the one-and-only. In primitive 
illustrations, brimming with minute creatures and people frollicking among the 
multiple landscapes, Kleven imagines an entire universe filled with sparkling 
animation and sweet affection. This small and beautiful book neatly reconciles 
the child's wishes with dreams fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
A child's imagination can transform even the impersonal shelves of a grocery 
store into unthinkable terrors. Take Tommy at the Grocery Store by Bill 
Grossman, illustrated by Victoria Chess (Harper &amp; Row: $12.95; 32 pp.), 
starring a small pig who is repeatedly mistaken for something he is not. 
Tommy's mother unintentionally forgets him at the store, and the grocer must 
deal with the toddler as best he can. "He thought that Tomy was salami / And 
set him on the deli shelf. / And Tommy sat among salamis, / Softly sobbing to 
himself." Before the happy ending of this frantic do-si-do of mistaken identity 
come several near-fatal puns when Tommy is nearly "prepared" for dinner. It 
would be cruel were it not so deliciously funny and yes -- to reassure 
youngsters -- entirely absurd. It could never happen -- could it? 
</P>
<P>
Hansel and Gretel's wicked stepmother, were she alive today, would be able to 
ditch those brats in a minute. She'd just drop them off at the nearest 
department store mall and they'd be lost for good. And no adult would pay any 
attention; witness another book set in contemporary times that, like Tommy, 
uses basic elements of children's humor. Young consumers will want to head to 
the mall with everyone's favorite faithful Rotweiler in Carl Goes Shopping, the 
latest in the series by Alexandra Day (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: $9.95). It 
may be the first picture book to turn the inside of a department store into a 
leading character. The other two characters, of course, are Carl and his 
baby-size charge; the results of their antics within the store are invisible to 
the mother who returns and repeats that now famous refrain, "Good dog, Carl." 
This latest adventure should prove enduring and popular. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I'm in the Zoo, Too! by Brent Ashabranner, illustrated by Janet 
Stevens (Cobblehill/Dutton: $12.95), is a declaration that leads to all kinds 
of loop-de-loops of thinking and head-scratching. A squirrel named Burl lives 
in a tree inside a zoo. But he doesn't get regular drop-offs of food from the 
zookeeper; isn't he in the zoo, too? Demanding equal rights, Burl becomes a 
regular little performer, posing for photos, playing with other animals, and 
getting locked inside a cage. Suddenly it's clear that Burl has given up a lot 
more than nut-gathering. Children will flip past the logistical implications, 
but adults will be readily involved with smiles of their own as fearless Burl's 
tale of trial and error comes to a close. Despite the unfortunate use of 
illustrations -- awkward lines and expressions prevail in several frames, and a 
tendency toward the slapstick undermines the story's more thoughtful aspects -- 
this may yet be one of the season's brightest.

The most publicized video of the year -- "Batman" -- apparently has been put on 
the market without Macrovision, the standard anti-copying device used to 
prevent unauthorized duplication of copyrighted videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Home Video shipped an estimated 13 million-16 million copies of the 
video nationwide on Nov. 15, with a suggested list price of $24.98. (Many 
stores have priced it considerably lower.) 
</P>
<P>
Outtakes was able to copy its "Batman" video, and a survey of several local 
video stores indicates that most, if not all, the "Batman" videos are 
apparently being sold without anti-copying protection. Warner Home Video execs 
we reached declined to comment and a company spokesman had not returned our 
calls at press time. 
</P>
<P>
An insider at Tower Records, where the "Batman" video is a hot item, thought 
its lack of protection won't hurt sales: "Copy-guard is just an industry 
security blanket," he said. "At this ridiculously low price, it's cheaper to 
buy than copy it. The fact that it isn't copy-protected won't affect our sales 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
A smaller retailer disagreed. "We think people won't rent it as much if they 
can make copies at home," he said. "Once word gets out that you can copy it, 
there won't be any market for it." 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to want a copy for Christmas when every kid already has one?" 
asked another video store owner. "Warner usually copy-guards its product. I 
don't know why they didn't protect this valuable property." 
</P>
<P>
A video manufacturing insider theorized that Warner, with a rushed shipping 
schedule, skipped the Macrovision stage to save time. "And since the price (for 
the consumer) is so low, the added cost of encoding each copy was probably a 
factor," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The all-time video sales champ, "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," which sold close 
to 15 million copies last year, was protected with Macrovision. Gregg Barrios

OUTTAKES: IN SEARCH OF . . . CATHERINE BURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Helen Berg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catherine Burns, once cast as the consummate outsider, has finally found her 
niche. 
</P>
<P>
Burns snagged an Academy Award nomination for her first film role -- priggish, 
pug-nosed Rhoda, the definitive late bloomer in the 1969 drama "Last Summer." 
But her screen career went nowhere fast and she eventually left Hollywood for 
regional theater. Now, during the film's 20th anniversary year, the actress has 
emerged as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
Burns has written about two dozen plays and screenplays in the last 15 years, 
but it was only this fall that she sold her first work -- three episodes for 
the CBS daytime drama "The Guiding Light." She's got an agent at Curtis Brown 
to represent her latest play and a screenplay co-written with husband Kenneth 
Shire (they were married in June). 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a journalist, Burns feels that writing is in her blood. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do something well, you like it," she explained from her Upper West Side 
apartment in Manhattan, surprising herself with the analysis. "What a 
reasonable and sane thing to say! I didn't know I could say anything so 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
After raves for "Last Summer," the "out of type" actress went on to largely 
forgettable appearances in "Red Sky at Morning" and several TV movies, with her 
screen career petering out in the late 1970s. By her own admission, she wasn't 
a typical leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
"I am one of a kind," she quipped. "Ah, but what kind?" 
</P>
<P>
Burns spent the early '80s as part of the highly respected Tyrone Guthrie 
Theater repertory in Minneapolis, appearing in such classics as Ibsen's "Peer 
Gynt" and Shakespeare's "As You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't rule out a return to stage or screen: "I'm gonna be terrific when 
I'm about 65 doing character parts -- like 'Where's the beef?' " Mary Helen 
Berg

FROM BELLINI TO BRAQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bernard Barryte 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a long and prolific career, Giovanni Bellini (early 1430s-1516) oversaw 
the transition in Venice from the International Gothic style to the High 
Renaissance style perfected by Titian, his pupil. The succession of Bellini's 
masterpieces reveal a suave mastery of color and a profound enthusiasm for 
landscape that constitute his artistic legacy. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike earlier authors who describe the artist's life and works in 
chronological sequence, Rona Goffen, who is Distinguished Professor of Art 
History at Rutgers, has adopted an unusual, fugal format in GIOVANNI BELLINI 
(Yale University Press: $60; 355 pp.) . In separate chapters, she traces the 
evolution of his private devotional images, public altarpieces, portraits, and 
secular and mythological subjects. Although some redundancy is unavoidable, 
this strategy highlights the characteristics that are unique in Bellini's 
treatment of each genre while emphasizing common trends. 
</P>
<P>
Goffen focuses less on stylistic issues and more on content than her 
predecessors. Supported by a detailed examination of their iconography, 
Goffen's reading of Bellini's spiritual paintings is especially acute and 
sensitive. Though she offers a lucid description of the intellectual and social 
context in which they were created, her discussion of his mythological 
paintings is more tentative. Although it is possible to quibble over occasional 
details, this thoroughly documented and generously illustrated volume is 
written in a manner as accessible as Bellini's paintings and should be a 
delight to the amateur and connoisseur alike.

Inspired by a visit to the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and the product of 
11 years research, THE ROYAL HORSE AND RIDER: Painting, Sculpture and 
Horsemanship 1500-1800 (Abaris Books: $59.50; 336 pp.) offers an innovative and 
fascinating survey of equestrian portraits and monuments created between 
1500-1800. Because these images mirror the most distinctive activity of the 
ruling class, the book also offers new insight into the self-image and ideals 
of European's aristocracy. 
</P>
<P>
In a lucid and meticulously documented essay, Walter Leidtke, curator of Dutch 
and Flemish paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, traces the evolution 
of the genre in terms of both pictorial style and social significance. To 
reacquaint most of us with now forgotten subtleties of horsemanship, the book 
includes a helpful essay on "Riding in the Renaissance and Baroque Period" by 
Alexander Mackay-Smith, curator and chairman of the board at the National 
Sporting Library in Middleburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Leidtke suggests that equestrian portraits resumed their classical importance 
during the Renaissance. Antique prototypes were refined conceptually, though 
not in practice, by Leonardo da Vinci. His ideas, however, provided the basis 
for the accomplishments of Giambologna and Pietro Tacca, Florentine sculptors 
active in the second half of the 16th Century. They developed an image of the 
mounted ruler that matured in the 17th Century into a dynamic symbol of public 
authority. Giving greatest emphasis to the masterpieces of Rubens, Velazquez, 
and Van Dyck, Leidtke adds new depth to our understanding of individual 
paintings while clarifying the artistic relationships between the artists. 
</P>
<P>
A subtext of this discussion is Leidtke's thesis that "equestrian portraits and 
monuments of the late 16th and 17th centuries are intimately related in form 
and meaning to the contemporary art of riding." Making effective use of prints, 
especially those recording the "airs" of haute ecole horsemanship that spread 
from Italy throughout Europe during this period, Leidtke specifically 
identifies the equine movements depicted in the portraits. These details are 
given broad significance, especially in his second chapter which analyzes the 
symbolic connotations of the equestrian portrait. Liedtke's essay, supported by 
a rich bibliography, offers new material for interpreting Baroque portraits. It 
may also serve as a successful model for the integration of social and art 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Skira's STILL LIFE: A History (Skira/Rizzoli: $85; 240 pp.) is a far 
less successful genre survey. Although this genre, too, dates back to 
antiquity, it has suffered from relative scholarly neglect in spite of the 
almost hypnotic appeal exerted by many of the images and the plethora of 
masterpieces produced by many of our greatest artists. In part, this neglect is 
due to that fact that the still life -- defined by the absence of humanity and 
focusing largely on the detritus of life -- was considered ignoble by the 
Greeks and occupied the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres formalized 
by 17th-Century academicians. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately this volume fails to fill the void. It does not supersede Charles 
Sterling's "Still Life Painting From Antiquity to the Present Time" (1959) 
which, regrettably, was reprinted in 1981 with only black-and-white 
illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly tracing the history of the genre from its tentative appearance on 
the walls of Egyptian tombs to the present, the text meanders on the periphery 
of narrative, failing to deliver the chronological analysis promised by the 
title. Instead, the text offers only the prolix ruminations of the author, 
which fail to suggest the magic, beauty, or significance of the images under 
consideration. The text is enlivened, however, by occasional vivid descriptions 
("the incandescent pears and marmoreal cheese of Nicolaes Gillis") as well as 
by seemingly random digressions on various themes. A seven-page excursus on the 
pomegranate (in which a capricious choice of allusions is undocumented) left me 
bewildered as I pondered the meaning of such statements as: "Thus the 
pomegranates, in the ardor of their demonstration, draw from the depths of a 
dark autism, a nourishing, equivocal action, between the disquieting figure of 
Hera and the taste of Delights." Can one blame the translation from the French? 
</P>
<P>
That Skira, a practicing still-life painter, has a passionate enthusiasm for 
the subject is evident in the way he guides the reader's eye in a detailed 
reading of various compositions. Unfortunately, such useful exercises only 
occasionally interrupt a text hampered by the author's habit of piling up 
synonyms and adjectives the way Frans Snyders piles up slaughtered animals. 
</P>
<P>
This book is disappointing because still life, with its long history, deserves 
more insightful analysis. Although there are now useful studies of the 
still-life tradition in Italy, France, Spain, Holland, and America, there 
exists in English no survey incorporating new research scattered in articles 
and catalogues. Until an appropriate volume appears, however, the curious 
reader is advised to use Sterling's text and refer to Skira's volume only for 
its gorgeous illustrative material. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline and Maurice Guillaud, who became famous in France for their 
startling and idiosyncratic exhibition installations, have translated their 
innovations into book format. 
</P>
<P>
RAPHAEL: Grace of an Angel (Guillaud Editions/Clarkson Potter: $100) is the 
latest in a series devoted to the greatest painters and distinguished by 
extraordinary reproductions. This volume is devoted to Raphael's major fresco 
suites in the Vatican. Except for the brief essay on the conservation history 
of these rooms by Fabrizio Mancinelli, director of Medieval, Byzantine, and 
Modern Art department at the Museum of the Vatican, the text is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
The book itself is an exercise in advanced printing technology. Unfortunately, 
the novelty of the garishly colored dividing pages and diecut windows is 
quickly wearing. These elements end by distracting from the crisp images which 
have been otherwise left to speak for themselves. And they, of course, are 
glorious. 
</P>
<P>
The reproductions on the Guillaud's distinctive onionskin paper approximate the 
surface appearance of the frescoes. The reader is left to pore over a multitude 
of luscious details (although the order of plates is somewhat idiosyncratic) 
that are otherwise inaccessible except to angels and conservators. For 
biographical and interpretive information, look elsewhere. This expensive book 
is useful, however, in facilitating an appreciation for Raphael's matchless 
artistry. 
</P>
<P>
The extravagantly illustrated FRANS HALS (Prestel Books/te Neues Publishing: 
$60; 437 pp.) is the catalogue published in association with a dazzling 
retrospective exhibition that opened recently at the National Gallery in 
Washington, D.C. The show travels to London and concludes at the Frans 
Halsmuseum in Haarlem, where the painter spent his career. 
</P>
<P>
Edited by Harvard professor Seymour Slive, author of the three-volume Hals 
catalogue raisonne (1970-74) as well as the richly informative entries 
describing the 86 pictures in the exhibition, the book includes the first 
English translation of Arnold Houbraken's biography of the artist (1718), a 
valuable compilation of 190 documents, and a series of authoritative essays 
describing his patrons, their clothing, and the artist's working methods. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most interesting for the amateur is the essay by Frances Jowell, which 
summarizes the critical fortunes of the painter. Though his reputation today 
rivals that of his younger contemporaries Rembrandt and Vermeer, Hals 
(1582/3-1666) died in poverty after enjoying continuous patronage during his 
life. He was quickly forgotten and his paintings relegated to attics when his 
vigorous brushwork was no longer fashionable. Credit for his rediscovery must 
go to Theophile Thore, who in the mid-19th Century recognized Hals as "the true 
predecessor of the realism just beginning to come into fashion". 
</P>
<P>
Characterized by this critic as an "adroit swashbuckler" who "painted as if 
fencing," Hals' ineffable capacity to capture the "essential vitality of his 
sitters" and his unrivaled virtuosity in giving form and vibrancy with the 
merest brush stroke influenced artists as distinct as Manet, Van Gogh, and John 
Singer Sargent. They were impressed -- as we remain today -- by the uncanny 
immediacy of the portraits to which Hals devoted his career, and they emulated 
Hals' audacious technique for their diverse purposes. 
</P>
<P>
With ravishing color plates (including a plenitude of details), the appearance 
of this book is especially welcome today when contemporary artists are 
experimenting again with painterly representation. In addition to providing a 
large audience an opportunity to enjoy (vicariously) Hals' immensely 
pleasurable paintings, it also provides a focus for studying the techniques of 
a quintessential master of the loaded brush. 
</P>
<P>
If the museum has sometimes been described as a laboratory, PICASSO AND BRAQUE: 
Pioneering Cubism (Museum of Modern Art/Little, Brown: $70; 464 pp.) documents 
what is unquestionably one of the most complex and rigorous experiments ever 
performed at New York's Museum of Modern Art. The bulky catalogue is primarily 
a picture book. Supported by a multitude of documentary photographs, it 
includes hundreds of color reproductions of the paintings, drawings, sculpture, 
collage, and papier colle created by Picasso and Braque between 1907-1914. 
Gathered under the leadership of William Rubin, director emeritus of MoMA's 
Department of Painting and Sculpture, they have been brought together for the 
first time to help answer the myriad questions still surrounding the invention 
of Cubism, which he describes as "the most passionate adventure in our 
century's art." 
</P>
<P>
Like the exhibition itself, the book provides material for studying the 
formation of this style and its evolution from Analytic to Synthetic Cubism. 
Conclusions resulting from the encounter with this material will be published 
in a subsequent volume containing the proceedings of a seminar conducted by 20 
specialists in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Insisting that art historical judgments can be properly drawn only from direct 
experience with the objects under consideration, Rubin's introduction merely 
suggests "starting points for comparing the work of the two artists . . . 
without attempting to engage prematurely those complex issues that the seminar 
will confront when the works themselves" are present. The objects themselves 
are given only minimal labels, but there is a meticulous 108-page "Documentary 
Chronology" compiled by Judith Cousins. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, therefore, this is not a book for the timid. Whether elegant or 
frivolous, the fragile studies and dense finished works that emerged from the 
intellectual intercourse of Braque and Picasso are intensely thought-provoking 
and there is in this volume no user-friendly analysis to guide the reader, who 
is dumped squarely in medias res. However, this strategy has the benefit of 
providing the adventurous with an opportunity to eavesdrop, as it were, on the 
brief but immensely fruitful dialogue between two distinct and creative 
personalities.

HOLIDAY PAPERBACKS

By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paperbacks remain popular holiday gifts: They're smaller, cheaper and easier to 
wrap than hardcover books. Not everyone on the list rates one of the $85 gift 
books the publishers trot out each fall ("The Joy of Lard," "The Bassoon: A 
Photo Study," "Chunk Style," "Lapland From the Air") and consign to overstock 
tables January 2. 
</P>
<P>
Cartoon books rank among the most popular paperbacks, and there are some 
excellent choices this year. THE CALVIN AND HOBBES LAZY SUNDAY BOOK (Andrews 
&amp; McMeel: $9.95), a full-color collection of Sunday pages, proves that Bill 
Watterson is, simply, the best comic strip artist working today. He blends 
words and drawings with rare skill and unflagging imagination to portray the 
mischievous fantasies of 8-year-old Calvin and his tiger companion, Hobbes. 
Hilarious and charming, this book makes an excellent gift -- or a reward to 
yourself for getting through a hard day's shopping. 
</P>
<P>
For the last few years, Watterson and Gary Larson have been sharing the number 
one and two spots on paperback bestseller lists, and the only book likely to 
rival "Lazy Sunday" in popularity is THE PREHISTORY OF THE FARSIDE: A 10th 
Anniversary Exhibit (Andrews &amp; McMeel: $12.95) This off-the-wall anthology 
includes preliminary sketches, "childhood drawings," panels that were too gross 
to print and the artist's comments on his favorite cartoon panels and mistakes. 
(When one paper mixed up the captions, it was Dennis the Menace instead of a 
snake who looked at his sandwich and complained, "Oh, brother! . . . not 
hamsters again!") "Prehistory" offers readers a rare peek into the bizarre mind 
that conceived so many gags about cows, snakes, cavemen and bugs -- and 
discovered "the real reason the dinosaurs became extinct" (they smoked 
cigarettes). 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who prefers the nostalgic appeal of an older comic strip will enjoy 
LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE, Volume Two: 1932 by Harold Gray (Fantagraphics Books: 
$14.95). By 1932, Grey had given up trying to do a humorous strip and was 
developing the soap opera/adventure format that made "Annie" famous. 
Eleven-year-old Annie was a Reagan Republican 50 years before the fact, 
extolling the virtues of thrift, hard work and private enterprise. Billionaire 
"Daddy" Warbucks counted as a good guy because he used his wealth to create 
jobs. (Leapin' Lizards -- is that the origin of the "trickle down" theory?) 
Included in this collection is Warbucks' forgotten marriage to golddigger 
Trixie Tinkle. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian cartoonist Lynn Johnston is less concerned with supplying a daily 
laugh than presenting an account of middle class daily family life in the '80s. 
A LOOK INSIDE . . . FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE: The 10th Anniversary Collection 
(Andrews &amp; McMeel: $12.95) continues the tradition of Frank King's 
"Gasoline Alley." The characters age and make decisions that may not be wise, 
but are true to their personalities. Johnston's gently skewed vision of 
contemporary suburbia is both more accurately observed and more entertaining 
than many contemporary novels. 
</P>
<P>
Kim "Howard" Johnson pulls off the impressive trick of making one of the 
funniest groups in the history of television and film comedy seem dull in THE 
FIRST 20 YEARS OF MONTY PYTHON (St Martin's Press: $14.95, illustrated). He 
just summarizes the skits, adding bits of trivia about changes in their order 
on the original TV shows. With so many Python videocassettes and recording 
available, why bother? 
</P>
<P>
Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, a.k.a. "Los Bros Hernandez," are part of the small 
group of artists working to establish the comic as a legitimate vehicle for 
artistic expression. DUCK FEET (Fantagraphics Books: $12.95), their latest 
collection, shows that Jaime is the more skillful artist, using bold black and 
white drawings to recount his slightly fantastic tales of the LA punk scene. 
Gilbert's continuing series of stories about the tiny Latin American town of 
Palomar ("Chicken Coop") prove that he is the more effective storyteller. 
Palomar seems as real as the unnamed city in "Love in the Time of Cholera," as 
Heraclio, the local accordion teacher and artist manque, explains how his love 
for his wife overcame his desire for a career in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Hernandez's graphic stories are more readable than the trendy prose spoofed 
in SPY NOTES ON MCINERNEY'S 'BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY,' JANOWITZ'S 'SLAVES OF 
NEW YORK,' ELLIS' 'LESS THAN ZERO' ... And All Those Other Hip Novels of the 
1980s by the editors of SPY Magazine (Doubleday: $7.95), a delightfully 
malicious satire of the brat pack's ready-to-weary line of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with McInerney's tale of Little Boy Blow, Spy punctures the genre's 
pretentious, perma-prest Angst, and reveals how a small group of agents, 
publishers and professors created a hip, flash-in-the-panic movement out of 
vacuous student work. Ironically, these books were written by and for the 
desperately hip audience Spy caters to, which makes the parody seem a touch 
incestuous. The book became a minor cause celebre when Cliff's Notes tried (and 
failed to block its publication, claiming that the use of the familiar 
black-and-yellow striped cover constituted an infringement of trademark. 
</P>
<P>
IMAGES FROM THE INSIDE PASSAGE: An Alaskan Portrait by Winter &amp; Pond by 
Victoria Wyatt (University of Washington Press: $19.95) ranks as this year's 
most interesting photography paperback. From their studio in Juneau, Lloyd 
Winter and Percy Pond unknowingly documented the conflict between the native 
Haida and Tlingit cultures and encroaching Western civilization: Amerindian 
women posed for portraits in fussy Victorian dresses, but with their 
traditional jewelry and dance blankets. The exceptionally clear images were 
printed from glass plate negatives taken between 1893 and 1910. 
</P>
<P>
HALSMAN AT WORK by Philippe Halsman &amp; Yvonne Halsman (Abrams: $16.95) is an 
affectionate memoir of the photographer who shot more than 100 covers for Life 
Magazine. While his elaborate tableaux of Cocteau and Dali seem both dated and 
affected, his portraits of Einstein, Hitchcock, Churchill and Louis Armstrong 
rank as classics of their genre. 
</P>
<P>
Classic hardly describes the pictures of children making faces, animals with 
their heads stuck in barrels, etc. in LIFE LAUGHS LAST: 200 More Classic Photos 
From the Famous Back Page of America's Favorite Magazine by Philip Kunhardt, 
Jr. (Fireside: $10.95), and the accompanying explanations (just in case the 
reader is too dim to figure out what's going on) flattens what little levity 
the pictures generate. A book to flip through in a book store -- and leave 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The annual spate of books on the minor arts, interior design and pricey 
bric-a-brac seem restricted to hardcovers this year, with two notable 
exceptions. The beautiful IMPERIAL TASTE: Chinese Ceramics From the Percival 
David Foundation (Chronicle Books: $22.95) encapsulates much of the history of 
Chinese pottery in just 134 pages. Unlike most works on the subject, "Imperial 
Taste" focuses on the wares Chinese artisans created for Chinese patrons, 
including the Imperial Court, rather than export ware geared to Western tastes. 
A lovely gift for anyone interested in the arts of the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
THE LIVING TRADITION OF MARIA MARTINEZ by Susan Peterson (Kodansha: $34.95) 
celebrates the work of one of the pre-eminent Southwestern potters. Maria 
Martinez was already an accomplished artisan in 1910, when an archeological 
team asked her to re-create the ancestral black Tewa pottery they unearthed. 
The gleaming, onyx-black and polychrome ceramics she creates have become a 
tradition within her talented family, and the goal of many collectors. A 
welcome antidote to the mass-produced Southwestern kitsch that blights many 
Southern California interiors. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, THE ART OF SKIING, 1856-1936 by Gary Schwartz (Wood River Publishing: 
$19.95) contains some attractive images culled from 80 years of magazine 
covers, advertisements and postcards. This agreeably superficial book might do 
as a hostess gift, if you're planning a holiday visit to someone in snow 
country; however, $20 will also buy about a pound of superior chocolate, which 
might do more toward ensuring you not only a warm welcome, but an invitation to 
return.

WRIGHT AND WRONGS; 
</P>
<P>
THE AMBITION AND THE POWER (VIKING: $22.95; 768 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John M. Barry, Taylor, author of Patterns of Abuse (Wynwood Press), is 
working on his second novel.Jim Wright. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Wright, the disgraced former speaker of the house, blossoms in this 
exhaustive account of his rise and fall more splendidly than he ever seemed to 
do while in power. John M. Barry, a veteran Washington journalist, spent more 
than two years with the Texas congressman and his colleagues in the Democratic 
leadership, nestled as close to the spine of raw political power as any 
outsider could be. He attended scores of private meetings in Democratic inner 
sancta, including some, apparently, where Wright made the very enemies who 
helped bring him down. He was with Wright during all the high points of the 
100th Congress in 1987-88, taking time out to visit the Republican side to talk 
to Rep. Newt Gingrich, who "sat . . . like Madame Defarge, knitting together 
his file of press clippings" about his elaborate plans for laying Wright low by 
manipulating the media. These glimpses at what powerful men were thinking as 
they acted gives the book the same immediacy as a photograph of the Titanic the 
second it hit the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's accomplishment is far more than a product of the good fortune of being 
on the inside when things started to pop. Other books have shown the 
warts-and-all workings of Congress, notably Bernard Asdell Muskie's "The Senate 
Nobody Knows." Books about the last two presidential elections by special 
Newsweek teams have given us the best politique verite since the late Teddy 
White's "Making of the President" series. But no study of congressional life in 
all its tawdry splendor has ever combined access with execution as well as "The 
Ambition and the Power." It is a Herculean effort and a magnificent 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
In telling Wright's story, Barry conveys all the intricacy, bombast, grandeur 
and villainy of what occurs on the dark side of representative democracy. The 
reader often knows more than the participants and thus sees the seeds of 
misunderstanding and resentment as they are planted in the minds of people who 
do not listen as closely as we read. Climactic scenes on the House floor dance 
on the page as though they had been blocked out by Frank Capra. Barry uses all 
of Tom Wolfe's tricks -- the capital letters, exclamation points, and 
interior-monologue italics -- to excellent effect. Striking details, such as a 
Republican leader smashing a lectern with his fist in frustration at one of 
Wright's tactics, propel the reader through complicated accounts of legislative 
maneuvering that would drag in the work of a lesser writer. 
</P>
<P>
Barry began the book after writing a newspaper profile about Wright in 1986, 
soon before he was elected Speaker. Learning that Wright planned to use the 
office to galvanize Democratic power in the House as no modern-day Speaker ever 
had, the author won from Wright the privilege of attending virtually every 
meeting where staff members were present, and also some where they were not. He 
conducted hundreds of interviews as well. "Most of the events related in this 
book," he writes in a note on methodology, "I personally observed." This is 
refreshing in an era of proliferating anonymous, unexaminable sources, and 
indeed the quality of Barry's reporting makes most newspaper work seem like the 
funny papers. In exchange for access, Barry agreed, among other things, to 
clear negative quotations with their authors and to withhold publication of 
anything he observed until this year. 
</P>
<P>
Wright struck this deal on the eve of his greatest political triumph. One 
wonders whether, as things started to turn sour, the perpetually dieting 
Speaker ever looked up at Barry from the raisin bran and skim milk he had every 
morning in his ornate offices and muttered: "You still here?" If so, it was 
good he listened to his better angels and let Barry stay because this book will 
inaugurate Wright's revisionist period a lot earlier than most of our internal 
political exiles get one. While he has not written an apologia, Barry was 
obviously sympathetic to his subject, so much so that he devotes far more space 
to criticizing the sloppy coverage of Wright by the national media than was 
perhaps politic. He puts the ethics charges against Wright in perspective 
without fully exonerating him. "Wright had a sense that rules did not apply to 
him," Barry writes. After running unsuccessfully for the Senate in the early 
1960s, in an impulsive moment, he paid off his campaign deficit himself and 
soon found himself wallowing in personal debt, a situation this Texas populist 
found intensely humiliating. As he scampered back to solvency, he became blind 
to the perception of impropriety -- "(a)nd to a politician," writes Barry, 
"perception was virtually reality." Wright's rule was simple: "My position now 
is if the law says it's all right, I'll take the money." Indeed, he did not 
ever break the law, but he also did not behave with the prudence Americans have 
the right to expect from the speaker of the house -- and in the end, he seemed 
to realize it. One of the many moving passages about his personal anguish comes 
soon before his resignation, when he says to his daughter, Ginger Brown: "We 
were just greedy. Damn it." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's undeniable lapses end up appearing not as capital crimes but merely 
Capitol ones -- levers to be used against him by adversaries who, had these 
levers not been available, might well have contrived others. "Jim Wright is the 
symbol of Democratic control of the House," Gingrich said. "I don't think he's 
a Mafia don. He's a symbol of the machine." While Wright is hardly blameless, 
few people in the book look much better. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the excellent statesmen on the House ethics committee who claimed 
Wright had committed 69 violations of House rules had in 1987 refused to take 
any disciplinary action against a millionaire Rhode Island congressman, 
Democrat Fernand J. St. Germain, even though he had allegedly violated those 
highly malleable House rules and federal law as well. His district's voters 
called him home instead last year. Stinging from charges it had gone too easy 
in that case, the committee went outside Congress and hired an ambitious 
Chicago lawyer, Richard Phelan, to investigate Wright. Phelan dug into Wright 
with a vengeance. According to Barry, whose case is compelling, the 
investigator "misled the committee repeatedly" and in the wake of Wright's 
resignation was already hinting coyly about running for governor of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
So when Barry picked "The Ambition and the Power" for his title, he clearly 
didn't mean just Wright's. This was not a morality play about an unethical man 
being brought to account by his better. It was a classic power struggle that 
Wright lost and his ambitious antagonists won. One reason he was a target to 
begin with was that, had he prevailed, he would probably have been a force to 
reckon with in Washington for a generation. "If he survives this ethical 
thing," said Gingrich, in the midst of working virtually around the clock to 
ensure that Wright would not, "he may become the greatest Speaker since Clay." 
</P>
<P>
This statement would be nonsensical only to the reader who did not understand 
that Gingrich seemed to personify all the rage of a Republican minority that 
had not known real power in the House of Representatives for more than three 
decades and that, during the 100th Congress, sweated under a Democratic 
speaker's lash more than they ever had under Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, Carl 
Albert, or John McCormack. Being in the minority under them was never fun, 
though one Republican, California's Jerry Lewis, was honest enough to concede 
that "We have just enough votes to be irresponsible." But being in the minority 
under Wright was something else again. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Wright's vision and Reagan's Iran-contra-induced weakness, the 
100th Congress was, in the estimation of Barry and many liberally inclined 
pundits, "the most productive in decades." It produced dramatic overrides of 
two Reagan vetoes. It produced major domestic legislation in an era when the 
budget deficit had seemed to have finally put Democrats out of the domestic 
legislation business. It produced the spark that led to the Arias peace plan in 
Central America. And it also produced many, many congressmen who were mad as 
hell at Wright for the blood and sweat he squeezed from them while making it 
all happen. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows how Wright's handling of the congressional pay raise early last 
year -- the one they wanted without having actually to ask for it -- helped 
forge one of the nails for his coffin. But pay raises aren't the only things 
our representatives don't care to vote on. When Wright scheduled a vote on a 
pro-labor bill, at a meeting "(o)ne member jumped to his feet, waved a doughnut 
in the air, and complained, '. . . My (state's) two senators go into the 
AFL-CIO convention and get a standing ovation. Then they walk across the street 
to the Chamber of Commerce convention and get a standing ovation. And the 
reason they do this is that the Senate is smart enough not to schedule any damn 
labor bills for a vote! Why are we scheduling one for a vote?' " Snapped Wright 
in another context, "That's the trouble with this place. Too many here who 
shouldn't be in Congress. No guts. That's what leadership is. If you don't have 
it, you shouldn't be in government." 
</P>
<P>
Wright had the gall to articulate a vision of the national interest and expect 
members to help advance it. Whether one happens to agree with it doesn't much 
matter. If Wright had been a Republican speaker forcing his will by means of a 
Republican majority, he would have engendered the same resentments on both 
sides of the aisle. The principal business of the House is neither policy nor 
ideology but rather protecting each member's individual political interests. 
O'Neill himself said: "Jim doesn't have the ability to put his arm around a 
member and just listen to his problems." So in the closing weeks of Wright's 
political career, "the Democrats did not rally to him. No Democrat on the 
(ethics) committee worked his colleagues in the off-hours, talked to them on 
the floor, took them to dinner, called Phelan a liar . . . . (They) did not so 
much kill him as let him die." 
</P>
<P>
Even the reader who feels respect and compassion for Wright and anger at the 
cynicism of some of those who helped bring him down may wonder whether he was 
quite the man for the job. For one thing, his judgment was severely lacking at 
times. The shrewd legislator who refused to intervene in the Iran-contra 
investigation because "entangling himself in areas beyond his control was a 
fool's errand" failed to understand that he was doing precisely that in the way 
he conducted his personal affairs. One also wonders about a man who "wanted to 
elevate the Speakership to a new level of power, almost equivalent to the 
Presidency." In late 1987, when he and Reagan appeared together at the White 
House to announce a compromise on the budget, the President "shuffled about the 
stage uncertain where to stand" while Wright fielded reporters' questions about 
income taxes. "Wright had become his clear rival," writes Barry, and it is fair 
to ask: Who, besides a few hundred thousand voters in Ft. Worth, elected him as 
pretender to the throne? 
</P>
<P>
By pushing so hard, in a way, Wright was asking for precisely the treatment he 
got. If he had sought less power, he would have run less risk. Conversely, to 
pull off the institutional realignment he contemplated, to propel himself to a 
position in American political life on a virtual par with the President, he 
would have had to be as clean as Snow White. And even then, Gingrich might have 
been able to nail him for copyright violations.

A FALLIBLE BUT LOVING FATHER; 
</P>
<P>
A PLACE FOR US BY NICHOLAS GAGE (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95; 419 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Eric Larsen, Author of the novel, An American Memory (Anchor Books), Larsen 
teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nicholas Gage published in 1983 the successful and now widely famous "Eleni," 
the story of his mother's execution by firing squad in 1948 at the hands of 
Communist guerrillas near the end of the Greek civil war. Now, with similarly 
painstaking detail and thoroughness, he has produced a sequel to that work, 
picking up his family's story in 1949, when Gage and three of his sisters came 
to America (the fourth, still in forced conscription behind Communist lines, 
was to arrive later), and continuing it up to the death of their father, 
Christos Gatzoyiannis, in 1983, the same year that saw publication of "Eleni." 
</P>
<P>
Gage made no secret of the driving forces behind the writing of that earlier 
book -- his own emotional need to confront at last the entire truth about his 
mother's death; his towering, Olympian outrage at the murderous injustice of 
it. The question that arises here is whether there exists another Gage-family 
subject of power and moment equal to the death of Eleni, or of sufficient 
dramatic weight to propel a second book of much the same breadth and scope. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, although it may take a reader some time to come to a realization of 
it, seems to be that, yes, maybe there is, although it's by far a quieter, more 
domestic, less-tragic (and often repetitive, doubling back over the earlier 
work) theme that lies at the heart of this longish effort. Gage writes this 
time around about Greek-American life over some decades, but he writes also, 
and more centrally, about the character of his father, whom Gage had come to 
blame fiercely -- and unjustly, he finds -- as being the one ultimately 
responsible for Eleni's death. 
</P>
<P>
Christos Gatzoyiannis came to America back in 1910, at age 17, drawn by the 
fabled wealth that could be earned there. Working first as a day laborer and 
then, with a countryman as partner, starting a fruit- and produce-delivery 
business in Worcester, Mass., he did well enough to make return visits home 
with a big-spending and Midas-like aura about him, but never enough to return 
for good. On one such visit back to his remote, northern-Greek village of Lia, 
he married 17-year-old Eleni Haidis (by then it was 1926), and on subsequent 
return visits, Christos sired an unbroken string of four daughters, causing the 
wedded but most of the time separated couple to despair that they would ever 
produce a son. In 1939, at last a son was conceived -- to become, of course, 
Nicholas Gage; but almost at once, World War II intervened, and soon after that 
came the Greek civil war, isolating the Gatzoyiannis family in the war-torn 
country and making it impossible for Christos to return from America. He was 
not ever to see Eleni again, nor would he see his son Nicholas until 1949, when 
the children came to join him in Worcester. 
</P>
<P>
Here, then, begins the new story proper, and it opens with disappointment. 
Expecting to find a prospering father of wealth and influence, these children 
from the poor northern mountains discover instead that Christos has suffered 
business reversals, that he is hardly Midas, that in America, there will in 
fact be scarcely enough to go around. "(Even) Father's irrepressible optimism," 
Gage writes, "must have wavered on that day in March, 1949, when his newly 
arrived children discovered that he was not the tycoon they believed but an 
out-of-work, fifty-six-year-old short-order cook." 
</P>
<P>
The book's first half edges slowly toward its later pace and theme, chronicling 
what often feels like the by now very nearly conventionalized -- certainly the 
oft-told -- vagaries and struggles of growing up in America foreign and poor. 
Gage's commitment to this long and sometimes touching album of detailed family 
and immigrant-community life -- marriages, illnesses, job losses, setbacks, 
unflagging efforts to keep up old customs, school and playground tribulations 
-- is never in doubt, but the book takes greater and fresher dramatic hold as 
it becomes more and more apparent that its real subject is Christos 
Gatzoyiannis himself. 
</P>
<P>
Telling the story of his own American boyhood and schooling (unlike his more 
vulnerable and less adaptable sisters, he is a great success in school), Gage 
also tells the story of the bitter resentment he felt toward his aging father 
-- not only for his general failure, after all those years in Worcester, to 
achieve wealth and high position, but more specifically for his failure to 
bring his family out of Greece in time to have saved the beloved Eleni's life. 
The young Gage's unexpressed resentment takes the form of various youthful 
rebellions and misjudgments -- stealing money from his father, lying to friends 
about his family's affluence, brushing sleeves with a youthful neighborhood 
crime ring -- as the boy, all the while, waits for the opportune moment when he 
can unburden himself fully and condemn his father openly for his many failures. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point comes by surprise in early high school, though, when Gage, 
driving a "borrowed" car, causes a half-serious accident and then leaves the 
scene, getting in trouble with the law. The boy expects the towering and 
pitiless wrath of his father to fall upon him, but finds instead that the 
suddenly pensive Christos takes the blame upon himself and chooses this 
opportunity to admit his own failures in not having brought his family from 
Greece in the short respite between the Nazi occupation and the start of the 
civil war. " 'They said the guerrillas were fighting for democracy. I believed 
it,' " he tells Gage. " 'I want you to know that I loved your mother very 
much,' he said. 'Not a day, not an hour goes by when I don't think of her and 
how I failed her. I failed all of you, and all I can say is that I never meant 
it to happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
Seeing his father now by a human scale, "naive and fallible" but deeply loving, 
Gage carries on the Gatzoyiannis saga with his father placed at the dramatic 
and symbolic center of it: the flawed but honored, loved and loving, 
instinctively generous patriarch residing in the midst of a growing and 
increasingly thriving clan. Sisters marry; grandchildren are born; sons-in-law 
open pizza stores and begin to thrive after years of uncertainty and bare 
survival. Gage's own success story -- discovering journalism in high school; 
working his way through Boston University; receiving, in 1963, a national 
journalism award personally from President Kennedy's hand; joining the staff of 
the New York Times -- is saved from self-indulgence by being made the story of 
Christos Gatzoyiannis' success as much as of Gage's own. Says Christos, now an 
old man: " 'Educated son with college degree. Honors from the hand of the 
President. What more I want out of life? Don't care if I drop dead tomorrow, 
I'm satisfied.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gage is not a high stylist ("Olga rose from her sickbed like Lazarus from the 
dead, her heart bursting with joy") or always his own best editor against the 
seduction of repetitiousness or the clankingly forced detail (" 'But I thought 
Nassio betrayed you by selling the produce truck and buying the restaurant and 
never making you a partner!' exclaimed Olga"). But in general, what he gives us 
here, written in homage to his mother and father and their long domestic and 
tragic past, are large, unpolished handfuls of life and memory and love, 
unpretentious, unfalsified, and therefore welcome.

Photo, Immigrants leaving Ellis Island in 1910. After decades of abandonment, 
the famous gateway through which so many immigrants passed into America has 
finally been restored. "Ellis Island: Echoes From a Nation's Past" (Aperture: 
$39.95) accompanies an exhibition that will be mounted in conjunction with the 
monument's opening to visitors next year. The book, edited by Susan Jones, 
includes an extensive history of the Island and a detailed study of its 
architecture, as well as a moving personal essay on the years of neglect by the 
recently-deceased Aperture board chairman Shirley C. Burden. A celebration of 
photography as well as a document of the place, "Ellis Island" contains images 
by such well-known art photographers as Jerry Uelsmann and Emmet Gowin. Filled 
with dozens of family portraits and both historic and contemporary documentary 
photos, the book resists the temptation for superficial flag-waving, instead 
providing a thoughtful and loving portrait of this sacred landmark in the 
American soul.

SCHWARZ'S SEATTLE SYMPHONY ON RECORD: FLEXIBLE, TIGHT-KNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the old, established American symphony orchestras become increasingly intent 
on pricing themselves out of the recording market, a few of what were once 
considered provincial orchestras are being actively courted. Not by the old, 
established labels but by the nouveau likes of Los Angeles-based Delos, whose 
existence is centered on the Seattle Symphony Orchestra under music director 
Gerard Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle comes to recordings relatively cheaply, a consequence of modest wages; 
grants from the pre-Serrano/Mapplethorpe National Endowment for the Arts; and 
freedom from financial restraints imposed by the American Federation of 
Musicians, which the SSO has dumped in favor of its own, home-grown union. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in learning how flexible and tight-knit an ensemble this is 
need go no further than Bartok's hair-raising "Miraculous Mandarin" -- the 
complete 30-minute ballet score rather than the usual suite (Delos 3083). 
</P>
<P>
In live performance one can get away with all sorts of murder in this noisy 
score unless one leads it sluggishly. Schwarz hardly does that, keeping it 
appropriately tense: not through speed but through rhythmic and ensemble 
control, with the strings permitted their lyric moments rather than burying 
them under the braying brass and screeching woodwinds. 
</P>
<P>
The coupling, however, with Kodaly's oft-recorded "Hary Janos" Suite and 
"Galanta" Dances seems gratuitous. 
</P>
<P>
Another release combines a pair of reputed musical monstrosities by Richard 
Strauss: his "Josephslegende" ballet and "Symphonia Domestica" (3082). 
</P>
<P>
We are spared the hour-long "Josephslegende," with its galumphing glosses on 
"Rosenkavalier," and offered instead the composer's 29-minute suite. The 
compression works wonders, exposing some liltingly delicate music otherwise 
lost amid the dross. 
</P>
<P>
The "Symphonia" usually sinks under the weight of its bombast and leaden wit. 
Schwarz, surprisingly, takes the score at very moderate tempos (he was a 
speed-demon during his Los Angeles days) maintaining rhythmic clarity and 
uncovering a wealth of subtle instrumental detail, with the assistance of 
Delos' illuminating sonics. The SSO strings and solo woodwinds shine 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
The least known music here is a program (3059) of works by Stephen Albert, a 
48-year-old New Yorker and recent Seattle Symphony composer-in-residence whose 
Violin Concerto ("In Concordiam") makes a neutral, if not unpleasant, initial 
impression. The score carries on a constant flirtation with tonality within its 
mildly dissonant framework, suggesting Ravel, Berg, Puccini and something 
vaguely Hebraic during its course. 
</P>
<P>
The romantically virtuosic solo is powerfully projected by SSO concertmaster 
Ilkka Talvi, formerly of Schwarz's Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The longer, if not necessarily more substantial coupling is "TreeStone", 
Albert's James Joyce settings, in which Schwarz leads the New York Chamber 
Symphony, with vocal soloists Lucy Shelton and David Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
A Schumann program combining the "Spring" Symphony, the Overture, Scherzo and 
Finale, and Opus 86 "Konzertstuck" is a delightful, instructive surprise 
(3084). 
</P>
<P>
Braving exceedingly glamorous competition, Schwarz and his dedicated players 
make some potent points: above all, that they take the familiar symphony more 
seriously than the nominal big boys, not only executing with pinpoint accuracy 
but with extraordinary fidelity to Schumann's score. Note the theme of the 
symphony's Scherzo, here played legato, and sounding all the grander for it, 
than the usual staccato. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Schwarz does some preening with the "Konzertstuck" for four horns and 
orchestra. Its solo quartet, led by Robert Bonnevie, gives notice that it can 
blast, croon and negotiate Schumann's trickiest hurdles at least as well as 
their counterparts in any orchestra, anywhere.

RECORD RACK: RISK-FREE FARE FROM PHIL COLLINS; 
</P>
<P>
PHIL COLLINS " . . . BUT SERIOUSLY." ATLANTIC * 1/2: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A 
SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).

<P>
Since Collins hardly has deviated from the hot-selling, Grammy-sweeping formula 
of his last solo album, an alternative title might be in order here: "No 
Gumption Required." 
</P>
<P>
This is stand-pat, risk-free music-making, as safe and innocuous as it gets. 
Take a temperate, user-friendly singing voice, stir in plenty of catchy hooks, 
shiny production and toe-tapping rhythms, punching it all up with bright horns 
or mellowing it out with a caressing keyboard haze, and there you have it: more 
hit product. 
</P>
<P>
The formula would be easier to swallow if Collins were just a blithe popster 
purveying silly love songs, but he tries here to stake a claim to substance as 
well. We get a song about African famine and apartheid, two unrelated issues 
for the price of one. We get songs about the homeless, and about the 
indifference of the powers that be. But instead of poetic insight and edgy, 
unsettling music calculated to bring home the roiling conflict and bitter 
emotion at the heart of these issues, Collins feeds us stock images and the 
sort of routine pity and vaguely helpless feeling already familiar to anybody 
who reads a newspaper or watches a news broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
A similar blandness pervades Collins' songs about broken love: How can you 
capture depths of aching feeling when nearly every line is a cliche, and every 
note comes across sleek and unmussed? " . . . But Seriously" may be the 
sincere, craftsmanlike and well-intentioned effort of a real nice guy, but it 
all adds up to the sound of a fat cat purring. MIKE BOEHM

RECORD RACK: RAP / FUNK RAUNCH BY ARSENIO'S LITTLE 'BRO';

Hall should have the last laugh on his pal Eddie Murphy, who's had little luck 
making records as a straight singer. Hall may one-up Murphy by selling tons of 
albums in which he adds funky music to what he does best -- comedy. 
</P>
<P>
This is a raunchy, frequently hilarious album that's part rap -- reflecting 
influences by the Fat Boys and Heavy D -- and part funk, done in the 
talk-singing style of George Clinton and Cameo's Larry Blackmon. Hall does no 
straight singing, which is probably for the best. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who wrote and co-produced the album, performs under the persona of Chunky 
A, an alter ego presented as his rowdy, decadent, chubby younger brother. Many 
guys will crack up at las 
</P>
<P>
civious songs like "Dipstick +," "Stank Breath" (about the woes of having a 
girlfriend with bad breath) and "Ho Is Lazy" (ho is ghetto slang for woman, 
coming from whore), done to the tune of the Fine Young Cannibals' "She Drives 
Me Crazy." Some women, though, won't be able to see the humor for the sexism. 
</P>
<P>
Hall turns sassy funkster on "Owwww!" and "I Command You to Dance," but he's 
better on songs that have stronger emphasis on comedy, like "Sorry," a contrite 
lover's side-splitting confession of a series of wrongdoings, and the Prince 
parody "Very High Key." 
</P>
<P>
The album ends on a serious note, with the anti-drug plea "Dope, the Big Lie" 
-- featuring guest comments by the likes of Paula Abdul and Ice-T. It sort of 
breaks the mood, but Hall obviously wants to get across the message that he's 
not all fun and games. DENNIS HUNT

THE BLACKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm not saying the blacklist didn't have an emotional effect on us; it did. 
Hugo was a fine writer and a devoted craftsman, and struggling to survive as a 
writer in a country where the language was not his own -- at a time in history 
when he couldn't even write under his own name -- added a terrible frustration 
to the problems of supporting six children. And yes, he was a pretty awesome 
paterfamilias; after all, he worked largely at home, and our house in Mexico 
was small. But he was also a wonderful paterfamilias: He instituted weekly 
baseball games, and picnics, and trips to Acapulco, and stories at bedtime 
every Saturday night, and a hundred other kinds of adventures. So it seems 
unfair to paint the family portrait in such heavy colors, when we had glorious 
times, too. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy was that he died young -- at 53 -- and before that had undergone a 
serious personality change (from a then-undiagnosed arteriosclerotic brain 
disease), so the older children never got a chance to know him as adults and 
equals, and the memories of the younger ones are affected by his last illness. 
</P>
<P>
Flawed? Of course. We all are. But he gave us a fascinating life in Mexico and 
still managed, against terrible odds, to do some of his best writing there. And 
after all the injustices he suffered because of his politics, I don't want the 
only written record of him as a human being to be such a negative one. He 
deserved better.

THE BLACKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Children of the Blacklist," by Jack Mathews (Oct. 15), gave me a jolt. I was 
one of the blacklisted, although not important enough in either "the party" or 
"the industry" to be called before HUAC. Needless to say, I avidly absorbed the 
photos and the text -- and then I came to Hugo Butler. I worked with Hugo for 
many, many months and became friends with him and with his wife, Jean. I can 
tell you that he was one of the most original, delightful, engaging 
personalities I ever knew. It is simply not possible that he could have been a 
monster in private. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Mathews was irresponsible in using only the interview with Mary Hugo. He 
had to see that her input was not pertinent. He mentioned that Hugo had five 
daughters. Why didn't he interview any of the others?

A CHINA WATCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Orville Schell now realizes that he has been somewhat mistaken about the 
government of China ("The Re-Education of a China Watcher," by Jacques Leslie, 
Oct. 15). Hasn't he ever heard of the large-scale executions that took place 
there in the 1950s? What about the ongoing genocide against the Tibetans that 
has recently intensified? 
</P>
<P>
May we be protected from these naive, starry-eyed "China experts." Their 
misinformation is partly responsible for the continual misery of the Chinese 
people and our own befuddlement and inaction over events in China.

The Ansel Adams photograph, "Winter Sunrise, The Sierra Nevada, from Lone Pine, 
Calif.," shown as part of "Picturing California" (Sept. 3), reminded me of the 
absolutely magnificent views of that mountain range that can be seen from 
Highway 395 and the incredibly talented eye possessed by Adams. However, if the 
camera is looking west toward the north-south Sierra Nevada range from Lone 
Pine, the rays of the morning sun should be coming from behind. Can you shed 
any light on this quirk of nature?

The Constitution guarantees "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" to all 
citizens, not just those who are "normal" and thereby declare themselves 
non-handicapped and in some way superior. 
</P>
<P>
The mind-set that by virtue of a three-digit IQ we are dominant beings elected 
to oversee selective reproduction is not unlike the reasoning some half-century 
ago when only the blond and blue-eyed were to be allowed to procreate. 
</P>
<P>
As the writers of "L.A. Law" are so eloquently attempting to illustrate, the 
mentally retarded can be quite capable of making decisions regarding 
responsible sexual behavior if they are afforded the simple luxury of an 
unbiased education. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, some of my favorite people are dark-eyed. And some are mentally 
retarded.

Joan Siegel, in her Nov. 12 letter, not only missed the message in the first 
episode of television's "L.A. Law" but also misinterpreted its thrust. 
</P>
<P>
The characters Benny and Alice were not encouraged to have children. In the 
last scene, they both echoed what had been stated earlier -- they didn't think 
they should have children and listed myriad reasons why. 
</P>
<P>
The message was that care takers, even if a parent, do not have the right to 
have their mentally retarded charges sterilized arbitrarily. 
</P>
<P>
I felt that the writers did an outstanding job in showing that the father is 
very caring and felt that he was acting in Alice's best interests in deciding 
that she be sterilized. However, that decision was shown to be extremely 
questionable at best and morally wrong. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud "L.A. Law" for showing all aspects of what could be described as a 
"delicate issue."

A 'REAL' TV WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been much criticism of the portrayal of women in the new crop of TV 
shows this fall, but there is one show I want to commend. 
</P>
<P>
That show is "Peaceable Kingdom." Somehow, in the midst of America's TV 
wasteland, this show successfully portrays: a woman in a leadership position 
who is competent at both management and parenting; realistic conflict among 
adults; a message of ecological concern and value; real-life child-rearing 
issues that interest kids of nearly all ages; no unrealistic or gratuitous 
violence and sex, just reasonably healthy relationships and normal motivations.

Wher else on the major networks can we find so much to admire -- and enjoy -- 
in one hour?

Smith states that Mozart would love his new programming. Mozart, when playing, 
would not abide a cough from an audience member. What makes Mr. Smith think 
that he would appreciate hearing his works truncated or sandwiched between 
jazz?

If Smith believes he can sucker a jazz lover into listening to Mahler he is 
mistaken. His programming change can be likened to casting Disney characters in 
a play by Eugene O'Neill.

Re "Classical Music Radio: What's Not Too Stuffy and Yet Not Too Hip?" by 
Claudia Puig, Nov. 19: I wish all those people sending hate mail to Wallace 
Smith, KUSC-FM general manager, would stop. The new format is absolutely 
terrific.

Every time a KUSC radio personality starts bumbling through some "imponderable" 
or a traffic report or programs only a single movement from some work, I simply 
turn off the radio and go for a walk. It's wonderful! In the last two months 
I've lost 23 pounds.

Keep up the good work, Dr. Smith. By this time next year I should be ready for 
a marathon!

AN AMERICAN STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with sadness and more than a bit of anger that I read Dan Sullivan's 
Nov. 19 article on the supposed lack of classical American actors ("Into the 
Breach With Branagh"). 
</P>
<P>
As an actor who has done most of her work in the classics and has been 
fortunate enough to work with world-class American actors and directors on the 
classics, I was appalled by Sullivan's uniformed and chauvinistically 
anglophile observations. 
</P>
<P>
First, to say that Taper executive Gordon Davidson's decision to bring over a 
British company to do Shakespeare is "gutsy" is both offensive and ridiculous. 
What would be gutsy would be to use classical American actors who are well 
versed in the language plays, not just personality actors whose last brush with 
Shakespeare may have been their high school English class. (I recognize the 
need for box-office draw, but I believe the American public would respond as 
well to quality as to TV-Q.) 
</P>
<P>
Come, Mr. Sullivan, in this day of foreign interests buying up our country 
right and left, don't sell out our actors too!

THE ORACLE

CERTAINLY, NO OTHER turntable matches the Oracle's visual appeal -- a trait 
that has won it cult-object status. The Oracle boasts an unforgettable "naked" 
appearance. Instead of hiding inside the customary rectangular box beneath the 
platter, the motor and spring suspension are exposed; the platter is hung from 
three big spring "towers." Oracle's rationale: The top and sides of a 
conventional base act as a resonating chamber that absorbs acoustic energy from 
the loudspeakers, which the stylus then picks up, muddying the sound. The 
Oracle sounds like a marriage between philosophy and technology, which in fact 
were the subjects being taught at the University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, by 
professor Marcel Riendeau in 1979 when he developed the Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
Other Oracle innovations have been copied by virtually every other turntable 
manufacturer with high-end aspirations, such as the smooth platter mat 
(previous mats were ridged) and the turntable spindle threaded to accept a 
clamp. The clamp screws down tightly, to force the entire record's surface into 
contact with the mat. The procedure smoothes out record warps, yet makes 
warp-free records sound even better. For the record can no longer resonate in 
response to motor vibrations, loudspeaker feedback or even forces as subtle as 
the buildup of energy in the vinyl induced by the stylus as it traces the 
grooves -- all factors detracting from clean sound. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a friend replaced his 1979-vintage turntable, among the best machines 
in the days before spindle clamps, with an Oracle. The improvement in musical 
detail was startling. Specifically, what had sounded -- on the Philips 
recording of Mendelssohn's Second Symphony with the London Philharmonic 
Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Chailly -- like an additional, mushy woodwind 
instrument was revealed by the Oracle to be a pipe organ. Another mystery 
resolved by the Oracle's Delphic powers was the meadow scene of Act I of 
Wagner's "Tannhauser" (Vienna Philharmonic / Solti / London Records), wherein 
the pilgrims march off to Rome. Formerly, it had seemed dense and meandering. 
The Oracle disclosed that the recording producer had embellished Wagner's low 
brass chords, in the trombones and tuba, by dubbing in faint, distant church 
bells. As the Oracle proves, there's still gold to be prospected in them thar' 
vinyl microgrooves.

 Oracle turntable prices range from about $700 to $2,000. Available from 
Optimal Enchantment in Santa Monica; G.N.P. in Pasadena; Rogersound Labs in 
Canoga Park; Stereo Vision in Encinitas, and from Brooks Berdan Ltd., in Temple 
City. Berdan has built an impressive reputation in audio magazines as the 
world-champion Oracle "tweaker." His modification costs $300 to $500, depending 
on the turntable's date of manufacture and the tone arm used.

ENGLISH BONE CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ONE OF THE great contributions made to the world by the English potteries in 
North Staffordshire was the development of bone china in the early 19th 
Century. Tradition holds that the technique was discovered by one of the local 
potters, Josiah Spode, who was looking for an inexpensive way to duplicate true 
porcelain, that splendid product that had been imported from China for more 
than 200 years. Spode's bone china turned out to be very much like Chinese 
porcelain: He simply added bone ash to kaolin and feldspar (discovered at the 
time in Cornwall) in order to make a paste more manageable in the kiln than 
porcelain. In addition, it was lighter, whiter and easier to decorate than 
either true "China" or the hard-paste porcelain favored by the Continental 
potters at Meissen and Sevres. 
</P>
<P>
European porcelains in the 18th Century -- the "hard pastes" made in imitation 
of Chinese pottery and the French and English "soft pastes" -- were soon 
superseded by Spode's invention. It was a better product in every way, and the 
bone china of the early 18th Century is virtually the same material that is 
used today in England and elsewhere for tablewares. 
</P>
<P>
For many years Spode, Son and Copeland (Copeland was the London representative 
of the firm whose family eventually took over the business) was the finest mark 
of English bone china. In addition, Josiah Spode II, the son of Josiah Spode, 
became one of the first English potters to apply gilding to bone china, making 
many handsome adaptations (known as "Japans") of Japanese Imari ware. The 
variety of objects made from bone china and decorated lavishly by Spode is 
without end: punch bowls, mugs, sugar boxes, butter tubs, roll trays, supper 
plates, broth bowls, toast racks, steak dishes, radish trays, cheese toasters, 
scent jars, ink stands, card racks, snuff boxes, rouge pots and violet baskets. 
Bone china, of course, was produced by many other Staffordshire potters during 
the 19th and 20th centuries: Minton, Worcester, Coalport -- and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Prices vary considerably, depending on the age of the porcelain: mugs of 
various sizes for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, 1897, $75 to $250; a 
blue-and-white oval foot bath with handles, 18 inches wide, late 18th Century, 
$1,500 to $2,600; Copeland Spode blue, red and gilt revolving tray on stand 
with six matching cups and saucers, $400 to $500, and George III tea service, 
each piece hand-enameled on a white ground, $700. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for English bone china at Robert Stewart Reed and Charles Gill, both in 
Los Angeles; Richard Gould, Main Street Antiques, and Something Old, Something 
Nouveau, all in Santa Monica; Roberta Gauthey and Richard Yeakel, both in 
Laguna Beach; Panache Unlimited in Fullerton; Jay's Antiques and Green Dolphin 
Street Antiques, both in Pasadena.

UNFAIR TO HARVARD SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You have misportrayed the students, faculty and parents of Harvard School. 
</P>
<P>
You said the opinion of Westlake's administration concerning Harvard boys was 
that they are "obnoxious." If Westlake truly believed this, they would 
certainly halt the proposed merger. After all, both Harvard and Westlake 
Schools exist to benefit the students. 
</P>
<P>
You also pointed out that Harvard Headmaster Thomas Hudnut was a member of an 
exclusive, all-male club in the District of Columbia. The fact that the club 
has since changed its policies about admitting women shows that men and women 
are breaking traditions in order to work together in our ever-changing society. 
Like a club changing its admission policies, the merger of Harvard and Westlake 
Schools is meant to preserve and enhance the heritages of both schools, to the 
benefit of all the students. 
</P>
<P>
Also of great concern was your mention that the Harvard-Westlake School may 
need zoning changes and/or conditional-use permits and that a Westlake father 
sits on the city Planning Commission, while a Harvard father serves on the 
Board of Zoning Appeals. If, by this snide remark, you are suggesting that 
Harvard and Westlake Schools use political influence to gain flavors, I would 
like to hear about it. But until you have facts stating so, please do not 
bad-mouth two fine institutions.

PUBLIC DEFENDER NOW A VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has been my husband for 22 years and he has been a public defender for 24 
years. His name is Howard Waco and he has never been a victim. 
</P>
<P>
After we had been married for a few years, I began to tell him about my 
family's background. My parents had been victims, survivors of concentration 
camps in Germany, where I was born and raised. My father's entire family was 
murdered. My mother lost her parents, a sister, a brother, a niece and many 
other family members. The most important loss of all was the loss of human 
dignity, the loss of trust, the loss of security, the loss of self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
My husband could not understand. My husband was unable to comprehend how people 
allowed to let themselves be led to slaughter. "Didn't they resist?" he asked. 
"Didn't they fight back?" 
</P>
<P>
"But . . . but . . . but . . . " He could not understand. 
</P>
<P>
Until yesterday morning (Nov. 6) in Van Nuys Superior Court. Yesterday, he 
understood what it means to be a victim. Yesterday, when he was grabbed and 
with brute force removed by two police officers, acting on orders of a judge, 
from one courtroom, dragged down a hallway to the other end of the building, 
thrown against a door and tossed inside another courthouse like a piece of 
trash, still clutching his court file, yesterday, he knew. He knew how it feels 
to be helpless, how it feels to be a victim. He knew. And now he understands.

TECHNOLOGY COMPETITION: TIME TO FIGHT 'EM OR JOIN 'EM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should the U.S. electronics industry try to beat its Japanese competitors or 
join them? Or can it do both? 
</P>
<P>
A battle is raging within the nation's largest and most important manufacturing 
industry over just how to cope with the international competition that is 
reshaping such formerly divergent sectors as computers, consumer electronics 
and telecommunications into one gigantic global industry. 
</P>
<P>
The most promising strategy for the 1990s and beyond, a number of analysts 
believe, is to pursue both competition and cooperation with Japanese and 
European firms simultaneously. American electronics firms are trying, although 
they are having a hard time striking the right balance. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events reflect that. At the same time that seven major American 
electronics firms are pursuing efforts to put together a consortium aimed at 
counterbalancing Japanese dominance of the computer memory chip market, other 
companies are turning their backs on such U.S. alliances and forging closer and 
closer ties with Japanese manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few firms, such as International Business Machines, Motorola and Texas 
Instruments, are trying -- with varying degrees of success -- to pursue these 
different approaches at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
A parallel battle is proceeding in Washington. And in the view of many 
high-tech firms and analysts, federal policy-makers are only making life more 
difficult for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
As the still-powerful U.S. electronics industry gropes for a new strategy, 
Washington remains locked into its old way of looking at things -- to subsidize 
or not to subsidize. Like a fun-house mirror, Washington's debate reflects the 
industry's internal struggle in a grossly distorted way. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies like IBM, DEC (Digital Equipment Corp.) and others are pursuing a 
very sophisticated strategy involving both international and domestic 
partnerships," said Jeffrey Hart, an Indiana University professor who is a 
high-tech expert for the University of California's Berkeley Roundtable for 
International Economics. "But it may be too sophisticated for Washington to 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, a host of powerful lawmakers insist that the U.S. electronics 
industry will collapse without large doses of government assistance. Most Bush 
Administration officials, by contrast, argue just as heatedly that providing 
substantial aid would only undermine market forces and foster a new forum for 
pork-barrel politics. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) warns that the Administration's approach would 
doom the U.S. electronics industry's effort to develop an all-American 
high-definition television industry. "What we are seeing is the economic 
equivalent of Neville Chamberlain's failure of nerve at Munich," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael J. Boskin, President Bush's top economic adviser, says it makes 
little sense to support certain firms just because they are headquartered in 
the United States. U.S. electronics companies stand to gain a good share of 
business -- making components and assembling them into final products -- if 
they merely participate in international cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's American-owned, Japanese-owned, German-owned or who-owned," 
Boskin said recently, "manufacturing in America in the '90s is going to be 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
The battle lines are less clear cut within the industry than within the 
government. Even as one lobbying group, the American Electronics Assn., 
besieges Washington with demands for help in catching up with Japan in 
high-definition television, U.S. semiconductor manufacturers based in Silicon 
Valley are scrambling on their own to make deals with the AEA's Japanese 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a gesture of good faith on Japan's part," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, the 
chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Assn., after concluding an agreement in 
Tokyo earlier this month that called for U.S. companies to design and produce 
critical HDTV components for Japanese manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The Cupertino, Calif.-based SIA itself wears two hats. It gathers under one 
umbrella the $200-million-a-year semiconductor consortium of U.S. industry and 
government known as Sematech. Simultaneously, it seeks to boost semiconductor 
sales to Japan through its HDTV deal. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Flam, an industry specialist at the Brookings Institution, says 
international deals such as that have made the old ways of looking at the 
electronics industry obsolete. "It is impossible to draw lines that divide the 
U.S. from the rest of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in trying to pursue both globalism and nationalism simultaneously, the 
electronics industry is being caught in the middle of Washington's age-old 
ideological debate over whether the government should intervene to support 
certain industrial sectors. 
</P>
<P>
"This controversy represents a clash of two ideas," said Jeff Faux of the 
Economic Policy Institute here. "Unless the government gets more involved, we 
face unilateral economic disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
The tension surfaced earlier this month on Capitol Hill when several members of 
Congress accused the Administration of trying to cut back on the relatively 
small amounts of federal funds now provided for certain high-tech projects by 
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a part of the Defense 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers charged that top Bush aides such as Boskin and Budget Director 
Richard G. Darman were trying to crush DARPA's high-tech projects. "The Bush 
Administration is waving the white flag," said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
Darman vigorously denies the accusations, however, and top Pentagon officials 
support his statements. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress wonder if U.S. firms are betraying American interests 
as they forge new ties with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't let another country control our future," said Rep. Helen Delich 
Bentley (R-Md.), "and that's what is happening when Americans sell out to the 
Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of aiding U.S. industry argue in response that the government is in 
no position to single out which industrial sectors are worthy of its support. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't be helping particular firms or particular products," said a 
high-level Administration official who asked not to be named. "The type of 
technology should be a type that applies across a host of sectors. But HDTV, 
for instance, didn't fit my version of the appropriate criteria." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the question of government funding, a 1984 law allowed U.S. 
companies to emulate the presumed Japanese virtue of cooperation. As a 
consequence, electronics companies have banded together in more than 100 
consortia to share the risks of costly research. 
</P>
<P>
The results so far, however, are thin. And a far more ambitious effort to carry 
such joint efforts into cooperative manufacturing appears to be running out of 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
The much-ballyhooed U.S. Memories consortium, formed earlier this year by seven 
leading computer and semiconductor makers, has so far failed to attract any 
additional sponsors despite a year-end deadline for signing up enough 
participants to get the project off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Headed by an ex-IBM executive, Sanford Kane, U.S. Memories is supposed to build 
from scratch a factory to make the next generation of computer memory chips. 
The goal was to lessen the dependence of American firms on the Japanese 
suppliers that dominate the market and undercut any advantage such control 
provides in spreading to new products where Americans still reign. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of leading U.S. computer firms -- including Apple Computer, Sun 
Microsystems and Compaq -- have decided not to join the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that many firms are now confident of the reliability of their 
Japanese chip suppliers and are seeking closer ties in Asia. Sun, for instance, 
has forged a strong relationship with Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan and has offered to 
license the operating system of its computer workstations to Asian computer 
firms to encourage its use abroad. 
</P>
<P>
There are also fears, though, that more than strictly business considerations 
are involved. Some analysts argue that certain firms have bowed to Japanese 
demands to steer away from all-American groups. "There has been quiet pressure 
from the Japanese to stay out of U.S. Memories," says Berkeley's Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry mavericks have questioned the need for U.S. Memories at all. 
</P>
<P>
T. J. Rodgers, president of Silicon Valley's hottest new company, Cypress 
Semiconductor, insists that his firm could manufacture advanced memory chips on 
its own if IBM would make available the technology it has promised to provide 
to U.S. Memories. Covering its bets, IBM has entered into talks with Cypress 
and Micron Technology, based in Boise, Ida., to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Washington, it is unclear just what the federal government could do to 
help the electronics industry even if policy-makers wanted to plunge ahead. 
With little extra money in the till, "the government's role must be limited and 
carefully designed to help and not hinder," said Earnest Ambler, the Commerce 
Department's undersecretary for technology. 
</P>
<P>
Most in-depth studies, such as the report prepared earlier this year by the 
Electronics Industries Assn. on HDTV, contend that the first priority of the 
federal government to boost industrial competitiveness should be to reduce the 
federal budget deficit, boost aid for education and press other nations to open 
their markets more widely. 
</P>
<P>
That should be more than enough to keep Washington busy.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: EAST BLOC NEEDS WESTERN SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE L. PERRY, GEORGE L. PERRY is a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution research organization in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The historic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe cry out for support 
from the West. We welcome the political and economic revolution sweeping the 
region and should be willing to help it succeed. The chances of success are 
greater if living standards improve; if they do not, hard-liners could once 
again come to power in the region. Thus, there may be a big payoff to economic 
assistance at this crucial juncture. 
</P>
<P>
All of the centrally directed economies face certain common problems as they 
try to become market economies. To varying degrees they lack some parts of the 
framework of a market economy -- entrepreneurial skills, institutions for 
creating and responding to market signals and other incentives, and financial 
instruments for channeling investment and risk taking. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, years of central planning in each country have left relative 
prices distorted and resources misallocated. Because of these shortcomings, 
total production is inefficiently low and what gets produced is not what 
consumers want. In some cases, these problems have worsened recently. 
</P>
<P>
In a market economy, these shortcomings would be corrected eventually. But 
getting from the present state to the market system may not be an easy 
transition. There is little precedent and no good theory to guide the process. 
And for a time the countries may face both more unemployment and higher 
inflation, as well as sharp increases in income inequality among workers. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment will rise as inefficient firms and industries are forced to lay 
off employees. Eventually these workers should find jobs where they can produce 
more and earn more. But all the needed jobs will not be immediately available; 
so, there will be transitional unemployment and the need to provide 
unemployment compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The inflation risk comes in part because the price of goods that have been 
heavily subsidized in the past will rise, while pent-up demand for goods that 
have been rationed or unavailable will push up their prices. Only gradually 
will expanded production lead to lower prices for these goods in a market 
economy. In addition, any transitional decline in total output may push up the 
average price level. 
</P>
<P>
With such problems looming, how can the Western industrial democracies aid in 
the transition from socialism? Western firms are already entering some Eastern 
European markets. Such direct investment and joint ventures between foreign and 
domestic firms can provide technical and entrepreneurial expertise, capital and 
immediate entree to the market economies of the world. For the long run, these 
are what the economies need the most. But in some countries, the transitional 
problems may require more immediate, macroeconomic assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, who has studied Poland's economic 
situation carefully and is an adviser to the Solidarity labor union, believes 
that Poland has much of the foundation needed for a market economy: 
entrepreneurial talent and a relatively skilled and educated work force. He is 
optimistic that foreign investors would be attracted to the new Polish economy. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Sachs sees a critical need for special financial support from the 
West to help maintain living standards and provide foreign exchange to permit 
imports and support Poland's currency during the transition to a market 
economy. Congress has recently provided for aid to Poland and Hungary, and 
other financial help will come from international agencies and other industrial 
democracies. Whether enough is forthcoming remains to be seen. With the Bush 
Administration pleading poverty in response to acknowledged domestic problems, 
it will be unlikely now to provide generous leadership on this international 
front. 
</P>
<P>
The problems, the stakes and the difficulties in providing assistance to 
Eastern Europe are all magnified when it comes to the Soviet Union. There the 
distortions of central control and bureaucratic oppression have existed for as 
long as any citizen can remember. Initiative and entrepreneurship are not only 
in short supply, they are feared and disliked by the average citizen. The 
handful of Soviet cooperatives that have sprung up and have prospered modestly 
by operating outside the centrally controlled economy are not admired for their 
accomplishments so much as they are mistrusted for fostering income inequality. 
</P>
<P>
If the economic situation in the Soviet Union has the furthest to go, it is 
also the most crucial. Soviet living standards have worsened during Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's reform period, and his leadership is at risk because of it. The 
incredible transformation that has taken place in the Soviet Bloc has happened 
because Gorbachev allowed it and encouraged it. If economic disaster were to 
lead to his overthrow by hard-liners, it would threaten progress in Eastern 
Europe as well. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that the stakes are especially high and problems with the 
Soviet economy are particularly grave, some kinds of assistance contemplated 
for Poland or Hungary will be less available to the Soviet Union. Its economy 
starts with less of the foundation needed for a market economy, and it is 
likely to be less attractive to foreign investors. And clearly, neither the 
public nor politicians are ready to send direct monetary aid to the Soviet 
Union the way they are to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
How then can we help? Certainly by finding ways to reduce defense spending in 
both the Soviet budget and our own. Probably by allowing technical transfers 
that have previously been discouraged or forbidden, by removing trade barriers 
and by encouraging direct involvement of U.S. firms in the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
But we may also need to contemplate more direct aid, such as through loans or 
subsidized grain sales, that would provide temporary economic assistance. 
Which, if any, of these initiatives would be appropriate, let alone politically 
saleable, is yet unclear. The important thing is that President Bush leave all 
such possibilities open. The sterile "read my lips" approach that he has 
brought to domestic budget problems with such sad results should not be carried 
over to this new arena.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: EVEN LOYAL IBM INVESTORS ARE SINGING THE 'BIG 
BLUES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When IBM's stock was soaring at around $175 a share just before the 1987 crash, 
there were undoubtably more than a few Monday morning investors who wished that 
they had bet the house on Big Blue. 
</P>
<P>
IBM shares have been trading under $100 a share recently, and those same 
investors are probably wondering if Big Blue (which can now appropriately be 
called Big Black-and-Blue) is still worth the gamble. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it's the stock to own," says Rick Martin, the analyst who 
follows IBM for Prudential-Bache Securities. He thinks that it will take years 
before IBM cleans up its act. 
</P>
<P>
Only two months ago, it seemed unfathomable that IBM's stock would be as cheap 
as $100 a share ever again. The last time the company's shares had sunk that 
low, after all, was in 1984. And even after the 1987 crash, IBM managed to stay 
$4 above the century mark. 
</P>
<P>
But the stock has fallen faster than anyone would have guessed, mainly because 
of disappointing corporate earnings that are expected to haunt the computer 
giant for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Martin thinks that IBM will earn just $9.50 a share this year, which is down 
substantially from the $9.80 that it earned in 1988. That $9.50 estimate is 
also substantially below the $10-a-share profit that Martin previously 
predicted for IBM this year. 
</P>
<P>
Martin is not the only one down on IBM. With the company's acquiescence, 
analysts have all been reducing their forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, isn't IBM at $100 a share a mighty attractive investment? Sanjiv 
Hingorani, IBM watcher for Salomon Bros., is telling clients to hold onto 
whatever shares they already own but not to buy any more. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a different company" than the one that everyone loved through much of 
the 1980s, Hingorani says. For one thing, IBM hasn't been able to sustain the 
15% revenue and earnings growth that people had come to take for granted. 
Growth is now around 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say some important decisions will have to be made by the management of 
the Armonk, N.Y., company in the next couple of years. For one thing, it will 
have to decide if it wants to aggressively price its new Summit mainframe 
computer that analysts expect to be introduced in 1991. "It will set the tone 
for pricing in the whole company," Martin says. 
</P>
<P>
IBM won't even acknowledge that it is working on a new mainframe, much less 
discuss pricing. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say IBM has lost ground in the computer business these past 
few years because it hasn't been pricing its products low enough. And the 
company abandoned its aggressive pricing practices, they say, because its costs 
got too high. That was mainly the result of IBM's practice of expanding its 
work force and refusing to lay off workers when they were no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
Something has to give, analysts say. Either IBM will be forced to reduce prices 
to improve its revenue and profits, or it will have to cut costs -- and people 
(maybe up to 50,000) -- from the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Wall Street thinks that investors should be spectators instead of 
participants, as IBM sorts things out -- even if the stock is singing a siren 
song. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Santa Claus Is Coming, So You'd Better Cash In 
</P>
<P>
Is the stock market getting you down? There's hope -- in about a month. That's 
when the market often goes into what one observer calls the "Santa Claus" 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
In 24 of the past 37 years, stock prices have risen significantly -- between 
0.9% and 1.7% -- in the last five trading days of the year and the first two 
days of January, according to Yale Hirsch, the unofficial keeper of market 
trivia. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch believes that the market rallies because any stock purchased during this 
period wouldn't show up on a professional's performance record until the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven times over those 37 years the market gained small amounts during those 
seven trading days and in six years it declined. 
</P>
<P>
But you'd better hope that Santa is good to investors this year. Bear markets 
followed the six years that the Santa Claus rally failed to develop, Hirsch 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for a Portfolio That's Lean and Mean 
</P>
<P>
If you don't want to commit financicide -- which I'll define as the mortal 
wounding of your assets -- it's time to whip your portfolio into shape for 
1990. You can start by ridding yourself of some of the shares that got flabby 
during the binge of the past decade, and put yourself on a strict diet of lean, 
up-and-coming stocks. 
</P>
<P>
And before it's too late, you'd better start locking in today's interest rates 
by buying some long-term bonds. Bonds may not be as attractive as they were 
earlier this year, but today's rates are likely to be the best you'll see for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
I recently called a number of financial experts -- the chief investment officer 
of Merrill Lynch, a top-rated money manager, a demographer, a tax planner and 
others -- for suggestions on what investors should be doing as the last decade 
of this century begins. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch &amp; 
Co., had to say. "We are in an environment where interest rates are likely to 
go lower," says Clough, who adds that America is entering the biggest slowdown 
in borrowing since World War II. And with fewer Americans buying cars and 
homes, Clough says, the Federal Reserve won't be able to keep interest rates up 
at current levels even if it wants to. 
</P>
<P>
So what's an investor to do? "Get out of your certificate of deposit. Each 
quarter you go to roll that over, the bank is going to give you less interest," 
says Clough. "The first thing an investor has to do is lock in the nearly 8% he 
can get in long-term Treasury bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Clough advises investors to keep 50% of their money in bonds and the rest in 
stocks. But pick the stocks carefully: That slowdown in consumer borrowing is 
going to hurt a lot of companies and industries. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock market is finally coming to grips with the big negative -- earnings 
are falling," Clough says. He's worried about auto stocks and the businesses 
that feed the car industry, like steel and textiles. 
</P>
<P>
Clough also sees red flags for retailing and the defense industry, as well as 
real estate and its associated industries, such as home appliances and home 
furnishings. He also doesn't like real estate investment trusts and the 
financial services industry. 
</P>
<P>
So, what's left? "There is tons of stuff," Clough says. He likes utilities, for 
instance, which will prosper no matter what happens to the economy. And he 
likes regional telephone companies, whose earnings are sheltered even during a 
recession; energy companies; health-care management firms, and 
engineering/construction concerns that will be in the driver's seat when 
America needs to upgrade its industrial base after the upcoming economic 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
Clough doesn't advise holding a lot of cash. And he has one more piece of 
advice. "Individual investors should be long-term investors. They shouldn't be 
looking at the paper every day." 
</P>
<P>
Marc Heilweil, a highly respected investment adviser from Atlanta, is also 
telling clients to be cautious about the stock market right now. "Individuals 
investing for the 1990s should wait for the maturation of the oncoming bear 
market before getting heavily into stocks," says Heilweil, whose firm is called 
Heilweil, Hollander &amp; Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Once stocks do drop in price during the bear market that many experts believe 
is already under way, Heilweil says, investors should buy into companies that 
are well-managed, conservatively financed and have predictable growth records. 
And they should hold onto those stocks for the long haul, despite any 
short-term volatility. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, go back to the old-fashioned way of investing that predated the 
takeover-crazy 1980s. "People should buy shares of at least one company they 
know and admire, and then put its certificate away in the back of the safe 
deposit box," Heilweil says. He emphasizes the "back" of the safe deposit box 
-- so the temptation to sell won't be great. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies that Heilweil personally admires are SCI Systems Inc., which 
supplies the raw material used in the manufacture of computers and 
telecommunications products; Lawson Products, which distributes fasteners and 
other supplies to manufacturing companies; Air Products &amp; Chemicals, a 
supplier of industrial gases, and Lubrizol, the largest independent producer of 
motor oil additives. All of these companies have been building their businesses 
for the future, Heilweil says. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see something that is a mirror-image of the 1980s. The 
desirable companies for investors are going to be well-run, niche companies, as 
opposed to asset-rich companies that are ripe for breakup or restructuring," 
says Heilweil. 
</P>
<P>
And now some tax advice for those considering a New Year's make over for their 
portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
All the chatter out of Washington about a possible reduction in the nation's 
capital gains tax has created a unique worry for investors this year. People 
are asking themselves: Should I sell stock now, or wait until 1990, when I 
might be able to pay less tax on the gain? 
</P>
<P>
"It may be the time to hedge some of your bets," says William J. Goldberg, 
national director of personal financial planning for KPMG Peat Marwick, the 
giant accounting firm. "Take some of your gains while you are sure you still 
have them. And let some of them ride." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg and others warn investors not to let tax considerations cause them to 
make bad financial decisions. In the tax business, that's called "letting the 
tax tail wag the investment dog." 
</P>
<P>
Texas billionaire Harold Simmons is now about $70 million in the hole on his 
investment in Lockheed. Simmons owns nearly 11% of the outstanding shares in 
the aerospace company, which recently said it may have to take a $300-million 
charge against earnings because it blundered when bidding for a government 
contract. Wall Street last week was counting on Simmons to take some aggressive 
action to get Lockheed's stock moving higher once again. The betting is that he 
will. Simmons took a step in that direction last week when he told Lockheed 
that he might increase his holdings to 15%. Simmons wasn't answering telephone 
calls last week.

THERE'S GOOD REASON FOR POOR AMERICAN CAR SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I believe your reporter, the market analysts and the auto industry are all 
missing the real reason behind falling sales of American cars ("Rebates, 
Production Cuts Blamed for 27.5% Drop in Auto Profits," Oct. 27). 
</P>
<P>
The real reason for U.S. auto makers' problems is that they are simply losing 
the competition with foreign car makers. 
</P>
<P>
One auto industry expert, Brock Yates, blames management as well as labor in 
his book, "The Decline and Fall of the American Automobile Industry." 
</P>
<P>
American buyers are not as naive as American car makers may think. Getting 
rebates or long warranty periods are meaningless if you have a car that keeps 
needing repair or just doesn't work right. 
</P>
<P>
It would be truly refreshing if American cars actually performed as well as the 
sexy advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Unless American car makers start making better cars and stop trying to fool 
American car buyers, I think I, for one, will continue to buy foreign cars.

ON VIEW: THE 'FUTURE PART II' ARRIVES -- WITH A BONUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Futuristic. Fabulous. Foxy. Fun. Funny. Friendly. The world premiere of "Back 
to the Future Part II" last week, drawing 1,500 guests to the Cineplex Odeon 
Universal City Cinemas (four theaters), was all that. The bonus was that it 
benefited TRIPOD to help families with hearing-impaired children. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Mary Ellen Trainor Zemeckis said: "We've got $400,000 tonight. Net. 
TRIPOD's a great organization. It's about the future of children, and this is 
about the future." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd couldn't get close enough to star Michael J. Fox and wife Tracy 
Pollan (in slinky black) and to Robert Zemeckis, the director. With three party 
tents connected by black time tunnels, Fox was hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
But there he was, in the roped '50s area, surrounded by Universal president Tom 
Pollock, Bob Gale, Steve Starkey, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas 
Wilson. Close by were James Woods, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Michael Douglas, Michael Valenti, Chevy 
Chase, Woody Harrelson, Mark Cowan and Mary Shea, Peter and Robin Barker, and 
Michael Shamberg and his wife, Megan Williams, who helped start TRIPOD seven 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most parties have one tent. Ambrosia Caterers vice president David Corwin 
created three. The "past" became a pleasure palace with gaming tables; the '50s 
tent sported a mermaid and band with dancers bopping through balloons and 
tinsel to "Hit the Road, Jack." The futuristic setting took the form of steel 
grids and a bar in an atmosphere too dark to see stars, but providing anonymity 
for pigging out. 
</P>
<P>
Beamed MCA president Sid Sheinberg: "This movie's like a Swiss watch." So was 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: The business tycoons ventured into archeology the other evening 
when John and Marion Anderson opened their Bel-Air home to the Board of 
Visitors of the John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA (which 
the Andersons endowed with $15 million). 
</P>
<P>
The prominent group became the first to see Christopher B. Donnan's newest 
slides of the royal tombs from the Moche civilization discovered recently in 
Peru. Donnan, professor of anthropology and director of the UCLA Museum of 
Cultural History, said the tombs have yielded some of the greatest pieces of 
jewelry ever found in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
Oohing over the gold warrior priest and intricate spiders were J. Clayburn La 
Force, dean of the Graduate School of Management, and wife Barbara, Jim and 
Carol Collins, Dick and Susan Roll, Jim and Inge Miscoll and political 
economist James Q. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
DONORS: Celebrating the continued building of a significant permanent 
collection for Los Angeles and the Museum of Contemporary Art, MOCA, headed by 
Richard Koshalek, recently dedicated the Collection Donor Galleries at Bunker 
Hill and opened two exhibitions including "Selections from the Beatrice and 
Philip Gersh Collection." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 friends of the Gershes including Jeff Kastenberg, Steve Martin, 
Marcia Weisman and Ed Ruscha were there; 50 moved on to late-night dining at 
Rex restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
ELEGANCE: Mary Smith (Mrs. William French Smith) and Bullocks Wilshire cast 
floral elegance on the luncheon to meet London's floral decorator Kenneth 
Turner, in town to open his new boutique at Bullocks Wilshire and to tout the 
Southern California Committee for Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Guests included Michael York (quoting Shakespeare), I. Magnin CEO Rose Marie 
Bravo, Constance Gavin (just returned from Las Cruces), Iona Brown, Joan 
Hotchkis, Jennifer Diener, Flora Thornton and Marion Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
TO HONOR: Mayor of Cannes Michel Mouillot was in the spotlight last week. 
Chardee and Thomas Trainer feted him in their Beverly Hills home, inviting 
former President Ronald and Nancy Reagan. French Consul Gen. Gerard and Naomi 
Coste hosted another reception Wednesday at their home. 
</P>
<P>
Chardee Trainer is a trustee of Pine Manor College, which is co-sponsoring a 
program of French studies at the International College of Cannes, where the 
mayor is chairman. 
</P>
<P>
BACCHUS: The ancient Greek and Roman god of wine and revelry was revered the 
other evening at the California Wine Patrons at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
Before dinner, hotelier Alain M. Longatte saluted 13th annual Bacchus Banquet 
awardees: restaurateur Michael McCarty, Domaine Chandon CEO John Wright and Los 
Angeles Times wine writer Dan Berger. 
</P>
<P>
News of the night was the opening of the California Wine Exhibit at the Museum 
of Science and Industry to pay tribute to Hernando Courtright, late owner of 
the Beverly Wilshire. Among those in the spotlight were Fiorenza Courtright, 
Jack P. Hennessy, chairman of the California Wine Patrons, Raoul Balcaen, 
Patrons president, and Bob and Margie Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
PLAUDITS: To Frank and Barbara McNamara, celebrating a 40th anniversary with 
dinner and friends at Annandale Golf Club. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To Pitzer College President Frank Ellsworth and supporters, raising funds at 
the Universal benefit screening of "Dad." . . . 
</P>
<P>
To the Bob Hope Cultural Center Muses and their "Best of Paris" fashion 
extravaganza in Palm Desert co-chaired by Marilyn Tennity and Robin Ceriale. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
To Janet and Bob Christy and members of Applause, fund-raising for the Norris 
Theatre for the Performing Arts (Palos Verdes Peninsula) with a tour of 
corporate jets. . . .

MISS MANNERS: A COUNTEROFFENSIVE TO FOOD FUSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How do we describe someone who is intensely aware of the composition and 
consequences of every bit of food he or she eats, and takes pains not to ingest 
anything offensive? 
</P>
<P>
A sensible eater? 
</P>
<P>
A sensitive person? 
</P>
<P>
A gourmet? 
</P>
<P>
A nutritionist? 
</P>
<P>
How about a food fuss? 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners is not unsympathetic to the current interest in food from dietary, 
aesthetic and political standpoints. She has always appreciated the traditional 
religious and ceremonial considerations. She understands about allergies, 
scruples and preferences. 
</P>
<P>
But enough is enough. She can no longer tolerate people talking when their 
mouths ought to be full. It's ruining her appetite. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, it is ruining modern social life. The pretense of being grateful 
for whatever refreshment is offered has disappeared into a self-righteous 
demand for menu control. Guests are announcing what they want and what they 
disapprove of. Those who consider themselves polite do it beforehand, kindly 
allowing the hosts time to fill their orders. Those who don't care, do it right 
at the table. 
</P>
<P>
Hosts are being advised to be extra careful not to offend their guests by 
serving -- well, any of the major or minor food groups. There isn't anything 
that someone isn't allergic to, or against. The list includes: alcoholic 
beverages, animal fats, veal, shellfish, nuts, saturated fats, pork, eggs, 
fried foods, game, sugar, heavy sauces, red meat, butter, starches, organ 
meats, heavy desserts and caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
Kind of simplifies your dinner planning, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Miss Manners suggests that people put their energy into fighting back 
against the food fusses. 
</P>
<P>
We all agree that everybody does not eat everything. That is not the issue. 
There are polite rules for avoiding what you don't want: 
</P>
<P>
* If you are serving yourself, from a tray or a buffet table, don't take it. 
Take what you can eat and leave the rest. 
</P>
<P>
* If you are given something you don't eat, mess up the plate a bit (sure, you 
know how -- Miss Manners saw you hiding your vegetables under your potatoes 
when you were a mere toddler). 
</P>
<P>
* If your list of things you don't eat covers everything served at a normal 
meal, then eat before you go out. Take a minimum amount for messing-up 
purposes. We don't want to waste food, but we don't want to waste the hosts' 
energies, either, by making them rush around trying to find something to please 
you. 
</P>
<P>
* If you are worried about truly hidden ingredients -- ubiquitous foodstuffs 
that are not easily detected, but to which you have a serious reaction -- you 
are allowed one whispered word to the hosts, or a reminder in advance to those 
with whom you dine often. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't discuss food. (If Miss Manners weren't so polite, she would say, "For 
heaven's sake, shut up about it.") Nobody is interested in hearing about what 
you don't eat. Don't announce it, and refuse to be led into any discussions 
about it. If prodded, just smile happily and decline what is offered, refusing 
to supply an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners is fighting this battle for the sake of beleaguered hosts, so she 
feels she must make her own requests of them, in their interest.

ERMA BOMBECK: BROAD RULES EXPAND DIETER'S . . . LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We live in a society that is dictated by rules. There are rules for marriage, 
rules for raising children and even rules for war. So why shouldn't there be 
rules for dieting? 
</P>
<P>
For years, I have contended that food eaten over the sink doesn't count. It's 
not like you're sitting down enjoying something. The guilt alone burns off any 
caloric damage before it ever reaches . . . wherever it is food goes. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I was delighted finally to see a breakthrough in dieting -- a list 
of rules found by a reader in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, the calories in the 
candy bar are canceled out by the diet soda. 
</P>
<P>
Foods that have the same color have the same number of calories -- spinach and 
pistachio ice cream; mushrooms and white chocolate. (Chocolate, incidentally, 
is a universal color and may be substituted for any other food choice.) 
</P>
<P>
And here's one I'll bet you didn't know: Food used for medicinal purposes never 
counts. That's right, if you have a piece of dry toast with your hot chocolate 
or a cup of bouillon before your Sara Lee cheesecake, don't even think about 
the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritionists probably already know this, but cookie pieces contain no 
calories. The process of crumbling causes "caloric leakage." 
</P>
<P>
Tasting while you are cooking is considered a public service project, and 
public service is calorie-deductible. Movie-related foods such as Milk Duds, 
buttered popcorn and vat-sized soft drinks contain no calories whatsoever. They 
are part of an entertainment package and not part of one's personal fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Anything offered by people demonstrating foods in a supermarket and samples set 
out in candy stores or bakeries don't count in your daily intake of calories. 
Dieters are never penalized for good manners. 
</P>
<P>
I have been on this diet for three weeks now and love it. However, there is a 
side effect that is worth mentioning. The more I "diet," the more rules I 
discover, and the more my consciousness is broadened. Among other things.

<P>
When her class sits down to eat lunch, 14-year-old Jennifer sits with them, but 
instead of eating her food she pours it into a tube to her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Since birth, Jennifer has been unable to eat normally because she was born with 
a brain dysfunction that prevents her from swallowing food. 
</P>
<P>
At a regular school, Jennifer's actions might draw attention, but during lunch 
at the Rancho Los Amigos Hospital School in Downey, no one seems to notice. It 
is a school for physically handicapped students, ages 3 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
The school, in the pediatric ward of the county-operated medical center, has 
been part of the Downey Unified School District since 1962. It was started as a 
county project in the mid-1930s for youngsters who needed care at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the hospital celebrated its 100th anniversary. It is internationally 
known for its work in rehabilitating people with disabilities ranging from 
severe spinal injuries to nerve and brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Under a contract with the county Board of Supervisors, the county provides the 
building, utilities and maintenance, and the Downey school district is 
responsible for instructional material and staff, said Shirley Zanger, 
principal of the school. Enrollment usually averages 45 to 55 children. Most of 
the students live in the hospital and are undergoing rehabilitation because of 
illness or injury, and the rest are bused in. 
</P>
<P>
If a child's physical condition prevents him from attending class, a bedside 
teacher is provided. When his medical condition is stabilized, he is sent to 
the pediatric ward of the hospital for rehabilitation, Zanger said. As soon as 
he can sit in a chair for three or four hours, he is sent to school. 
</P>
<P>
School hours are 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., during which time in-patients go to 
occupational, physical and speech therapy at the hospital. They also may have 
medical, dental and vision appointments, or may be scheduled to meet with a 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Therapists follow a strict schedule in picking up students and dropping them 
off throughout the day, but teachers are flexible. They often have to be able 
to pick up where they left off with a student, Zanger said, making their time 
with the patient very individualized. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary goal is to get students rehabilitated and medically stable," said 
Caleb Wong, the teacher in the head and trauma class, which focuses on 
stabilizing memory. "Teachers and therapists work together as a team and share 
information. We come up with plans that best help the students overcome 
physical, emotional and behavioral problems." 
</P>
<P>
If you took away the wheelchairs, respirators, helmets and other medical 
equipment, the four rooms would look like any other schoolroom. On the wall in 
the preschool classroom are numbers, alphabets and artwork. The elementary, 
high school, and head and trauma classrooms are filled with audiovisual 
equipment and computers. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the head and trauma class, the other classes follow a regular 
school's curricula, including reading, math and language arts. High school 
students receive instruction in career education to assist them in finding a 
job after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
When the pediatric building was built, the doctors felt the school was an 
important part of the rehabilitation process and decided to rebuild it in a 
wing of the pediatric ward, Zanger said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is primarily for hospital patients because some of them stay a long time, 
years even," Zanger said. Other physically handicapped students, who live at 
home and need special equipment to attend school, are transported on specially 
equipped buses. 
</P>
<P>
Gary, 15, comes from Monterey Park each day. The former straight-A student is 
in the head-trauma class. 
</P>
<P>
Gary suffered brain damage in an automobile accident about a year ago and has 
forgotten everything, Wong said. He was also unable to speak. But Wong is 
feeding sentences written on strips of paper into a computer that reads the 
sentences aloud and enables Gary to learn them. 
</P>
<P>
Wong considers music to be therapeutic, and said he uses it every morning to 
get students going. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary is like Mel Tillis (a country singer), he stutters so terribly, but he 
can sing a song. He couldn't say a sentence, but he could sing half a song." 
</P>
<P>
Wong said he works with students at their ability level. "I try to give them a 
sense of accomplishment or satisfaction of being able to do something, because 
after an accident, a lot of them feel very depressed, very worthless, because 
they're not able to do what they used to do. Some couldn't even write their 
names, couldn't even say their names, and that's very demoralizing." 
</P>
<P>
When Gary first came to the school, he had a low self-image, Wong said. Gary's 
sentences were incoherent. But now he is coming out of his shell and learning 
to enjoy life again, Wong said. He beamed as he told the story of how Gary 
would laugh each time he won at shuffleboard. 
</P>
<P>
Before Gary left for his therapy session, he raised his arms and cupped his 
hands as if he held a basketball. Wong said that meant Gary wanted to play 
basketball, probably because Gary had beaten him the day before. But Wong told 
him he must learn his sentences before he could play. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a special-education school, the four teachers are specially 
trained. They are assisted by a full-time attendant who takes care of the 
student's physical needs and helps the teacher in the educational program. Some 
of the students come to school in wheelchairs or on gurneys. 
</P>
<P>
Six-year-old Juan, who has cerebral palsy, comes to his elementary class in his 
wheelchair. He is a spunky first-grader who greets strangers with a smile and a 
hello. 
</P>
<P>
He recently came to the school after his mother died, Zanger said. He lives 
with his aunt and uncle in Downey. She said he had not been out of the house 
since he was an infant. When he came to the school he could not speak English, 
she said. Now he speaks it fluently. 
</P>
<P>
Juan cannot walk without the help of leg braces, but during playtime he is able 
to speed around the playground on a little red bike. 
</P>
<P>
Without the school, parents would have a difficult time taking care of these 
special children. And Jennifer's mother appreciates it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have a place to send Jennifer. A place where she's accepted. And 
I don't have to worry about her," said Susan Goforth. "She's getting a good 
education. When Jennifer was small there was no way I could get a baby-sitter 
unless I found a parent who had a child with a (tracheotomy)." 
</P>
<P>
Goforth said she is pleased with the staff at Rancho and feels comfortable with 
Jennifer's care there, which started when she was 7. Goforth remembers when 
Jennifer first went to preschool, and she had to stay with her for two months 
until the teacher's aide learned how to take care of her. 
</P>
<P>
Goforth now describes Jennifer as "a bubbly, outgoing and giving person." 
</P>
<P>
"Jennifer has gone through a lot," said the divorced mother of two. "She used 
to be leery of everyone and said that everyone hurt her. She only wanted me." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Jennifer has slowly gained independence. Goforth has taught her 
to feed herself and take care of her trachea. She seemed confident at school 
recently, washing for lunch and putting on her sterile gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer is one of the few students who can take care of herself. Most of the 
students are on respirators, incontinent or quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
Zanger, who has been principal at the school for nine years, said it takes a 
"special person to work in a place like this." 
</P>
<P>
Anna Mescavage, an attendant in the high school class, said the experience is 
"very rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
"The children are so high, so positive. Sometimes you see someone take steps, 
who didn't think they could do it. They're inspirational and live life in an 
uplifting way," Mescavage said.

WHAT YOU GET FOR THE MEDIAN PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Kathy Cully bought her handsome, two-bedroom condominium in West Los 
Angeles a few months ago, she had no idea that she had just become the 
"typical" buyer of a "typical" home on her side of town. 
</P>
<P>
Cully, an executive with a Century City advertising firm, simply fell in love 
with the complex's well-landscaped grounds and the way the afternoon sun 
filters through the large windows that look out over the quiet street below. 
</P>
<P>
And although Cully could have bought a large, single-family house in other 
parts of Los Angeles County for the same amount of money, her new condo is just 
a few minutes away from her office and a short bike ride from the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought the place because it's just perfect for me," Cully said. "I didn't 
know that I became 'Miss Average' when I closed escrow." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, she's a near-perfect statistic. At $220,000, the purchase price was nearly 
identical to the median price of all the homes sold in Los Angeles County for 
that month, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Half of all homes sell for more than the median price and half sell for less. 
Statisticians for the realty trade group issue price reports for different 
counties and regions of California on a monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise that median prices vary widely from one county to the next. 
It's about $221,000 in Los Angeles County, where the figure is lowered by a 
huge number of condominiums and low-priced houses in poorer parts of town. But 
in newer Orange County -- where there are fewer low-end markets and condos -- 
the median is $30,000 higher. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, in the first-time-buyer meccas of Riverside and San Bernardino -- 
where both homes and raw land are relatively inexpensive -- the median is a 
modest $130,036. 
</P>
<P>
Still, cold statistics don't tell the whole story: A home buyer's money will go 
much further in one neighborhood than it will in another, even if the two sites 
are in the same county. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers looking for a median-priced home of $221,000 on the Westside of Los 
Angeles will, like Kathy Cully, probably have to settle for a condominium or 
townhouse. If they move east, to the San Gabriel Valley, they can find a nice 
three-bedroom and possibly even four-bedroom house with two bathrooms in a good 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
And if they don't mind long drives and sweltering summer days, they can spend 
$221,000 in the northern Los Angeles County communities of Palmdale and 
Lancaster for a brand-new, two-story home chock-full of built-in appliances and 
other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Here, then, are the median prices for each of six Southland areas tracked by 
the realtors and a guide to what the money will buy in various parts of each 
region: 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County 
</P>
<P>
The sheer size of the county makes its median price virtually meaningless: 
$221,954 will buy a huge house in the far east or northern corners of the 
county; however, it will barely be enough to purchase a modest condominium on 
Los Angeles' pricey Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll get a lot of house for that kind of money out here," says Realty 
World/Carousel's Carol Hinds, a broker who works in Duarte, La Verne and other 
parts of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a home for sale right now for $220,000 that has a huge family room 
with a massive fireplace, a formal living room that also has a fireplace, three 
bedrooms, two bathrooms and a small pool. And, we've got a lot of homes like it 
in the same price range." 
</P>
<P>
Money can go even further in Palmdale, Lancaster and other communities in the 
northeast corner of Los Angeles County. The trade-off: Buyers are faced with a 
120-mile round-trip commute each day if their jobs are in downtown Los Angeles 
or the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Some nice three-bedroom houses in the $220,000-range are also available in 
several parts of the San Fernando Valley, Long Beach and the South Bay. Condo 
buyers in that price range can settle in some of those areas' most exclusive 
neighborhoods. Buyers who insist on living on the Westside -- the county's most 
expensive area -- have no choice but to purchase a condo or townhouse if 
they're in the $220,000-price range. 
</P>
<P>
"You can pretty much forget about buying a single-family home on this side of 
town unless you can pay $300,000 or more," said Elaine Golden-Gealer of Jon 
Douglas Co.'s Santa Monica office. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you've got $220,000, you can find a two-bedroom condo in Santa Monica, 
West L.A or Brentwood, or a three-bedroom condo in Culver City. There are some 
nice complexes in that price range, and you'd be close to everything -- the 
ocean, the freeways, shopping and downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has the dubious distinction of being the most expensive region in 
the Southland, according to the realtors' statistics. In fact, its median price 
of $250,885 makes it the second-most expensive market in the entire state, 
trailing only San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Still, $251,000 can go a long way in many parts of the county, including 
Anaheim, Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Midway City, Stanton, Huntington Beach and 
Fountain Valley, said Dean Cunningham of Tarbell Realty in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a three-bedroom, 1 3/4-bath home with a family room, fireplace, air 
</P>
<P>
conditioning and pool listed for $249,900 in a good part of Anaheim," 
Cunningham said. "And the lot is over 6,500 square feet, bigger than most 
residential lots." 
</P>
<P>
Buyers who want to live in the tonier areas of Costa Mesa, Irvine and other 
parts of southern Orange County often must settle for a townhouse or condo if 
they want to spend $250,000 or less, although smaller single-family homes in 
that price range can also be found. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best buys in the southern part of the county can be found in San 
Clemente, an oceanside town of about 35,000 that's the last stop before 
entering the northern tip of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of very good areas down here where you can get a real nice 
single-family home for $251,000," said Paul Yoder, an executive in the San 
Clemente office of Grubb &amp; Ellis. "There's a home on the market now for 
$252,900 that's 3-years-old, has a two-car garage, three bedrooms and two 
baths. Plus, it's only three minutes to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Newport Beach, Orange County's answer to Beverly Hills. "You 
can forget about getting a single-family home here for $251,000, but you can 
find a condo in that price range," said Tom McQueen, a district manager for 
Grubb &amp; Ellis in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a two-bedroom, 1 3/4-bath condo for sale for $249,000 near Hoag 
Hospital. It's not in the most prestigious part of Newport Beach, but the unit 
has a nice ocean view, the complex is gate-guarded and the grounds are very 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County 
</P>
<P>
Up until a few years ago, home prices in Ventura County were lower than those 
of comparable houses in Los Angeles. But Ventura's median now stands at 
$245,454 -- nearly $25,000 more than its neighbor to the south -- in part 
because so many Angelenos have fled the city for the less-congested, 
slower-paced life that this coastal county offers. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of homes for sale in Ventura County are in two areas: Oxnard and 
the city of Ventura. "You generally get more for your money in Oxnard," said 
Harriet Clune, assistant manager in the Jon Douglas Co. office in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a home on the market now for $245,700 that has four bedrooms, 1 3/4 
baths, a family room and fireplace. It's got 1,750 square feet, and is in 
northern Oxnard -- a real solid area with a lot of well-kept homes." 
</P>
<P>
Several good-sized condos either on the beach or with ocean views can also be 
purchased in Oxnard and neighboring Port Hueneme for $245,000. 
</P>
<P>
It's much harder to get beach-area property in the city of Ventura for the 
county's median price of $245,000. "But there are a lot of well-built homes in 
good neighborhoods on the east side of the Ventura Highway in that price 
range," Clune said. "You'll get three bedrooms and two baths, with 1,600 to 
1,800 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
"If you move even farther east, toward Santa Paula, you can find newer homes 
with a little more square footage for the same price," Clune said. "You won't 
be as close to mid-town Ventura, but you'll get a little more house for your 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County 
</P>
<P>
For reporting purposes, the California Assn. of Realtors lumps home sales in 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties together and issues a median price for 
the entire region. Although the median for the area is $130,036, prices in 
Riverside are generally $15,000 to $20,000 higher than those for comparable 
properties in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
"For $129,000, I can sell you a starter home that's in prime condition, with a 
new roof, central air conditioning, three bedrooms, 1 1/2 baths and 1,643 
square feet," said Sandy Sandison of Betty Landes Realty in Riverside. "It's on 
the north side of the city of Riverside, a good area with excellent schools and 
good access to the 60 and 91 freeways." 
</P>
<P>
Home buyers can get even more space for their money if they're willing to move 
to Moreno Valley -- a boom town about 20 miles farther east -- or to Perris, 
Rancho California and other towns to the south. "They have lots of new homes 
that are a little bigger than what you'd get for $130,000 in Riverside, but 
you'd spend more time on the freeway if you have to commute to Los Angeles 
everyday," Sandison said. 
</P>
<P>
S. Bernardino County 
</P>
<P>
If Riverside is a first-time buyer's paradise, then San Bernardino is nothing 
less than nirvana. Several new developments in the sprawling county still 
feature starter homes for less than $100,000, while buyers looking for the 
region's median-priced house of $130,000 can find huge houses with lots of 
amenities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a 2-year-old home in the desirable north end of San Bernardino is 
on the market for $129,500: It has three bedrooms, 1 3/4 baths, a pool, big 
deck and fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
There are even good bargains in Lake Arrowhead, the charming mountain resort 
town that is becoming a bedroom community for people who work in San Bernardino 
and neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a two-story home with tongue-and-groove paneling in the living room, 
a used-brick fireplace and cathedral ceilings in the two master bedrooms for 
$129,500," said Deon Faust of Lake Arrowhead Realty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only 21 miles down the hill to San Bernardino, which is about a half-hour 
drive. That's less time than most of the people who live in Los Angeles spend 
on the freeway every morning when they're going to work." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County 
</P>
<P>
Most of the homes that can be purchased for the San Diego median price of 
$176,852 are in the central part of the city of San Diego, and in established 
communities such as Allied Gardens and San Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
"For $177,000, you'll get about 1,500 square feet, three bedrooms, two baths 
and maybe a small den," said Jack Forness, a local broker and president of the 
90-outlet Century 21 San Diego Brokers Council. "The home will be about 20 
years old, and you'll be close to everything. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll get a little more house for your money if you move toward the eastern 
part of the county -- places like Santee, Jamul and El Cajon. There you can get 
maybe four bedrooms and a couple of hundred extra square feet for $177,000."

HOT PROPERTY: NEWHARTS WANT MORE ROOM AT INN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor/comedian BOB NEWHART, who stars as a Vermont innkeeper in the 7-year-old 
CBS sitcom "Newhart," wanted more land than he has at his current Bel-Air home, 
so he found another house a few blocks away on 1.31 acres. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Virginia, are buying it for $4.2 million, say sources not 
involved in real estate sales. 
</P>
<P>
The price is considered a bargain for the neighborhood, as the house is on one 
of the choicest streets in the old part of Bel-Air. But the house is said to be 
a tear-down or a rehab. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be one of those rare opportunities to create a major estate," said 
one of the sources. 
</P>
<P>
The house -- a two-story country-English style with seven bedrooms and six 
baths in 6,110 square feet -- was built in 1941. It was designed by the late 
architect Wallace Neff for screenwriter/director WALTER REISCH, whose family is 
selling it. 
</P>
<P>
Reisch, who died in 1983, wrote this about the house in a 1982 letter to the 
architect's son, Wallace Neff Jr.: 
</P>
<P>
"For many years, since the day we moved in, the house was a regular meeting 
place of Hollywood's most celebrated colony and still is. Walter Slezak, Edward 
G. Robinson, Max Reinhardt, Ingrid Bergman, Jack Webb, Billy Wilder, William 
Wyler and numerous other celebrities were prominent guests."

Reisch arrived in Hollywood from England in 1937, and for the next two decades 
wrote such films as "Ninotchka," starring Greta Garbo, and "The Titanic," for 
which he won an Oscar. He was also one of the three writers of "Gaslight," 
which had an Oscar-winning role for Ingrid Bergman.

JAMIE ROSE, who appears as actress Shelley Long's mother in the ABC-TV 
miniseries "When Rabbits Howl" starting Wednesday, has purchased a two-bedroom, 
two-bath condo in Santa Monica near the ocean in the mid-$300,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who played Victoria Gioberti Hogan from 1981-83 in the TV series "Falcon 
Crest" before starring in the 1985-86 ABC series "Lady Blue," has previously 
owned houses but decided to buy a condo because of its carefree upkeep and her 
busy schedule, said her mother, Reta Rose, who represented her in the sale. 
James Chalke of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young represented the seller. 
</P>
<P>
Reta Rose is manager of the George Elkins Co.'s Beverly Hills office, where 
George Elkins, the company's founder and chairman, who will turn 90 on 
Thursday, still works everyday.

The 90-year-old, New York-based WILLIAM MORRIS AGENCY -- which has counted Bill 
Cosby among its clients -- is getting a $22-million office building on Beverly 
Hills' most famous street. It is a few blocks from the recently completed, 
$25-million headquarters of rival Creative Artists Agency, which is at the 
intersection of Little Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The new William Morris building will be at 150 S. Rodeo Drive, adjacent to the 
talent agency's West Coast headquarters at 151 E. El Camino Drive. An elevated 
pedestrian bridge connecting the agency's two buildings may be built after the 
offices are completed next fall.

Johanna Falduto represented the seller, and Stephen Shapiro represented Morton. 
Both are with Stan Herman &amp; Associates in Beverly Hills, where Morton also 
owns a house.

IT'S TIME TO DO YOUR END-OF-THE-YEAR REAL ESTATE TAX PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and real 
estate broker.

<TEXT>
<P>
The end of 1989 is rapidly approaching. But you still have time for your 
year-end real estate tax planning to minimize your 1989 income taxes. Here are 
some suggestions if you want to lower your taxes: 
</P>
<P>
Buy a home. If you don't already own a home, acquiring one can cut your income 
taxes while you get to enjoy the benefits of home ownership. Uncle Sam now 
allows you to deduct the interest on a home "acquisition mortgage" up to $1 
million when you buy, construct or improve your principal residence or second 
home. Deducting mortgage interest is usually better than paying non-deductible 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
Deduct the mortgage loan fee. When buying a home, if the mortgage lender 
charges a loan fee to approve your loan for buying, constructing or improving 
your primary residence, you can deduct the loan fee as itemized interest. 
</P>
<P>
However, the IRS says you must pay the loan fee by separate check if you want 
to deduct the entire amount in the year paid. But if you allow the lender to 
subtract the loan fee from your loan proceeds, then the IRS says you can only 
deduct the loan fee over the life of the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Obtain a home-equity loan. In addition to the interest deduction on your 
home-acquisition mortgage, you can also deduct the interest on a home-equity 
loan up to $100,000. Many shrewd taxpayers are now paying off their mostly 
non-deductible credit card, auto and personal loans, and replacing them with 
deductible home-equity loans. However, if you borrow for business purposes, 
regardless of the amount, then your interest becomes deductible as a business 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
Sell your home and buy a replacement. Another way to maximize your 1989 real 
estate tax deductions is to sell your primary residence and buy a replacement 
home. Internal Revenue Code 1034 allows you to defer paying tax on your sale 
profit if you purchase a replacement principal residence of equal or greater 
cost within 24 months before or after the sale. If you buy a home that requires 
a larger mortgage, you will be increasing your deductible mortgage interest and 
property tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Deduct your moving expenses. If you move because of a change in job locations, 
whether or not you change employers, you may qualify to deduct your moving 
expenses. However, the tax law says your new job site must be at least 35 miles 
farther away from your old home than was your old employment location. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, if your old job was 10 miles from your old home, your new job 
must be at least 45 miles (10 plus 35) from your former residence. In addition, 
you must be employed in the vicinity of your new job location at least 39 weeks 
during the next year after your move, or 78 weeks in the next two years if you 
are self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
By completing the residence change in 1989, you can deduct all your household 
moving expenses plus up to $3,000 of indirect costs, such as all or part of 
your real estate sales commission for selling your old home, house-hunting 
trips, and even temporary living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
If you are 55 or older, sell your home and claim up to $125,000 of tax-free 
profits. The "over 55 rule" of Internal Revenue Code 121 allows you to claim up 
to $125,000 of tax-free profits when selling your principal residence if you or 
your co-owner spouse are 55 or older on the day of sale, have owned and lived 
in the principal residence any three of the five years before the sale, and 
have never used this tax break before. 
</P>
<P>
Make a tax-deferred exchange. Investment or business property can qualify for 
an IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange for other "like kind" property. Reasons for 
making such exchanges include: trading for property with a greater depreciable 
basis, avoiding tax on profits, acquiring a more desirable property and 
disposing of an unsuitable property. 
</P>
<P>
Delayed "Starker" exchanges are also available under IRC 1031(a)(3) if you want 
to sell your property and have a third-party intermediary hold the sale 
proceeds while you designate within 45 days a property to be acquired within 
180 days. 
</P>
<P>
Defer a property sale into next year. If you want to sell a property that does 
not qualify for tax-deferral or tax exemption, you can push the sale into 1990 
or a later tax year by using a lease with option to buy. An installment sale 
will partially accomplish the same tax result. 
</P>
<P>
Deduct a casualty or theft loss. You can deduct a loss that was "sudden, 
unusual or unexpected," such as fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, accident, 
theft, windstorm, water pipe breakage or tornado damage. However, casualty 
losses are tax-deductible only on the loss that exceeds 10% of your adjusted 
gross income. 
</P>
<P>
Deduct expenses for your real estate business activities. If you own business 
or investment real estate, don't forget that you can deduct applicable expenses 
such as operating costs, legal fees, accounting charges, business travel costs 
and other applicable expenses. These tax-deductible expenses will help minimize 
your 1989 taxable income. For further details on maximizing your 1989 real 
estate tax deductions, please consult your tax adviser.

</P>
<P>
VILLA PARK: ONCE THE SCENE OF CATTLE DRIVES, THIS SMALL ORANGE COUNTY CITY'S 
HOMES ARE ON SPACIOUS LOTS, THERE ARE LOTS OF TRAILS AND NO STREET LIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLLEEN NICKERSON ADAMS, Nickerson Adams is a Huntington Beach free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks after moving to Orange County in 1959, a Villa Park resident was 
late for an appointment in Tustin because he got into a traffic jam on Santiago 
Boulevard. Not cars. Cows. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred yards off Katella Avenue, cowboys from the Irvine Ranch were 
driving several dozen head of cattle from one side of Santiago to the other. 
Apparently the grass was greener where million-dollar homes would grow three 
decades later. 
</P>
<P>
"Ranches" haven't completely disappeared from Villa Park, although now they are 
limited to an acre or so and "cowboys" to the several miles of trails that wind 
throughout the city. Now built to 95% capacity of its planned development, 
Villa Park still manages to maintain a rather rural ambience. 
</P>
<P>
There are no street lights, no parks, no gas stations, no churches, and only an 
occasional stoplight or sidewalk. And that's the way the 7,000 residents of the 
2.1-square-mile city like it. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, the street lights throw people at first," said Lesslie Giacobbi) of Seven 
Gables Real Estate, who has lived in the city since 1978. "They're all up in 
arms, ready to take the city to task. And then they realize that lights would 
ruin the country atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
For all it may lack in urban amenities, life in Villa Park is hardly roughing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The homes range from comfortable to the absolutely massive, and they are set on 
lots of a minimum of one-half acre throughout most of the city. The standard 
back-yard swimming pool is often augmented by stables, corrals, guest houses or 
tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
Homes are a mix of ubiquitous rambling one-story ranch styles, and in the newer 
sections, imposing French Country styles are shoulder to shoulder with Cape Cod 
and Mediterranean facades. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is diverse, not the cookie-cutter look you might find in other 
communities," Giacobbi said. 
</P>
<P>
And all this atmosphere doesn't come cheap. According to Giacobbi, the median 
home price is $682,000, several hundred thousand above most Orange County 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to compare Villa Park to other cities because there are no 
condominiums or town homes, only single-family detached homes on very large 
lots," Giacobbi said. 
</P>
<P>
At the low end of the market, buyers can find a home in the "buffer zone" of 
10,000-square-foot lots near the city's southwest border for $335,000. For that 
money, a purchaser may get a 20-year-old, five-bedroom, three-bath house with a 
little more than 2,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a buyer in the more prestigious northern part of Villa Park could 
spend close to $4 million on a new 10,000-square-foot mansion with a view 
stretching to the ocean and Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative that is increasing in popularity is tearing down older, 
smaller homes (that are often on the largest lots) and subdividing the property 
for two or more homes. A tiny house on one acre with a view could go for 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts by developers to rezone to a higher density some of the 
buildable parcels left in Villa Park was met with vocal opposition by 
homeowners. In fact, zoning was the catalyst in the city's incorporation a 
little more than a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
With the housing boom of the late 1950s, the city of Orange began annexing 
parcels of the Villa Park area and allowing much denser building than the 
area's traditional 1.5 homes per acre minimum. Voters approved incorporation in 
1962, making it Orange County's 24th and smallest city. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of discouraging growth as residents had hoped, the zoning appealed to 
developers who began tearing down orchards of oranges and avocados to build 
tracts of homes. Some older residents didn't adapt to the newcomers easily. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one City Council meeting in particular, when we were discussing the 
building of the city hall, one gentleman called us carpetbaggers," said 
Catherine Wells, a resident since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
For all its wealth (the median household income is nearly $10,000 higher than 
the county average) Villa Park maintains a relatively low profile. Situated in 
northern Orange County, Villa Park is completely surrounded by the city of 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"People have usually heard of us, they're just not sure exactly where we are," 
laughed Craig Ota, who moved to Villa Park with his wife, Margaret, and three 
daughters in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Once people find Villa Park they seem to stay there quite a while. "Many 
residents are doing major remodeling, sometimes involving hundreds of thousands 
of dollars, instead of moving, especially since it would be hard to 
'over-improve' for this area," Giacobbi said. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Ota estimates that nearly half of their neighbors who moved in at the 
same time she did are still there. After looking around at other communities, 
particularly south Orange County, the Otas decided to forgo moving for 
remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
"Why move? We would be paying more money for less house and less land," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also driving home prices up is Villa Park's centralized location. For all its 
rural charm, the city is just five minutes from the Newport-Costa Mesa Freeway. 
"You have to watch the clock and avoid the peak times, but it's usually pretty 
easy to get around," Craig Ota said. 
</P>
<P>
Which is a good thing, since Villa Park has no movie theaters or restaurants. 
In fact, the city's only shopping center features a grocery store, a variety of 
small shops, city hall and a library. 
</P>
<P>
"It is interesting to note, however, that our shopping center has four banks," 
Giacobbi said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the obvious expense of buying a home there, residents find little to 
complain about in their community. The crime rate is the lowest in the county, 
according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department, with just 35 burglaries so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Otas say Villa Park is a close-knit neighborhood, where people work 
together to maintain the small-town ambience. And they rave about the country 
flavor the city has managed to preserve, and the bobcats, raccoons and rabbits 
that occasionally wander their property. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to have a golf or tennis club nearby, but now the land is 
worth so much, it's out of the question," Craig Ota said. 
</P>
<P>
The Otas, who previously lived in Huntington Beach, bought in a small tract of 
customized homes in the hilly, northern part of the city. Ota, a dentist, 
estimates that their 4,000-square-foot home on about 1 1/2 acres has tripled in 
value since they purchased it. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Wells and her family bought a house on Jacotal Street in 1968 because 
they liked the large lots and the "wall-to-wall kids." 
</P>
<P>
"With four schools within walking distance of the house, it was a dream come 
true for a station wagon refugee," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, who serves as the city's historian, reminisces about the days you could 
drive through Villa Park and enjoy the sweet fragrance of acres of orange 
trees, which was the area's major crop for almost 60 years. It was the citrus 
growers who molded Villa Park into a vital community and organized its 
incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Does the city's growth and the impending development of the wide open spaces 
east of Villa Park bother her? "That's progress," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Accornero of North Hills Realty was so taken with Villa Park 10 years ago 
that he changed careers to stay there. "It was a gradual thing, but one of the 
reasons I left the air-freight business and went into real estate was so that I 
could live here," Accornero said. He raves about the large setbacks from the 
street, a minimum of 30 feet, and the privacy large lots afford. But what keeps 
him in Villa Park, he says, are the people. 
</P>
<P>
"When my wife passed away three months ago, people were so caring," he said. 
"The outpouring of cards and flowers really touched me. My neighbors are still 
bringing food over. You can't buy friendship or community spirit like that."

JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, school teachers Evie Werner and Al Davis bid goodby to their 
classes in the San Francisco Bay Area and headed for Hawaii to launch a B&amp;B 
reservation service aimed at the budget traveler. The idea dawned after Werner 
and Davis fell in love with the islands during a vacation. The couple sent 
their regrets to friends on the mainland: "Goodby, we've found our Paradise." 
Only, could they afford the gamble?

A Ranch in the Rockies: A testimonial on behalf of Colorado ranch life from Dr. 
Anthony B. Sokol of Beverly Hills: "Vacationed last summer at the Drowsy Water 
Ranch in Granby, Colo. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Felt that the entire operation 
hosted by owners Ken and Randy Sue Fosha was excellent. The staff were 
attentive and solicitous and understood the needs of both adults and children 
to make the week enjoyable and safe. Guests ranged from secretaries to heads of 
corporations. A wonderful mix of people. We were surprised to find four 
separate families from England that had been returning to the ranch year after 
year. The accommodations, although Spartan, were just what we felt a ranch 
should have -- that is, log cabins. The food was wholesome and plentiful. We 
certainly recommend Drowsy Water Ranch as a wonderful family vacation."

Granby, Colo. 80446. Telephone (303) 725-3456. Drowsy Water opens in late May, 
closes late in September. Rates: $800 per week single, $1,450 double. Cheaper

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: LEARNING THE LANGUAGE OF CUSTOMS; 
</P>
<P>
MANNERS: WHEN ABROAD, IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR TRAVELERS TO KNOW THE LANGUAGE OF A 
PARTICULAR COUNTRY. ONE SHOULD ALSO KNOW ITS CUSTOMS AND RULES OF ETIQUETTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago I was in a business meeting with a government official in the 
Middle East. I sat on a chair. My associate sat on a low couch facing our host. 
Everything went fine until my friend, uncomfortable with his position on the 
couch, crossed his legs. 
</P>
<P>
The official grew agitated, appeared nervous and soon ended the meeting. As we 
walked outside, our interpreter explained what had happened. When my friend 
crossed his legs, his feet were raised and seemed to point directly at the 
official. It was considered an insult. Not having been forewarned, we had acted 
inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly but surely, Americans traveling abroad are discovering that it's not 
enough simply to know the language. To avoid making some small -- and some 
not-so-small -- social blunders in foreign countries, it pays to know a few of 
their more important customs and manners. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, you can't be expected to know every obscure or bizarre custom or law 
of countries you visit. But it does help to know certain essential rules of 
etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, never wear green and yellow, the colors of the flag. People will 
laugh at you. Don't give the thumbs-up sign in Iran, Ghana or the Soviet Union 
-- it's considered obscene. Waving your hand back and forth might seem like the 
appropriate gesture for "hello" in the United States, but in Greece it's a rude 
gesture called the moutza. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you do, don't give the "A-OK" sign with your hand in Tunisia. Forming 
a circle with your thumb and forefinger essentially means "I'll kill you" in 
that country. If you make the same symbol in Japan, people will think you're 
begging for money. 
</P>
<P>
If you lay your chopsticks down on the table in Korea, it's a signal that you 
have ended your meal. If you lay them down in Japan, be sure they're not 
pointed in the direction of any other guest at the table. That's a taboo. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the problem of body language. In Thailand, tradition dictates that 
the "eyes are the windows of the heart." Eye contact is a large part of the 
Thai culture. As long as you look into a person's eyes, your look probably will 
be returned with a smile. But don't stare. 
</P>
<P>
And don't wink at anyone in Hong Kong. It's considered quite impolite. Also, be 
aware of body linguistics. Watch what you do with your hands and feet in 
countries such as India and Thailand. A friendly slap on the back to a Thai 
could get you into trouble. Finger pointing is rude, and while sitting, never 
point your feet in the direction of another person -- that is a serious insult. 
</P>
<P>
In Chile, holding your hand with the palm up and the fingers separated means 
stupid. And a right fist raised to the level of the head might have been hip in 
1972, but not these days. (It's the Communist sign). Then there's this 
longstanding bizarre rule: In Albania, federal law prohibits singing in public. 
</P>
<P>
As for keeping your distance, a good rule to follow is that when introduced to 
someone in a foreign country, keep things relatively formal until you fully 
understand the customs. 
</P>
<P>
Recently an American businessman visiting Malaysia did not follow this advice. 
He went to the country to close a deal on a lucrative contract. At a ceremony 
to celebrate the beginning of negotiations, he was introduced to someone he 
thought was called "Roger." Trying to be more familiar, he called the man 
"Rog." One small problem. The man to whom he was talking was a rajah. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of good books that can guide you through the subtle but 
important differences (and expectations) in foreign customs and manners. Nancy 
Braganti and Elizabeth Devine have written both "The Travelers' Guide to Asian 
Customs and Manners" (St. Martin's Press, $9.95) and "The Travelers' Guide to 
Latin American Customs and Manners" (St. Martin's Press, $10.95). 
</P>
<P>
The guides deal with variations in behavior, dress, legal matters, tipping and 
how to avoid major gaffes in language and general conversation. Some of the 
advice is excellent: "If you're changing money at a bank in Chile, be prepared 
to stand in long lines, since people pay their bills there." 
</P>
<P>
Some of it is more or less universal: "When you ask Argentines for directions 
on the street, they will give you very detailed instructions, even if they have 
no idea where your destination is. It's a matter of pride for Argentines to act 
as if they know the correct response." (From my experience, the same advice 
applies equally in New York, Tanzania and Canton, Ohio.) 
</P>
<P>
Then there's something called "Culturgrams," four-page leaflets packed with 
etiquette and customs information on 90 countries. The series is produced by 
the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young 
University. Write to BYU, KCIS Publication Services, 280 HRVB, Provo, Utah 
84602, for prices. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to leave home to benefit from "Foreignisms" by Tad Duleja 
(Macmillan, $18.95). The book calls itself a "dictionary of foreign expressions 
commonly (and not so uncommonly) used in English." 
</P>
<P>
It explains, in entertaining detail, the meaning and origins of phrases and 
terms ranging from oy vey to gringo, to a full glossary of French ballet 
terminology. After all, you never know when you'll be called on to explain the 
difference between a glissade and a sissonne. 
</P>
<P>
Two other books deal with an approach to foreign language that can only 
described as definitely not Berlitz. "Wicked French" and "Wicked Italian," both 
by Howard Tomb (Workman Publishing, $3.95 each), will not help you become 
fluent in these languages, but will help you develop the appropriate hip 
attitude with French or Italian. 
</P>
<P>
For example, under the "Words of Love" section the author helps American 
tourists with such phrases as "vous etes une super nana" (you are one fabulous 
babe). 
</P>
<P>
Other selections include "Entuyons nous ensemble sur mon yacht, mon petit chou" 
(Come away with me on my yacht, my little cabbage). 
</P>
<P>
The "Wicked Italian" book offers even more practical phrases. The chapter 
"Shouting in Traffic" gives six suggestions, ranging from "Che pezzo di 
stupido!" (What a jerk!) to the more colorful "Speriamo che all'inferno le 
insegneranno a guidare" (Maybe they will teach you to drive in hell).

HER WORLD: CAUGHT MAPPING ON TRIP TO ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, author of California (with photographer DeWitt 
Jones), is a La Jolla travel writer.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Let me see the Arizona map," my sister said as she turned her back on the 
Pacific and squinted toward the sun in the east. 
</P>
<P>
I reached into the car door pocket and pulled out a map: Italy and the Balkan 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice country," she said patiently. "But too far to drive." 
</P>
<P>
She did not ask what it was doing there. She has known me too long. 
</P>
<P>
I had not packed a map of Arizona -- our destination -- nor one that showed the 
Southern California deserts we would have to cross. 
</P>
<P>
But the house was locked, the car was stuffed and we were eager to roll. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go through Julian and Glamis," I said. "I'm not in a freeway mood." 
</P>
<P>
Glamis, which used to claim a population of five, now boasts a dozen year-round 
residents. Life centers around the Glamis Beach Store and Cafe, which is 
hunkered amid pink dunes south and east of the Salton Sea. Glamis is 
party-and-supply headquarters for thousands of motor homes, dune buggies, 
three-wheelers and other off-road vehicles that gather in the desert each 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
We saw their flags rise over distant dunes. We heard the whines and roars. We 
slowed -- but did not stop -- in Glamis. 
</P>
<P>
Eastward we drove, passing the odd sheep and the odd sign (Willow Wash, Bamboo 
Wash and "For information about this property -- or any for the next 46 miles 
-- phone. . ."). I did not jot down the number. 
</P>
<P>
The land was bleak and treeless. The Chocolate Mountains were bland. The only 
splotch of color was in our rear-view mirror: crimson, pink and yellow roses 
that I'd clipped in the garden that morning. They were the last of the season 
and too pretty to leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen home-grown roses crossed the desert, their stems wrapped in wet towels 
and foil. They lasted for almost a week in our Sedona cabin, which had a 
plastic ice bucket for a vase. 
</P>
<P>
Some may argue that it is silly to take your roses on a trip, but I don't have 
a dog or a cat. 
</P>
<P>
My 13-year-old goddaughter would understand; she took her lifelong teddy bear 
to England this summer and caused a family U-turn when she reached the 
outskirts of York and realized teddy was back at the B&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same bright charmer who shopped at Harrods for a black miniskirt 
and, in Edinburgh, bought a traditional kilt. Thirteen can be a wonderful age. 
</P>
<P>
My friends Susan and Gwen would understand. Gwen took Susan's cocker spaniel on 
a drive to the Grand Canyon last summer because Susan suddenly could not make 
the trip and the dog -- as Gwen pointed out -- had never been there. Grover 
loved the outing. 
</P>
<P>
I went to Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon. I wanted to explore forest trails. 
</P>
<P>
On that first morning in the canyon I dressed in flannels and jeans. I pulled 
on cotton socks and tied the laces of my right shoe. The left shoe, however, 
did not seem to fit. It was some time before I realized that I had grabbed two 
right tennis shoes from my closet at home. My sister laughed first and last. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that I packed in haste, folding sweaters, shirts and khaki pants into 
large plastic bags that could be squooshed into the trunk. Fortunately I had 
brought both a right and left hiking boot for the serious climbs. 
</P>
<P>
Car trips allow room for such silliness. We took large down pillows to push 
behind our backs while driving and to make napping a dream. We took more books, 
magazines and newspapers than we could read. We took playing cards that went 
untouched, and pads of the old word game Jotto, which almost caused a war over 
four-letter words such as myna. 
</P>
<P>
We took apples, Bosc pears, Lifesavers and pecans for road food and trail 
snacks. We had a small ice chest full of water, apple juice and Diet Cokes. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a new map called Experience Sedona (Thorne Enterprises, Box 
2371, Sedona, Ariz. 86336), we explored red rock trails, the Mogollon Rim and 
vortex areas such as Boynton Canyon that have been touted for having psychic 
energy of the levels attributed to Stonehenge or the Pyramids of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
I kept that map in the car door pocket . . . right next to Italy and the Balkan 
Peninsula.

WHAT GOES UP CAN'T COME DOWN IN MONTREAL

<TEXT>
<P>
We arrived here without reservations, a spur-of-the-moment side trip during a 
vacation in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Picking out Rue St. Denis on a city map as central to some of our explorations, 
we turned north from Rue Sherbrooke into a world of students and sidewalk 
cafes. 
</P>
<P>
But no motels. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants and shops gave way to three-story residences, snuggled close a la 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
It was getting late and we parked to study the map again. No sooner had we done 
so but a man walking toward us on the sidewalk paused and asked, "Are you 
lost?" 
</P>
<P>
We responded instinctively to this friendly native, but a black cat he was 
carrying got restless and he said, "Wait, I'll put her in the house." 
</P>
<P>
Heading for a nearby building, the man began to climb an outside stairway that 
rose steeply from the sidewalk to a balcony on the second floor, where he 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
We noticed that the wrought-iron railings of stairways and balconies were 
echoed in a balcony on the third floor that seemed isolated without any 
continuing stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Then we realized that, up and down the street, the stairways were repeated in a 
variety of styles but at the same precarious angle and with the same detached 
balconies. 
</P>
<P>
When our new-found friend returned, he insisted on spreading out our map on the 
sidewalk, and we squatted with him to locate nearby motels. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing days, Kest Morgan took the time to guide us to some of his 
favorite haunts in a city he can't resist, although he is an American who has 
lived in various parts of the States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the joie de vivre here," he said, his bilingual proclivities giving way 
to some ambivalence when it came to the Gallic stairways. "These people are so 
careful with their money, they built them outside to economize. You ought to 
try climbing them when they're covered with ice and snow, or try shoveling off 
the snow and chipping away the ice, step by step." 
</P>
<P>
Quebec historians acknowledge that the stairways were built to save on building 
costs and increase useful space. They have been outlawed in new construction 
since the 1970s, partly because of the slipping hazard during Montreal's long 
and rigorous winters. 
</P>
<P>
Another, more controversial reason why they might have been banned concerns 
their role in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Bouffard of Quebec's Ministry of Tourism said, "On the fire-hazard aspect 
of the discussion, opinions are split. Building technicians and urbanists 
pretend that the outside stairs are frail structures easily destroyed by 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
"Firemen argue that these constitute open and direct access with the ground and 
a firm landing for them to force access when needed in burning structures." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of the debate, but also because the stairways are a distinctive 
facet of Montreal's history, repairs and reconstruction are permitted on 
existing stairways. 
</P>
<P>
Some residential streets lined with these structures are a veritable bouquet of 
wrought-iron styles and colors, integrated with trees in the narrow front yards 
and plants on the balconies. 
</P>
<P>
Some stairways reach straight for the second floor, some curve gracefully 
upward. The hues range from black and white to bronze, blue and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Montreal in Evolution," Jean-Claude Marsan notes: "In the 19th 
Century every country, and perhaps even every large city, produced its own type 
of housing suited to the economic, social and cultural conditions of the 
majority of its population." 
</P>
<P>
He writes that industrialization at the turn of the century and a large influx 
of workers to Montreal led to the need for a quantity of housing close to 
transportation and job sites. 
</P>
<P>
Three-story houses took shape with small setbacks from the sidewalk, "leaving 
vacant but unused space," he said, that "provided an opportunity to build the 
staircase leading to the upper floors on the outside of the house. The space 
thus saved inside the apartment was then put to good use. For houses with three 
floors, the staircase from the balcony of the second floor to the flat on the 
third floor usually remained inside." 
</P>
<P>
But there may be some cultural ingredients in this building brew. The style 
that evolved was designed for newcomers from the country, accustomed to porches 
or verandas. 
</P>
<P>
"Front balconies," Marsan said, "may also have been an attempt, whether 
conscious or not, to imitate the houses of the rich where the main entrance was 
often protected by a porch whose roof was used as a balcony for one of the 
rooms on the second floor." 
</P>
<P>
For a tourist encountering this architecture after a promenade through the 
sidewalk cafes of lower St. Denis, however, another explanation comes to mind: 
the Gallic predilection for savoring the passing scene. 
</P>
<P>
Kest Morgan would buy that one: "Some of my neighbors sit on the balconies by 
the hour; they know my every move."

CONSUMER REPORT: LOST BAGGAGE IS A WEIGHTY MATTER FOR CARRIERS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: IF YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE CASH SETTLEMENT ON YOUR LOST 
LUGGAGE, YOUR ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS TO GO TO SMALL-CLAIMS COURT.

<P>
When you check in for an international flight and hand your check-through 
baggage over to the airline counter personnel, you should get more than just a 
tag as a receipt. The number of bags and their weight should also be recorded 
on your ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Flights to and from the United States generally allow passengers two pieces of 
checked luggage at no extra cost. In other parts of the world the weight system 
may be used with different free-weight limitations per class of service (such 
as 44 pounds economy and 66 pounds for first or business class). 
</P>
<P>
Airlines, however, also apply a weight limitation to checked luggage, even with 
the piece system. The amount of weight per bag can vary from region to region. 
Generally, if the weight of either bag goes over 70 pounds on flights to 
Europe, you pay extra for the excess weight. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid any problems, it's always a good idea to check with the airline on how 
many pieces of check-through luggage you can take, plus the maximum allowable 
weight per bag. 
</P>
<P>
If your bags should be lost and never recovered, the airlines -- under the 
provisions of the Warsaw Convention -- are committed to paying you a maximum of 
$9.07 a pound or $20 a kilo. 
</P>
<P>
Airline personnel, busy boarding a heavily booked jet, may not always have time 
to note the weight of your luggage on your ticket. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, some airline may just pay you the maximum for lost luggage, 
depending on the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"We might, for the sake of expediency, assume that the weight of the lost bag 
is the total allowed, so $640 would be the most a passenger could be paid per 
bag based on the 70-pounds cut-off point," a TWA spokesman said. "This doesn't 
happen too often." 
</P>
<P>
More often, the passenger is paid a lower amount based on the estimated value 
of the lost bag and its contents. 
</P>
<P>
"This leads to a problem sometimes that's resolved in Small Claims Court when 
passengers insist on being paid based on the weight of their lost baggage," the 
TWA spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether there is a record of the weight of your lost bag, you 
should -- after filing a claim for your lost luggage -- get a form from the 
carrier asking you to list each item, when it was purchased, what it cost and 
photocopies of whatever receipts you can produce to document your claim. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines pay on the basis of depreciated value, not the original cost of items. 
Obviously, this can lead to differences of opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"We have charts on various items, including different kinds of clothing, that 
we use for this purpose," said the TWA spokesman. "If passengers can establish 
through a receipt that they just bought a suit or dress a month or so 
beforehand, chances are good they would get paid the full value." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a record of the weight of your lost luggage, the airline can pay 
you the amount due based on the weight, even if the amount you claim is higher 
than this total but still less than the maximum of $640. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose your bag weighed 35 pounds, which would normally obligate the carrier 
for $317.45. You asked for $375, which the carrier then reduced to $275 based 
on depreciation. Most likely you would get the lowest figure involved, $275. 
</P>
<P>
If there was no record of the weight of your luggage, the airline could still 
pay you the $275 in this scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines are also aware that some passengers may claim items that were not in 
the lost luggage and that their bags contained more expensive and more recently 
purchased items. 
</P>
<P>
"All claims are subject to the proof of value, and those presented without 
receipts are reviewed more closely," said the TWA spokesman. "Passengers should 
realize that when we have nothing to base a factual decision on, we have to 
review claims on a more subjective basis." 
</P>
<P>
Said another airline spokeswoman: "We try to show flexibility and give 
passengers some benefit of the doubt, as we know not everyone has receipts, but 
it's amazing how many expensive furs and tuxedos are supposedly in suitcases." 
</P>
<P>
One mistake some passengers make is not completely filling out the forms that 
airlines send them. "Don't leave any blanks," the TWA spokesman said. "This 
will prevent a reviewer from having questions. And don't forget to sign the 
form and have it notarized." 
</P>
<P>
The forms are likely to ask if you have any insurance coverage for lost 
baggage. The airlines will then coordinate your claim with the insurer; you're 
not likely to get double coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Both the report of the loss and the claim form must be submitted within 45 days 
from the date of the loss. "Some people sit on these forms and we can deny 
claims if they wait too long," the TWA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
If the value of your luggage is more than the airline's maximum liability, 
consider getting excess valuation insurance. Cash, medications, important 
documents, jewelry and other valuables should be taken in your carry-on bags, 
not those you check in. The carriers can also decline liability for what they 
regard as fragile items. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines, though, are on the hook for a maximum of $400 for any loss or damage 
for your unchecked baggage if they consider themselves responsible. Most often, 
the airlines hold that passengers are to blame, by generally leaving items 
behind even though they are reminded to look around before getting off the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
Items in unchecked baggage would also be assessed on a depreciated value basis 
by the airlines. Situations where airlines might accept responsibility for 
carry-on baggage could be when flight personnel take control of the item, such 
as hanging up a garment bag. 
</P>
<P>
"But if a passenger hangs up his own garment bag, it's not our responsibility," 
said the TWA representative. "Many people mistakenly believe that airlines are 
automatically responsible for the personal property in their carry-on bags, but 
if you leave something behind, we have no liability." 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, the airlines will pay up to $1,250 per passenger (not per bag) 
for lost or damaged baggage. Airlines seldom pay that amount, however, using 
the same practice of working down from that figure. Again, you have to prove 
the worth of your luggage through receipts, with items assessed on a 
depreciated basis. 
</P>
<P>
If you are traveling domestically and connecting to an international flight, 
the international rules on baggage apply. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect to get paid immediately for a lost-bag claim. It may take the 
airline several months before your matter is fully processed and a check is 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
If you believe the airline is unresponsive to processing your claim, you can 
bring the matter to the attention of the Department of Transportation's 
consumer affairs division. Call (202) 366-2220, or write to the Office of 
Consumer Affairs, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 7th St. S.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20590. 
</P>
<P>
While the DOT can prod an airline to settle a claim, it does not get involved 
in determining the value of lost baggage and its contents.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: TWO-WEEK LIVE ABROAD STAYS IN OAXACA OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grand Circle Travel has added a new Live Abroad vacation in Oaxaca to go with a 
similar long-term stay in Guadalajara and its two-week "Three Faces of Mexico" 
tour. Like all Grand Circle offerings worldwide, it's for the age 55-plus 
traveler. 
</P>
<P>
Offered through April, 1990, the Live Abroad two-week stay in Oaxaca costs from 
$800 to $940 per person, double occupancy, depending on the season and choice 
of accommodations. The price includes air travel from Los Angeles, transfers, 
tips and baggage handling. 
</P>
<P>
A choice of two first-class hotels is offered: the San Felipe Mision and the 
slightly more expensive Mision de Los Angeles. A daily American breakfast is 
served in both, but those choosing the San Felipe Mision also get dinner each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Set in a mountain-ringed valley 350 miles south of Mexico City, Oaxaca has an 
excellent climate -- especially during winter -- of warm days and cool nights. 
In addition to golf, tennis and swimming, there is optional sightseeing to six 
major ruins within a 20-minute drive, including the famous Monte Alban. 
</P>
<P>
And like the Live Abroad program in Guadalajara, each hotel has a weekly social 
program with a welcome cocktail party, bingo, Spanish cooking and language 
lessons, plus films, an orientation tour and local entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The Live Abroad program in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city, also 
offers a choice of hotels for the two-week stay: the first-class Plaza de Sol, 
a 30-minute drive from downtown, and the deluxe Hyatt Regency Exelaris. Daily 
breakfast is included at both hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Prices vary from $762 to $832 per person double at the Plaza de Sol, and from 
$902 to $972 per person double at the posh Hyatt Regency. Rates vary with the 
season, but include air fare from Los Angeles, plus tips, transfers and baggage 
handling. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Circle's Three Faces of Mexico tour is a 14-day escorted trip that takes 
in pre-Columbian cultures, plus colonial and modern Mexico. It covers the 
Yucatan, Oaxaca, Mexico City and Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Priced at $1,772 per person double from Los Angeles, the tour includes 
first-class hotels, 20 meals and comprehensive sightseeing. It can also be 
combined with a Live Abroad stay in Guadalajara. Departures are Dec. 28, 1989, 
Jan. 11 and 25, Feb. 8 and 22 and Mar. 8 and 22, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Grand Circle main office in Boston at 
toll-free (800) 535-8333, or the company's California office at (800) 327-3904. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Three San Francisco hotels are offering special deals or discounts for mature 
travelers over the holidays and into 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Carlton Hotel, 1075 Sutter St., six blocks west of Union Square, has a 
$62-per-night rate, single or double, now through March 11. The rate, which 
includes an 11% city tax, is a saving of about $18 a night. Mature travelers 
also get a 25% discount at the hotel's Ritz Cafe, and discount coupon books for 
Pier 39 and Ghirardelli Square shopping and dining. For information: (800) 
792-0958. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel Bedford, 761 Post St., sets an $80 rate, single or double (tax not 
included), now through March 30, also with the discount shopping and dining 
coupon books. Information: (800) 652-1889. 
</P>
<P>
Free parking is included in the $69 single or double overnight rate at the 
Cathedral Hill Hotel, on Van Ness at Geary, now through Jan. 31. Information: 
(800) 622-0855. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
And some last-minute holiday trip additions: 
</P>
<P>
Frontier Travel &amp; Tours, based in Carson City, Nev., and a member of 
California's Senior Travel and Recreation Activities Council, is running a 
five-day New Year's Gala Event tour at the Anaheim Hilton and featuring the 
Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade. 
</P>
<P>
The tour is mostly for mature travelers visiting California, but Frontier also 
has limited openings for two big holiday dinner dances and shows at the Anaheim 
Hilton that are included in the tour. 
</P>
<P>
The dances are Dec. 30-31 and feature Myron Floren and the Lawrence Welk 
Orchestra, plus Anna Maria Alberghetti and John Raitt, in addition to other 
"Lawrence Welk Show" stars. Tickets are $65 per person. For information: (800) 
648-0912. 
</P>
<P>
The tour includes four nights at the Hilton and reserved seats for the 
Tournament of Roses Parade, in addition to the two shows and other sightseeing, 
for about $500 per person, double. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Senior group tour leaders should know that the Candlelight Pavilion Dinner 
Theater in Griswold's Claremont Center, featuring the Christmas musical "Home 
For The Holidays" until Dec. 30, will follow with "Fiddler On The Roof" from 
Jan. 5 to April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes "Evita," April 6 to June 17. All are popular with senior travelers, 
and early group reservations are suggested. For more information, call (714) 
621-1370. 
</P>

Correction: An incorrect telephone number was listed in Hank Kovell's Mature 
Traveler column last week. The toll-free number for Collette Tours, an 
Alhambra-based mature travel club, is (800) 832-4656.

KANSAS CITY SUGGESTION

<TEXT>
<P>
Although I enjoyed "Kansas City Is a City of Fountains" by Beverly Beyer and Ed 
Rabey (Nov. 12), I wonder why there was no mention of the Alameda Plaza Hotel. 
As far as I'm concerned, if I can't stay at the Alameda Plaza I don't want to 
go to Kansas City. The address is 401 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, Mo. 64112, 
(816) 756-1500.

PROFESSORS ADORE/ABHOR PUPILS, REVERE/REGRET THEIR OWN CALLING

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching issued the 
results of a survey of 5,000 college and university professors. Professors were 
asked to appraise their students and their jobs (not the same thing). The 
results: Johnny can't read. We knew that. Johnny is a bore. Did we know that? 
</P>
<P>
Undergraduates are unwilling to work hard, doing just enough work to get by. 
Students are more grade-conscious now -- and more likely to cheat. 
</P>
<P>
Responding professors, 64% of them, agree with the survey statement that "many 
students ill-suited to academic life are now enrolling in colleges and 
universities." 
</P>
<P>
We should be as wary of despairing opinions among adults regarding youth as we 
are wary of the reverse. Children are both critics and heirs. In either case, 
our perception of their behavior ought to tell as much about us as about them. 
</P>
<P>
My own generation -- the one that went to college in the 1960s -- was famous 
for proclamations of freedom. We were free -- of parents and grandparents and 
government and corporations and all that stuff. Suddenly the Winter Palace was 
overturned. We were our own teachers. History hadn't worked. "Don't trust 
anyone over 30." 
</P>
<P>
The '60s generation was conceived during the postwar years -- the baby boom. 
Far from being free of history, we were tied to history by birth, a biological 
continuation of the species after cataclysm. During the war our parents had 
seen the world nearly destroyed. And after the war, a blanket of optimism, the 
necessary hypocrisy, was thrown over the obscene memory. America rewarded 
knowledge of evil with a GI Bill that would transform higher education into 
mass education. 
</P>
<P>
The generation of the 1960s, having presumed to overturn history, is not now 
resigned to being itself overturned. Our authority was our youth. We undermined 
our authority by growing old. Haven't our children noticed some hypocrisy? 
</P>
<P>
The faculty members surveyed by Carnegie identify themselves on a 5-point scale 
as "moderately liberal." They perceive their students as "conservative" -- 
politically conservative and conservative in life style. 
</P>
<P>
About 84% of the professors believe "undergraduates have become more careerist 
in their concerns." 
</P>
<P>
I taught freshman English as a graduate student during the late-1970s. I 
remember lecturing a class about Hamlet while at the back of the room, several 
premed students studied biochemistry behind propped-up Shakespeares. What did 
my class matter when there was a "real" course to follow? Who had time for 
soliloquies? 
</P>
<P>
The new careerism was a rejection of the romantic rhetoric of the 1960s. 
Student of the late-'70s saw clearly enough that the '60s radical was enrolled 
in law school now, that the anti-war activist had become an aerobics superstar. 
</P>
<P>
The romance of the 1960s was that higher education should be made available to 
groups of people who had never reached it before. What the next generation had 
to realize was that a degree was worth less than before. To distinguish oneself 
in the 1970s one needed a degree beyond college. Law. Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
I heard teachers in the 1970s -- I was one of them -- disdain the new 
careerism. The young, discovering pragmatism, had turned us into what we 
thought we would never be: just another generation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few things the young seem to have kept from us is rock music. They 
hear its beauty and its darkness. What grandmother understood -- that the world 
can be disrupted -- today's young take for granted. They accept despair calmly, 
through the earphones of their Walkmans. Talk to undergraduates. They're not 
interested in George Bush or Michael S. Dukakis; they care little for left or 
right. They are more likely to be environmentalists. They can imagine incipient 
tragedy larger even than their grandparents remembered. There is literally a 
hole in the future, somewhere over the pole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am apprehensive about the future of this country," so agreed 63% of the 
professors. 
</P>
<P>
 When I left graduate school, I was scandalized to discover that many adults 
could not read or write -- I mean adults who had been to college, men and women 
who worked in banks and elementary schools. My first job was to revise the 
everyday correspondence of businessmen. One of the men who employed me was a 
Yale graduate with the language skills of a grammar school student. 
</P>
<P>
America keeps its secret, but "basic skills" may be rarer in this age of mass 
education than anyone cares to admit. Basic skills may even be irrelevant. Who 
knows? Perhaps Peggy Noonan knows. The most powerful men and women in America 
routinely pay a Peggy Noonan to write what they will say. 
</P>
<P>
I know teachers who cannot write; I know others who insist that if you cannot 
write clearly, you cannot think clearly. 
</P>
<P>
During the ferociously democratic 1960s, I noticed a loss of confidence among 
certain professors. They seemed afraid of the implication of their role. One 
insisted that students call him by his first name. Another rejected the idea of 
grades. His solution was to give all A's. 
</P>
<P>
In those years, some students believed a classroom should reduce to commerce: 
"I'm paying for this," the student reminded the university. As teachers 
inflated grades, student assumed the right to evaluate professors, as one would 
evaluate an employee. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, the faculty members polled by the Carnegie Foundation 
complain about "grade inflation" at American colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
About 62% of the professors admit that grade inflation is a "problem at my 
institution." Are they talking about the teacher down the hall or their own 
classroom? 
</P>
<P>
There has been a "widespread lowering of standards in American higher 
education," say 67% of the educators. Lowering of which standards, and by whom? 
</P>
<P>
Many faculty members admit that they spend little time attending meetings of 
the faculty senate. Many have never participated on an administrative 
committee. These same professors complain about the "autocratic administration 
of their schools." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, affirmative action was the hot issue on campus. Many professors 
wouldn't engage the issue publicly. And all questions of affirmative action 
were relegated to "the administration." Today's difficult issue is the canon -- 
are there texts, dates, memories, all American student should know in common? 
Again the professors fret privately. But at prominent universities students 
have already been offered the option: you decide. 
</P>
<P>
Among Carnegie respondents, 77% would make the same job choice if given the 
chance anew. But 44% say they would like the option of early retirement. Like 
many other Americans, most professors think they receive a "good" salary but 
not an "excellent" one. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism of undergraduate careerism, there is something careerist 
about this enterprise. The survey reduces the complex experience of teaching to 
numb-skull assertions: "I enjoy interacting informally with undergraduates -- 
agree, neutral, disagree." Check one. The language belongs to the rating game, 
less opportunity for nuance than on a tax form. Carnegie posits teaching as a 
job, not a vocation, and that may be the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Our professors say they are pessimistic about their students. They also say 
they are content with their jobs. They feel decisions are being made without 
their say. They are disappointed with the young. They like working with the 
young. Our professors, for all their degrees, agrees and disagrees, end up 
sounding so much like other Americans.

NEW U.S.-JAPAN MERGER: IS AMERICA A JUNIOR PARTNER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald Brownstein, Ronald Brownstein covers politics for the National 
Journal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the international economic struggle against Japan, many U.S. politicians 
depend on entrepreneurs such as Apple Computer Co. founder Steven P. Jobs, 
whose latest firm, Next Inc., just introduced a dazzling new computer. 
</P>
<P>
But if Next stands as a symbol of U.S. potential to hold the technological 
line, it also demonstrates the increasing difficulty of mapping the border 
between the two economies. For Next's fortunes are entwined with Japan's Canon 
Inc., which provides key technology for the computer, handles distribution in 
Asia and owns one-sixth of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Rules in the conflict are rapidly changing: "Events in the commercial world are 
running at 78 rpm while events in the political world are running at 33, if 
that," said GOP strategist Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., president of the Hudson 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The key commercial event driving -- and confounding -- politics is the 
continuing integration of the U.S. and Japanese economies. Japanese investment 
here rises, joint ventures proliferate, U.S. manufacturers grow increasingly 
dependent on Japanese components and Japanese manufacturers move more 
operations to the United States. This powerful trend is generating intense but 
contradictory political currents that baffle both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Growing Japanese commercial presence has stirred public fears of U.S. economic 
decline and calls in Congress for renewed efforts to protect U.S. positions in 
key industries. But the very process of integration complicates the development 
of policies that respond to it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is making it harder to identify what an American firm is," said Jeff Faux, 
president of the Economic Policy Institute. "Is it one with 51% ownership by 
American individuals or institutions? Or is it a firm that operates in America 
and maybe is owned by somebody else? There is no legal answer to this." 
</P>
<P>
That blurring complicates the debate now heating up over how to defend U.S. 
competitiveness in cutting-edge technologies -- such as advanced 
semiconductors, fiber optics and high-definition television (HDTV), which some 
maintain could be the key consumer electronics product for decades to come. In 
a study released last week, Faux's institute warned that failure to develop a 
U.S. HDTV industry could cost 2 million jobs by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, though, has rejected calls for greater government 
spending on HDTV and it has reportedly prepared cuts in the existing research 
budget. Worried legislators maintain the Administration is contemplating the 
elimination of support for Sematech, a consortium blending public and private 
funds to conduct basic research in the semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>
Even as George Bush rejects such partnerships, support for them is moving 
toward the center of the Democratic economic appeal. That is the latest stop in 
the party's long search for a policy that would respond to the voters' 
persistent but vague unease about the nation's economic future. With both 
unemployment and inflation restrained since the first part of the decade, most 
Democrats have viewed the fears of national decline as their best -- perhaps 
only -- opportunity to talk economy to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, House Democrats twice pushed through "domestic content" 
legislation aimed at preventing U.S. auto manufacturers from moving jobs 
abroad; when that failed in the Senate, House Democrats proposed an industrial 
policy aimed at nurturing "sunrise" high technology industries. But that sank 
too, in interminable disagreements with Rust Belt Democrats over how much 
emphasis should instead be placed on reviving "sunset" manufacturing 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Then House Democrats turned toward tough trade legislation sponsored by Rep. 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), which imposed automatic sanctions on countries 
that ran large trade surpluses with the United States. That died in the Senate 
-- to the relief of many Democrats who feared being labeled protectionist. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gephardt's tough talk on trade struck sparks with voters although he 
justifiably took enormous criticism for focusing too much blame on foreign 
trading partners and not enough on failures at home. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Gephardt and other House Democrats have shifted emphasis again. 
Without diminishing criticism of foreign partners for closing markets, they are 
now revisiting a form of industrial policy aimed at restoring U.S. capacities. 
A wide spectrum of liberal activists calls for greater public investment in 
education and research and the creation of "industry-led" government 
partnerships to nourish U.S. companies in emerging industries, particularly 
HDTV. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gephardt, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) and other House 
Democrats have stepped up efforts to prevent U.S. technology from being 
exported. Their fight with the Bush Administration this spring over its deal to 
construct the FSX fighter plane with Japan ran on fears of providing critical 
technology that the Japanese could then use to challenge U.S. civilian aircraft 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the Democrats sharpen their America-first program -- and prepare 
for war with Bush over his retreat from the government's modest efforts to 
support emerging technologies -- the ground may be shifting beneath them. While 
the political debate hardens into the language of conflict, much of the 
commercial dialogue gravitates toward the vocabulary of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The FSX fight was intended to help no firm more than Boeing Co., one of 
America's premier exporters. And yet, after Democrats spent months warning 
about allowing Japan into the civilian aircraft industry though the back door, 
Boeing recently invited three Japanese partners through the front door to 
participate in the construction of its next major plane. Even more striking was 
the recent announcement that the semiconductor industry, which supports a 
government program to encourage U.S. production of HDTV, is negotiating to 
design and supply components for Japanese HDTV firms. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates insist these alliances only underscore the need for government to 
bolster threatened strategic industries. Without the prospect of government 
help, they maintain, these industries can only choose between allying with the 
Japanese or falling fatally behind them. 
</P>
<P>
But if the alliances are good business, they are unquestionably bad politics 
for the advocates of "industry-led" partnerships. Firms in such alliances -- 
like firms dependent on Japan for key parts -- could be less likely to push 
Capitol Hill for programs that might offend their partners. Voices urging 
greater synergy -- and less competition -- between the two nations could become 
dominant. 
</P>
<P>
But that point is not here yet -- certainly not in the minds of the voters, or 
in important segments of the business community. Just last week, a task force 
of industry leaders recommended an ambitious government program to revive the 
ailing semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is likely to recoil from all suggestions that smack of industrial policy. 
Though the Administration has pressed for greater access to the Japanese 
market, it has thought little about ensuring that U.S. manufacturers can 
compete in battleground industries. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, greater integration between the U.S. and Japanese economies 
may be inexorable. But if Americans fear they are slipping into junior-partner 
status, Bush could face charges of unilaterally disarming the United States in 
what is becoming the most pressing test of national strength.

WAR IN THE WORLDS OF ART: DAVID VS. POLITICAL GOLIATH; 
</P>
<P>
NEA: AS THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND GRANT-GIVING GROWS POLITICALLY CHARGED, ARTISTS 
MUST BECOME AWARE OF WHAT THEY CAN DO TO DEFEND THEIR WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Federal funding of the arts or, more accurately, the threat of withholding that 
funding, is being used to intimidate artists and arts organizations into 
producing "politically correct" art. Here, in America. This is embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
Well, artists never believed the cultural propaganda that Art is above 
politics. We know that Truth and Beauty aren't above politics -- Sen. Joseph R. 
McCarthy and Roy Cohn made up truth as they went along; Richard M. Nixon denied 
it. Does anyone believe Oliver L. North "didn't know it was illegal to lie to 
Congress"? Beauty? Our Miss America, after the Vanessa Williams brouhaha, was 
blonde and blue-eyed. Sexism is certainly political. So nothing is beneath 
politics. Why would anyone think that Art floats above the fray -- our hot-line 
to the sublime? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe part of the problem is that we've been taking our artistic license for 
granted. Take a look at who's been doling out those grants lately and who's got 
the power to revoke that license. Look what happens when art runs a stop sign: 
Our license is history, right? We're only a roll of the dice away from: "Go 
Directly to Jail! Do Not Collect $200." 
</P>
<P>
If we're surprised by the conservative cultural agenda, or by how much 
political hay Sen. Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.), has harvested by cutting an old 
fashioned flattop out of the long hairs at the National Endowment for the Arts, 
Washington's Corcoran Gallery and the Art Establishment in general -- then we 
haven't been paying attention for the last eight years and 11 months. Whether 
Helms or Gov. George Deukmejian or art critic Hilton Kramer, these people and 
their constituencies are dangerous to the health of the First Amendment, the 
arts and arts organizations and rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
For Helms, attacking the NEA is a no-lose tactic. Gay-bashing always garners 
campaign contributions from his power base. Religious sanctimony is good for 
votes in ugly political elections. Conservatives have easy targets. 
</P>
<P>
We better get hip to the politics of art -- its role in the political economy 
of American culture. The culture industry is big business. Arts organizations, 
museums, artists' spaces, art schools, university art and art history 
departments have always been financially beholden to various combinations of 
federal, state, city, corporate and philanthropic institutions. Cultural cachet 
and currency are products of a sophisticated manufacturing and distribution 
network that conflates patronage, commodification, public relations and 
advertising -- often disguised as "criticism." All to tickle the ideological 
desires of the powerful while perpetuating the status quo. And to make money. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong, artists need this pipeline -- it's the only game in town. 
But we can't afford to have any illusions about how it works. When we receive 
funding, it's our job to know the location of all strings attached. When some 
agency tries to jerk strings, we have to know how to string along jerks. 
Artists must learn to play political hardball. Art has always had the capacity 
to be politically powerful -- it has been used as a potent cultural weapon -- 
and many artists have been effective politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the controversy over Michelangelo's David -- the greatest 
sculpture of a full male nude figure in Western art. When the Medicis were 
expelled from the Republic of Florence in 1494, they repaired to Rome, plotting 
and maneuvering to regain control of the little city-state with their allies, 
Cesare Borgia and his father, Pope Alexander VI. The Medici-Borgia campaign 
reached crisis proportions in 1501, when the Republic decided to commission 
Michelangelo to make a large sculpture that would deliver a message of 
defiance: The David (Florence) would do battle with Goliath (the Medicis and 
the Pope in big bad Rome). Even as Michelangelo was working on the sculpture, 
it was so inflammatory that Florence had a shed built around it to maintain 
secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
Before the statue was completed, a meeting was held in Florence on Jan. 25, 
1504, to settle on its placement. Leonardo da Vinci attended. Sandro Botticelli 
was there. Piero di Cosimo and Filippino Lippi sat in. The minutes of this 
extraordinary gathering still exist at the duomo in Florence. Tensions were 
high -- the sculpture's location had enormous symbolic significance. Nine 
different sites were suggested, but the battle came down to either the front of 
the Palazzo Vecchio or the Loggia dei Lanzi. If the David were in front of the 
Palazzo, with his terribilita scowl facing south -- at Rome -- it would be an 
obvious challenge to the despotic Medicis. If placed in a niche at the Loggia, 
its political implications would be neutralized. The group ultimately opted to 
go for the jugular: The statue was to be placed in front of the Palazzo. 
</P>
<P>
This situation was so combustible that, on May 14, 1504, when the sculpture was 
ready, the leaders of Florence decided it should be moved at night. During its 
journey from its shed to the Palazzo, the David was stoned by Medici 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Michelangelo wouldn't get along with the U.S. arts agencies today. 
David would have his problems, too, with Goliath's lieutenant over at the NEA, 
John E. Frohnmayer -- basically a conscientious civil servant trying to 
administer arts funding in the true spirit of the 1990 appropriations bill. The 
problem is that the true spirit of that bill is repressive. Frohnmayer, an 
attorney who had specialized in First Amendment issues, failed to notice this 
fact. His first act was to rescind a $10,000 grant for an art show focusing on 
AIDs at a New York gallery. He offered three contradictory explanations why he 
axed the grant. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with an arts community revolt that reached into the upper levels of his 
own agency, Frohnmayer changed his mind and gave back the money. The show was 
going on in any case and perhaps he has learned his lesson. We've learned ours. 
Artists must fight for their rights on all fronts. Along with developing our 
own politically effective arts lobby, alliances should be formed among all the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, the conservative arts agenda is a declaration of cultural 
civil war. Artists should use their media savvy and connections. If a huge 
statue of a naked David showed up on Capitol Hill, scowling directly at Helms' 
office, do you think he'd be upset? If squads of artists mounted guerrilla 
poster attacks on conservative cultural positions, do you think they would get 
any press coverage? Would anyone be interested in a TV movie? Let's deliver our 
message to the mainstream through the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
This is sexy stuff. It could sell a lot of Reeboks. 
</P>
<P>
What if a confederation of artists, graphic designers and printers pooled 
talents and resources to provide pro-bono promotional services to arts 
organizations? In Los Angeles alone we have movies, music, TV, print media 
facilities and artists galore. And money. All we really need is consciousness. 
When the Corcoran Gallery yielded to conservative pressure and pulled out the 
exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, it took artists about two 
minutes to figure out they could boycott that institution and it would have 
nothing to show. Artists do have power.

A CODE OF ETHICS FOR L.A.: CAN IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden, Xandra Kayden, executive director of the Commission to Draft 
an Ethics Code for Los Angeles City Government, is the author of Surviving 
Power: the Experience of PowerExercising It and Giving It Up, to be published 
in January by Free Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposals for a Los Angeles city ethics code presented last week are being 
called the toughest in the nation. The commission that drafted the 
recommendations also calls them the "fairest, clearest and most effective 
code," but that is a matter of perception. There is going to be plenty of 
discussion in the coming weeks and months as to whose perception is correct and 
what impact such a code would actually have in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the staff that drafted the recommendations, let me state that 
what makes this code tough is not its parts; none are more stringent than 
anything else in U.S. government. But it is more comprehensive: Every 
recommendation is based on procedures in the private sector or the current 
practice in some city, state or federal branch of government; or it is proposed 
law. Nothing came out of whole cloth. Nothing was drawn from our imaginations 
-- creative as they might be. 
</P>
<P>
Putting aside the question of how tough is tough, perhaps there is a more 
appropriate question: What difference will this code make in the way business 
is conducted in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
The 30 recommendations include creation of a city ethics commission; specific 
and detailed requirements about financial disclosure; prohibitions on earning 
outside income and on investments that could cause a conflict of interest, 
lobbying for those who leave city government, and campaign finance. The 
commission called for oversight of ethics regulation, the power to investigate 
and prosecute violations and an extensive training program to educate everyone 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
So what will change? We start with the assumption that most of the people who 
work for the City of Los Angeles are honest, dedicated public servants. Those 
in elected and top policy-making positions will be required to be more complete 
when they fill out disclosure forms, but we believe the new forms will be 
easier to fill in because respondents will know what is required of them 
(partly because they have been trained and partly because the questions will be 
so specific.) "Eliminate the gray" has become our motto in the past several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
For the small group of individuals who move back and forth between the private 
and the public sector, there will be guidelines: They will not be able to leave 
city government one day and become lobbyists trying to influence the decisions 
of those they left behind the next. They will be "permanently barred" from 
being involved in "particular matters" in which they had a personal and 
substantial involvement while in office; that condition could last a few weeks 
or even a few years. A staff aide who worked on developing regulations for a 
specific development could not become a lobbyist for someone bidding on it. A 
staff member will be barred for one year from lobbying the department the 
staffer left, but will be able to use knowledge of city government to lobby 
others. Elected officials and those decision-makers who have citywide 
responsibilities would be banned from lobbying anyone in the city for a year. 
</P>
<P>
These prohibitions will make it more difficult for individuals to leave City 
Hall and immediately build a career on inside knowledge. On the other side of 
the issue, these regulations will assure everyone else in the city that Los 
Angeles is not run by insiders bent on protecting their own. For the many 
individuals we met who pride themselves on integrity and honesty, these 
prohibitions will be an enhancement; no one will be able to taint their success 
because of whom they knew or what strings they could pull. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change is likely to come in two areas: enforcement and campaign 
finance. The proposed city ethics commission is modeled after the state's Fair 
Political Practices Commission. It puts teeth in the entire package. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign finance reform will require a change in the way business is conducted 
at City Hall. One proposal calls for a ban on fund-raising until nine months 
before election for that office. A similar plan, Proposition 68, was approved 
by California voters in June, 1988. Most incumbents raise most of their money 
in the years between elections. 
</P>
<P>
Our proposals would also eliminate most non-campaign fund-raising committees. 
Such "friends of" committees are currently able to circumvent the intent of 
recent city campaign finance laws, because contributions to them are not 
limited to $500. 
</P>
<P>
Partial public financing -- which provides a floor -- also makes it possible to 
impose a ceiling, in the form of expenditure limitations. Incumbents will have 
no need to spend their days and nights raising money, once they reach the 
spending limit. Challengers will have a chance to catch up in the spending and 
make their case to voters. 
</P>
<P>
Will this make a difference to Los Angeles? Yes. It will not mean the wholesale 
dumping of elected city officials, because many incumbents have the opportunity 
and the desire to maintain close relationships with their constituents. But it 
will make a difference to those officials who forget the people who put them 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Will it make a difference in the ethical measure of the city? We think it will. 
The proposals for campaign finance -- and, in fact, in the entire ethics 
package -- seek to draw sharp lines between what is acceptable and what is not, 
to establish a process for addressing conflicts of interests and to keep a 
tight a watch on the flow of money. 
</P>
<P>
When I came here six months ago, a long-time friend said, "Make sure you don't 
get taken over by those good-government weenies." He was afraid that if our 
recommendations were too tough, no one would want to serve. But is that the 
reason anyone questions a public career? Would you want your son or daughter to 
go to work for the city? 
</P>
<P>
If you have any reservations at all, it is not really because the city does not 
pay well (although we think there should be salary increases). It is not 
because they will have to disclose the cost of their house and the mortgage 
rate they pay on it. It is because you think it is a sleazy place to be. 
</P>
<P>
An ethical code requires a broad sweep -- unlike law, which must be narrow. The 
problem, of course, is that ethical behavior, unlike legal behavior, is not 
measured in narrow terms. It is reflected in a standard that is cumulative and 
general. One has a sense of integrity, or one does not. 
</P>
<P>
We think a tough code -- and only a tough code -- will make all the people who 
do public work -- or have public business -- look on city government as a place 
of honor.

ENVIRONMENTAL SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At some point, Southern California must decide whether every last fine natural 
area is going to be converted to houses, condos, office buildings, shopping 
malls and parking lots. A perfectly logical spot for making that decision, for 
drawing the line, is the Santa Rosa Plateau in southern Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-acre plateau in the Santa Ana Mountains south of Murrieta has been 
recognized by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve, one of three such special places 
in California. The Nature Conservancy has bought 3,100 acres for preservation. 
The plateau is one of California's last intact enclaves of native grassland and 
Engelmann oaks. Mountain lions prowl the plateau and golden eagles nest there. 
Occidental College botany professor Jon Keeley told The Times' Jenifer Warren: 
"This is not just a neat place; It is an extremely special place with 
ecological value that extends far beyond the Riverside County line." 
</P>
<P>
Developer Won Sang Yoo also believes Santa Rosa Plateau is a special place. He 
owns 3,855 acres there and wants to build a new community called Santa Rosa 
Springs. The development would include thousands of homes, commercial centers, 
schools and roads. 
</P>
<P>
Yoo's firm, Ranpac Communities, has gone to great lengths to plan the new town 
so it will blend into the unique environment. About 400 acres would be parks 
and golf courses, providing corridors for wildlife to roam. Only a handful of 
the 2,400 oak trees would be removed. Some 2,000 acres would remain as passive 
open space. This would be "a state-of-the-art project where people live as part 
of the natural environment," said David Dillon, a Ranpac official. 
</P>
<P>
Ranpac's efforts are commendable. But the fact is, the plateau will remain 
natural and wild, or it will not. No amount of compromising, or of painting 
houses in earth tones, will overcome the impact of development. If the Santa 
Rosa Plateau is graded and paved, perhaps no other natural area in Southern 
California is safe. This is something the Riverside County Board of Supervisors 
must consider as it begins debating this week a proposed community plan that 
would determine what, if any, level of development is tolerable at Santa Rosa 
Plateau. The area's supervisor, Walt Abraham, says the ideal would be purchase 
of the land for a regional park, but "I come from a world of reality, and we're 
not made of money." 
</P>
<P>
But the question should be: Can Southern California really afford to squander 
what little is left of its precious natural heritage?

GEORGE SHULTZ ON LEGALIZING DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legalization of drugs: Bravo! for all of us. I'm Colombian and as such I've 
suffered the horror that this last year's illegal business has produced not 
only to our Third World society, but to the American people. Violence has been 
the medium in which this demand-and-supply deal has taken place. I do not want 
youngsters depending on drugs and most of all I do not want youngsters seeing 
this business as the only way out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Let's legalize, let's take the criminal part away from selling and buying. 
Decriminalization would sharply decrease the profit motive of the dealers and 
consequently decrease supply. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a liberal, I never thought I'd agree with George Shultz!

GEORGE SHULTZ ON LEGALIZING DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Terry Smerling's column ("Punishment Won't Dent the Drug 
Crime Rate," California Commentary, Nov. 13) on drug crime is a curious beast. 
Smerling begins by blasting the President's anti-drug effort for subordinating 
"critical analysis and pragmatism" to "conventional political wisdom." 
According to Judge Smerling, the Administration seeks a "rigid law-and-order 
approach." He then goes on to recommend intensive probation and other 
alternatives to conventional incarceration and says "we must demand that our 
leaders adopt a more balanced and utilitarian approach. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Smerling's enthusiasm for his views has overrun his research. The President's 
National Drug Control Strategy, which is available in all Government Printing 
Office bookstores, calls for many of the same measures Smerling so stridently 
espouses. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the strategy calls for expansion of the criminal justice system, 
but specifically notes: "Expansion does not merely mean more police or more 
prisons. . . ." The President's strategy voices the same lament as Smerling: 
"In many jurisdictions, the choice of criminal sanctions is between prison or 
nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the President's strategy specifically suggests: 
</P>
<P>
* Halfway houses and strictly supervised addiction recovery programs. 
</P>
<P>
* House arrest programs that keep an offender incapacitated at his own expense. 
</P>
<P>
* Stiff fines and property forfeiture for "casual" users who maintain a job and 
steady income. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Judge Smerling is mirroring the President's strategy when he endorses 
"judicial coercion" to get addicts into treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The general tone of Judge Smerling's column suggests that the President has no 
plans which do not involve the criminal justice system. Wrong again; the 
National Drug Control Strategy calls for accelerated education, prevention and 
treatment efforts, including a first-year increase of over 50% in federal funds 
devoted to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, Judge Smerling would seem to have some very good ideas. Sadly, he is

RAPE VERDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Judge Negates $7.5 Million for Victim of Rape," Metro, Nov. 16: 
</P>
<P>
Let me get this straight. A man rapes a severely brain-damaged woman and she 
becomes pregnant. Her case goes to trial, the jury finds in her favor and then 
the judge negates the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David M. Schacter admits wrong was done to Andrea Nerpel but says her 
attorney couldn't prove she suffered damage. Since when is a rape not damage to 
a woman? She may not have been mentally aware that she was raped, or able to 
tell about it. But she was physically violated nonetheless. This physical 
violation of her body resulted in a pregnancy. This is in itself proof that she 
was raped. Possibly she was raped on more than one occasion when one considers 
the probability of a pregnancy occurring from one rape. 
</P>
<P>
Schacter states there was not enough evidence to prove negligence on the part 
of the nursing home. This may be debatable but, there is no lack of evidence 
that Andrea Nerpel suffered damage from the rape. She was violated and became 
pregnant by a man who did not have her consent. 
</P>
<P>
I ask Judge Schacter, can all women who are either temporarily or permanently 
unable to say no expect the same verdict? Suppose his daughter passed out, was 
raped, couldn't remember the incident and then became pregnant. Would she also 
have suffered no damage?

GEORGE SHULTZ ON LEGALIZING DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One small speech for (former secretary of state) George Shultz, one giant 
speech for mankind. Finally, someone from the Reagan-Bush years has opened his 
eyes to the drug problem ("Drug Legalization: Interest Rises in Prestigious 
Circles," front page, Nov. 20). Decriminalization is the only answer. Hopefully 
more prominent people will come out of the closet. 
</P>
<P>
However, the big story is that he thought about this while in Washington. So, 
as our country goes down the drain, our elected officials are afraid to present 
their ideas for improvement due to the fact that they might not get reelected 
or appointed. Does drug czar William Bennett ever think about this? He probably 
does, but he will continue to spend billions of dollars that we don't have, 
fighting a war we can't win. 
</P>
<P>
I never thought I could or would say this, but good for George Shultz; he may 
have started something good.

U.S. NAVAL ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headline "Navy Accident Toll Climbs to 102 for '89, Highest in Decade" 
(Part A, Nov. 11) tells of tragedies, some of which could have been avoided. 
Battleships were the mainstays of World War I, but were obsolete by World War 
II. Even the recently launched nuclear aircraft carrier is virtually an 
anachronism, overtaken by sophisticated missiles. The mind-set of the military 
is such that they kept the horse cavalry right up to World War II. Seems they 
are always fighting the last war. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa and three sister ships were de-mothballed to satisfy the egos of 
President Reagan, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman and assorted admirals. The 
result: an inaccurate shelling of Beirut, which may have led to the bombing of 
the Marine barracks and the loss of 241 lives in October, 1983, and the recent 
explosion in the gun turret on the Iowa that killed 47 sailors. So you have 
four costly, useless hunks of steel, unnecessarily stretching Navy manpower, 
bloating our already massive military budget. Who knows how many other weapons 
and bases, both here and abroad, that are simply there because they support 
some military fiefdom or some congressman's campaign chest?

DENTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to Calvin Trillin's column "A Costly Hour With Sweeney 
Todd, DDS," (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 14). 
</P>
<P>
I happen to be a retired dentist who was in active practice for many years. I 
resent the implication that all dentists are interested only in gouging their 
patients and determining the treatment on the money involved. If this article 
was written to be a comic piece, it is a failure and ends up being a vindictive 
diatribe against a dedicated group of honest and sincere professionals. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Mr. Trillin, how much did you receive as payment for this silly 
piece? Whatever it was it was a lot more than the hourly fee of your dentist, I 
am sure, and much more than you deserve.

A RESTRUCTURING IN SEARCH OF A STRATEGY; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: OUR EFFORTS TO CUT BACK THE MILITARY NOW MUST NOT LEAVE US FATALLY 
WEAKENED A DECADE DOWN THE ROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAROLD BROWN, Harold Brown was secretary of defense during the Carter 
Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unraveling of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, following clear evidence 
that Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his colleagues are deemphasizing the military 
component of Soviet power in favor of an attempt to cure the disastrous state 
of the Soviet economy, justifies a restructuring of U.S. military forces and a 
lower budget level that economic policy-makers have long sought in response to 
deficit-reduction pressure. 
</P>
<P>
But in deciding on the level and structure of defense programs, a key problem 
will be to ensure that a future reversal in Soviet policy (a possibility even 
though a complete return to pre-Gorbachev days seems wildly improbable) would 
not find a fatally weakened American and allied military capability in Europe 
or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a developed and articulated security policy for the 1990s, 
what can be said about the future defense program? 
</P>
<P>
The changed international political environment suggests a reduced active-duty 
force structure with more emphasis on reserves; retention of a high degree of 
readiness for strategic, forward-deployed and quick-reaction forces (but 
reduced readiness for the rest); full sustainability for ready forces, and a 
change in emphasis on modernization to ensure that the technology of systems 
will be available a decade from now. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to more specific issues, strategic nuclear weapons are not about to 
disappear. The United States and the Soviet Union will remain nuclear 
superpowers. The likelihood of strategic nuclear war, already very low, is made 
still lower by the easing of U.S.-Soviet political conflict. But a robust 
strategic deterrent remains the highest priority requirement of military 
forces. The strategic nuclear balance is stable, the more so with the demise of 
the Strategic Defense Initiative except as a research program. But that 
stability can be retained, or even improved, at a lower level providing that 
the reductions are properly structured and accompanied by a modernization 
emphasizing survivable forces. A strategic arms reduction agreement along the 
lines that have emerged would serve that purpose. Retention of a triad of 
forces is also indicated, but a desirable movement to a force of small mobile 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and aircraft may have to be stretched out 
by budget reductions and the wrong decisions (the B-1 bomber, rail-mobile MX 
missile) of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk (80% to 85%) of defense expenditures, however, go to conventional 
forces. And a large fraction of these are oriented toward, or justified on the 
basis of, the force balance in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the political situation in the coming years -- in any of the more 
likely scenarios -- will dictate a lower level of such forces. Withdrawals of 
U.S. ground and air forces should be done as part of arms reduction agreements 
on conventional forces in Europe. These should contain the necessary provisions 
about where American and Soviet forces go and what happens to them. 
</P>
<P>
Only the disbanding of such U.S. forces, as contemplated in the present NATO 
proposal, would reduce the budget; merely returning those forces to the United 
States would not. Additional forces in the United States could be moved to 
reserve status. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian political situation (especially in North Korea) has not yet 
paralleled that of Europe. Correspondingly, the issues of U.S. forward 
deployments and base structure do not have the immediacy of those in Europe. 
But Philippine base negotiations, U.S.-South Korean political-economic 
relations and North Korean leader Kim Il Sung's age will push them forward in 
the next year or two. In the absence of Asian equivalents to the Atlantic 
Alliance or the European Community, it makes sense to move carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Force projection forces will continue to be needed. Quick reaction forces 
(airborne and airmobile Army and Marine divisions) and the associated lift 
forces and air support will require a high degree of readiness -- and stocks to 
sustain them for some months. The Navy will not and should not reach its 
600-ship aspiration. Carriers are useful for force projection, though 
vulnerable to attack by advanced submarine or bomber weapons; 12 carrier battle 
groups will surely be enough for a balanced force. The Navy should concentrate 
more on antisubmarine and anti-cruise missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
As to modernization of conventional forces, it makes sense to retire older 
equipment while keeping a fraction of the present production lines going 
slowly. A warm production line is good insurance, but we don't need all the 
models now in production and can delay the next, far-more expensive generation 
of weapons. When we do buy them they will need to embody advanced technology, 
not only use against a less likely Soviet military threat but for possible use 
against Soviet-provided weapons elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The use of force, and the threat of its use for purposes of political 
intimidation, will not disappear from international relations. The Middle East, 
Southeast Asia and Central America provide examples. This does not mean that 
U.S. forces should be involved, but it does mean that we need military 
capabilities. And the stabilizing role of U.S. military capability for Europe 
and in East Asia, with decreased deployed forces and plans for reinforcement 
from the United States, is by no means exhausted. The political stability of 
Europe, East and West, is not automatic. A military balance, at a lower level 
in the context of an eased European political situation, is an important factor 
in making political and economic progress. 
</P>
<P>
We can only hope that a new national security strategy is being formulated, 
that it will then be translated by the secretary of defense and the chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs, with their staffs, into a military strategy, that defense 
programs and budgets will be derived from that strategy and that Congress will 
judge those programs and budgets on the basis of their military merit, rather 
than as elements in a public-works program.

NEW IMPROV'S CACTUS CAFE SERVES 'TEXICAN' FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I never thought I'd live to see a Mexican restaurant (well, not wholly Mexican; 
they call it Texican) with brutal, '70s-style design, but here it is. Bare 
brick walls, ceilings chock-a-block with exposed ducts and beams, the whole 
splash of cold water in the face. 
</P>
<P>
What is this, some kind of joke? Or maybe I should rephrase that: What, is this 
some kind of joke? 
</P>
<P>
Because technically it might be. The Cactus Cafe is the front end of a comedy 
nightclub, the new Improvisation in Santa Monica. But these ungainly air ducts 
hanging down from the ceiling aren't funny. They look like sleep tubes for 
klutzy space aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, though, the Cactus Cafe is a pretty comfortable room, with its 
surprisingly high ceiling and mirrors. It's a pleasant place to sit and eat, 
and I suppose a pretty good spot to wait for the next show. 
</P>
<P>
So what do you eat? What the original Cactus Cafe in Silver Lake served, I 
presume: Mexican dishes and a couple of gringoesque items. The American things 
are pretty good, in fact, particularly the hamburger: a thick, juicy one that 
fills a huge bun and falls apart in your hands before you're halfway through. 
The french fries are the usual blond starch rods. 
</P>
<P>
The chicken-fried steak is very likely the best in our area. First, it's really 
a tenderized steak rather than a breaded hamburger, that shameful travesty 
palmed off by a number of Diner Revival places. Second, it's very crunchily 
breaded, probably having been deep-fried. Even the best chicken-fried steak in 
the world is not an intense sort of dining experience, but this one is really 
enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
The barbecued beef ribs have a pleasant, rootless sort of sauce that tastes 
like A.1. sauce and light molasses, maybe. When they're good, or rather where 
they're good, they're very good. Some parts, however, may be dry and overdone, 
even charcoalized. 
</P>
<P>
And the chili, which Mexican purists insist is an American dish, is excellent. 
There are both stewed beef and ground meat in it, and somebody's private recipe 
of ground peppers and spices, prominently cumin and clove. The smaller of the 
two sizes is more than adequate for an appetizer. I'm a little afraid to see 
how big the large size is. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican things themselves are actually not quite of the same standard. The 
appetizer sopes, a little cup of masa, (or tamale cornmeal) are pretty good: 
tasty little beds of masa topped with beans and a choice of meats with shredded 
lettuce and red cabbage on the side. (I'm glad we're assured this kitchen uses 
no lard, because they're really somewhat oily.) But the taquitos, for instance, 
are terribly dry despite all the salsa verde on them. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entrees, which come with rice and plain boiled beans, you can order 
the usual combo plates. Note: The Sonora enchilada is actually a sort of 
aggrandized sope, a thick homemade tortilla stacked very high with onions, a 
choice of meats and some pickled red cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
The other Mexican dishes I've tried -- on the menu, incidentally, each is 
singled out as a house specialty with a little cactus plant symbol -- were all 
in some way or other disappointing. The chicken mole is not chicken stewed in 
mole sauce but a chicken breast with sauce ladled over it. Though it's not a 
very sweet mole sauce or one dark with chocolate, it is a pleasant one that 
smells of anise and cloves. The enchiladas suisas are sort of aggrandized 
versions of the taquitos, not crisp but with all the dryness. 
</P>
<P>
I've never understood the rage for fajitas -- maybe some people really crave 
tacos made with half-fried onions, tomatoes and bell peppers . . . if they're 
allowed to put them together themselves. Cactus Cafe's version is much like 
everybody else's, except that if you dig around in the bottom you may find a 
nice bit of spice in the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
A waitress told me that the flan is very good, but the only thing I've found 
available for dessert is a fried tortilla with vanilla ice cream; a sort of 
dessert tostada, I guess. I'd take the one with chocolate syrup over the one 
with stewed apples. 
</P>
<P>
She couldn't tell me why there weren't any more desserts available that night. 
Personally, I'd have a look in those air conditioning ducts. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: chili, $2.95/$3.95; hamburger, $5.95; chicken-fried steak, 
$7.75; dessert tostada, $3.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Cactus Cafe at the Improv, 321 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 
394-8664. Open for dinner from 6 p.m. daily. Full bar. Valet parking. 
MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $25 to $41.

ART NOTEBOOK: A BEATLE BROTHER STEPS FROM THE SHADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul McCartney isn't the only member of his clan involved in arts and 
entertainment. The celebrity Gallery in Brentwood is presenting an exhibit of 
limited-edition photographs and silk-screens by Michael McCartney -- Paul's 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 13 silk-screens (ranging from $1,000 to $1,700) and 18 photographs 
(from $400 to $800) in the show deal with the Beatles, though McCartney, who 
has published several books of his photographs in the United Kingdom, has 
included photos of celebrities such as Michael Jackson and Sylvester Stallone 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
The McCartney show is the second of the Celebrity Gallery's Beatle photo 
exhibits. Currently on tour around the United States is a collection of photos 
by Dezo Hoffmann, who was the Beatles' first professional photographer, hired 
to document the band's personal life. The Hoffman exhibit, on view in the Bay 
Area, also includes photos of the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
What's the Celebrity Gallery's connection with the Beatles? 
</P>
<P>
"Basically fondness," says the gallery's director, Larry Richard. "We want to 
move rock memorabilia past the hobby stage and bring it up to a collectible 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Michael McCartney enjoyed some musical success in the 1960s under the name of 
Mike McGear. His band, the Scaffold, had a British No. 1 hit with a song called 
"Thank You Very Much." He took back the McCartney name in 1980 and has 
subsequently written several children's books. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Beatle be by to see the exhibit? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know," Richard says, "but we certainly hope so. He'll be in Los 
Angeles for two weeks during the run of the show." 
</P>
<P>
Michael McCartney at the Celebrity Gallery, 11682 San Vicente Blvd., Brentwood. 
(213) 826-4255. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday, 
through Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
VISCERAL PENETRATION: That's the goal of a group show by the same name running 
at the Installations One Gallery in Encino, according to curator Laura Peisner. 
</P>
<P>
"What I wanted," Peisner says, "was a gut reaction, an emotional gut 
penetration to the work." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 40 oils, photos and drawings and 10 sculptures in "Visceral 
Penetration" were commissioned especially for the event. (They range in price 
from $250 to $3,000.) Participating artists include Rene Deloffre, Debra 
Drexler, Dan Gonzales, Leslie Hara, Francisco Hernandez, Louis Jacinto, Robert 
Moore, Sandra Mueller, Anton Paris, Peisner, Franscska Schifrin and John Paul 
Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
All of the artists are members of LAART, an organization designed to help young 
and emerging artists develop and promote their work by securing free gallery 
space in unleased portions of new buildings. Installations One, in the newly 
completed Encino Terrace Center, was donated by the Fujita Corporation for this 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is open and will have its official opening reception Wednesday from 
7:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Visceral Penetration" at Installations One, 15821 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 
981-9422. Gallery hours are 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday 
through Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
FIBONACCI AT URBANATI: Italian avant-garde artist Mario Merz will be 
re-creating one of his most famous installations at the Fiorella Urbanati 
gallery on Melrose beginning Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The installation, "Leyda's Bottle," was originally created in the late 1970s in 
Italy and installed on the walls of a deconsecrated church in the city of 
Brescia. Consisting of false walls, "Leyda's Bottle" is hung with plastic 
sheeting, steel cages and neon numbers from the Fibonacci series. 
</P>
<P>
Leonardo Fibonacci, a 13th-Century Italian mathematician, decribed the infinite 
series of numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 . . .) in which each number is 
the sum of the two numbers preceding it. 
</P>
<P>
Merz's work is the subject of a major retrospective at the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum in New York. His work was seen locally last year at the 
Museum of Contemporary art. "Leyda's Bottle" opens to the public on Dec. 6, 
with a pre-opening reception Saturday from 4 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Merz' "Leyda's Bottle" at the Fiorella Urbanati gallery, 8818 Melrose 
ave., Los Angeles. (213) 271-8094. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday 
through Saturday. Exhibit opens Dec. 6 and continues through Jan. 30, 1990.

<P>
The entire hard-line Communist Party leadership resigned Friday, forced from 
power by a week of massive pro-democracy protests that surpassed even the 
"Prague Spring" of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Party chief Milos Jakes became the third East Bloc leader to be swept out of 
office in a stunning five-week wave of political upheaval that has washed over 
the Communist world in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Little-known Karel Urbanek, a Politburo member only since October, 1988, was 
elected by the party Central Committee in a secret ballot to replace Jakes, who 
resigned along with the rest of the 13-man ruling Politburo and Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people poured into Wenceslas Square late Friday night, dancing and 
singing at the news. The joyous celebration capped a day in which 300,000 
people jammed the square for the triumphant return of Alexander Dubcek, the 
bold reformer ousted in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"An old wise man said, 'If there once was light, why should there be darkness 
again?' Let us act in such a way to bring the light back again," Dubcek had 
earlier told the jubilant crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when he heard the news of the resignations, Dubcek and top dissidents at 
a news conference jumped to their feet, shouted, "Hooray!" and hugged each 
other joyously. 
</P>
<P>
Urbanek, 48, is the former party leader of the Czech republic. He was a 
surprise choice to replace Jakes and represented a break with the rigid 
policies in place since Warsaw Pact tanks crushed Czechoslovakia's reforms in 
1968. His selection seemed designed to boost the party's flagging standing 
after a week of nationwide calls for its reform-resistant leaders to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations were offered at a closed-door session of the Central 
Committee, which was expected to approve them without delay. 
</P>
<P>
Jakes said the party had not instituted reforms quickly enough and had 
underestimated the effect of the pro-democracy movement sweeping Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In a terse dispatch, the official news agency CTK announced: 
</P>
<P>
"The general secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Milos Jakes, and 
all other members of the (ruling) Politburo and Secretariat submitted their 
resignations so that a new leadership of the party could be elected. Jakes said 
he hoped the newly elected organs of the party will contribute to a more 
resolute implementation of the process of restructuring and democratization." 
</P>
<P>
Restructuring and democratization have been key terms used by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has inspired the reforms that have swept through his 
own nation, Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's leaders, who were in stalled after Warsaw Pact tanks crushed 
Dubcek's "Prague Spring" reform movement in 1968, had resisted most of the 
reforms adopted by their formerly hard-line Communist allies. 
</P>
<P>
Since Nov. 17, hundreds of thousands of people have filled the streets of 
Prague and other cities demanding democratic reforms and the end of the 
Communists' monopoly on power. They have been the largest demonstrations in the 
nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
"For a week, our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere accompanied by large 
demonstrations," CTK quoted Jakes as saying. "The tension is gradually 
spreading to other places in the republic. We must openly say that our country 
is at a fateful crossroads." 
</P>
<P>
"We have underestimated completely the processes taking place in Poland, 
Hungary and especially recently in East Germany and their effect and influence 
on our society," said Jakes, who was responsible for the expulsion from the 
party of half a million Communists, including Dubcek. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, Jakes was named Communist Party chief to succeed Gustav 
Husak, who came to power in April, 1969, eight months after the Soviet-led 
invasion. Jakes, 67, was seen as a bureaucrat and party functionary whose 
speeches and personality have made little or no public impact despite his long 
years in high office. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek, 67, made his first public appearance in Prague since the party purge in 
June, 1970. Since his ouster, he has worked as a low-level employee of the 
state forestry services and has lived in virtual seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Dubcek, Dubcek!" and "Long live Dubcek!" the flag-waving crowd yelled as he 
appeared in Wenceslas Square, the site of repeated pro-democracy 
demonstrations. He urged them to unite to improve the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the conditions of a new 
generation," Dubcek said. "We must unify to raise our country to a higher 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-democracy demonstrations also were held in the cities of Bratislava, Brno, 
Kosice, Ostrava and Usti nad Labem, according to state-run media. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek threw his support behind the Civil Forum, an opposition group formed 
Sunday to guide Czechoslovakia's burgeoning pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
He appealed to police, militia and the army "to stand by the people's side," 
and not to destroy the search for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not act against the people. Remember, you are from the people," Dubcek 
said. He also warned demonstrators to "avoid extremist trends." 
</P>
<P>
Riot police beat hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in the square on Nov. 17, 
sparking a week of growing protests. Police have kept a generally low profile 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissident, then spoke 
to the crowd and told them that Civic Forum "is ready to negotiate with the 
authorities elsewhere than on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not up to us, but to them, whether democracy will arise from the 
excited atmosphere on the square. It is their turn to move, not ours," Havel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Havel received the Olof Palme award for human rights at the 
Swedish Embassy.

<P>
DIPLOMATS: WHEN THE HOST CITY AND ITS GUESTS CONFLICT, ONE WOMAN IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR SMOOTHING THE WATERS. 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Ed Koch, told that Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, were coming 
for a visit, said: "Great. Invite them to dinner. I'll take them to my favorite 
Chinese restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Although the reaction says something about the mayor's natural exuberance, it 
also says a great deal about this polyglot city that is host to the world's 
largest diplomatic corps, about 40,000 men, women and children from widely 
divergent cultures. They staff 159 missions to the United Nations and 87 
consulates. 
</P>
<P>
If it's not easy living with 8 million New Yorkers, it's no piece of cake for 
the New Yorkers either. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these guests live within the sometimes shelter of diplomatic immunity. 
Their various embassies are considered foreign territory, immune from New 
York's police force and city inspectors, as is the United Nations itself. And 
their 1,000 cars have special areas to park, one of their privileges, which 
doesn't stop them from parking illegally almost anywhere they choose. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 65,000 parking violations were issued to cars with diplomatic 
plates, down from 154,000 a decade earlier, an indication of better 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna Convention does specify that the diplomats should respect the laws 
of the host country. So diplomatic vehicles can be towed away by the city if 
they threaten health and safety, but unlike everyday New Yorkers, the erring 
diplomat can retrieve his or her car without cost in most circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The city concedes that there is not enough diplomatic parking space. Fifty-five 
missions and consulates don't have any. But it is the one battlefield where the 
host New Yorkers and their guests cross bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the Mexican ambassador pulled up to his designated diplomatic 
parking spot in front of his residence just as a New Yorker was backing into 
it. The ambassador asked him to move and he wouldn't. It heated up from there. 
Finally, the ambassador pulled a gun and won back his parking place. 
</P>
<P>
The person who adjudicates, mediates and calms the angry waters is Gillian 
Martin Sorensen, head of the city's Commission for the United Nations and 
Consular Corps. She is the wife of Ted Sorensen, a New York attorney who served 
in President John F. Kennedy's White House. 
</P>
<P>
Their home phone rings at all hours of the night. The diplomatic 911 number 
seems to be "Call Gillian." 
</P>
<P>
"Not that it happens every night, because it doesn't," she said. "But it still 
makes me jump because I know if they're calling at that hour, it's important. 
They know someone will respond." 
</P>
<P>
It can be anything -- including a bomb threat, a diplomatic suicide, a runaway 
child or a heart attack. "The daughter of the Indian ambassador died the other 
day of an asthma attack in a matter of minutes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a towed car, we let it wait until morning." 
</P>
<P>
For her, it is an obvious labor of love. "I learned how deeply diplomats care 
about their work," she said. "I learned how the image of diplomats as 
high-living, socializing, striped-pants types is far from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
As commissioner, she is a sometimes housemother to people who are far from 
home, in an alien environment and vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
They have their share of stolen cars, stolen car radios, even stolen license 
plates. A car belonging to Bangladesh was hijacked at knifepoint in October. 
Sorensen points out that the red, white and blue diplomatic plates make them 
highly visible. 
</P>
<P>
To counteract this, one diplomat put an "I love New York," sticker on his 
bumper. So she made them available to any embassy or consulate that wanted 
them. China, Haiti, India, Jordan, the Holy See and Hungary were among the 
first to order. Hundreds went out. 
</P>
<P>
New York is not an easy environment. 
</P>
<P>
During the telephone strike, there were about 80 calls from diplomats who 
couldn't get their phones installed and were out of communication with their 
home governments. 
</P>
<P>
Sorensen said she and her staff of 14 "were able on a selective and emergency 
basis to get their phones hooked up." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time a water main burst and flooded the Bulgarian Embassy's 
basement, where they keep important files. The water department responded 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Another time, the Chinese Consulate in Manhattan called in consternation," she 
remembered. "They looked out their windows and to their shock there were 
flaming cars speeding by." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a movie crew filming a chase scene. The crew had a permit, 
but nobody had notified the Chinese. "World War III is not breaking out," she 
reassured them. 
</P>
<P>
Part of her staff's job is to cut through municipal red tape, provide advice on 
everything from leases to insurance, from child care to provisions for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, there have been a sprinkling of minor crimes, an occasional 
shoplifting, a few assaults, usually involving teen-age sons of diplomats. But 
she insists that as a group the diplomatic corps is responsible and 
law-abiding. 
</P>
<P>
There is a curious pattern in the parking violations, which are tracked by 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a handful who tend to be chronic," Sorensen said. "And then I 
discovered from friends in London that the worst chronic offenders here are, by 
nationality, the worst chronic offenders there." 
</P>
<P>
It often reflects the attitude toward the law they have at home. When a new 
ambassador comes in and cracks down, making them pay for their own parking 
tickets, even when they are not required to pay under international law, the 
parking violations clear up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic immunity is a sometime thing. Heads of mission and their immediate 
family generally are immune from all local laws. But as one's grade in post 
descends, one's immunity erodes. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they didn't have to confront local or state law, they would have to 
face various degrees of censure from their home countries and the United 
Nations. For a while, debt was a large problem, so bad that some New York 
landlords wouldn't rent to diplomatic missions. Probably the premier case 
involved Zaire, which is not a poor country. 
</P>
<P>
When Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko came to New York on a courtesy visit, 
Mayor Koch received him. After some polite conversation, the head of state 
asked Sorensen about Zaire's debt in New York. She told him that his nation 
owed more than $150,000 in rent and other bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The president was furious and berated his ambassador and his foreign minister, 
who were there," she recalled. "When he heard the sum involved he said, 'You 
come with us when we leave here.' So I took a City Hall colleague with me and 
we went to the president's hotel. Then and there, from suitcases, they 
literally paid us in cash, bundles of cash." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the political demonstrations on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had occasions when we've had two opposing views, the pro on this side of 
the street and the con on that side of the street," she said. 
</P>
<P>
New York gives wide latitude to demonstrators, but the police firmly enforce 
the limits, broad as they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it bothers the neighbors and sometimes it bothers the people in the 
mission or consulate being picketed," she said. "We let it be a lesson in 
democracy, a lesson in free speech. I think that is not a bad lesson. They know 
they are in New York in the United States of America. They know what the rules 
and regulations are, that people can carry any flag they like and they can say 
anything, even outrageous things. 
</P>
<P>
"They may not like it and it may not be allowed at home, but those are the 
rules we go by, so they accept it." 
</P>
<P>
It's not the only lesson New York teaches the foreign diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's heartwarming to me to see that the foreigner's attitude and understanding 
toward this city and toward democratic society does change with time," she 
said. "They arrive in New York somewhat intimidated and afraid of the city. Our 
reputation is kind of frightening. When they leave, I find a lot of them love 
New York. They love the options. They love the rhythm. They love the diversity 
and the mix. They love the freedoms that we take for granted. And they leave 
with regret." 
</P>
<P>
She said the New York experience stays with them. "We know that service in New 
York is an essential step on the career ladder of diplomats. And the younger 
the country, the younger the diplomat, the more true it is. And we'll see them 
again, either as ambassador or minister or, in some cases, head of government." 
</P>
<P>
In her dozen years tending to diplomats, Sorensen has seen everything from a 
terrorist assassination to a head of government who wanted to hire a chef at 
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and take him home with him because he liked his 
pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
The Gorbachev visit on Dec. 6, 1988, marked the end of frosty and somewhat 
formal relations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only was the Soviet Union changing its historic role and becoming active 
and engaged and constructive in the U.N., but also the citizens of New York 
(were changing), with construction workers hanging out a huge sign that said, 
'Hard Hats Welcome Gorby.' It was proof that you should never give up, that 
things can change and that diplomacy is not just a highfalutin term but a 
vehicle for that change." 
</P>
<P>
A footnote to the Gorbachevs' quick trip: It took 5,000 extra police to provide 
security and traffic control, for which the city was reimbursed $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
When the Gorbachevs had to cut short the visit on Dec. 8 because of the 
Armenian earthquake, it was a great disappointment to a fourth-grade class 
where Raisa Gorbachev was to visit. The 8-year-olds were all dressed up, their 
welcome sign was up and the refreshments were ready. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where it goes beyond diplomacy to touch real people and change a view 
of another power, no longer an evil empire, but somebody's country, a people to 
know and understand and to learn about," Sorensen said. 
</P>
<P>
To her, the whole experience has been extraordinary -- and sometimes touching. 
When the sultan of Brunei arrived to celebrate his country's joining the United 
Nations, he asked what the city needed. He wanted to present a little gift. 
</P>
<P>
Of the hundreds of needs in New York, Sorensen named a few. When the Sultan 
called on the mayor, "he was about as shy as anyone I've ever seen. You could 
hardly hear him. He almost spoke in a whisper, so there was a slightly awkward 
exchange with the mayor. Then he reached into his pocket and took out his 
little gift. It was a check for $500,000 made out to 'Meals On Wheels.' "

The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday called off the search for the body of a third 
person believed killed in a Thanksgiving Day boating accident off Santa 
Catalina Island that still has investigators puzzled as to a cause. The bodies 
of an elderly Hemet couple, Robert Reid, 84, and Thelma Reid, 75, were found 
late Thursday amid debris from the wreckage of the Lucky R, the cabin cruiser 
owned by their son, Charles Reid of Long Beach. Relatives told Coast Guard 
officials that Charles Reid also was aboard the boat, which was found 
demolished about 10 miles northeast of Avalon.

CLEARER SKIES FORECAST FOR LATER TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it appeared that Orange County residents might have to stock up on 
suntan lotion for a long winter at the beach, the skies darkened Saturday and 
dampened the region with scattered showers. 
</P>
<P>
More of the same was expected this morning, followed by clearing skies and 
brisk temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Traces of rain were reported at most weather-monitoring stations throughout the 
county, and residents in cities from Newport Beach to Dana Point and Santa Ana 
said rain fell on and off during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Meager though it may have been, the rain came as a welcome relief to many 
Orange County residents eager to see even the smallest hint of a change in the 
seasons. The showers arrived just days after a lengthy bout of summer-like 
weather, when Santa Ana winds from the desert sent temperatures across the 
Southland soaring into the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered showers are expected to continue through the morning and then give 
way to patchy clouds and cooler temperatures tonight, said Bill Hibbert, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbert said a 50% chance of showers is forecast, with at most a quarter-inch 
of rain expected this morning in Orange County. But winds during the afternoon 
should "clear everything right down the coast just like a squeegee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As winds drive the clouds out, lower temperatures should creep into the county 
tonight, with the mercury expected to drop into the upper 40s across the 
county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll begin to be more like a November instead of what it's been the past 
couple weeks," Hibbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures on Monday are expected to rise into the upper 60s to lower 70s. 
</P>
<P>
The sweater weather conditions may not last long. Hibbert said Santa Ana winds 
might start up again later in the week.

* MARCH TO YOUR OWN BEAT: From star-studded tradition to offbeat kookiness, 
three parades planned for today should offer a little something for everyone. 
The 58th Annual Hollywood Christmas Parade led by Grand Marshal Sammy Davis Jr. 
kicks off at 6 p.m. at Van Ness Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. The 14th 
Occasional Doo-Dah Parade, a spoof of the Tournament of Roses, will take over

from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. along Whittier and Atlantic boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
* CRUISE WITH SANTA: A double-decker bus, provided by the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce, will carry Santa Claus, a choir and a different high school band 
along Hollywood Boulevard every night for the next 19 days starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
* SATAN SLEUTHS: Parents who want to ban a textbook because they believe it 
contains satanic material will present their grievances to officials of the 
East Whittier School District on Monday at 7 p.m. at East Whittier Middle 
School. 
</P>
<P>
* STRANGE MACHINATIONS: Engineering students at Caltech will compete Thursday 
to see who can build the best ping-pong-ball-collecting machine from a bag of 
assorted springs, plexiglass, tubing and electric motors provided by their 
instructor. The 4th Annual Caltech Engineering Design Contest gets underway at 
2 p.m. in the Baxter Lecture Hall in Pasadena.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pay and Ethics Package 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 252 to 174, the House approved legislation (HR 3660) raising the 
pay of members of Congress and tightening their ethics rules. The bill, which 
also hiked the pay of federal judges and high executive branch officials, was 
sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
House members and senators would receive a 7.9% cost-of-living increase Jan. 1 
plus a cost-of-living hike of up to 5% and a 25% raise in January, 1991. This 
would raise their present $89,500 salary to about $125,000, up about 40%. 
Salaries of up to 834 top executive branch officials, including Cabinet members 
and 1,115 Supreme Court, appellate and district court judges, also would rise 
under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Tightening congressional ethics, the bill prohibits lawmakers from keeping 
honorariums such as speaking fees, caps outside earned income at 15% of 
congressional pay, prohibits members from accepting gifts worth more than $200 
and stiffens travel rules. It repeals in 1993 the law under which House members 
elected before 1980 can convert campaign contributions to personal income when 
they leave Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Robert Livingston (R-La.) said, "We cannot allow ourselves to be 
intimidated by the Ralph Naders of the world, who in their own monastic 
thinking think that everything that government does is absolutely corrupt and 
therefore there should be no government." Nader opposes the raise. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent James Traficant (D-Ohio) said: "I understand the game. We come in with 
ethics reform and sneak in a pay raise." He added that members should not 
receive a raise until they show they can tame the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pay raise-ethics reform package.

Civil Rights Commission 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 278 to 135, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3532) to renew 
the U.S. Civil Rights Commission for six months beyond its scheduled expiration 
on Nov. 30. Democratic sponsors said the time would be used to seek 
Congress-White House agreement on a major restructuring of the faltering 
agency. The commission has been a battleground between civil rights activists 
and congressional Democrats on one side and the Reagan and Bush administrations 
on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The bill shelved President Bush's plan to extend the agency for six years under 
new commissioners appointed by him and Congress. It also dealt the White House 
a defeat by transferring from the President to Capitol Hill the authority to 
appoint the commission's staff director. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to extend the life of the U.S. Civil Rights 
Commission for six months as advocated by the civil rights lobby rather than 
six years as urged by President Bush.

To Fund Population Control 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 244 to 178, the House approved $15 million in American support of 
a United Nations program to slow global population growth. The payment to the 
U.N. Population Activities Fund could not be allocated to China, said by 
critics to have coercive abortion and sterilization policies, or spent anywhere 
on abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House approved the conference report on a foreign aid 
bill (HR 2939). It reversed a previous House stand against U.S. support of the 
fund, and put the House in agreement with the Senate that the $15 million 
should be sent to the U.N. However, the House then reversed itself again, 
approving an amendment by anti-abortion legislators that gives President Bush 
power to block release of the money. The Senate then refused to accept the new 
House conditions involving the President. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter John Porter (R-Ill.) said, "Human rights violations in China cannot 
be used as an excuse to cut off funding for voluntary family planning in . . . 
120 other countries." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Christopher Smith (R-N.J.) denounced "forced sterilization and forced 
abortion that have become commonplace in China's brutal one-child-per-couple 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted America to contribute $15 million to the U.N. 
Population Activities Fund.

TOLERANCE, DIVERSITY IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As many community members in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach know, I was recently 
reelected to the Newport-Mesa school board. I want the community at large to 
know how many community members came forth -- not so much to support me as an 
individual as to uphold the public schools' and our nation's heritage of 
tolerance and diversity. 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of the campaign, parents and non-parent community members 
spoke out on behalf of providing our children with a breadth of information 
about the world in which they live. They want our young people able to deal 
with the diversity of ethnicity, of religion, and of perspective -- which 
enriches our society. These people spoke up. They took a stand. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time there are some people who feel so strongly that their specific 
views on an issue are the only right ones, they cannot embrace the consensus 
forged by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
While I do not acknowledge these individuals' right to impose their views on 
others, I do respect their right to feel as they do and urge all of us to move 
forward from here. We must focus on the fact that almost every person's actions 
have come from a deep personal belief about what is best for children. Though 
neighbors and people who were previously friends may now have to agree to 
disagree on specific issues, my hope is that everyone will do what he or she 
can to reforge friendships, and to reheal neighborhoods.

THE FEEDING OF CATS AT CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning the story about the many "kitties" that are being fed at the Corona 
del Mar cliff: not a good idea! 
</P>
<P>
This kind of publicity only serves to encourage people who no longer want their 
cat or kittens to dump them there. 
</P>
<P>
Feeding these cats does not make a person kind. It only adds to the cruelty or 
suffering for many of these animals. 
</P>
<P>
Are any of these felines ever captured to administer the necessary vaccinations 
so they will not suffer from common disease? When one of these cats becomes 
very sick, it goes away and dies a slow death. 
</P>
<P>
Those who feed the cats should be aware that not all of these cats get their 
"fill." The most aggressive ones eat most of the food. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, on the beautiful cliffs of Corona del Mar there is pain and there is 
suffering.

MEASURE M AND THE NORTH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a North County resident, I can tell you that my "no" vote on M had nothing 
to do with tax rebellion or the like (Nov.16). The 10 pieces of mail and the 
five phone calls I received several days before the election convinced me that 
this was no "citizen initiative" but a multimillion-dollar campaign by land 
developers supported by politicians who depend on their contributions and 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
The net effect of Measure M was to improve the probability that developers 
could continue to build homes in the southern and southeastern fringes of the 
county by making commuting from these outlying areas easier. This would further 
entice homeowners and others to move from the older, and in some cases 
declining, neighborhoods in the north to newer suburbs in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M provided little in the way of mass transit in the increasingly dense 
north where it might have had a chance of succeeding, financed by a sales 
rather than gas tax. 
</P>
<P>
As a person who normally votes in favor of public works projects and bond 
issues and who found some good aspects of M, I nevertheless voted against it 
for the reasons given above.

SCR'S ETHNIC QUOTAS AND ARTS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re ethnic balance on the arts (Nov. 13). The South Coast Repertory's grant 
request was cut by 23% by the California Arts Council because it didn't have 
its quota of Latinos on its board, and the Times applauds the move. Presumably 
SCR's grant request will be restored if it fills its Latino quota next year. 
</P>
<P>
To quote The Times: "SCR has shown its commitment to minorities in ways its 
board composition does not indicate. It sponsors the nationally recognized 
Hispanic Playwrights Project, which showcases budding authors. All told, it 
spends $500,000 on (the) community." 
</P>
<P>
But SCR's commitment to minorities doesn't matter to the California Arts 
Council. Nor do SCR's nationally recognized results matter. Why? Because the 
commitment and successes came from a board whose ethnic balance does not meet 
the criteria set by the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum has more than its quota of Latinos so it gets its 
grant. Neither The Times nor the anonymous member of the arts council says what 
the museum does for the Latinos. That doesn't seem to be important. Neither is 
what SCR does for Latinos important. 
</P>
<P>
The Times and the California Arts Council determine whether a group is worth it 
or not by looking at the ethnic origin of the name. 
</P>
<P>
Shame on you and the arts council. I thought we had come further that that. How 
sad.

TOLERANCE, DIVERSITY IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding sex education in the Newport-Mesa school district, Bonnie O'Neil 
states that the curriculum should be chosen by "selected" parents and school 
personnel. Who will select the "selected" parents and by what and whose 
criteria? Will they be selected so that they ensure the students are presented 
with incomplete, inaccurate information that will ill prepare them to make 
life's difficult choices in this ever more complicated world? 
</P>
<P>
High school age students are not gullible little children whose behavior and 
values can be twisted any which way. If they are taught the "right" values at 
home then Ms. O'Neil need have no fear they will misuse the complete, accurate 
information they receive in a sex education class.

in trying to ensure that the public is well and diligently served. On the one 
hand, they are constantly accused of failing to police themselves, and on the 
other, they are constantly thwarted in any attempt to protect the public by 
accusation of self-interest and ever-increasing judicial restraints. 
</P>
<P>
The action of Superior Court Commissioner Ronald Bauer in stopping the attempt 
of the California State Board of Medical Quality Assurance, appointed by the 
governor to maintain professional standards of practice, to restrict the highly 
questionable activities of an Orange County physician is very frustrating. 
According to The Times report (Nov. 15), in spite of accusations that the 
physician prescribes massive doses of hormones for almost any ailment and 
despite a statement by the BMQA that no scientific evidence for his treatment 
exists, and notwithstanding the fact that the physician had been previously 
cited by the board, the jurist not only failed to restrain the physician from 
this practice but, again, according to The Times and for reasons which are not 
clear, refused even to hear the state's case. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Medical Assn. and every hospital in the county maintain 
credentials committees and other formal boards to attempt to ensure that the 
public receives ethical and appropriate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
From personal hours and hours of effort spent to find out what ethical, honest 
doctors can do to limit or eliminate spurious treatments prescribed by doctors 
of doubtful ability and motivation, I know that the best of professional intent 
is almost always stymied by the admonition of legal advisers that doctors can't 
act to protect the public without exposing themselves to the real and 
ever-growing threat of punitive legal action, including large fines and even 
prison in the name of restraint of trade. 
</P>
<P>
This latest mysterious action by a prominent Orange County jurist tends to 
support the "Oh, what's the use" despair that more and more of us are feeling. 
</P>
<P>
If doctors and their professional organizations are prevented from effective 
self-policing, there will be nobody left to do it but the politicians -- those 
same wonderful folks who brought you the $900 hammer and the $300 screw.

THE FEEDING OF CATS AT CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feral cats do not have a good life, contrary to the description given in the 
story about the cats of Corona del Mar (Nov. 15). The experience I've had with 
a group of wild cats living in a park near my home is that the life of these 
animals -- also fed by a handful of caring people -- is pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Adult cats have chronic eye infections or wounds and abscesses from fighting, 
but are too frightened or wild to catch and treat. The kittens I have rescued 
were all suffering from roundworms and tapeworms, and are emaciated and 
dehydrated. Others, their eyes glued shut with crust, constantly scratched at 
hundreds of fleas crawling on their tiny bodies. 
</P>
<P>
A high concentration of cats in a public area can be a health hazard for 
humans. Cats get toxoplasmosis, an internal parasitic disease, from eating 
birds and rodents. Toxoplasmosis is highly infectious to humans who come in 
contact with cat feces and is especially dangerous to pregnant women because it 
can cause birth defects. The possibility of a rabies outbreak in a population 
of feral cats is high. Then the situation will no longer be cute. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that the cats live in some kind of paradise by the sea may encourage 
people to abandon their own unwanted, unvaccinated, unaltered pets -- leaving 
them for someone else to feed and worry about. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of cats and dogs are born in Orange County every year. There 
are not enough homes for all of them. Most end up in animal shelters, where 
they are humanely put to sleep, or they are illegally abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Pet overpopulation is a serious problem that the public creates and the public 
can solve. Spaying or neutering a pet so that it cannot breed is the only 
solution. If cost is a problem, there are low-cost spay/neuter clinics, and 
animal humane groups often provide assistance. 
</P>
<P>
If each pet owner would take this responsible step, then perhaps one day there 
would be no feral cats or overcrowded animal shelters or euthanasia.

EASTERN BLOC UNREST CASTS DIFFERENT LIGHT ON FINLAND'S '39 WINTER WAR WITH 
RUSSIA 
</P>

HELSINKI, Finland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finland this month remembers its short but bitter Winter War with the Soviet 
Union, mindful of the fate it could be sharing with Moscow's restive Baltic 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting began on Nov. 30, 1939. At the armistice 105 days later, Finland 
had suffered 25,000 dead. It had to seek peace and lost vast tracts of 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
However, it had also bloodied Stalin's armies, which by Finnish estimates lost 
between 200,000 and 250,000 dead, and Finland had survived as an independent 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look across the Gulf of Finland and see what is happening in Estonia, 
you can't help thinking that there, but by the grace of the Winter War, would 
be Finland," said Max Jakobson, former Finnish ambassador to the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1939, the Soviet Union, led by Josef Stalin, and Hitler's Nazi 
Germany signed a nonaggression pact with a secret protocol that divided Europe 
into Soviet and German spheres of influence. 
</P>
<P>
Finland and the Baltic states fell into the Soviet sphere. One by one the small 
nations on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland acceded to Soviet demands 
to station troops on their soil, a presage to lost independence. 
</P>
<P>
Finland was told in early October that it must agree to host a Soviet base. The 
border on the Karelian Isthmus, just 20 miles from Leningrad, had to be moved 
back 24 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Finland refused. Talks broke down in mid-November and the war began two weeks 
later. 
</P>
<P>
As the "phony war" at the start of World War II simmered in the rest of Europe, 
Helsinki was bombed from Soviet bases in Estonia, which with Lithuania and 
Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic republics have since condemned the 1939 pact and there has 
been agitation for autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Jakobson said that by retaining its independence, Finland has saved Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev from one more headache. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have to feel threatened. Essentially, it's a consequence of the 
fact that . . . we were not occupied. Our system was not destroyed and we 
retained our independence." 
</P>
<P>
Professor Tuomo Polvinen of the Academy of Finland said Soviet intentions for 
Finland at the time will remain unknown until researchers had access to closed 
archives. 
</P>
<P>
"We still do not know what were Stalin's final aims regarding Finland," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, Soviet commentators had blamed Finland for the war, historians 
said. But it is now being reassessed in the light of Gorbachev's policy of 
glasnost, or openness. 
</P>
<P>
"The Winter War was the first open reaction against the pact," Helsinki 
University history professor Jukka Nevakivi said. "Nobody knew about the 
protocol at the time but many people had an idea those two devils had shared 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
He also has no doubt that the Soviet plan had been to occupy Finland. 
</P>
<P>
"We would now be about 50% Russians, like in Estonia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said documents show that the Soviet commanders expected a rapid victory. But 
fighting was fierce along the front, which stretched from the isthmus to the 
Arctic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nevakivi, troops fought hand-to-hand with knives in the permanent 
Arctic night around the port of Petsamo. Ski-borne Finnish commandos, dubbed 
"white ghosts" because of their camouflage, harried the Soviet forces. 
</P>
<P>
Many Soviet soldiers, ill-prepared for war in temperatures 50 degrees below 
zero and lacking even boots and winter camouflage, died of cold, Nevakivi said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being outnumbered -- 126,000 Finnish troops faced up to half a million 
Soviet soldiers -- the Finnish lines held until a Soviet offensive in February, 
1940. But finally, the overwhelming Soviet strength ground down the defenders 
and the Finns decided to seek peace. 
</P>
<P>
The price was far higher than the original Soviet demands. Finland conceded the 
naval base and lost about 10% of its territory, including the Karelian Isthmus.

AS AIDS STRIKES CATHOLIC IRELAND, A DISPUTE ERUPTS OVER LIMITED SALE OF CONDOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DUBLIN, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dublin, the city at the center of the fastest-growing AIDS epidemic in Europe, 
has been hit by a dispute over the sale of condoms, widely recognized as one of 
the most effective measures for preventing the killer disease. 
</P>
<P>
The number of AIDS cases is doubling every nine months in Ireland, but the sale 
of condoms is confined by law to pharmacies and family planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish Family Planning Assn. was taken to court in October for selling 
condoms at a record store in the Irish capital. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the law is clearly an ass," said Richard Branson, chief of 
Britain's Virgin record store chain, after the court threw out a case against 
the stall at his Dublin shop on a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make condoms in Ireland as common as sliced bread," he said after 
the court dismissed the case because the notice to prosecute was given more 
than six months after the original complaint was filed by an anonymous 
protester. 
</P>
<P>
Branson's Dublin store sells up to 350 condoms a day, many of them to rural 
clients visiting the city because they are too embarrassed to buy them locally 
in this predominantly Catholic state where abortion is illegal. Up to 4,000 
Irish women go to Britain each year for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
After the court decision, Branson told reporters it was incredible that at a 
time when every other government was trying to promote condoms in the worldwide 
fight against AIDS, Ireland was trying to stop their sale. 
</P>
<P>
Irish Family Planning Assn. chief Christine Donaghy was equally scathing in her 
criticism of Irish state policy after the case against the stall in the record 
store, which was set up by her organization. 
</P>
<P>
"This summons will cause Ireland to be seen, once again, as the laughingstock 
of Europe as our contraceptive laws and policies remain incomprehensible to our 
European neighbors -- and rightly so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The case broke in the same week that an Irish government health spokesman told 
a World Health Organization seminar in Dublin that AIDS is spreading faster 
here than anywhere else in the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two people have died of AIDS in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now entering the epidemic phase of the disease," government health 
spokesman Liam Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of cases of AIDS in Ireland is doubling every nine months," he 
said. In Britain the figure doubles every two years, in France and West Germany 
every 2 1/2 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The disease is spread mainly by the growing community of drug addicts who 
transmit it through shared needles and sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
The addicts, who account for about 60% of AIDS cases, are a major concern 
because officials fear they could be the main conduit for transmitting the 
disease to the heterosexual community. 
</P>
<P>
Donaghy's association, which gives advice to about 60,000 people a year, argues 
that the contraceptive laws are both medically and morally unnecessary and now, 
in the era of AIDS, positively dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1975 law, contraceptives -- condoms, birth-control pills, diaphragms 
and interuterine devices -- could only be prescribed by doctors to couples. 
This was amended in 1985 so that condoms could be sold in pharmacies and family 
planning centers without prescription to anyone over 18. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 95% of the Irish population is Catholic. The church is a major influence 
on social issues and was a prime mover in helping to defeat referendums to 
legalize abortion and divorce. 
</P>
<P>
A 1983 referendum overwhelmingly approved inclusion of a ban on abortion in the 
country's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child took Irish 
student union leaders to court for distributing the telephone numbers and 
addresses of British abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The censors recently lifted a longtime ban on "The Joy of Sex," a sex manual by 
Dr. Alex Comfort that has been translated into 18 languages and has sold 10 
million copies.

BAN ON IVORY TRADE MAY BRING AN END TO CARVING CRAFT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seated in his workshop where he has meticulously transformed elephant tusks 
into intricate ivory artwork for four decades, Wong Cheong-lam knows the days 
of his craft are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only one left," he sighs, looking around the workshop where six 
carvers once worked. 
</P>
<P>
The artwork crafted by the 55-year-old Wong and the 1,200 or so other ivory 
carvers in Hong Kong has long been popular. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers from the United States, Europe and Japan have eagerly snapped up 
tons of ivory worked in Hong Kong. Shop windows in tourist districts display 
works ranging from panoramic landscapes carved from an entire tusk to delicate 
earrings. 
</P>
<P>
But now the centuries-old craft may be doomed. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
adopted a ban on world ivory trading to save Africa's dwindling elephant 
population, which has dropped from 1.5 million in the 1970s to an estimated 
600,000 now -- victims of poachers after their tusks. 
</P>
<P>
The ban gives ivory traders until Jan. 18 to sell their stocks. But Hong Kong 
companies say they will need much longer to sell 670 tons of ivory, the world's 
largest known stockpile, worth about $128 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wong estimates the value of his own uncarved ivory at about $25,600 and said he 
has no idea what to do. "It'll take at least five years to carve it all." 
</P>
<P>
Local traders are lobbying the government in this British colony to allow them 
to continue sales past the January deadline and are scrambling to figure out 
how to save their industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the elephants and the carvers, who do you think should be protected?" 
asked an angry Dominic Ng, a leading ivory trader. 
</P>
<P>
Ng suggests the government forbid the import of more tusks but allow the 
carving and export of the existing stockpile until the ban is reviewed in 1991 
by CITES. 
</P>
<P>
But because the United States, Japan and other major ivory import markets are 
upholding the ban, it is not clear how much such a policy would help the 
industry in Hong Kong. The only legal market for traders would be smaller 
countries that do not belong to CITES or refuse to go along with the ban. 
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government has indicated it will abide by the trade ban, and 
officials are considering vocational training for carvers thrown out of work. 
</P>
<P>
But Wong is skeptical about retraining workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ivory carvers usually do not have much education," he said. "It is too late 
for them to learn another skill and doing other odd jobs will barely make ends 
meet." 
</P>
<P>
The government also has promised to seek support for the creation of an 
international fund to buy up the ivory stockpile in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Local traders are demanding compensation for their stockpile, which they say 
consists of ivory that was purchased with approval by CITES before it imposed 
the ban. 
</P>
<P>
A government survey found 93% of the ivory in Hong Kong contains valid CITES 
certification, but conservationists argue much of the stockpile comes from the 
tusks of poached elephants that the convention has nonetheless allowed onto the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Pirie, chairman of the local branch of the Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says the Hong Kong ivory must be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
If ivory exports were permitted to continue, it would be easy for more poached 
ivory to be smuggled into the colony and claimed as part of the original 
stockpile, Pirie argues. 
</P>
<P>
"I sympathize with the workers but I don't sympathize with the bosses," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At his workshop, in an old residential building, Wong methodically works on a 
6-inch-high elephant figure, using a tiny drill to carve wrinkles in the 
animal's feet. The project will take up to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Such craftsmanship has been an integral part of Chinese art for centuries. But 
Wong believes the long history of ivory carving in Hong Kong, a center for such 
work, is reaching an end with or without the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"Who wants to learn how to carve ivory nowadays?" he asked, explaining it takes 
five years of apprenticeship and pays only about $500 a month.

SCHOLARS PREDICT DEMISE OF GREAT PLAINS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two New Jersey scholars who predict that the Great Plains will revert back to 
the days when it was only a home where the buffalo roam got some discouraging 
words from the human herd that lives there now. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Popper and Deborah Epstein Popper say the heated reaction they got 
from the area's residents recently -- one called their work "Popperscock" -- is 
tinged with a fear that the theory that much of the Plains is emptying out is 
prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
"A region that was totally sure of itself, genuinely secure in its own future, 
would not have made so much of this," said Popper, a Rutgers University urban 
studies professor. 
</P>
<P>
The pair faced some hostile questions from about 125 North Dakota journalists 
and others at the University of North Dakota's Editors and Broadcasters Day 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Popper and his wife, a doctoral student in geography at Rutgers, suggest the 
federal government should eventually buy up most of the Plains to create a huge 
"Buffalo Commons." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a theory, and you have to ask: 'OK, we understand what you're saying, 
but what the hell do you want us to do about it? Leave?' " said Mark Carlson, 
editor of the weekly Pierce County Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Sinner didn't attend the forum, but he said that he believes the 
Buffalo Commons idea is a "passing thing," and that the Poppers did not 
appreciate the importance of the region. 
</P>
<P>
"A vast majority of the world's food supply comes from these Plains states," 
Sinner said. "And I think they think the food comes from the supermarket down 
the road and the electricity comes from the switch on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
The notion that someone from New Jersey couldn't appreciate the Plains was 
expressed by some in the audience too. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they enjoy it back home in toxic Jersey," said Lauren Donovan, editor 
of the weekly Hazen Star. "Foolishness and Popperscock like this could only 
have come from a place like that." 
</P>
<P>
But Ellen Swendsen of Hettinger, in western North Dakota, said the couple's 
views were not unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I walk around and count the empty houses and I shudder," she said. "I think 
that what the man said made a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be thinking critically," added Bismarck Tribune reporter Jeff 
Olson. "I think the challenge has been laid square in our lap . . . and I think 
we all realize that." 
</P>
<P>
The Poppers' idea, first outlined in a 1987 magazine article, envisions a 
5.5-million-acre Buffalo Commons, including large parts of North and South 
Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The commons would come about as Plains residents gradually abandon a relatively 
arid region that has never been thickly settled, despite extensive federal 
inducements and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The couple said the 1862 Homestead Act, which gave 160 acres to anyone willing 
to settle the land and stay five years, was a historic error. 
</P>
<P>
Federal encouragement of settlement on the Plains, they wrote, was "the 
largest, longest-running agricultural and environmental miscalculation in 
American history." 
</P>
<P>
The Poppers are developing maps of each of the states within the commons to 
buttress their arguments that the region is in long-term decline. Their North 
Dakota maps document 16 counties with significant poverty, population losses 
and little building activity. 
</P>
<P>
Popper acknowledges that if the counties lose all their residents, it would 
"involve a great deal of individual suffering and community hardship." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he does not believe the commons area will lose its entire 
population, nor does he advocate aggressive federal intervention in creating 
the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
"We never advocated any kind of rural version of some horrible urban renewal 
project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If somehow our work gets the Plains so irritated at us that the region is 
inspired to pull up its socks, just to prove what waterheads we are, we'd be 
delighted. We really would."

SOCIAL SECURITY TAKES FORMS TO THE STREET

Jeannie, age 69, sits in a corner of the public restroom where she spends her 
days, perched on a garbage bag filled with her belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Today her concern is her towel. "I wasted two hours this morning looking for 
that towel. I looked through that bag 10 times." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you look on the side? Sometimes things fall on the side and you can't see 
it," said Patricia Betch, kneeling on the concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
Betch, a Social Security field representative, has been trying for months to 
persuade the thin, white-haired woman to apply for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie changes the subject. She is worried about the dead bird she found while 
sleeping in the doorway of Broadway Market in the historic Fells Point district 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people leave their windows open a little bit. I think they fly into 
some people's windows at night to sleep," Jeannie said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you'd like to do, isn't it Jeannie?" asked Kathy Lorenzo, a 
psychiatric worker with Health Care for the Homeless and Betch's partner. "Why 
don't you let me find you a room?" 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie refuses politely. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo and Betch leave and Jeannie shouts her thanks for the gifts she had 
said she did not need: peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches, shirts and a jacket. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to work so hard with these people to win their trust. Jeannie is 
afraid she's signing admission papers" to a mental hospital, Betch said. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Administration has hit the streets here to seek out people 
living in alleys, restrooms and parks, under a directive to reach out to the 
homeless. It's the only SSA office with such a program. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo called Betch last spring to ask her to take an application from a 
homeless person who wouldn't enter a building. The two became a team and make 
their rounds each Wednesday, distributing sandwiches, clothing and friendship. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to go out there because the need was so great. Something had to be 
done here," Betch said, noting that 46% of Maryland's estimated 4,220 homeless 
people live in Baltimore. Statewide, 2,200 beds in shelters and transitional 
housing are available. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really afraid to go into any building. They've been out on the street 
so long that that's more relaxing to them," Betch said of the people she 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
Betch set up an advisory board of officials from 18 agencies, including 
shelters, soup kitchens, legal aid and the mayor's office. She keeps office 
hours at the Baltimore Rescue Mission on Wednesday evenings so people can find 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kurt Schmoke wants a state worker to accompany Lorenzo and Betch; many 
people who aren't eligible for Social Security will qualify for welfare 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
If Lorenzo can persuade the homeless to visit her clinic and a psychiatrist 
judges them unable to hold a job for at least a year, they qualify for $368 in 
Supplemental Security Income and medical care. Conditions that are covered 
include alcoholism, mental illness, drug addiction and physical disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to prove a disability if you have no medical records," Betch said. 
"I'm not a (medical) professional but I can tell they're sick." 
</P>
<P>
Many are old enough to get Social Security retirement benefits with only proof 
of age and an address -- but many refuse to apply. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, Betch has persuaded nine people to apply for benefits, a score she 
considers good. "They'll take a sandwich from you. They'll bid you good day, 
but until they know you . . . they have to want to file." 
</P>
<P>
Six of the nine were turned down and must reapply, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter, 62, is one of those Betch is trying to help. A gentle man with bright 
brown eyes, he qualifies for retirement benefits but won't leave a square-block 
area near the Baltimore Rescue Mission and the park where he and about 10 other 
men spend the days on benches. 
</P>
<P>
Since they began making their rounds in April, Betch said, some shelters and 
soup kitchens have agreed to serve as mailing addresses for applicants. (Many 
agencies don't want to attract hoodlums and addicts who prey on Social Security 
recipients, so they won't allow checks to be mailed there. With an address, a 
homeless person can receive benefits and open a direct-deposit account at a 
bank.) 
</P>
<P>
As they part for the day, Lorenzo is plotting where she can find Jeannie a room 
for the winter. Betch says that a congressional aide has Jeannie's power of 
attorney; maybe the aide can sign the application form. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate to find her frozen to death," Lorenzo said. "When you're out on the 
street, that's your last bid. You either go up or you die."

OPPOSITION GROWS TO CUTS IN SOCIAL SECURITY FOR OLDER PEOPLE WHO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Depression-era law that cuts Social Security benefits for older people who 
work faces growing opposition from congressional critics who say it pushes 
seniors out of the labor force when the nation needs them. 
</P>
<P>
Benefit reductions from the so-called "earnings test" can combine with federal, 
state and local taxes to produce such high marginal tax rates that many older 
workers do just as well staying home, foes say. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tremendous disincentive to work and a tremendous incentive to just 
give up and throw in the towel," said Sen. William L. Armstrong (R-Colo.). "The 
marginal tax rate on some people is easily 80% and in some cases more." 
</P>
<P>
Workers aged 65 to 69 this year lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every 
$2 earned over $8,880, and beneficiaries under 65 face a similar reduction for 
earnings in excess of $6,480 -- a 50% effective marginal tax rate by itself. 
There is no limit for those 70 and older. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the threshold is scheduled to rise to $9,360 for those 65 to 69 and 
$6,840 for those under 65, and the penalty will be less severe for those 65 and 
above: a $1 reduction in benefits for every $3 in excess earnings. 
</P>
<P>
But several proposals in Congress would relax the limits further, and calls for 
repeal are gaining new allies. 
</P>
<P>
Each year almost 1 million Social Security beneficiaries aged 65 to 69 lose 
some or all of their benefits because of the earnings test, and another 100,000 
don't file for benefits because of it. Others stop working, deliberately hold 
their earnings to just under the threshold or hide excess wages from the 
government to avoid the loss of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
A 67-year-old woman who works at a county courthouse in Illinois recently wrote 
to her congressman that "because of the earnings limit, it just doesn't pay to 
work beyond the $8,880 limit." 
</P>
<P>
A. Haeworth Robinson, chief actuary for the Social Security Administration from 
1975 to '78, once had a maid who quit because he insisted on paying Social 
Security taxes on her wages, which would have alerted the government to her 
earnings. Robinson believes the earnings test is justified, but predicted that 
its days are numbered because of mounting opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking to relax the limits include Rep. Tom Tauke (R-Iowa), who recalled 
that a woman who took care of his son faced such a big tax bite on her wages 
due to the earnings test that she "would've been better off if we had simply 
given her big presents" at Christmas and other holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly made it clear to us that the system needed to be changed," Tauke 
said. "This will be around for a while, but certainly the trend and the 
momentum is toward elimination." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the earnings test -- created along with Social Security in the 
Depression when older Americans were being encouraged to retire to free up jobs 
for young workers -- is an anachronism at a time when policy makers are trying 
to keep older people working longer and labor markets are tight. 
</P>
<P>
They also argue that it discriminates against working-class Americans because 
the benefit reductions are linked only to earnings, and are unaffected by 
unearned income such as pensions, rent and dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters, meanwhile, maintain it is only fair to limit the retirement 
benefits paid to those still pulling in a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ball, who headed the Social Security Administration from 1962 to 1973, 
said there is merit to the original concept of paying Social Security benefits 
to make up for earnings lost because of retirement. "We've already departed 
from that a long way and I don't see any reason to go further in the direction 
of making the program a straight annuity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That view is shared by Robinson, who said too many people believe Social 
Security benefits are an earned right they bought and paid for. 
</P>
<P>
Most workers get back far more in benefits than they paid in taxes, government 
figures show. A typical worker who retired at 65 in 1988 had paid about $12,000 
in Social Security taxes, which will be recovered in benefits in two years. The 
average retiree goes on to collect benefits for 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you repeal it, you're giving in to this propaganda that this is a pension, 
that it bears some relationship to what you paid in taxes, and that is just not 
true," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
After years of unsuccessful legislative jostling on the earnings test, Congress 
appears ready to relax the restrictions over the next two years. The House this 
fall passed a proposal to boost the earnings threshold to $9,720 next year and 
$10,440 in 1991. The Senate Finance Committee passed a more generous plan to 
raise the limits to $11,700 next year and then to $14,520. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King voiced support for both 
proposals, saying they would "encourage seniors to remain in the work force and 
contribute their knowledge and experience to the nation's economy." 
</P>
<P>
There also is growing support in Congress for outright repeal. About 150 House 
members are co-sponsoring a bill introduced by Rep. J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), 
that would eliminate the test for those 65 and above. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans in Congress long have favored repeal of the earnings test, but 
the idea now is gaining support among Democrats, said Carolyn Weaver, a scholar 
at the American Enterprise Institute. "It is far more likely that it'll be 
repealed or at least loosened." 
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Administration supports the concept of scrapping the 
earnings test, but isn't pushing for action because it says repeal would cost 
too much -- $25.3 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of eliminating the earnings test is the right way to go," said 
spokesman Phil Gambino. "All the belief and the logic behind it still exists, 
it's just the costs that are the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Some advocates for repeal, however, believe that scrapping the test would 
actually save money by returning thousands of retirees to the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Two conservative research groups, the Institute for Policy Innovation and the 
National Center for Policy Analysis, issued a study this fall predicting that 
at least 700,000 retirees would enter the labor market if the earnings limit 
were repealed, generating $140 million more in new, work-related taxes than the 
cost of the additional Social Security benefits that would be paid.

WHERE BODYGUARDS SPELL STATUS, SOME VIPS PREFER A LOWER PROFILE

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a typical scene in the capital: A black sedan with a red light on the dash 
sweeps into the Supreme Court basement. 
</P>
<P>
Several eagle-eyed FBI guards hover nervously around the side entrance of the 
imposing, white marble building as Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh steps out of the 
car. Make no mistake, they know their mission is to protect the boss. 
</P>
<P>
But wait -- isn't that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dashing up the stairs 
alone, off for his morning stroll near Capitol Hill? 
</P>
<P>
The contrast between the entourage surrounding the attorney general and the 
solitary wandering of the nation's top judicial official illustrates the wide 
variety of personal security arrangements in and around Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In general, security here has been stepped up in the 1980s, a decade punctuated 
by terrorist threats and actions such as the bombing of Pam Am Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, last December. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, threats from Colombian drug traders reportedly prompted 
President Bush to beef up the Secret Service guard around some of his children. 
</P>
<P>
Drug czar William J. Bennett is under the protection of the U.S. Marshals 
Service, a part of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, there is a threat to be considered as far as Bennett's work is 
concerned," said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the marshals. 
</P>
<P>
The marshals' function is to protect the judiciary, including federal judges 
and jurors, and they also assign guards to officials such as Bennett when 
ordered to do so by the attorney general, Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a big upsurge in security," said Chuck Vance, a Secret Service 
veteran who now runs a $20-million-a-year security company, Vance 
International. "There's been an increased concern." 
</P>
<P>
Vance recommends using a wide range of preventive measures -- home security 
systems and concrete barriers around buildings, to name two. He said that the 
"bodyguard business sometimes gets overdone." 
</P>
<P>
While trained security agents can deter trouble, having too many guards around 
can defeat the purpose, he said. "You will attract nuts if there is a big 
security splash." 
</P>
<P>
Bodyguards definitely are in, though, with government officials as well as 
business executives and other private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Livingstone, in his book, "The Cult of Counterterrorism," quoted 
Washington restaurateur Victor Colucci as saying that bodyguards are "a mark of 
importance. When someone says to a maitre d' that he or she needs an extra 
table for their security personnel, it is immediately assumed they are 
important." 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey of several agencies turned up a broad range of personal 
security arrangements, from the knot of Secret Service agents around Bush to 
the single staff aide who escorts Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole to the 
driver who accompanies Jack Kemp, the secretary of housing and urban 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"He just jumps in the car and away he goes. He got rid of all that stuff," said 
Kemp aide Bob Nipp, referring to the entourage with which former HUD Secretary 
Samuel Pierce traveled. 
</P>
<P>
Many agencies were reluctant to talk about their protection of officials for 
fear of attracting unwanted attention. The Secret Service, with a $364-million 
annual budget and 1,900 special agents, never talks about its methods except in 
broad terms. 
</P>
<P>
The service, part of the Treasury Department, protects the President and vice 
president and their immediate families, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, 
presidential candidates and visiting heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Vance said, the service has increased the number of people 
traveling with top officials. 
</P>
<P>
While the bodyguard function is important, he said, the agents' major task is 
to secure public areas in advance of an official's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"Security is taking away the opportunity to harm," he said. Once an assailant 
gets close, there is little a bodyguard can do other than "damage control," he 
said. For example, when President Ronald Reagan was shot in March, 1981, agents 
pushed him into a car to be rushed to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
While the Secret Service protects the White House contingent and the marshals 
are responsible for the federal judiciary, most officials rely on security 
details inside their agencies for protection. 
</P>
<P>
CIA Director William H. Webster has men in plain clothes stand at the entrance 
to the tennis court during his 7 a.m. games. When he visits friends in 
Washington's residential Georgetown district, the agents wait for him in a 
parked car. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI, as part of the Justice Department, takes care of Thornburgh and FBI 
Director William S. Sessions. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney have details from their own agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has its own armed security force, although the justices are 
among the most inconspicuous officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"They're low-key people," said Toni House, the court's spokeswoman. The 
justices, however, can receive protection from their own agents or the marshals 
should they want it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health and Human Services has five guards, some of whom are 
assigned to Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, according to a security official who 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Because they supervise the government's work on a number of touchy subjects 
(from AIDS research to abortion regulations), Sullivan and his predecessors 
have received threats, the official said. Otis Bowen, who preceded Sullivan, 
received 40 threats in his last 13 months in office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner oversees an office of 19 security 
people with an annual budget of $4.1 million.

PIGEON-TRAPPING AT CONDOMINIUM IN LAGUNA BEACH RUFFLES SOME FEATHERS 
</P>

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Laguna Beach like to save things. Save the ocean. Save the canyon. 
Save the old downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Now some residents want to save the pigeons too. 
</P>
<P>
This seaside community, it seems, is a self-declared bird sanctuary, and 
someone has been out there trapping a flock of pigeons because they have been 
making a mess of things at a ritzy condo complex. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the animal control division and an angry resident, and what you have is a 
community in uproar over pigeons' rights -- Laguna style. 
</P>
<P>
It all started last August, when Blair Roberts, manager of Laguna Sea Cliffs 
Apartments, a 22-unit oceanfront condominium complex on fashionable Cliff 
Drive, hired someone to trap a flock of 60 pigeons that were making a mess of 
residents' balconies. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't sit well with a neighbor, seeing all those pigeons being trapped, 
and soon the animal control division of the Police Department was called in to 
disarm the trap and release the pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, informed that a city ordinance protects pigeons and other feathered 
friends, went before the City Council on Nov. 7 to seek permission to thin out 
the flock by trapping the pigeons. The city code states that "no person shall 
trap, hunt, shoot or molest any bird or damage the nest or the eggs of any wild 
birds within the city." 
</P>
<P>
If a type of bird becomes a "public nuisance" or a "menace to health or 
property," the City Council may take action to destroy or otherwise control the 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Violation of the code is a misdemeanor, and Roberts was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the pigeon pow-wow. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's a sensitive issue," Roberts said. "But you can't imagine the mess. 
There are flies and droppings everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he resorted to trapping the birds only after trying "every trick 
in the book" to control them. Roberts said he hired a firm to trap the animals, 
but he declined to identify the company. 
</P>
<P>
"They come out and set the trap and bait it with food and water," Roberts said. 
"Twice a week, they service the trap, take the birds out and re-bait. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was the most humane way," he said. "I'm not trying to destroy them; 
I'm trying to reduce the flock to a manageable level." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he didn't know where the pigeons were taken and what happened to 
them afterward -- matters of some concern to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Said Councilman Dan Kenney: "I admit pigeons are not at the top of my list. But 
they shouldn't be killed. I'd prefer they don't become pigeon soup." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts maintained that pigeons aren't protected by the city code because 
"these birds are not wild." 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said others, noting that the code protects "any bird" in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Johanna Felder, board member of Village Laguna, a group whose mission is to 
save the village atmosphere in Laguna Beach, defended the pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be more tolerant of nature and redefine what is a menace," she 
said. "We should exhaust all measures before authorizing trapping." 
</P>
<P>
Resident Philip May agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're fortunate enough to live on the sand, birds are going to be a small 
price to pay for living on the water," he said. "We can't have it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
Birth control for the pigeons -- spiking their food to make them infertile -- 
was one solution offered during a lengthy discussion before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But resident John Gabriels, who said the town has "squirrel lovers hanging from 
the chandeliers," thought that was a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get into birth control, we're going to have pro-choicers out here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible solutions put forth included petitioning the Fish and Game 
Department for some peregrine falcons -- a pigeon predator -- or relocating the 
pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting them somewhere else is ridiculous," another resident said. "They'd 
beat you driving back; they're homing pigeons." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Martha Collison suggested using fake owls, sound recordings of 
predatory animals and pinwheels to keep the pigeons away. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts said he has tried a dozen fake owls. 
</P>
<P>
Council members sympathized with Roberts' dilemma and instructed Roberts to 
seek advice from Pacific Wildlife Assn., pigeon experts, on how to deal with 
his problem. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Roberts said the problem is "far from funny." 
</P>
<P>
"Homes are literally being desecrated," he said. "We're talking about railings, 
tile, carpeting, wood, furniture and barbecues. Imagine coming out on your 
patio and finding it covered. . . . You'd be upset about it too."

Capt. Hoss Pearson is besieged by 26 proposals from San Diego city and county 
clamoring for a parcel of land that once nobody wanted: Miramar Naval Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Pearson fends off one request, he's hit with another. In most cases 
the requests are for undesirable projects that most neighborhoods fight: a 
sewage-treatment plant, sludge and garbage landfills, a jail, roads, a 
petroleum tank farm, a power plant, and a police and a fire academy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants a piece of action out here," said Pearson, commanding officer 
of Miramar, one of the nation's four master jet stations, a hub for the Navy's 
sophisticated fighter jets situated 13 miles north of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mind-boggling. You name it, if they don't want it in their back yard, 
they want to put it at Miramar," said Rear Adm. Phil Anselmo, commander of 
Miramar's Pacific Fleet fighter wing. 
</P>
<P>
But the most menacing of all the bids on the 24,000-acre Miramar is the 
proposal for a joint-use, civilian-military airport. It's a proposal that has 
been shelved and revived several times through the decade. But, with each 
revival, it gains more force as the city fumbles for a solution to replacing 
Lindbergh Field, which experts say cannot keep pace with San Diego's booming 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
A decision this month by the San Diego City Council to permit developers to 
build in the area around Brown Field shortens the list of alternatives for 
Lindbergh. And the spotlight on Miramar has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, the San Diego Assn. of Governments is scheduled to release 
recommendations for an airport site based on a 14-month, $350,000 study. There 
are two key options: Miramar or a multiple-airport approach that would involve 
Lindbergh and Brown fields. 
</P>
<P>
As the population of San Diego has doubled in the last 30 years, much of the 
city's land has been developed. By the middle of the next century, an estimated 
35 million passengers will fly into San Diego annually -- or more than three 
times the number now served at Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
"The handwriting is on the wall. The obvious choice is shared use at Miramar," 
said Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego). "It's not a question of being for the Navy 
or being for defense, but it's a question of what is in the best interests of 
all of us. Ultimately, that fighter-training airport should be elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Saying that commercial airlines and military could safely share an airport, the 
Airline Pilots Assn. has also come out in favor of a joint-use facility. And 
shared-use proponents point to three joint-use airports used by the Air Force 
in North Carolina, Hawaii and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"It will work -- and it's the only solution we have for San Diego," said Tom 
Carroll, APA spokesman and a member of the Sandag committee. "The Navy is being 
short-sighted. If it poses a hazard, then I question whether they should be 
operating out there." 
</P>
<P>
Others, including Mayor Maureen O'Connor, note that the Navy is unlikely to 
relinquish its prized airfield, which employs 11,000 military personnel and 
2,500 civilians. About 350 aircraft take off from Miramar daily. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you get a total change in Washington, we are really foolish to think 
the Navy is going to give up Miramar for our airport," O'Connor said at a 
recent City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials, feeling increasing pressure, are preparing to protect their 
turf. They cite Miramar's strategic role in defending the nation, the 
$10-billion price of relocation, the "untenable danger" posed by a joint-use 
airport and the potential damage to the environment at the base, which harbors 
endangered plants such as mesa mint. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here, and we're here to stay. We are not for sale -- we are a part of 
the community," Anselmo said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials hope to stop the piecemeal assault on the base, in which city 
and county agencies approach with proposals. To help solve this problem, city 
officials recently selected one liaison to handle all their projects. Navy 
officials, in turn, agreed to seriously consider many of them. 
</P>
<P>
Some say this approach may help the Navy maintain its land and a desired 
buffer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Navy is looking to surround itself with uses so unattractive that 
it isolates itself from the city," said Councilman Ed Struiksma. 
</P>
<P>
Anselmo says the Navy is willing to cooperate on many of the proposals but 
there is one caveat -- the Navy wants city officials to sign an agreement 
acknowledging Miramar's right to exist and adopt a policy reflecting the city's 
intention to prohibit major buildings in the area dubbed the accident-potential 
zone, 15 square miles around the flight path. 
</P>
<P>
The city may not make such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, I'm not sure we could ever strike such an accord because the 
city leadership changes, the various government bodies change and it would be 
difficult in my mind to make anything other than a short-term commitment about 
what the eventual use of Miramar will be," said Roger Frauenfelder, deputy city 
manager and the city's liaison with the Navy. "After all, we have to respect 
the independent thinking of our future leaders. I don't see how we can bind 
them in that fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Because it sits on federal land, Miramar officials do not always hold the 
reins. Until he read about it in newspapers, the day after the announcement, 
Anselmo did not know that Miramar was selected recently by the Federal Aviation 
Administration for a $114-million radar-approach center for air traffic 
control. The center, which will have its own access road, will take a 10-acre 
bite out of the east side of Miramar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a taxpayer, and I'm your agent, so you expect me to do the best thing I 
can do with your taxpaying dollars -- we should be using our federal 
resources," Anselmo said. "I don't get upset about these things, but I 
certainly would have liked to have known about it." 
</P>
<P>
The problem of encroachment is not unique to Miramar. Across the nation, every 
military base feels the pinch as once-fledging communities develop and the need 
for land becomes greater. 
</P>
<P>
At Miramar, officials are developing a multi-pronged defense against 
encroachment. Some point to the Navy's economic muscle, saying that the 
military personnel are responsible for $1 of every $5 spent in San Diego. 
Others brandish their patriotism. Anselmo said, "If we want to continue to be a 
free nation and a free world, I think we're going to have to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy's most compelling argument may be safety. 
</P>
<P>
When city officials talk of a train station south of the intersection of 
Frost-Mar Place and Miramar Road, Navy officials speak about the hazard of 
having 150 people clustered a mile west of their runway. From 1972 to 1989, 30 
military aircraft have crashed within 10 miles of Miramar, according to a 
report prepared by Miramar and the Naval Facilities Command in Virginia. Of 
those crashes, 73% crashed within the Navy's proposed accident-potential zones 
and two fell within a quarter-mile of the station site. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag officials, however, say they believe commuters would be safe because 
most stay at the station a very short time. They also say commuter rail is the 
only solution to escalating traffic. At the junction of Interstates 5 and 805, 
there are about 217,000 vehicle trips a day. In 1984, there were 145,000 
vehicle trips daily. 
</P>
<P>
"A station is very comparable to other industrial uses in the area, and it's 
compatible land use," said Michael Zdon, a Sandag senior transportation 
planner. "People come in 15 minutes before the train and then get out, unlike 
an industrial area where they are there for eight-hour shifts. The case is 
either station or no station; there really isn't any alternative." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rail system would consist of about six trains, each containing 
about 500 passengers, running from Oceanside to San Diego. And it could also 
become a transportation hub. Councilman Struiksma asked the city to study the 
feasibility of a trolley running to the proposed Miramar train station. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely important transportation hub for the future of San Diego, 
and the fact is that you don't have Navy jets coming out of the sky at all 
times," Struiksma said. 
</P>
<P>
Others say that, if the area is too dangerous for a station, then it's too 
dangerous for the neighboring residential communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy has had some airplanes ditch; there's no question about that," said 
Jim Mills, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Development Board. "But 
everybody clear on over to Torrey Pines is probably equally in danger. I'm not 
convinced that the Navy's fears are well-grounded." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Miramar pilots have accommodated the growth of surrounding 
communities. They once flew straight to sea to carry out their training 
exercises; now they make climbing S-turns to avoid offending their neighbors 
with the roar of jet engines. Even so, complaints flood the base. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, operations Duty Officer Bill Hubert said he would handle 
fewer than 12 irate calls daily from residents. Today, he says he receives as 
many as 50 complaints a day. These tallies do not include notorious 
complainers, such as the woman several years ago who moved from 1 1/2 to 5 1/2 
miles from the base and still called 35 times in a three-month period to gripe 
about noise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite noise complaints, Navy officials consider themselves good neighbors. 
Although Anselmo said he has no objections to a city-proposed jail on the base, 
he believes his neighbors might. When local builders needed to dispose of about 
100,000 cubic yards of fill-dirt, Miramar accepted it and used it to construct 
a berm around the rifle range. 
</P>
<P>
Base officials say one of Miramar's most important contributions has been 
preserving acres of chaparral-dotted open space, home to a variety of 
creatures, including deer, desert shrew, side-blotched lizard and one bobcat. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the Navy set aside 2,000 acres in East Miramar as a "research natural 
area" to preserve rare plants and unusual wildlife. With a cemetery dating back 
100 years and the ruins of a homestead town, Miramar officials hope to woo 
universities to study pockets of environmentally and historically rich areas. 
And they also hope to preserve the area, much of it covered with sage scrub. 
One sailor was recently chastised for using a metal detector to find artifacts 
that he sold for scrap. 
</P>
<P>
In the southwest corner of the preserved area, there are a small number of 
vernal pools, depressions in the ground where water collects during the rainy 
season. The depressions also harbor mesa mint, which once covered the San Diego 
area but is now endangered. When the Navy built a new jail, officials paid 
$500,000 to move seven vernal pools, said Capt. Al Katz, Miramar's public works 
officer who oversees the base. 
</P>
<P>
"We coined the phrase 'island of ecological rarity,' and we're trying to keep 
it that way," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
But Miramar's ecological bent is not without purpose. When the city expressed 
an interest in Miramar's East Gate Mall for a sewage-treatment and 
water-reclamation plant, officials demurred, saying the area was chock-full of 
vernal pools. 
</P>
<P>
"If an area is a natural resource area, it gives us the ability to say no, you 
can't build out there," Katz said. "That's the whole idea of Miramar being an 
'island of ecological rarity.' If someone says they don't care about ecological 
rarity, then part of our armor goes away. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the problem is that the Navy is always located next to coastlines. 
Where's the most valuable property? Coastline. And so the Navy will always have 
encroachment problems." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the decision about a project as major as an airport would be 
decided by Washington officials. Only seven months ago, the House cleared the 
way to close 86 military bases. Miramar was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
"You come to the question of (whether there) are . . . things that take place 
at Miramar that couldn't take place elsewhere. I suspect they could," Mills 
said. "Would the city want the Navy to relocate its activities and the payroll 
that goes with them? That's the question."

CARLSBAD GRAPPLES WITH ITS WALL OF SHAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great seawall of Carlsbad, a half-mile-long concrete promenade that's 
considered a beachfront jewel in this tony town, has turned into a wall of 
shame that has upset the community's sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 months, the smooth and graceful $3.5-million wall has become a 
vast exhibit of raunchy urban-style graffiti, everything from racial slurs to 
sexual expressions and surfer slogans. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of lending Carlsbad's seashore a touch of linear majesty and 
eye-pleasing precision, the wall now offers thousands of tourists and local 
residents' crude letters spelling "rampage," "the Pope smokes dope," and "oingo 
boingo." The ripest graffiti can't be quoted. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti problems are hardly unusual, but this is graffiti on a grand scale. 
About 70,000 square feet must be cleaned, and city workers spend 20 hours a 
week toiling at the wall. Yet they still can't stay ahead of the spray paint, 
chalk and stubborn markings made with surfboard wax. 
</P>
<P>
"It's available, and it's one of the few places where they have a big canvas to 
paint on," said Larry Willey, the city's assistant director for utilities and 
maintenance. "It wasn't a problem at first, it just seems to have escalated." 
</P>
<P>
The wall, ranging in height from 12 to 17 feet, is only 2 years old. It was 
built with city funds as a retaining wall to secure the erosion-prone bluffs 
between Tamarack and Walnut avenues. But now it is the cause of complaint and 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten complaints from residents who have taken friends down there to 
see this jewel, then become totally embarrassed," said Lee Bohlmann, executive 
vice president of the city Chamber of Commerce. Some markings are drippy 
statements of adolescent love, "but it seems they're mostly gutter terms." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown merchants who have labored to nurture Carlsbad's reputation as a 
breezy, quaint seaside village that's perfect for tourism have had gnawing 
concerns over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"It presents a very poor image for our city," said Hope Wrisley, co-chair of 
the Carlsbad Village Merchants Assn., bemoaning that the graffiti problem has 
gotten "overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
She often walks along the beach past the wall and discovered not long ago that 
graffiti isn't the exclusive lexicon of beer-chugging youths. She spotted a man 
"maybe 40 years old, spray painting. A nearly middle-aged man. How tacky." 
</P>
<P>
"The wall is just too big a target," Wrisley said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's obvious that most of the wall markings are left by young people. 
The heavy jumble of words and phrases includes "team crack," "surf or die," and 
"heavy metal rules." There are explicit drawings of nudity and characters 
having sex. Somebody took 30 feet of wall space to paint "I do not know -- 
where do you want to eat?" 
</P>
<P>
Chris Brady, a 39-year-old Carlsbad man, savors strolling along the beach 
during mornings and sunsets. The sprawling array of graffiti anger him. "It 
shows a lack of respect for other people's property. They're rebellious and 
they don't care about anybody but themselves," he said. "It shows how the 
society has gone." 
</P>
<P>
City official Willey isn't immediately as concerned about society as he is with 
the graffiti. Erasing it isn't an easy task, especially the markings made by 
surfboard wax that are covered with sand and left to melt into the concrete's 
pores. 
</P>
<P>
In frustration, the city had hired a contractor to help eradicate the graffiti, 
but the use of high-pressure water was eroding the wall's finished surface. 
That process left a more porous surface that is even harder to clean of new 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the City Council agreed this week to spend nearly $48,000 on another 
contractor who will rid the wall of all graffiti, then apply a protective clear 
wax coating to make cleaning easier. The coating will be replaced with each new 
cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
Willey hopes the new approach and prompt removal will discourage most people 
who yearn for public expression. 
</P>
<P>
Bohlmann suspects that the only way to eliminate the problem is to cover its 
surface with an artistic mural, although that has not been proposed. "When 
there is a mural or design painted on a blank surface, graffiti is not a 
problem," she said.

NO EASY A'S IN TOP SOUTH BAY SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Bay Union Elementary School District found itself once again at the 
rarefied level of California's top districts when the state's closely watched 
annual achievement test scores for elementary school performance came out 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Although no surprise to South Bay administrators -- who push tough 
accountability standards for teachers and who zealously stress basic skills -- 
the scores continue to astound many among the county's education establishment. 
</P>
<P>
After all, South Bay is a district with 8,600 students whose families are 68% 
nonwhite (mostly Latino); 57% working poor; 16% on welfare. Its geographical 
area hugs the backside of San Diego Bay, running through Imperial Beach, Nestor 
and Palm City. Yet its California Assessment Program (CAP) results rank right 
up with those of high-rent districts along the North Coast and Interstate 15 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
In gauging the reasons behind South Bay's performance, discussion soon centers 
on its physically imposing, hard-charging superintendent, Philip Grignon, a 
58-year-old, no-nonsense schools veteran whose passion for improving public 
education has stirred admirers and detractors. 
</P>
<P>
The history of South Bay during Grignon's almost five years as its chief is 
replete with change and controversy. His successful, sustained push for 
quarterly monitoring of teacher and student progress, for widespread use of 
computers, new teaching methods and curricula, all is directed toward the 
payoff of improved achievement as measured by standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
Student scores in South Bay have jumped by 20% to 30% in recent years, 
depending on the particular standardized math or reading test. 
</P>
<P>
"Meet my standards, and I love you," says Grignon, a husky, 6-foot former 
Marine Corps judo champion with a leathery face he readily admits resembles the 
texture of a football. "If not, then go be happy somewhere else. . . . For many 
parents here, the only thing to be proud of is their children, and this 
district produces test scores that they can be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Among those impressed are state schools Supt. Bill Honig, who has used CAP 
testing to push reform and improve accountability statewide, and who personally 
congratulated Grignon and his staff at a ceremony in May in Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"They emphasize curriculum, staff training, organization, and have gotten their 
kids to read, to do math, to grow (academically) more than (students) anywhere 
else," Honig said in an interview. "Grignon thumbs his nose at those who say 
you can't have high standards and high achievement everywhere. . . . There are 
all kinds of personalties and styles, but the bottom line is whether you've 
delivered the goods." 
</P>
<P>
But Grignon's role as gruff taskmaster has had its downside as well, arousing 
critics who point to his blunt style and his single-minded pursuit of better 
test scores. 
</P>
<P>
After Grignon called the teachers union "a cancer on education" in a 
particularly angry moment during heated salary negotiations in 1988, California 
Teachers Assn. chief Ed Foglia labeled Grignon "intemperate, intolerant and 
confrontational . . . exactly the kind of person we teachers work so hard to 
prevent our students from becoming." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Grignon's only detractor on the district's five-member board of trustees -- 
he voted against Grignon's last contract renewal and says he would vote no 
again today -- nevertheless confesses ambivalence because of the 
superintendent's many accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
That trustee, Thomas Teagle, principal of an adult education school in the 
neighboring Sweetwater district, compared Grignon's insistence on innovation 
and high expectations to the methods of Jaime Escalante, the nationally 
renowned calculus teacher whose creative classroom style has motivated Latino 
high school students in East Los Angeles to pass college-level courses. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was the education god, I'd stick Phil Grignon in the toughest district in 
the nation," Teagle said. "Those urban districts need a tough person willing to 
shake up the troops, and he'd do that well." 
</P>
<P>
But, Teagle added quickly, "South Bay doesn't need that style," saying that 
Grignon has offended people for years by being abrasive. Teagle himself ran for 
the board after his own personal run-in with Grignon, an incident he prefers 
not to discuss today but which still influences his view of the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be aloof, he wants to be feared. I just don't like his style," 
Teagle said. 
</P>
<P>
People in the district talk privately about hearing stories that Grignon 
"dresses down" principals or teachers whose schools show small test 
improvements or whose instructional methods fall short. 
</P>
<P>
In his defense, Principal Lynda Schultheis said Grignon can be pointed in 
discussing improvements he wants to see but never personally abusive. Board 
member Doug Langdon said that Grignon can dispense strong medicine, especially 
to those relmuctant to change, "but I have never seen him demeaning to people." 
</P>
<P>
Bayside School teacher Bill Boyd said major changes wrought in the district, 
rather than Grignon himself, might be the source of much of the animosity. 
</P>
<P>
"It would cause problems in any organization." 
</P>
<P>
Grignon concedes that he can be impatient with people, and he has tried to 
soften his handling of personnel in response to board directives. "I don't 
think the rank-and-file teachers are as vitriolic against me as the union 
itself is," Grignon said, conceding that he regards the union as a barrier to 
speedy change. "Yes, in general I'm probably not well-liked, but I'm going to 
hold everyone accountable nevertheless." 
</P>
<P>
Grignon lives, eats and sleeps education. He shows up at work Monday mornings 
often talking about three or four new ideas conceived as a result of weekend 
reading or bull sessions with district colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Around South Bay district headquarters, the only living being seemingly 
unaffected by his energy and ideas is his dog, Isabeau. The dog, a rare bouvier 
des Flandres breed, distinguished by a rough, wiry coat and long used in 
Belgium for herding cattle, sleeps contentedly in Grignon's corner office while 
Grignon alternately strokes and scolds his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Isabeau is brought into Grignon's "push for excellence" when the 
superintendent visits a school. He isn't content to have the children marvel at 
the unusual dog: at Pence School last week, he peppered a kindergarten class 
with questions about Isabeau. For example: "Look at her tail, how is it 
different from other dogs?" (It's a bobtail.) He pulled a world map down over 
the blackboard and pointed out the location of Flanders in an impromptu 
geography lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say his only weakness is that he needs more balance in his life . . . he 
is all school, school, school, although I don't know if a normal person could 
have gotten all the changes through," board member Nancy C. Yturralde said of 
Grignon. 
</P>
<P>
Grignon has had a zest for action since he joined the Marine Corps as a 
high-school dropout from the lower East Side of New York in the early 1950s. He 
was posted to Japan, where he gave judo demonstrations to Japanese as the U.S. 
military champion in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Entering community college in Southern California on his return, Grignon 
eventually became a biology teacher in south Orange County, winning state and 
national laurels as "biology teacher of the year" and helping to initiate a 
"Save the Whales" campaign as well at the Orange County Marine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
His South Bay stint was preceded by 3 1/2 years as superintendent in the 
smaller Carlsbad system, where he received high marks for rescuing that North 
County district from insolvency and beginning a host of programs to raise 
sputtering academic standards. In 1985, Carlsbad was named one of 17 districts 
nationwide that had met recommendations in a 1983 Carnegie Foundation report 
that castigated American public schooling. 
</P>
<P>
But Grignon left a sour taste among many teachers in Carlsbad because of his 
hard-nosed wage bargaining and temporary layoffs to stop the red ink. He was 
also criticized for being too much a perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Grignon wasted little time in shaking things up after taking over 
the 12-school South Bay system. 
</P>
<P>
Grignon instituted a rigorous, quantifiable evaluation of teachers four times a 
year, examining their instructional methods and the performance of their 
students. Under the setup, the principal or assistant principal reviews written 
goals set both for the teachers and each individual student. Principals are 
expected to spend 50% of their time observing in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The district's curriculum has been aligned closely with the academic frameworks 
in math, English, science and writing recommended by the state Department of 
Education and used by the state as the content basis for CAP testing.

Grignon has invested heavily -- more than $2 million -- in computer equipment 
and programs for every grade, including a "write-to-read" program specifically 
for kindergartners and first-graders. Each teacher and each school has specific 
plans for raising test scores annually, and test records are kept year-to-year 
on students so schools can determine how much growth a child has made annually. 
A new reading and writing competition among schools will reward teachers 
monetarily whose students show the most improvement on a combination 
multiple-choice and essay test. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher salaries rank in the top three of the county's 37 districts, with a 
1987-88 salary of $36,300 for a teacher with average senority. The district 
runs an extraordinary number of teacher training programs for its size and 
prefers to promote from within. Seven schools run year-round, with three more 
to begin year-round in July, each with proposed different schedules under a 
Grignon idea to give parents an option of sending their children for more than 
the state-mandated 180 days a year. All schools have free pre- and after-school 
education activities. 
</P>
<P>
All of Grignon's changes are tied to his belief that schools can make a 
difference for students and that achievement is not controlled by economic or 
social status. His administrative staff strongly backs his ideas, themselves 
working 60-hour-a-week shifts, in addition to occasional weekend retreats at 
which Grignon and his cabinet brainstorm other innovations. 
</P>
<P>
"Good students test well," West View principal Lowell Billings said. "And 
traditionally, our students were not expected to test well compared to those in 
Bonita or La Jolla." 
</P>
<P>
"For years, socioeconomics has been used to explain why kids don't learn," said 
Marilyn Wheeler, South Bay's testing coordinator who left Carlsbad for South 
Bay. "It's one thing to say we have high expectations, but quite another to 
work consciously to carry them out." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Steel, assistant principal of Nicoloff School, said she was skeptical 
when Grignon first put his plans into effect. Now she supports his program. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never held accountable as a teacher," Steel said. "Today, the principal 
is a partner with the teacher, and fewer students are allowed to fall through 
the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Nestor School teacher Jeff Knox, although by no means an unabashed admirer of 
Grignon, respects the high standards the superintendent sets. 
</P>
<P>
"Grignon demands that I know my stuff . . . and a lot of the staff development 
has been very, very good. There is more substance than gloss, although I hate 
to admit it." But Knox said that Grignon also has reaped the benefits of the 
many good teachers already in South Bay when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Knox also said he doesn't argue with the results from test scores, although he 
is uncomfortable with the amount of skills reviews that teachers are asked to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"You pass on a lot of anxiety to the teachers and to the students," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd of Bayside School said that, although perhaps 70% of the district 
improvement in test scores results from improved curriculum and the rest from 
regular review -- estimates also cited by trustee Doug Langdon -- he dislikes 
Grignon's use of the scores to push the district's visibility and publicity 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Grignon makes no apologies for wanting high standardized scores, saying there 
is nothing wrong with emphasizing skills measured on tests such as CAP -- 
skills that California educators have agreed are important. He also points out 
that the district's new reading curriculum is ahead of other districts in 
carrying out state changes for literature-based instruction, and away from 
rote-skill learning that some have accused the district, without specifics, of 
doing to raise test scores. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree that tests don't measure everything, but they do tell me if the kids 
know reading, math and social studies," Grignon said. "I'd rather have 
increased reading proficiency than increased playground mechanics or 
socialization techniques." 
</P>
<P>
He uses that argument in his latest campaign, a fight to take over two junior 
high and two senior high schools from the Sweetwater district and unify South 
Bay as a kindergarten-through-12th-grade system. Grignon cites low test scores 
in the Sweetwater system, saying that the skills his students take away from 
the sixth grade in South Bay dissipate after several years in Sweetwater-run 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater officials oppose the idea, and want to analyze computer data to 
compare the performance of South Bay students with that of students in the San 
Ysidro, National and Chula Vista elementary districts who also attend 
Sweetwater secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay, nevertheless, will push the issue to a vote if necessary. "We're 
being attacked because what we are proposing makes (Sweetwater) nervous . . . 
that with attention to detail and hard work, anyone can do what we have done," 
Grignon said.

A POOR RISK IN NORTH PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the San Diego City Council went against the advice of the city manager and 
decided to spend $905,000 in federal community development funds to purchase 
the dilapidated North Park Theater, it was betting on a dream of outgoing 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl that the theater would revive the somewhat tattered 
North Park business district. 
</P>
<P>
But, if her dream does not come true, the council may have purchased a white 
elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The theater has major structural problems, which the city manager estimates 
will cost $1.4 million to repair. And to turn it from a movie theater into a 
marketable playhouse will cost another $2.3 million. What's more, little 
private interest has been shown in operating the theater, and the city manager 
estimates that the city will be saddled with a continuing annual subsidy of 
more than $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city has learned how difficult it can be to raise money for theater 
renovation with the Balboa Theater downtown, which the city acquired for $2.5 
million and which is estimated to need up to $11 million in repairs. A 
foundation has been struggling for years to raise that money. So it is 
surprising that the city would be willing to take on another theater 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in recognition of the difficulty in raising private money, the plan for 
the North Park Theater renovation is to use tax money generated by a proposed 
redevelopment district. But $4.6 million -- for purchase and renovation -- is a 
lot of public money, especially when the theater community has not rallied 
around this project. 
</P>
<P>
The theater may be a landmark in North Park that McColl and community leaders 
want to save from demolition. And we often support such preservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But this project seems like a greater risk than the old theater merits. The 
council should reconsider its decision and look for surer ways to help North 
Park.

<TEXT>
<P>
There have been a number of recent articles concerning the U.S. Postal Service 
here in San Diego. Many of us in the mailing industry strongly disagree with 
the extremely negative comments in these articles and some of the comments 
attributed to Rep. Jim Bates. 
</P>
<P>
As co-chair of the San Diego Postal Customer Council, president of the San 
Diego Direct Marketing Club, and the owner of one of San Diego's largest 
direct-mail production companies, I think Margaret Sellers is an excellent 
postmaster. She is responsible for over 11,000 employees, almost 300 facilities 
and an annual budget in excess of $450 million. She has the task of managing 
these responsibilities as a government agency and a competitive business. While 
trying to provide top-notch service, Postmaster Sellers has to deal with 
constraints imposed on the Postal Service from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Many of my employees and I have had a great deal of contact with postal 
employees at all levels. While there is always room for improvement, our 
positive experiences with the Post Office far out weigh the negative.

REFLECTIONS: 'YOU FELT, WELL, UNTIL THE WAR'S OVER, I'M GOING TO DO ALL I CAN 
TO HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Terry Rather, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In July, 1942, the Navy opened its ranks to women. The female recruits were 
known as WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service), the idea being 
that the women could perform tasks here while the men were sent off to fight. 
Oceanside resident Luella May Holland, wanting to do her part for the war 
effort, joined the Naval Reserve in May, 1943, from Chicago, with her parent's 
permission because she was only 20. Holland studied radio and was stationed in 
Santa Ana for most of the war, where she met her soon-to-be husband, Bill 
Holland, at the Santa Ana base. Last May she founded WAVES of North County, 
which meets every other month for members to trade experiences. Holland 
discussed the war and her adjustment to the regimented life style with Times 
staff writer Terry Rather in her Oceanside home. Don Bartletti photographed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a different world then. This was war, our country was at war. We had 
been bombed at Pearl Harbor, and you just wanted to do your part. Right at the 
beginning of the war, women couldn't go in. So, when they opened it up for 
WAVES, I just started percolating to get on in and do something. The patriotism 
everyone felt in those days is so different from now. 
</P>
<P>
I expected boot camp to be rough because I heard the fellows talking about it. 
But I didn't realize how rough it would be for me to adjust to it, for all of 
us to adjust to it. The instant you went to boot camp, you had a huge culture 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't know what to expect. The officers told us when we first got there, 
"As long as you're here, except on the weekends, if you look around and you're 
alone, you're in the wrong place." I'm sure it's still something of a shock to 
people going in. 
</P>
<P>
After having been a free agent all my life, in radio school I had absolutely no 
free time. We had a few hours on Friday and Saturday night until midnight and 
Sunday until 9 p.m. The rest of the time you're in the barracks, or studying. 
It was very demanding, physically, emotionally and mentally. None of us had 
ever studied anything like radio. We had tests every weekend, and if you didn't 
pass, you were out. Lights out may have been 9:30, but many of us studied under 
our blankets with a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
For day-to-day living that was it, and that was rather confining. We worked 
close to the fellows, but it wasn't like you might imagine. Here you are in the 
midst of a bunch of men, you'd think you'd be dating and having parties. You 
weren't. You were working, and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
But I enjoyed the feeling of being in the thick of it. I didn't particularly 
enjoy the regimentation, the you do what the Navy says whether you like it or 
not. That part I could do without. But, for what I did, when I did it, I 
wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world. You felt well, until the 
war's over, I'm going to do all I can to help. You lived life for today. 
</P>
<P>
When I went in, I had no intention of getting married. The fellow I married, 
Bill Holland, had been overseas for the war. Then he came back to the states to 
Santa Ana, where we worked together. We worked through these long nights 
together in the radio room, so we became very well acquainted. He asked me to 
marry him still early in our relationship. We had been dating for two months, 
so we agreed to be engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Then we found out they were going to ship a whole lot of fellows from the base 
overseas. We thought, hey, we could get some leave for a honeymoon if we get 
married now, so why not do it now? We were married Dec. 29, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I didn't really think in terms of where we would live, how many 
children we would have, how's he going to make a living for us. We didn't think 
like that. We didn't know how long the war would last. When we got married, the 
war seemed to be stretching into infinity. So you kind of lived for today, 
enjoyed what you can for today and let tomorrow take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, it was a complete switch for everyone in the war, including the 
men as well as the women. "Oh boy, its over, let's get back to civilian life!" 
</P>
<P>
The WAVES of North County was started last May, so we former WAVES can get 
together and talk about those days. We consider ourselves kind of dinosaurs, we 
date so far back. Nobody can really share our reminiscing unless they were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone says what a great experience it was being in the WAVES. We don't know 
if we'd do it again, but it sure was great then. We enjoyed the feeling of 
participation, being part of what was going on. It was a bad time for America, 
but it was very exciting times. It was all devoted to the war effort, to 
getting the war over.

OAKLAND SET FOR SHOWDOWN WITH WASHINGTON OVER NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Nuclear weapons work goes on all around Oakland, Calif. Among the U.S. 
government facilities calling that city home are a naval shore depot that 
stocks non-nuclear spare parts for nuclear weapons and a Department of Energy 
office that oversees nuclear design work at the nearby Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Military bases where actual nuclear weapons might be stored surround Oakland. 
The Naval Air Station in next-door Alameda is home to five nuclear-powered 
ships, including two aircraft carriers. The Mare Island Naval Shipyard, north 
of the city, services nuclear-powered submarines. 
</P>
<P>
So when the voters of Oakland passed a referendum last year declaring their 
city a nuclear-free zone, they set up an inevitable clash with the federal 
government. The sweeping terms of the referendum not only ban production and 
storage of nuclear weapons, weapon components and radioactive materials in 
Oakland, they call for a flat ban on any person engaging in nuclear weapons 
work within the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice has now filed suit against Oakland, challenging the 
constitutionality of its nuclear-free ordinance. It is the first federal attack 
of its kind, and it could affect the more than 150 other self-declared U.S. 
municipal nuclear-free zones. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland nuclear-free area "impedes and interferes with the accomplishment 
and execution of unified policies regarding national defense," charges the 
Justice Department's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of communities declaring themselves nuclear-free zones first 
surfaced in Japan about 30 years ago. In the United States, the nuclear-free 
zone movement took off in the 1980s, with about 164 self-declared zones now 
established across the country, according to the Baltimore-based nonprofit 
organization Nuclear Free America. 
</P>
<P>
Some zones were established by voter-passed resolutions, as in Oakland. Some 
are the result of bylaws passed by city or county councils. In Malibu, a 
nuclear-free zone was simply declared by honorary Mayor Martin Sheen. 
</P>
<P>
In banning nuclear weapons and related work from their environs, most 
communities are making a symbolic gesture. Many nuclear-free zones are places 
far from concentrations of defense contractors and military bases. About 15 
zone resolutions contain provisions prohibiting city business with firms linked 
to nuclear weapons. In Takoma Park, Md., a Washington suburb, this has meant 
phasing out police cars made by General Motors, a large defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Under an ordinance passed by its City Council in 1986, Chicago is the biggest 
declared U.S. nuclear-free city. But Chicago is still gathering information 
about city defense contracting and thus has not yet made any enforcement moves. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's nuclear-free resolution was passed by voters in November, 1988. 
Besides prohibiting production of nuclear weapons in Oakland, the ordinance 
regulates transportation of nuclear-related materials through the city and 
prohibits any person within the city limits from knowingly engaging in nuclear 
weapons work after a two-year grace period. 
</P>
<P>
Most city politicians did not support the ordinance, yet in May, Oakland served 
notice to the federal government that it would try to enforce its new law. As 
the first self-declared nuclear-free zone to make such a move, Oakland set the 
stage for a constitutional showdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're on very firm ground with almost every part of this ordinance," 
said Oakland City Council member Wilson Riles, an original supporter of the 
nuclear-free resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department says it believes that Oakland's case is badly flawed. At 
issue is the complicated legal issue of when federal law preempts local 
statutes. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Justice Department complaint, under the U.S. Constitution 
states and cities have no authority to regulate "any matter relating to the 
national defense as provided for by the United States government." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint claims that the Oakland ordinance's attempt to regulate nuclear 
weapons work is an unconstitutional infringement on interstate commerce, that 
the city has no right to try to regulate actions taken on federal property, and 
that the Atomic Energy Act gives Washington exclusive control over atomic 
energy, both military and civilian. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the complaint says that under the 1975 Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act the government has the right to ship nuclear-related 
materials through Oakland if it wants to. 
</P>
<P>
There are few legal precedents for the Justice Department suit. In a 1985 case 
involving the Navy's right to build a Staten Island home port for a battleship, 
the New York state Supreme Court ruled that a local ordinance blocking federal 
defense policies is invalid if it was passed because of local objections to 
Washington's defense actions. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1985, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld a Cambridge 
municipal regulation preventing Arthur D. Little Inc. from conducting work with 
chemical-warfare poisons within the city limits. The court concluded that the 
health risk to citizens was relatively large, while the effect on national 
defense was only incidental. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 University of Chicago Law Review article concluded that "many of the 
recent Nuclear Free Zone ordinances are invalid as unconstitutional intrusions 
on the federal power to provide for national defense and to conduct foreign 
affairs." 
</P>
<P>
David Birman, director of the Lawyer's Committee on Nuclear Policy, holds that 
threatening the use of nuclear weapons is illegal under international law. Thus 
any local ordinance that bans nuclear weapons is in turn legal, he said. But 
Birman added that he's "not that optimistic" the Oakland nuclear free zone will 
be upheld in U.S. courts.

VINTAGE RAILROAD CARS RECALL THE GRAND OLD DAYS ALONG THE TRACKS

<P>
Despite dirt and fumes, there's no finer vantage point than the rear 
observation platform of the last car, watching the countryside unfold to the 
rhythmic clickety-clack of steel wheels over rail joints. 
</P>
<P>
And that's where passengers gather on the stainless-steel, domed Budd car that 
brings up the rear of Amtrak's No. 11, The Coast Starlight, as it begins its 
28-hour journey down the West Coast on a sunny October afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
It is the inaugural run for the newly rebuilt Sierra Hotel, one of several 
hundred individually owned private train cars that are enjoying a renaissance, 
rising from the scrap yards to grace the rails once again with their stately 
splendor. In its heyday, the car carried passengers on the California Zephyr. 
</P>
<P>
For owner Doug Ebert, 43, a Chicago-based airline pilot, the trip fulfills a 
long-held belief this genteel mode of travel must not fade into obsolescence. 
</P>
<P>
"In college, I was a cook on the Great Northern Railroad's Empire Builder, part 
of the last generation to experience passenger-train travel as it once was," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As The Coast Starlight ambles south, the car's vista dome offers an 
unobstructed view of the Cascade Range's snow-peaked mountains, bathed in the 
glow of the setting sun. An elegant dinner is served on white linen 
tablecloths, with heavy flatware. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the reason I've gone through all this," says Ebert, smiling as he sips 
a Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
A dense early-morning fog shrouds the fields as the train rolls into the 
Sacramento station. Night has passed quickly. The Sierra Hotel's passengers, 
lulled to sleep hours before by the train's motion, begin to stir in the 
comfortable berths of their tiny private bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
California's changing scenery provides the day's entertainment, while the train 
wends through fertile valleys. By mid-afternoon, the tracks leave the parched 
hills to hug the Pacific Ocean near San Luis Obispo. At last, the skyline of 
downtown Los Angeles appears. 
</P>
<P>
There the Sierra Hotel and a caravan of cars from around the country are 
readied for the trip to San Diego, site of the 12th annual convention of the 
American Assn. of Private Railroad Car Owners. 
</P>
<P>
The association, about a third of its 540 members actively running cars, was 
formed in 1977 to provide a mechanism for working with Amtrak. Private cars pay 
Amtrak about $2 million a year in mileage, switching and parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are highly dependent on Amtrak for movement, and must respond to its 
equipment standards," says membership chairman Larry Haines. Most private cars 
run almost exclusively on Amtrak trains, but a few occasionally operate on 
freight and private lines. 
</P>
<P>
An empty San Diego train yard has suddenly become a museum of beautifully 
restored private cars, as crews hose the dust off the cars' sides and polish 
their brass rails. Formerly the exclusive domain of Presidents, railroad 
executives and the very wealthy, private cars, or "private varnishes," have 
gone mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Today's owners, bound by a passion for railroads and a commitment to preserving 
this link with the past, often borrow heavily to finance their dreams. Many 
have the ability to do much of the restoration and maintenance themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Although a few reserve their cars for private use, most owners occasionally 
charter them to help offset their investment ($125,000 and up for a car that 
qualifies to run on Amtrak). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anyone who makes a profit," says Haines. "Some, if they have the

Two special criminal courts set up last summer will decide whether former Greek 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will stand trial on corruption charges, 
Minister of Justice Constantinos Stamatis said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, 70, whose Socialist party joined an all-party government last week 
after inconclusive elections Nov.5, was sent for trial by the previous 
government. He is accused of involvement in a $200-million bank embezzlement 
scandal and illegal telephone tapping during eight years in power that began in 
1981. He could be sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou has denied any wrongdoing and accused his political enemies of 
waging a vendetta.

COWBOY'S LIFE IS HARD, NOT ROMANTIC

CEDARVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the wind is calm on the high, empty desert of northwestern Nevada and the 
only sound is a Hereford bawling for water, a profound aloneness clamps a dry 
hand on most who venture very far from the normal dirt roads. 
</P>
<P>
But not on Denny Ellerman. Having never lived in a city, having never worked at 
anything but being a cowboy, he is forever a man who prefers to work alone and 
ride 15 miles on a day that may begin at 3 a.m. He sometimes must drive his 
pickup and horse trailer two hours to reach his starting point, and that, he 
says, is more tiring than riding a horse. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerman is a range rider -- the only one -- for the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management's Surprise Valley Resource Area headquartered in Cedarville, in 
remote eastern Modoc County. His official title is range technician, an 
anachronistic label for one who spends as little time as possible behind a 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
His job is simply to count cattle, check fences, ride where four-wheel-drive 
pickups can't go and assess the condition of 1 1/2 million acres of public 
grazing land in northeastern California and northwestern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 cows and 4,000 sheep graze sporadically on the land from spring to 
fall. They'd destroy what little grass grows in the arid climate if they 
weren't regularly moved to different pastures. Windmills that pump well water 
into tanks provide the only source of surface moisture during the summer in 
this dry, wind-gusted country of dust devils and alkali flats. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of Eagle Lake and Alturas, Ellerman meets with dozens of ranchers 
who use BLM lands, learning firsthand about their complaints and needs, while 
keeping a close eye on how the grass grows. When cattlemen round up their stock 
in the spring and fall, Ellerman is there. 
</P>
<P>
"You got to get there early for your biscuits and gravy. They just don't wait 
for you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerman, who has never smoked tobacco but has chewed a little and dipped 
Copenhagen "snoose," today sits on his horse, named Old Yeller, with a slight 
stoop in his shoulders, perhaps the result of the better part of his 62 years 
spent in the saddle, the last nine for the BLM. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been buckarooin' all my life," he said on a day spent riding through 
sagebrush 40 miles east of Cedarville. "I read all those Will James books as a 
kid, about cowboys riding all the way from Arizona to the Canadian line." 
</P>
<P>
He said with a laugh about his early attempts at rodeoing, "I tried for years 
to ride buckin' horses, 'til it finally dawned on me, I didn't have any 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
But he's lived his life the way he dreamed it, riding "young" horses that 
hadn't been ridden before and working ranches from Arizona to Montana, often 
from dawn to dusk but always outdoors and on his own and on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
He still rides in rodeos as a pickup man -- the one who rides alongside a 
bucking horse and grabs the rider to safety after the whistle blows. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerman traveled with his schoolteacher wife of 32 years until the first of 
their five children began attending school. 
</P>
<P>
Four went on to college with the help of their parents, who taught them to be 
trick horseback riders at national rodeos and such prestigious events as the 
Belmont Stakes under the name, The Flying Cossacks. They've performed as far 
away as Kuwait, on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerman's only son, Troy, is a bull rider with an eye on national competition. 
"The cowboy lawyer," Ellerman calls him, because he's studying law at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerman moved to Alturas from Elk Creek, Glenn County, in 1980, when he went 
to work for the BLM. "I never knew what an eight-hour day was 'til I went to 
work for the government," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerman and his wife, Carmel, live in an expanded mobile home on 56 acres 
outside Alturas, sharing the land with 14 horses. Ellerman shoes all his own 
mounts, because he doesn't trust anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
His hands are hard and calloused, and his legs are bowed a bit after an 
uncomplicated life of hard physical work. But when he mounts his horse after 
two attempts at getting his left foot in the stirrup, he grasps lightly at his 
bridle reins, which are made of horsehair. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I'll do this as long as I can climb onto a horse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a little independent after a while. If you can't do it on a horse, 
then you don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
He wears his sweat-brimmed hat pulled low over dark glasses, and a bushy, gray 
drooping mustache gives him the look of a highwayman. He walks with a limp 
because he lost half a foot, amputated after it was caught under a pickup truck 
that rolled over him.

INSPECTORS GO UNDERCOVER TO HELP CONSUMERS GET A GOOD SLEEP;

WATCHDOGS: MATTRESS CHECKERS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THAT TAG THAT SAYS "DO NOT 
REMOVE UNDER PENALTY OF LAW."

<P>
At first blush, the 20 rebuilt mattresses looked new as they were wheeled out 
of the bulky sterilizing oven at Cousin Jack's Mattress Co. 
</P>
<P>
Then Joann Johnson, one of a handful of state inspectors who monitor the 
furniture industry, ordered a worker to cut one open. 
</P>
<P>
Peering inside, Johnson discovered a dirty old mattress that had not been 
renovated at all. Cousin Jack's had simply sewn a fresh cover over the beat-up 
bedding, which may well have been lying on a street corner a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a no-no. You can't do this," declared the state Bureau of Home 
Furnishings employee, who proceeded to temporarily withhold 60 rebuilts from 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Caught red-handed, the longtime operator of the Santa Fe Springs factory agreed 
at once to rip off the old covers. But James Haske Jr. insisted that there was 
nothing wrong with the practice. "With the sterilization," he said, "I figured 
that killed any living organism." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the world of the rebuilt mattress, a burgeoning but low-profile 
industry light-years removed from the environment of luxury sleep shops. 
</P>
<P>
Across Los Angeles County, 50 low-budget factories churn out anywhere from 10 
to 500 rebuilts daily. 
</P>
<P>
The mattresses, normally stripped to the springs and repaired, are marketed at 
dozens of retail discount furniture stores and thrift shops, primarily in 
low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
For new immigrants or impoverished families -- who are believed to account for 
the bulk of the purchases -- a spanking-fresh rebuilt set may seem a real 
bargain at $60 retail. Considering the alternative -- new mattresses generally 
cost upward of $500 -- it frequently is. 
</P>
<P>
But all too often, manufacturers cut corners to make up for low profit margins, 
state officials say. And rarely are they caught or prosecuted, the officials 
add. 
</P>
<P>
"In many instances, they don't sterilize them. And then they will merely put a 
brand-new cover over the existing mattress. The cover will be very badly 
stained with urine, blood and goodness knows what else," said Gordon H. Damant, 
chief of the state home furnishings bureau. "(But) it's the kind of situation 
that unless someone becomes suspicious of something, there's no way to check." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, added Damant, is "Who looks inside? You have to destroy it 
basically to look inside of it." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, complaints are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, state lab test records in Sacramento show that Los Angeles rebuilt bedding 
manufacturers have repeatedly violated state codes requiring the sterilization 
of rebuilt mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
Although Damant's agency is responsible for monitoring rebuilts, the 
second-hand mattress industry is a low-priority matter for a bureau with only 
five inspectors statewide to police 24,000 furniture and bedding retailers, 
wholesalers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which also is responsible for keeping tabs on manufacturer claims 
and on the flammability standards for all furniture and bedding, is cautious 
about imposing penalties, which can include statewide product sales bans or 
fines of $2,500 per offense. 
</P>
<P>
Mattresses may be the most personal of furnishings -- the average person spends 
roughly one-third of his life on one. But the skeletons for rebuilts are 
gathered in the most impersonal of ways. 
</P>
<P>
"We buy from motels, apartment houses, colleges," and in smaller lots of ones 
and twos "that come in from the street," said Don Franco of the giant Gateway 
Mattress Co. in Montebello. "We go out and we will purchase any old mattresses 
and box springs and hide-a-bed sleepers that we can possibly get our hands on." 
</P>
<P>
In many Los Angeles County communities, officials said, most discarded 
mattresses left outside on trash day are hauled off in scavengers' pickups 
hours before the rubbish truck arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Franco describes typical mattress scavengers, who earn from $3 to $7 for each 
unit, as "rummies . . . who do it so they have enough to eat for a couple of 
days. . . . (They are) basically trash peddlers who scavenge aluminum cans or 
cardboard if not mattresses." 
</P>
<P>
Franco is the king of rebuilts, the largest manufacturer of his kind in the 
state, and probably the nation. Each day, 500 mattresses are renovated and 
sterilized at his Montebello factory, located in a grimy industrial area across 
the street from a gasoline distribution terminal. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Franco's business are "cores" -- used mattresses that serve as 
the frames for the rebuilt product. 
</P>
<P>
Behind his plant, more than 20,000 cores are stacked 20 to 30 high, exposed to 
the elements. The cores, which come in myriad sizes, colors and floral 
patterns, sit like silage for months before being forklifted into the plant. 
</P>
<P>
To rebuild a mattress, Gateway workers cut off the old cover and check for and 
repair broken coils. 
</P>
<P>
They then add cotton padding and a smolder-resistant layer of foam and sew on a 
new cover -- along with a red "Do Not Remove" tag to identify the material 
inside as second-hand. 
</P>
<P>
The finished product is baked in a sterilizing oven for two hours at a 
temperature that reaches 205 degrees. State codes also mandate that 
formaldehyde, a substance on the state list of cancer-causing chemicals, be 
pumped into the oven to ensure that any contaminants are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Franco admits that "at one point, rebuilders had the reputation of fly-by-night 
operations." But he contends that rebuilt mattresses are generally a good buy, 
particularly when one considers the lack of quality in inexpensive new 
mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
But there are serious problems, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Some retailers have been known to misrepresent the used mattresses as new by 
tearing off the red "second-hand materials" tags that must be affixed to 
rebuilts, officials say. Moreover, it is difficult to tell the quality of an 
individual mattress because the quality of the cores and the extent of 
rebuilding, if any, can vary so much. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the question of sanitary standards. 
</P>
<P>
Damant said the bureau is concerned about the carcinogenic properties of the 
sanitizing agent formaldehyde, but says no adequate substitute has been agreed 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
And although there have been no illnesses directly attributed to inadequately 
sterilized rebuilt mattresses, the state's Damant says health officials believe 
"the potential is there for the spread of disease." 
</P>
<P>
Even Gateway, regarded by state officials as one of the cleanest rebuilt 
operations in California, has been repeatedly accused of inadequate 
sterilization of rebuilt mattresses. Bureau records inspected by The Times show 
that in seven of the last 10 years, Gateway rebuilts tested in the state lab 
have failed to meet sterilization standards. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of two other large-scale Los Angeles rebuilders acknowledged in 
recent interviews that they regularly sew new covers over old mattresses, 
sterilize them and send them to market. Both said they were totally unaware of 
the requirement that dirty covers be removed. 
</P>
<P>
At Cousin Jack's, which manufactures about 100 rebuilts daily, Haske agreed 
that the average consumer might be unpleasantly surprised to learn of the 
practice. But the 10-year company co-owner contended that until inspector 
Johnson's recent visit -- accompanied by a Times reporter and photographer -- 
he was never informed that old, stained covers must be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Panza, president of Goodwill Industries of Southern California, said 
Goodwill stores regularly sell rebuilts that have old mattress covers inside. 
But like Haske, he said he was unaware of any prohibitions. "As long as we put 
a new cover on it and sterilize it." 
</P>
<P>
Damant, however, insisted that the state codes are clear: All rebuilt 
mattresses must be sterilized and dirty covers must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is very specific," the bureau chief said. "It says if you have a 
filthy or soiled cover that the mattress cover must be cleaned or replaced. . . 
. In order to take the mattress cover off and clean it, you'd have to destroy 
the cover." 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the bureau's investigative resources are stretched to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Los Angeles County's 25 to 50 rebuilt mattress factories go several 
years without inspections. "You can do maybe the tip of the iceberg," Damant 
said. "You're basically spot-checking whatever you're looking at." 
</P>
<P>
The state lab examines 10 to 30 mattresses a month, about 10% of the total 
furniture products it tests. Even then, there is a long backlog. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter visited the lab in late August, technicians were examining a 
rebuilt from Castro Mattress in Lynwood that had been shipped to Sacramento in 
May. Inside the new cover was a dirty, old mattress. Whether it was ever 
sterilized will never be known. Any traces of formaldehyde would be long gone 
in three months, according to Damant. 
</P>
<P>
When lab tests determine that rebuilts have not been sterilized, Damant's 
customary practice is to write a letter to the factory requesting that it shape 
up its equipment and procedures. "Sometimes they are not even aware they have a 
problem until they get a negative result from us," he says. 
</P>
<P>
His role, he says, is to seek compliance, not to close down businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, most of the people in the second-hand business are very small 
and even if you take them to the district attorney's office, so what?," Damant 
asked. "What are you going to accomplish? 
</P>

PENGUIN FANS WANT MORE FOR THE MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
NHL: CRITICS SUGGEST THAT MARIO LEMIEUX'S RICH CONTRACT IS THE ROOT OF HIS DROP 
IN PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT FACHET, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first seven weeks of the National Hockey League season have been unsettling 
for Pittsburgh center Mario Lemieux, with critics suggesting that his new $12 
million, five-year contract has made him complacent. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux's production has fallen alarmingly, his 40-point total putting him 
second in the NHL and five points behind Wayne Gretzky of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
That's bad? Well, it is by Lemieux's standards. After 21 games last year he had 
56 points, despite missing two games because of an injured wrist. Lemieux 
finished the season with 199 points and captured his second straight scoring 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned by the dropoff -- his goal total has tumbled from 22 to 11 -- and an 
apparent lack of energy, Lemieux wondered about his physical condition and 
underwent a battery of tests, which revealed nothing untoward. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, Lemieux let it be known that he was unhappy with Coach 
Gene Ubriaco's decision to tighten up the Penguins' defensive play. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux also continually found himself with different wingers as Ubriaco sought 
a productive combination. So Lemieux said: "It takes time to adapt. Most NHL 
teams have one or two set lines and then, if they don't work for a while, they 
switch." 
</P>
<P>
Those criticisms were translated in some quarters as a demand to management to 
trade him or get rid of Ubriaco. Lemieux, who recently moved into a new mansion 
in Pittsburgh and insists he loves the city, denied such sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the rumors of trouble woke up the Penguins, who won three 
straight games for the first time this season before dropping a 6-3 decision to 
New Jersey on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux has recorded at least one point in his last 10 games and he had a goal 
in five straight until Saturday's 5-3 victory over the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Still, things have not turned completely around, and the favored Penguins might 
have a lot of trouble finishing first in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
A major problem has been the failure of the Penguins' special teams. Last 
season Pittsburgh set an NHL record of 120 power-play goals and connected 21 
times while shorthanded. Lemieux had 31 goals and 49 assists with the extra 
man, as well as 13 shorthanded scores. 
</P>
<P>
This season the Penguins have recorded only 20 power-play goals, three by 
Lemieux. They rank last in the NHL in penalty killing, allowing 29 extra-man 
goals in 99 opportunities. They have yet to score shorthanded but have given up 
a league-leading six shorthanded goals. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux is not the only player struggling. Rob Brown, a 49-goal scorer last 
season, has managed only six, ending a three-week drought with a goal 
Wednesday. Andrew McBain, obtained from Winnipeg in a six-player deal in June, 
has two goals, after netting 37 last season. Both are right wings, but Ubriaco 
tried them at center in an effort to escape the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
Although defenseman Paul Coffey has been flying in the last few games, the 
Penguins are sadly lacking in overall team speed. Sending Dave McLlwain to 
Winnipeg and losing Dave Hannan to Toronto in the waiver draft compounded that 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
With goalie Tom Barrasso (wrist surgery) and defenseman Zarley Zalapski 
(fractured collarbone) on long-term disability, the Penguins have struggled in 
their end of the ice. But the New York Rangers and Philadelphia have overcome 
far greater losses. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the blame for the Penguins' problems probably should fall on the 
shoulders of General Manager Tony Esposito. His trades have cost the team speed 
and defensive ability and his decision to rehire Ubriaco for two years -- after 
the chaos that typified last season -- has been criticized. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I have to get things rolling," Esposito said. "We have to win. That's 
the bottom line. I've been in this business long enough to know we have to turn 
this around now." 
</P>
<P>
The three-game winning streak provided some breathing space. But the Penguins 
cannot afford a relapse. The fans who last year chanted "Sign Mario" could 
easily be inspired to alter their message to "Espo must go," so recently 
effective against his brother, Phil, in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Still Lemieux is the man who ultimately is responsible for getting the Penguins 
on a winning course. He is the one whose sensational play turned a largely 
empty Civic Arena (6,839 average in pre-Lemieux 1983-84) to the current 
virtually automatic sellout of 16,015. And he is the one who is getting the big 
bucks to keep the puck rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully I'm going to be in Pittsburgh a long time ... the rest of my life," 
Lemieux said after signing his blockbuster contract. "All I want to do in the 
next five years is keep improving and build a championship team here." 
</P>
<P>
Presumably those sentiments still prevail today.

Alonzo Mourning walked into the most secure courtroom in the U.S. District 
Court Building at 10 past 10 a.m. this week. A bulletproof glass panel 
separated the defendants, their attorneys, the judge and the jurors from 
anybody who might not be patient enough for justice to take its course. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven defendants, including reputed cocaine kingpin Rayful Edmond III, were on 
trial and Mourning was called upon to testify as to just how much he knew about 
Edmond, Jerry Millington and other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning would later join his teammates behind the walls and gates of 
Georgetown University to prepare for a holiday trip to Hawaii to play some 
basketball games. But first, in this courtroom with the bulletproof glass and a 
metal detector outside the door, Mourning would be hit with a dose of real 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Conte to Mourning, under oath, about what he saw while visiting 
Millington's house: 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever see any narcotics? 
</P>
<P>
"No sir." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever see any large amounts of money?" 
</P>
<P>
"No sir." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see any money-counting machines?" 
</P>
<P>
"No sir." 
</P>
<P>
"Any drug paraphernalia?" 
</P>
<P>
"No sir." 
</P>
<P>
Another attorney, Barry Tapp, would ask, "Did you see his Volvo? Did you see 
the car phone in the Volvo? Did you see his beepers? Did you ride in his 
Pathfinder? Did you ask him if he had a job? Did you look in the kitchen and 
china cabinets (to find evidence of drugs)? Did you think the number of people 
in the house was unusual?" 
</P>
<P>
"I never talked to him about his activities," Mourning said. "I didn't know 
anything about his activities. I've seen the beeper, yes, on him. On his side, 
I guess. I rode in the Pathfinder; from my remembrance, I think I went to the 
store. I didn't look in kitchen and china cabinets. No sir, I didn't think that 
was any of my business." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mourning, did you know about the Jacuzzi and the expensive tile in the 
back of the house?" 
</P>
<P>
"No sir." 
</P>
<P>
For more than an hour, counting time for objections (to almost every question 
asked by the prosecuting attorneys), a short recess and numerous sessions at 
the bench, Mourning answered such questions. Judge Charles Richey would ask 
questions from time to time and remind Mourning to wait for the objections to 
be sustained or overruled before he answered. 
</P>
<P>
There was no high drama despite all the broadcast and print reporters. There 
was one funny moment, when one of the attorneys accidentally addressed Mourning 
as "Mr. Turner," a not-so-kind slip-reference to John Turner, the deposed Hoya 
who introduced Mourning to Edmond and Millington. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning only confirmed what we already knew -- that he had been associating 
with reputed drug dealers in the fall of 1988 and winter of 1989, and ceased 
doing so when his coach, John Thompson, started to hear things. 
</P>
<P>
After ending his testimony, Mourning left the District Building while camera 
crews scattered to cover every conceivable exit. Finally Mourning's dilemma 
appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
The problem lingers. Over and over, people in Courtroom 10 looked at Mourning 
-- 6 feet 10, clean-cut, well-dressed in his black double-breasted blazer and 
slate-gray slacks, a man who eventually will earn millions of dollars. They 
looked at him and whispered to each other, "Isn't it stupid that he would 
associate with these guys?" 
</P>
<P>
Everybody is attracted to a star, including drug dealers seeking to legitimize 
themselves through straight associates. Mourning is a star, one of the biggest 
in Washington. He lives in the city. His friends, for the most part, are city 
people. Wherever Mourning goes, people come up and ask for his autograph. Some 
of them might be drug dealers. Who's to know? 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting thing about most of the 11 defendants in District Court 
Wednesday? They didn't necessarily look like stereotypical drug dealers, the 
ones you see on "Miami Vice." They didn't wear gold chains and designer sweat 
suits. They wore expensive shirts and silk ties, the same kind a banker, 
congressman or stock broker might wear. Some had close, conservative haircuts, 
the same as mine. 
</P>
<P>
Back during the summer, Mourning was in attendance at Capital Centre, watching 
the Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight on closed-circuit television. He was mobbed 
by autograph seekers. Two of them -- I noticed them, but I don't think he did 
-- wore beepers. They looked like businessmen. Maybe they were doctors on call. 
Maybe they were drug dealers waiting to make a sale. Mourning was asked 
politely, and signed politely, for whoever they were. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson Mourning has to learn from all this is that at 6-10, friendly, 
dashing and soon-to-be rich, he's going to attract a crowd for the rest of his 
life. The people who want to watch him, hang out after games with him, won't 
always be lawyers and doctors and sportswriters. He's got to be exceptionally 
careful about the people he associates with. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was a safety net this time, but he won't always be. If Mourning 
doesn't learn from this mistake, next time it could be a lot more serious than 
answering a few questions behind bulletproof glass.

FORMER IVY LEAGUE COACH NOW PLOTS STRATEGY IN DRUG WARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The voice cut through the smoke and the smugness of the audience, which was 
mostly male, mostly white and mostly thirty-to-fiftysomething. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Philadelphia 
gathered after work in the elegant banquet room at the Downtown Club for 
drinks, dinner and a polite speech. 
</P>
<P>
What they got was Ed Zubrow, the man who walked away from an Ivy League 
football championship team and marched into a city's drug war. Zubrow's voice 
echoed in the hall, bouncing off the chandeliers, the curtains, the high 
ceiling, even the chintz Greek columns that held potted plants. His right hand 
jabbed in the air, and even though he looked slightly uncomfortable in a blue 
suit, white shirt and red tie, he was a coach again, calling the plays for his 
troops. The only thing missing was a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow talked of newborn babies addicted to cocaine, of children on their way 
to school forced to walk past drug dealers, of parents taking to the streets 
for night-long vigils to reclaim their neighborhoods from the crack suppliers 
and users. He quoted the city's most prominent real-estate developer, Willard 
Rouse, who said, "Our kids are going to inherit a pile of -- -- ." 
</P>
<P>
The audience stiffened, but listened. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a crisis," Zubrow said. "Children are victims of that crisis. We 
can't build enough prisons and we can't build walls high enough around our 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow's message: Get involved. Adopt a school. Establish drug-free zones. 
Lobby the federal government to increase funding for drug-treatment centers. 
Look at your neighborhood, your school, your home, seek solutions to solve an 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"For better or worse, this city is our home, and these little children are all 
of our children," Zubrow said. 
</P>
<P>
He finished. The crowd applauded and left. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow is neither a zealot nor a hero. Last March, at age 38, he simply traded 
jobs, leaving the comfortable world of Ivy League athletics for the harsh 
reality of inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
After compiling a 23-7 record in three seasons as the head football coach at 
the University of Pennsylvania, Zubrow became a special assistant to 
Philadelphia schools superintendent Constance Clayton. His mission: Coordinate 
district programs dealing with substance abuse, dropout prevention and senior 
high school interscholastic athletics. The Philadelphia school system -- 
composed of 256 schools and 190,000 students -- is the nation's fifth-largest. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, instead of poring over playbooks and film, Zubrow studies city maps 
and congressional testimony. He no longer calls plays or recruits athletes; he 
listens to neighborhood watch groups, police officers and students and tries to 
mobilize a prevent defense against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow's former team, the Penn Quakers, was to end its season Thursday at home 
against Cornell, trying to win once more to finish at .500. He attends all of 
Penn's games, and says he doesn't miss coaching. But in his new job, success 
and failure can't be measured on autumn afternoons. The challenge often is 
overwhelming, and the season is unending. In a salute to Zubrow this fall, the 
Penn band played the theme to the television show "Mission Impossible." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that is different about this is the terrain is changing 
almost daily," Zubrow said. "You don't have any measuring sticks. You just keep 
going and going." 
</P>
<P>
What motivates a man to stop in mid-career and start over again in a job some 
view as an impossible mission? The answer is complex. 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow easily could have climbed aboard the coaching merry-go-round, turning 
his success at Penn into a job at a major football-playing university. But two 
images haunted him: the face of the recruit desperate to leave behind the crack 
dealers who invaded his neighborhood and the face of the homeless woman, the 
human 5:30 wake-up call Zubrow saw each morning at a convenience store one 
block from the Penn campus in West Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"The increased visibility of many of our city's problems made it harder to 
ignore," Zubrow said. "You stop for coffee, and there was a homeless woman on 
the street. It's all the problems all of us see. Sometimes, you have to get 
involved in a good fight." 
</P>
<P>
George Weiss got Zubrow involved. Weiss is a Penn alumnus and football booster 
who in 1987 adopted the sixth-grade class at Belmont Elementary School, 
guaranteeing to finance a college education for all 112 students. 
</P>
<P>
"At Penn, the worst thing is you recruit a guy and he goes to Harvard or Yale," 
Weiss said. "With drugs, you're talking life or death. You can't go in there 
with a Don Quixote attitude and lean against the windmill. Ed is a realist." 
</P>
<P>
After the 1988 football season, Weiss brought together Zubrow and the city 
schools superintendent, Clayton. They talked. A job was offered. A mission was 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow said he hasn't made a sweeping career change. Coaching, he said, is 
educating. Zubrow, who received his undergraduate degree in American studies 
from Haverford College and his master's degree in education from Penn, said he 
is in another teaching role. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that unless we find a way to get a handle on the drug problem in 
this country, then it's going to upset the career paths of an awful lot of 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His job is amorphous. He has spent the last eight months educating himself 
about the drug problem, displaying the same careful attention to detail that 
marked his tenure as Penn coach. His office is filled with street maps 
designating the drug-free zones around every city school; statistics can be 
dredged up from books and pamphlets that are stacked behind his desk. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at a little piece of the problem, but Zubrow, because he is fresh 
and new, is interested in the broad picture of education and getting kids into 
the working world. He is terrific," said Ruth DuBois, executive director of the 
Corporate Alliance for Drug Education, which finances a drug-prevention program 
for the city's elementary school students. 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow's thrust is to get all facets of the community active in drug awareness 
and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a part of the city not touched by drugs, and children 
are the most victimized by it, whether they're the crack babies or the 
neglected ones, or the children who get dragged into the drug economy," Zubrow 
said. "What kids tell you is they are seriously affected by drugs, whether it's 
the younger kids who ask what do you do if the bullets follow you to the 
ground, or whether it's the high school students, who share their parents' 
frustrations and fears and sense of hopelessness. What we're hearing from kids 
is that this is a major problem." 
</P>
<P>
And what Zubrow is trying to tell others is that he is not unique, that the 
career choice he made is neither noble nor naive, just necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug problem is not my problem, it's not just the city's problem, it's all 
of our problem," Zubrow said. "The sooner we recognize that and start making a 
true national commitment to fighting the problem, the greater the chances that 
we'll eventually succeed. To say it's hopeless is to guarantee it will be." 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow isn't tilting at windmills or pushing a rock up a mountain. He is doing 
a job and fighting a battle. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need saints," he said. "We don't need martyrs. We don't need a few 
people to do everything. We need everyone to do something."

CHARGERS HOPE TO CONTAIN BROODING DICKERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Turns out the big guy in Indianapolis doesn't talk either. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, it's on national television, where Colt running back Eric 
Dickerson recently told talk show host Arsenio Hall he wasn't sure he wanted to 
play past the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
The other "big guy" is Charger quarterback Jim McMahon, who hasn't talked with 
Charger beat reporters for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, whose Colts (5-6) play the Chargers (4-7) at the Hoosier Dome today, 
has been unhappy with his offensive line this year. Yet he needs just 97 yards 
against the Chargers to become the first player in NFL history to rush for 
1,000 yards or more in seven consecutive NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper man he became most upset with is his own coach, Ron Meyer, 
who writes a weekly guest column for the Indianapolis News. 
</P>
<P>
The background: On Nov. 5, Dickerson missed the Miami-Colts game, a 19-13 
Indianapolis loss. It was the first game he had missed with an injury in his 
seven-year NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
The week before, Dickerson told reporters of his unhappiness with the 
performance of the rest of the team and said he would just be happy to take his 
paychecks. He also said he wasn't going to "name names" of the teammates he 
thought were shirkers. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer was furious with Dickerson's remarks and said so in his column. "I told 
him (Dickerson) to shut his mouth," Meyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer later said that's not what he really said to Dickerson. But Dickerson 
still refuses to speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
It reached the height of absurdity before the Nov. 12 game against Buffalo, 
when Dickerson's hamstring was still ailing. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Colt broadcaster Bob Lamey approached Dickerson in the locker room 
brandishing a green flag, a yellow flag and a red flag. He asked Dickerson to 
grab the appropriate flag regarding his playing status against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson eagerly grabbed the green flag, signifying he expected to play 
against the Bills. But when Lamey asked him if he would say as much on tape, 
Dickerson said, "Nope." 
</P>
<P>
Today's game marks the first return of Charger outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal 
to the Hoosier Dome since the 13th game of the 1986 season, his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal entered that game leading the Chargers in tackles and sacks. He left 
with a badly damaged knee that kept him from playing for nearly 22 months. 
</P>
<P>
During O'Neal's lengthy rehabilitation he was privately criticized on several 
occasions by members of the Chargers' organization. Part of their problem was 
an impatience that stemmed from O'Neal's refusal to use team physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, O'Neal worked with South Lake Tahoe orthopedist Richard Steadman. 
Steadman has treated many members of the United States Olympic ski team. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal's insistence on Steadman has finally paid off. He is leading the AFC in 
sacks with 10.5 and is a leading candidate this season to play in his first Pro 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal is not unaware that he is returning to the site of the game that almost 
ended his career. "If I come out and play a good game, it will be just like 
reliving what happened," he says. "But this time I will be going in the 
opposite direction." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal's return to full strength has also fostered a return of confidence, 
which was one of the reasons he was such a precocious rookie in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Leslie has the same type of abilities as a Lawrence Taylor," says 
Charger Coach Dan Henning, comparing O'Neal with the Giants' perennial Pro Bowl 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Chargers list O'Neal as an outside linebacker, he is likely to 
play any position. The unpredictability of the Chargers' defense is what 
concerns Colt quarterback Jack Trudeau. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Chargers will be the best defensive team we have faced all year," 
Trudeau said. "They bring people (on the pass rush) from every position." 
</P>
<P>
That is not empty praise. The Charger defense is the only one in the league 
that has not allowed more than 20 points in any of its past nine games. 
</P>
<P>
During that period the Charger defense has allowed an average of 14.55 points. 
The Colt defense has also played well during that period, allowing an average 
of 15.66 points. 
</P>
<P>
Former Charger linebacker Chip Banks says he expects to have a "little bit of 
an edge" against his ex-teammates today because, having practiced against them, 
he knows many of their techniques. 
</P>
<P>
But actually Banks hasn't practiced against any of the Chargers' offensive line 
starters except guard Broderick Thompson. All the others have joined the team 
since Banks played his last game as a Charger in December of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Banks credits much of his success since joining the Colts Oct. 18 -- in five 
games, he has 23 tackles, one sack, five quarterback pressures and one 
interception -- to the support he has gotten from Meyer. "He makes me feel part 
of the organization as a person as well as a player," Banks says. "They have 
concern for me. I want to do right." 
</P>
<P>
Banks is a two-time drug offender. One more positive drug test and he will be 
banned for life by the NFL.

PHILADELPHIA 76ERS WORK ON CHEMISTRY AFTER HOUSECLEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the cocky New York Knicks borrowed brooms from the crowd and swept the 
Spectrum floor last May following their 3-0 blitz of Philadelphia in the 
opening round of the playoffs, the symbolism was not lost on John Nash, the 
76ers' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Nash made some sweeping changes of his own. His off-season housecleaning 
altered half the team roster, with six new faces ready to greet the Washington 
Bullets in their first encounter at the Spectrum Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the new additions -- point guard Johnny Dawkins, acquired from the San 
Antonio Spurs, and power forward Rick Mahorn, obtained in a trade with the 
Minnesota Timberwolves -- have moved into the starting lineup. Forward Jay 
Vincent, also part of the Spurs deal, is a key frontcourt reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to take a realistic look at ourselves," Nash said. "Even though we were 
in all three of those playoff games, we had to look down the road. We knew we 
had to improve ourselves to be as good as the Knicks." 
</P>
<P>
So Nash took a calculated risk in his five-man swap with the Spurs, trading a 
hometown favorite in classic point guard Maurice Cheeks, the last link to the 
1983 championship team. Reserve guard David Wingate and back-up center Chris 
Welp, both regarded as disappointments last year, were included in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, it was a Cheeks-for-Dawkins deal, experience for youth. In Nash's 
mind, keeping the popular Cheeks, 33, any longer would have seriously 
diminished his trade value. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very painful decision," Nash said. "I loved Maurice as a person and a 
player. For 11 years here, he was the consummate, selfless pro. He led on the 
floor by example. His character was reflected in statistics in last year's 
playoffs, when he elevated his performance a notch. 
</P>
<P>
"Trading a quality guy like Cheeks makes a lot of people squeamish. But if I 
waited until Maurice retired, I would have been left without a starting point 
guard. People would have howled if I had to start Scott Brooks (the 5-foot-11 
reserve playmaker)." 
</P>
<P>
Nash said he learned his lesson in allowing 76ers stars Julius Erving, Bobby 
Jones and Andrew Toney to play out the string when they might have fetched a 
young player in return. "You have to trade players when they're still worth 
something," Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins, the former Duke All-American who appeared in only 37 games for the 
Spurs last season after damaging a nerve in his leg, is under extreme pressure 
to make the 76ers faithful forget Cheeks and his quiet leadership. 
</P>
<P>
He is being groomed as a point guard after he primarily played the off guard 
position in San Antonio alongside Alvin Robertson, who was traded to the 
Milwaukee Bucks this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny is not at Maurice's level yet," Nash said. "Cheeks was an All-Star, but 
Johnny was coming along before he got hurt last year." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dawkins: "I've only played the point for a short time, but I was doing 
well last year before my injury in December." 
</P>
<P>
He was averaging over more than 17 points and seven rebounds for the Spurs 
before he bruised his left knee. In a few days, his left foot turned numb. It 
was diagnosed as damage to the peroneal nerve, which runs the length of the 
leg's fibula and controls motion of the foot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I would ever walk again on my left leg, let alone play," 
Dawkins said in retrospect. "I'd always felt invincible. But all of a sudden I 
was vulnerable, and it was scary. But I told myself, 'If I can walk, I'll run. 
If I can run, I can play.' " 
</P>
<P>
After extensive therapy and a summer of testing the leg against playground 
competition, Dawkins insists his leg problems are behind him. 
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end) 
</P>
<P>
Still, the trade in August was maybe more of a shock for him than for Cheeks, 
who, at least, had heard rumors during the June draft that he might be traded 
to the Chicago Bulls or Houston Rockets for a high draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I figured in San Antonio's long-range plans," said Dawkins, a 
Washington native. "I was really looking forward to playing this season with 
David Robinson. But I think the move to Philadelphia will be good for me. I'm 
an East Coast guy, and this brings me a lot closer to home." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dawkins' new teammates are taking a wait-and-see attitude, 
particularly Charles Barkley, a forward who remains the 76ers' unquestioned 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset the day of the trade was first made," Barkley said. "I didn't like 
the way the team informed a great pro like Maurice. We'll obviously miss him, 
but I've found that Johnny does a good job of distributing the ball and forcing 
the break. That opens things up for me and (off guard) Hersey Hawkins." 
</P>
<P>
In obtaining Vincent and Mahorn, Nash hopes to see Barkley employed more often 
at small forward, where he could overpower his defender. But Barkley and 
Mahorn, two physical, outspoken competitors, already have exchanged angry words 
on and off the court, and 76ers Coach Jim Lynam faces early problems 
maintaining team harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of new guys who are playing a lot of minutes," assistant coach 
Fred Carter said. "Right now, the chemistry isn't right. Our offense is not as 
smooth as it will be. We still have to tighten up the spokes before we really 
get rolling."

SIKMA'S TRADEMARK WITHERS IN NEW ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS G. BUNN, NEWSDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Motta once said it was the most innovative move he had seen in his 
coaching career, which began in the '50s. In a century or so, some coach will 
run across it while watching videotapes and say, "That was a heck of a move. 
Wonder why it never caught on?" No one has been able to invent a name for it -- 
like "skyhook." It is known simply by the name of its originator -- The Sikma 
Move. 
</P>
<P>
It is not exactly majestic. Even when Jack Sikma was a spry 25, it was, at 
best, jerky. It calls for a 180-degree pivot, a step back, and a shot from way 
behind the head. If someone tries to block it, the pivot foot is still in 
place, so Sikma can fake the shot and go past the defender. 
</P>
<P>
At 34, he still can do the move better than anyone, primarily because no one 
else does it. But he is doing it less these days because in his old basketball 
age Sikma has become a 6-foot-11, 255-pound perimeter center -- sort of a Bill 
Laimbeer with class. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't use it as much anymore," said Sikma, who will be in Madison Square 
Garden when the Milwaukee Bucks play the New York Knicks Saturday. "I'm just 
not in the low post as much anymore. My game has kind of changed." 
</P>
<P>
It says a lot about Sikma that he can make such an adjustment 13 years into his 
career. And he has made it effectively. Last week in a game against the San 
Antonio Spurs, rookie David Robinson chose to double down low and leave Sikma 
unguarded. Sikma responded by converting five three-point shots and scoring a 
season-high 29 points while Robinson had 18. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it seems strange not seeing Sikma down low, whirling around and 
utilizing The Sikma Move. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me," he said. "I have found during my career that I get the 
most playing time by doing what the coach tells me to do. So that's what I have 
always done." 
</P>
<P>
Sikma says coaches have shown the most interest in the move. Many have inquired 
about how he invented it (he did it with the help of his college coach). Motta 
used to challenge every big man he coached to learn the move. Some would 
practice it and use it sporadically during games. But Sikma says no player has 
ever asked him about the mechanics of the shot. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, that is surprising because the shot is such an effective inside 
technique. For tall players who do not have the leaping ability of Patrick 
Ewing or Akeem Olajuwon, it would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
But then, it also is not surprising because very few players asked Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar to teach them the skyhook. If The Sikma Move included bouncing the 
ball between the legs 50 times, maybe it would have looked cooler and become 
more popular. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, it has only been good enough to help Sikma win a championship (with 
the '79 Seattle SuperSonics) and keep him in the league 13 years. Sikma knows, 
however, that when he retires, the The Sikma Move will become extinct. But he 
doesn't get dramatic about it. "It's a unique shot, and it sets me apart," 
Sikma says. "But that shot and 25 cents will buy you a newspaper, and that's 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
That may be true, and there is no doubt is not the most awesome move in the 
history of basketball. It may, however, be what Motta said it is -- the most 
innovative we have seen in quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
One move that did not thrill Spurs Coach Larry Brown occurred Wednesday when 
his team signed guard Johnny Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Brown made it clear that it was not his decision. "I'm happy for Johnny after 
what he's been through," Brown said. "But it really hurt to get rid of (Jeff) 
Lebo." 
</P>
<P>
Spurs General Manager Bob Bass made the decision to sign Moore, the popular 
ex-Spur whose career was interrupted in 1985 when he contracted desert fever, a 
rare form of meningitis. Moore, 31, apparently has recovered. He was working 
out with the Continental Basketball Association Tulsa team when Bass called. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Timberwolves guard Pooh Richardson consumes one of the most 
interesting refreshments during timeouts -- honey. I wanted to ask why but 
didn't get the chance. But then, it might have been a dumb question. When you 
think about it, considering his name, it makes perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
During the world champion Detroit Pistons' recent 88-84 loss to the Miami Heat, 
teammates and buddies Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas had a heated exchange of 
words on the floor. Thomas told Aguirre, "You're blowing it," while the game 
was in progress. Aguirre responded, "You mean I'm losing this game by myself?" 
Later, the two made peace, and because their friendship includes an exchange of 
kisses, it probably is safe to assume they literally kissed and made up. 
</P>
<P>
Once Thomas gets a full dose of the regular-season Aguirre and his massive mood 
swings, it will be interesting to see if their off-court friendship survives. 
It probably will help that Aguirre currently has a sprained ankle that will 
keep him out of the lineup for a while. Absence makes the poison less potent. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre has proven conclusively during his eight-year career that he cannot 
make it through an 82-game season without causing several major and minor 
distractions. The Pistons were on such a roll last season that even Aguirre 
could not disrupt them. But now he has a full season to work. The blowup with 
Thomas occurred before the season was two weeks old. There will be more. 
</P>
<P>
Several general managers are predicting Brian Shaw and Il Messaggero Roma of 
the Italian league will reach agreement on the settlement of his contract 
shortly, and that Shaw will return to the United States and join the Celtics. 
Il Messaggero Roma apparently has let it be known that it is in the market for 
an American guard. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Hawks General Manager Stan Kasten points out that the Italian season 
ends April 14, and if Il Messaggero Roma does not not make the playoffs, Danny 
Ferry could join the Cleveland Cavaliers for the National Basketball 
Association playoffs. "Ferry could be back," Kasten said. "This might help 
Cleveland sooner than anyone thinks." 
</P>
<P>
This observation is rather obvious, but cocaine really did hurt Mitchell 
Wiggins' game. The Houston Rockets guard, who was banned for two years because 
of cocaine use, has averaged nearly 22 points since returning. In his first 
four NBA years, he averaged 9.6 points and his highest average was 12.4. 
Wiggins credits his offensive burst to clean living and hard work. He also 
knows it is going to pay off for him. Wiggins is making only $250,000 and is an 
unrestricted free agent after the season. "Hopefully I can get a job," he said. 
"Do you think I can make some money? I would like to stay in Houston, but I 
might have to test the waters." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rockets Coach Don Chaney said don't be fooled by the eight minutes 
former starter Sleepy Floyd played against the Knicks Tuesday. "He's not in my 
doghouse, if that's what you're wondering," said Chaney, who has fooled a lot 
of people. "He's been struggling, and I've got some young guards I have to make 
decisions on." 
</P>
<P>
Right. You want to find out if Anthony Bowie and Byron Dinkins can play, so you 
bench your starting point guard. Floyd also will be an unrestricted free agent, 
and he was close to signing a new deal with the Rockets. But now, he may not. 
"This definitely will have an effect," Floyd said.

NOTE TO CONGRESS: LEAVE CABLE TV ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE HAMELIN, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When people sat down Thursday to carve their turkey, few bowed heads and gave 
thanks for the three TV networks. Howard Metzenbaum thinks that's too bad. The 
senator from Ohio thinks of these as a national resource. 
</P>
<P>
Doogie Howser, Alf and Roseanne? 
</P>
<P>
No. Thank God. Howie is speaking of sports. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrat is chairman of the subcommittee on antitrust and monopoly, which 
spent much of last week investigating the impact upon the American fan of 
cable's gobbling up sports events. In a guest editorial in Monday's editions of 
"USA Today," Metzenbaum suggests that too much is on cable now, and not enough 
on free television, and if that trend keeps up, Congress will have to step in 
and do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
Terrific, huh? 
</P>
<P>
Drugs are destroying America's fiber, people are dying in El Salvador's war, 
AIDS is threatening to wipe out humanity, the nation's highways fall apart when 
you shake them, and these clowns are sitting around taking testimony on which 
networks should carry what games. 
</P>
<P>
"The signs," Metzenbaum wrote, "are ominous: 
</P>
<P>
"Next year, the number of nationally televised Saturday baseball games on free 
TV will drop from 40 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday night NFL games are on ESPN, not free TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Tennessee college football fans had to pay $20 to see the Tennessee-Duke 
football game on television . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And then he finally got to the nub of it: 
</P>
<P>
"In my own state, Ohio, high school football fans in communities without cable 
are worried because, for the first time, the sports cable channel has an 
exclusive contract for the (state) championship." 
</P>
<P>
He calls cable "an unregulated monopoly." The "new kid in the neighborhood," he 
contends, is now the "bully on the block." 
</P>
<P>
My guess is that Howie doesn't know a hoola hoop from a hockey puck. 
</P>
<P>
The public has access to more "free" games than ever before -- and the numbers 
are swelling, not shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, CBS announced a billion-dollar arrangement to telecast all 63 games of 
college basketball's championship tournament from 1991 through '97. 
</P>
<P>
Cable network ESPN will air none. No more Dick Vitale. Too bad. R.I.P., baby. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, NBC put up $600 million to do as many as 50 NBA games in each of 
the next four seasons -- as many as the cable networks are doing. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks before that, CBS bid more than a billion to do baseball next season 
-- 16 regular-season Saturday games, plus as many as 22 others. 
</P>
<P>
All that, for free . . . more or less. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the word "free" is Howard's, not mine. 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum argues that professional sports teams get special treatment under 
federal law and thus have a debt to the public. He says fans who buy tickets, 
and those who pay taxes on sports facilities, deserve free access to the games 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
"The sports leagues," he wrote, "should take steps to ensure that access to 
sports on TV does not depend upon an individual's ability to pay. If they 
won't, Congress may do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
Over my dead body, Howard. 
</P>
<P>
What about people who can't afford a TV? 
</P>
<P>
Do we kill the B-2 and spend the dough on TVs for the homeless? 
</P>
<P>
And what's free TV, anyhow? 
</P>
<P>
"Free TV" programs are financed by sponsors. All those millions and billions 
are paid off by firms that make cars, beer and panty hose. To make the extra 
dough to pay for those ads, they hike the price of their products. 
</P>
<P>
You either pay the cable company or you pay the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference? 
</P>
<P>
As for those "ominous" signs, Metzenbaum's "ghost" seems confused. 
</P>
<P>
There were 30 regular-season broadcasts last season, not 40. There aren't 40 
Saturdays in the baseball season. There are also the local TV packages 
augmenting the networks and pay-per-view. More than 100 San Francisco Giants 
games were available last season in its part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, ESPN will cablecast 176 games next season, which is up from last 
season's total of NONE. 
</P>
<P>
As for football, ESPN is carrying only one pro game Sunday evenings. Except for 
those cities whose teams are in action, it's in addition to what America 
already had. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee-Duke, for $20 on pay-per-view cable, beats the hell out of not being 
able to see it at all. The same is true of Ohio's prep title game, which 
probably will raise all kinds of dough for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
If Howard sees some kind of threat to our liberty here, it eludes me. 
</P>
<P>
It also troubles Metzenbaum that cable rates have been escalating. So what 
about tickets? What hasn't been escalating? 
</P>
<P>
For about what it costs to get into one NBA game, you can get a month of ESPN, 
CNN, TNN, MTV, TBS, TDC, A&amp;E, PDQ, AAA and BVD. Cable reaches something 
like 56 percent of American households now. Add in the people with satellite 
dishes, those within walking distance of restaurants and taverns with cable or 
dishes, and those people who haven't bought cable simply because they like 
books, and it's clear three in four nationwide can watch whatever they want. 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum makes no sense. If a thing isn't broke, why fix it? For sports fans, 
times have never been better when it comes to TV. 
</P>
<P>
The piece would have been funny if Metzenbaum weren't so important a man, with 
the power to make life miserable for millions of sports fans. And all because 
some constituents have to pay to watch a prep football game. Or maybe because 
Metzenbaum had to. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why these guys need a raise.

REBUILDING PROCESS BEGINS AT MARYLAND UNDER WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
COLLEGE PARK, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a symbolism of sorts to the reconstruction and refurbishing that 
began recently in the basketball offices at the University of Maryland, 
symbolic not only because the Terrapins are in the midst of starting a new 
season, but because they are also starting a new era. 
</P>
<P>
New Coach Gary Williams already has put his stamp on a team that finished 9-20 
last season under former coach Bob Wade, but the ink has yet to dry. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of team Williams hopes Maryland will become in the months ahead is 
much the same as the teams he has had during the past 11 years at Ohio State, 
Boston College and American University -- hard-nosed overachievers with a 
passion for defense and a penchant for upsets. 
</P>
<P>
"They've worked hard. That's all you can ask for," said Williams, 44, a 
Maryland alum. "They've shown some improvement (since the start of practice) in 
terms of intensity. If we're going to be competitive this year, we're going to 
have to work as hard, or harder, than any other team we play." 
</P>
<P>
The legacy Williams inherited when he took the job in June, a month after Wade 
was forced to resign, was that of a team that often played down to the level of 
the competition when it came to weaker, non-conference opponents and rarely won 
a game it wasn't supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
Though Maryland has more talent left over than when Wade came in four seasons 
ago, this year's team is not typical of the ones Williams has coached in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"Our teams have been more guard-oriented," said Williams, who played the point 
for three years at Maryland during the mid-1960s. "This year, the predominance 
of our talent is in the frontcourt." 
</P>
<P>
Junior point guard Teyon McCoy is a good long-range shooter, but he does not 
penetrate the way Michael Adams did at Boston College or Jay Burson did at Ohio 
State. Sophomore forward Jerrod Mustaf, who added 20 pounds of muscle over the 
summer, still has a habit of pulling up from 17 feet rather than clearing a 
path for himself to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore swingman Walt Williams, 6-foot-8, certainly the most flexible player 
on the team, has yet to figure out if he's a forward who can shoot outside or a 
guard who can climb for back-door dunks. And senior forward Tony Massenburg, 
once he returns from his two-game penalty for selling Atlantic Coast Conference 
tournament tickets, has to become for Maryland what Tom Hammonds used to be for 
Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
In a word, consistent. The same can be said for Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to keep getting better," said Massenburg, who, along with 
reserve forward Rodney Walker, is expected to return Tuesday. "We can't slip 
back, like we did last year. Coach Williams won't allow it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams won't allow a lot of things. When sophomore guard Jesse Martin started 
missing classes during the preseason, Williams suspended him indefinitely -- 
the suspension was lifted Wednesday -- despite a lack of backcourt players with 
any college experience. 
</P>
<P>
When the Terps started feeling cocky last week after beating a weak Venezuelan 
National team by 32 points, Williams quickly brought them back to reality. 
Though pleased with the improvement his players had shown from their first 
exhibition game, Williams wore a pained look the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I do get on edge," he said. "You can't afford to waste a day." 
</P>
<P>
But what Williams will allow, and even encourage, is for the Terps to run and 
shoot and not look over their shoulders. That kind of attitude already has paid 
off in the improved play of junior center Cedric Lewis and in the confidence 
McCoy displayed in the first exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the players seem more relaxed," said McCoy, who has missed much of 
the last two weeks with a pulled groin muscle. "They don't have the pressure 
that was on them before. Coach Williams tells us, 'You're going to make 
mistakes, but the important thing is to learn from them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Lewis: "Coach Williams gives us a lot of confidence. He says, 'There's 
nothing you can't do if you work at it.' " 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't mean the Terps will challenge North Carolina and Duke for the ACC 
championship. It could mean that Maryland might surprise some teams along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to be realistic," said Williams. "We won one game in the ACC last 
year and were picked to finish last this year. If we keep everyone healthy, 
which we haven't been able to do so far, that will help us." 
</P>
<P>
Williams has refused to make predictions, for he is not quite sure how much 
talent his players have, and how much of themselves they will leave on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how good we are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, for now there are no grand dreams, just little ones. In time, they will 
grow as the Maryland basketball program, like the offices upstairs, is 
reconstructed and refurbished under the watchful eye of Gary Williams.

It's a light bat for tennis with a network of catgut, silk, or nylon in an oval 
frame attached to a handle, according to Webster's New World Dictionary of the 
American Language. 
</P>
<P>
But how do you spell it? R-a-c-k-e-t or r-a-c-q-u-e-t? 
</P>
<P>
The two orthographies have been volleyed back and forth since the sport was 
invented and there have been many variations to this day. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's defines the word only under the 'k' spelling, but the dictionary also 
says "same as racket" under the racquet listing. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one is getting involved in head-to-head competition over the 
matter, some tennis enthusiasts have a preference. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just always known r-a-c-q-u-e-t is how you spell it," Alexander McNab, 
Editor of "Tennis" magazine, said emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
McNab, 37, has been playing tennis since he was 10 years old and said he has 
always spelled the word that way. 
</P>
<P>
And so has his magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The cover of Tennis magazine's premiere issue, published May, 1965, read, 
"Tennis -- The Magazine of the Racquet Sports." 
</P>
<P>
But even in 1965, when the instrument was still generally composed of wood and 
Roy Emerson and Margaret Smith won Wimbledon, the reader had to look no further 
than the third page of that issue to see the other spelling. 
</P>
<P>
A Bancroft advertisement urged tennis buffs to "Play with America's New No. 1 
Tennis Racket." 
</P>
<P>
The editors at Tennis have no control over how their advertisers spell the 
word. 
</P>
<P>
McNab said the magazine follows The New York Times' style. The company has 
owned the magazine since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The piece of equipment itself has undergone many structural and cosmetic 
changes over the last 20 years, first with the move from a wood to aluminum 
body and later to fiberglass and graphite constructions. 
</P>
<P>
While those innovations have affected the dynamics of the game, the impact of 
the often-used 'qu' version is more subtle, but it exists, according to John 
Singler, an assistant professor of linguistics at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at who the tennis pros are, considering their backgrounds and all, 
you see this spelling is just reinforcing the snob appeal," Singler said, 
referring to the 'qu' version. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you bring in something that's French it's brought in for snob 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
The French spelling is racquette. 
</P>
<P>
Singler explains that language doesn't decide that one spelling of a word is 
more prestigious than another; the writers and speakers of the language make 
that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that there is only one way to spell a word is relatively recent, 
according to Singler, arriving with the 18th Century ascendancy of the 
grammarians in England. 
</P>
<P>
Singler has his own preference. "A racket's a racket and it's a ck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxford English dictionary lists the following among its historic spellings 
and usages for the word: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1624 - Captain John Smith, writing about Virginia: "The beaver, his tail 
somewhat like the form of a racket..." 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1828 - Benjamin Disraeli, former British prime minister: "In the tennis 
court he toiled with the racquet." 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1897 - Outing, a U.S. magazine: "When the racquette is fastened the heel 
and toe are free." 
</P>
<P>
The spelling difference has nothing to do with "snob appeal," McNab said, but 
rather "it's a matter of being correct versus being incorrect. I think we're 
right and other people are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The linguist Singler supports his "snob appeal" explanation with an example. 
</P>
<P>
The spelling of the word for a loud disturbance or the slang word for an easy, 
profitable business or profession would never become r-a-c-q-u-e-t because 
those usages don't have any elitist associations, Singler said. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising world, though, has not overlooked even that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
A magazine ad for Clairol, featuring a woman with long flowing hair holding the 
object in question against her face as if it were a veil, reads, "Beautiful 
hair is our racquet." 
</P>
<P>
The spelling in The Associated Press style and word usage manual is 
r-a-c-k-e-t. 
</P>
<P>
But who cares anyway? asks W. Timothy Gallwey, author of "The Inner Game of 
Tennis," a 1974 tennis instruction book that uses the 'k' form.

Gallwey said he has never thought about the issue and said he thinks he 
probably spells it both ways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a decadent society that considers such issues," he said.

PATRIOTS SEEK A QUARTERBACK FOR FUTURE

Steve Walsh might look good in a New England Patriots uniform. Bobby Hebert 
certainly would, and ditto for Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Maine's Mike Buck could fill the bill. Or perhaps a quarterback from 
Moscow (Idaho, that is) would be the person for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Whomever. Wherever. As life slowly seeps out of this season, the Patriots are 
already looking to the future. And to future quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get a quarterback somewhere," said Dick Steinberg, the Patriots' 
director of player development. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons the Patriots take a 4-7 record into Sunday's game in 
Los Angeles against the Raiders is the problem they have had at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Eason failed and is now with the New York Jets. Doug Flutie failed and is 
now buried on the Patriots bench. That leaves Steve Grogan, a 36-year-old with 
a history of injuries, and Marc Wilson, a soon-to-be 33-year-old, who has 
barely played in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a lot of sense to try and look around and see what's available next 
year in the draft or free agents (or) trades," said Patriots Coach Raymond 
Berry. 
</P>
<P>
It also makes sense for the Patriots to get a better read on Wilson, who has 
played less than a half this year after sitting out all last season. Grogan, as 
well as he has played, is certainly not the long-term answer, while Wilson's 
one brief appearance this season makes him a possible solution. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson made everyone reassess their opinions of him in his only regular-season 
game after Grogan sustained a concussion early in the second half Nov. 5 
against the Jets. Wilson completed 12 of 18 passes for 177 yards and two 
touchdowns in a near-heroic performance. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's touchdown pass to Hart Lee Dykes with 1 minute, 3 seconds remaining 
gave the Patriots a 26-24 lead. But the Jets won on a last-second field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Berry might have opted to play Wilson Sunday against his former team, but with 
last week's victory over the Buffalo Bills, Berry apparently holds a tiny bit 
of hope that victories in the remaining five games might get the Patriots into 
the playoffs. Thus, Grogan, who has played well in leading the Patriots to two 
victories in his five starts, gets the nod. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to get (Wilson) a chance to play as a starter certainly figures in our 
plans before the season is over," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're trying to concentrate on beating the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, Grogan and probably Flutie are expected back in the Patriots camp next 
year. New England also would like to bring in a young quarterback who can be 
groomed to take over the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
"The most likely scenario," said Patriots general manager Patrick Sullivan, 
"may be for us to sign a free agent." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' Everett and the Saints' Hebert will be free agents at the end of the 
season. But signing either might be costly -- not only in terms of the money 
they would demand, but also because the Patriots would have to give up two 
first-round draft picks as compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is that the Patriots might not be able to lure Everett or Hebert 
from their respective teams. 
</P>
<P>
Trades for quarterbacks don't happen easily, and the asking price for a good 
one is guaranteed to be steep. One quarterback who may be available for trade 
is Walsh, who is behind another young quarterback, Troy Aikman, with the Dallas 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys would probably demand a first-round draft pick to replace the one 
they used to select Walsh in the supplemental draft last spring, additional 
draft choices and maybe a player or two. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots would be interested, but probably not at that price. 
</P>
<P>
The draft is a more likely avenue. Steinberg likes to build through the draft 
and the Patriots may get a fairly early first-round pick depending on how they 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots will definitely draft a quarterback. The problem is that there 
aren't any blue-chip quarterbacks coming out of college next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't take a quarterback in the first round if he's not a first-round guy," 
said Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho quarterback John Friesz is the player most consistently mentioned as 
having pro possibilities. Everyone seems to agree that the lanky, 6-foot-4, 
216-pounder has a National Football League arm, but he is not mobile. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots are interested in Buck, who has played against National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division I-AA competition for the most part. Steinberg 
said he will have to see him in postseason all-star games to make a complete 
assessment.

TEEN-AGER SHOWS OFF HIS WHEELS; 
</P>
<P>
16-YEAR-OLD BRANDON TALLMAN OF NEWBURY PARK EXCELS IN ROLLER SPEEDSKATING, A 
POTENTIAL OLYMPIC SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The average Southern California teen-ager may roller-skate, but only as a 
hobby. Brandon Tallman is not the average Southern California teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Tallman, 16, a junior at Newbury Park High, is one of the area's rising stars 
in a relatively obscure sport -- roller speedskating. And, as in any other 
sport, he has gained his prominence through hard work. 
</P>
<P>
What, exactly, is roller speedskating? 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically the same thing as ice speedskating, but it's on roller-skates," 
Tallman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tallman is a member of the Southern California Speed League, which features 
teams from Lancaster, Riverside, Santa Ana and Ventura. Tallman is accustomed 
to "hopping around from rink to rink," but has found a home with the Ventura 
Speed Club, which practices at Skating Plus in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
He also has found success. Tallman was selected to attend a weeklong 
speedskating camp at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., 
after qualifying for the amateur nationals in the Junior Olympics last July. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 200 slots for 10,000 skaters," said Don Lovato, Tallman's coach. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis at the training camp was on the word training. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to wake up at 5:30 every morning and then you have to walk about a 
half-mile to the track, " Tallman said. "You have to do land exercises, which 
is practicing on form and balance for when you get onto your skates. You do 
that for two hours. Then you to go practice for two hours. Then you get a 
little break. Then you have to go practice for another two hours. Then you've 
got to go slideboard for an hour." 
</P>
<P>
The training center has a 200-meter outdoor track with banked turns. This is in 
contrast to the tracks that Tallman is used to, which are measured out with 
pylons. Distances on these tracks, which have either wood or cement surfaces, 
vary between 100 and 500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
For Tallman, the camp was not much of a change from his usual hectic life 
style. Tallman cycles 100 miles a week, trains with weights twice a week and 
works for one hour every day on the slideboard, a polished linoleum surface 
with two adjustable two by fours on either side. The skater, wearing wool 
socks, simulates skating on the board, shortening or lengthening the distance 
between the boards to shorten or lengthen his stroke. Longer strokes are better 
for longer distances, and shorter strokes for shorter races. 
</P>
<P>
All this in addition to school and team practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to school from 7:30 to 2:10 and then I have practices Monday from 5 until 
7 and then 9 to 11," Tallman said. "Thursdays I have practice from 4:30 to 6:30 
and on Saturday mornings I have practice from 7 to 9." 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, the training has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"He's shown a lot of improvement," Lovato said. "He's a hard worker, he pays 
attention and does those extra things that are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Tallman also provides his own equipment, which costs a bit more than an average 
pair of skates. The speed skates average $700 and differ from recreational 
skates in more than price. Roller-skates have one single-action cushion; speed 
skates have two cushions for double action, giving the skater better 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Tallman, who moved to Newbury Park from Oregon a year ago, initially became 
interested in roller-skating as a pastime. 
</P>
<P>
"I started roller-skating (when I was) about 9 years old. I started training 
for speedskating when I was 11 or 12, and I started competition when I was 
nearly 15," Tallman said. "I was just hanging out with my friends at school and 
then they tell me they're going to go roller-skating, so I go. I just kind of 
got hooked on it from there." 
</P>
<P>
Hooked is an apt description for Tallman's enthusiasm for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"In competition you get really psyched out at first when you get up to the 
starting line," Tallman said. "When they say, 'Skaters, take your mark,' you 
get down there and your heart's going a million miles an hour. Then they blow 
the whistle and you go. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, if you've got all the mental (aspect) down, you're doing pretty good, 
because it's about 75 percent mental. You've got to be a smart skater as much 
as a physically fit skater. You've got to know how to draft, how to make your 
passes, when to take the lead and when not to take the lead, how to balance 
into a corner." 
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility that roller speedskating will be included in the 1992 
Games. If that comes to pass, Tallman's chance at winning an Olympic medal 
might not be far behind.

Kirsten Dumford scored 19 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to lead Cal State 
Stanislaus to a 91-69 win over visiting Cal State Northridge Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's Denna Mulverhill led the Lady Matadors with 13 points. Bridgette 
Ealy and Julie Arlotto added 11 and 10 points, respectively, and both had seven 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Minturn of Stanislaus led all scorers with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislaus (1-3) raced to an early 16-point advantage, but Northridge (1-3) 
trimmed it to three with less than two minutes remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Lady Matadors could get no closer as Stanislaus exploded for eight 
unanswered points to take an 11-point lead at the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Dumford hit on five of seven three-point attempts for Stanislaus.

NITTANY LIONS WIN AND BRING HOLIDAY CHEER

A kicker named Ray Tarasi brought some holiday smiles to men dressed in red 
jackets Saturday when he made a 20-yard field goal with 13 seconds left to give 
Penn State a 16-13 victory over Pittsburgh at Pitt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Penn State Coach Joe Paterno accepted an invitation from 
Holiday Bowl officials to bring his Nittany Lions to San Diego. It will be Penn 
State's first Holiday Bowl appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State (7-3-1) will play the Western Athletic Conference champion Brigham 
Young Friday, Dec. 29, at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Tarasi's field goal prevented Penn State from going winless in its final three 
games, something no bowl official likes to contemplate for one of its 
participants. In its previous two games, Penn State lost to Notre Dame (34-23) 
and tied Maryland (13-13). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why these guys in red coats were so concerned," said Penn State 
Athletic Director Jim Tarman, referring to bowl officials. "Joe said we'd go to 
the Holiday Bowl with seven wins." 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's three losses this season have been to Notre Dame, Virginia (14-6) 
and Alabama (17-16). 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Bowl officials have looked at Penn State since the first weekend they 
were allowed to scout teams in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
"We started bearing in on them pretty hard then," said John Reid, executive 
director. "You look at the teams they've lost to and they've had a pretty 
incredible season." 
</P>
<P>
Said Paterno: "I've been to San Diego several times, and I'm anxious to have my 
squad go out there and see what a great city it is." 
</P>
<P>
Paterno said he never seriously considered another bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
"No, when it looked like this thing was starting to firm up, I told Jim 
(Tarman) to call John Reid and see if they wanted us when it was the 
appropriate time to make the bid. I said we'd really be interested." 
</P>
<P>
Penn State has never played BYU. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the score will be 16-13," Paterno said. "LaVell (Edwards, BYU's 
coach) might take it easy on me because I'm his buddy. He is a very special 
friend of mine. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll make a deal -- we'll throw the ball and he'll run the ball and we'll 
have a very dull game." 
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Bowl has guaranteed each team $1 million, an increase from its 
payout of $907,613 apiece last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Bowl is sold out, the earliest sellout in the game's history. It 
will be televised by ESPN.

RAMONA STANDS TALL AND WIDE IN 20-6 DEFEAT OF MISSION BAY

The Ramona Bulldogs are starting to like this thing called the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In its first San Diego Section 2-A playoff appearance, Ramona (8-4) is in the 
semifinals against Avocado League rival El Camino after its 20-6 defeat of 
outmanned and outweighed Mission Bay at Balboa Stadium Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona's offensive line, which averages 6-feet-2, 235 pounds, overpowered 
Mission Bay's defensive line and opened huge holes for running backs Sarn 
Salmon, Tom Smith and Frank Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
The trio combined for 183 yards on 41 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona Coach Mel Galli said the outcome was predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they had ever run into the size of people we have on our team," 
Galli said. "We tried to be conservative and we wanted to run the clock. Once 
we got past the first quarter I knew it was over." 
</P>
<P>
Ramona led 3-0 after the first quarter but controlled the ball for all but 
three plays. The second quarter wasn't much different as Mission Bay (9-3) ran 
off nine plays to Ramona's 16. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime Ramona led, 17-0, and had outgained Mission Bay, 239 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played a terrible first half," said Dennis Pugh, Mission Bay's coach. 
"We just can't compete with that much physical force." 
</P>
<P>
Pugh, who had to play most of his people both ways, said his team was still 
hurting from last week's victory over Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"We've only got 1,500 in our school and we bus most of them in," Pugh said. "We 
just can't compete with schools that have that many kids. They always say the 
teams up north are supposed to be better than us. I guess they were right." 
</P>
<P>
The first-half back-breaker came with Ramona ahead 10-0 and facing a third and 
six at its own 43. With Mission Bay expecting another plunge up the middle, 
Ramona ran a flea-flicker that resulted in a 57-yard touchdown pass from wide 
receiver Todd Dick to receiver Brandon Drouillard. 
</P>
<P>
"That just killed us," Pugh said. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay scored its only touchdown with 5:50 remaining in the third quarter 
on a Pat Betancourt one-yard run. Unfortunately for Betancourt, it was the 
highlight of his night. He managed only 11 yards in 10 carries with his longest 
run being three yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona's only problem came in the second when Salmon (15 carries for 57 yards) 
was sandwiched by two Mission Bay players. Salmon was carried off on a 
stretcher with a neck injury. Salmon was listed in stable condition with no 
signs of paralysis late Saturday at the UCSD Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas led all rushers with 72 yards. Smith added 54. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual 29, St. Augustine 0 -- San Pasqual did it with both offense and 
defense. Quarterback Jon Ramirez led the offense with 128 yards rushing on 12 
carries. He also threw for a touchdown. Ramirez was backed up by running backs 
Cullen Owen -- 18 carries for 116 yards and two touchdowns -- and Andy Bacon -- 
61 yards and a touchdown on 12 rushes. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual rushed for 368 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, they held the Saints to only 88 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way was defensive back Rodger Hill, who interceped a pass and 
knocked away two others. Troy Faris also had a big sack on a second-and-nine 
play early in the second quarter with the Eagles up 7-0. The Saints lost eight 
yards on the play. 
</P>
<P>
"To get to the quarterfinals and shut out a team, you have to give a lot of 
credit to a team," said Mike Dolan, San Pasqual coach.

BOOZE BAN HAS SLIM POLL EDGE IN SAN MARINO 
</P>

By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

SAN MARINO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to local legend and lore, sometime in the 1930s and 1940s this city 
said no to bars and no to drinking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The theory back then, Mayor Paul C. Crowley said, was that if San Marino 
permitted eating establishments to serve alcoholic beverages, the race-track 
crowd from Santa Anita in nearby Arcadia might stop by for drinks, get rowdy 
and disrupt San Marino's quietude. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a new, unscientific survey conducted by the city indicates that 
many residents favor maintaining the prohibition. But there is also some 
sentiment for change. 
</P>
<P>
In a citywide survey covering a broad range of issues, 51% of the residents who 
responded said they want to keep the prohibition. But 43% favored a change that 
would allow wine and beer to be served in restaurants. The other 6% had no 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Survey forms were sent to all 4,500 households in the city, and 723, or about 
16%, responded. 
</P>
<P>
"For this unscientific approach, it's a fairly close vote," City Manager John 
E. Nowak said. "So it's still an issue that's up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Crowley said, the city mood is "swinging a little bit more toward 
tolerance. But I think we're not going to change (the law) unless we get a 
mandate to change." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Nowak said: "There may be a feeling of 'relooking' at that 
restriction. Some people thought that (the vote) would have been much more 
overwhelming against (allowing liquor)." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the alcohol results are among the most significant in the 
survey, which was conducted recently by the city's Strategic Planning 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The overall results, Nowak said, show "basically that the community is pleased 
with the services being provided." 
</P>
<P>
In the law enforcement category, 93% of the respondents said they were 
satisfied. Nearly a third said they felt "very safe" being alone on the streets 
at night, and 50% said they felt "fairly safe." 
</P>
<P>
These answers, according to Police Chief Jack D. Yeske, need to be understood 
in context. San Marino has had only three homicides in the last three decades, 
and usually the most serious crime there is burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Nowak said one surprise he found in the survey was that some people said the 
city should provide more recreation opportunities for adults. 
</P>
<P>
Another insight for city officials came in answer to a question about 
renovating houses in the city, where, by law, the only residential housing 
permitted is single-family. 
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents, 62% said they had remodeled or added onto their houses in 
the last five years, and 27% said they planned to make similar improvements in 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew there was lot of activity," Nowak said, but "it was surprising to see 
how much."

RIVAL FAIRFAX PROJECTS JOCKEYING FOR APPROVAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: ONE BUILDER SEEKS THE CITY'S OK FOR A MAJOR SHOPPING MALL. ANOTHER 
PLANS A RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX AND OFFICE TOWERS LESS THAN A MILE AWAY. FAIRFAX 
DISTRICT RESIDENTS AREN'T SURE THEY WANT EITHER PROJECT, AND POSITIVE THEY 
DON'T WANT BOTH.

Steve Albert is upbeat. "You can't get rid of cars. You can get rid of the 
congestion they cause," says the developer. His firm wants to add 2,000 units 
to the Park Labrea residential complex and build two office towers and a hotel 
at the corner of Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Handelman is upbeat too. "We believe (our project) will be approved at a 
level that makes sense for us and everybody else," says the consultant. His 
employers want to make the Farmers Market into a major shopping mall, anchored 
by Nordstrom, Robinson's and May Co. stores. 
</P>
<P>
But the two projects lie within a mile of each other, and people who live and 
work in the Fairfax District are worried about the traffic and other problems 
that the future may bring to their neighborhood of small ethnic shops and quiet 
residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not standing in the way of progress, but we are opposed to the 
devastation of the community, and that's exactly what these projects will do in 
the size and scope they're being planned for," said Diana Plotkin, president of 
the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I care about this neighborhood," said Ronnie Gootkin, president of the Rancho 
La Brea Neighborhood Assn. "There is a special flavor and a special character, 
and it has to be maintained at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowner groups are not the only ones that want to be heard. The approach 
of large-scale development has revived Vitalize Fairfax, a previously defunct 
association of business people, service agencies, elected officials and other 
interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
"This group is not going to advocate development one way or the other. It's 
going to act as a sounding board," said its guiding spirit, Stanley Treitel, 
who is also director of the United Community and Housing Development Corp., a 
nonprofit job training agency with offices on Wilshire Boulevard. Treitel is 
also active in Orthodox Jewish circles. 
</P>
<P>
And attorney Michael Feuer has set up yet another group, Committee to Preserve 
Fairfax, which is adding its voice to the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"What began as a threat has become an opportunity for our group to actively 
participate in the shaping of this neighborhood," said Feuer. He said his 
neighborhood activism should be seen separately from his role as executive 
director of the Bet Tzedek legal services agency. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are two major developments that were conceived separately by rival 
firms. But fate, geography and the workings of the city's bureaucracy have 
linked them together. 
</P>
<P>
Both the A. F. Gilmore Co., which owns Farmers Market, and Forest City 
Properties Corp., which owns or leases all of Park Labrea and has an option to 
lease the oversized block at the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax, need city 
approval to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore faces an easier job of it, since much of its property is already zoned 
for commercial development. Forest City needs a General Plan amendment and zone 
changes on all four parcels of land involved in its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gilmore started planning its project years earlier, the two firms 
issued the draft versions of their environmental impact reports within one week 
of each other last July. 
</P>
<P>
Weighty and jammed with maps and statistical tables, both environmental reports 
found that traffic is already at gridlock level at intersections in the 
immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the developers try to deal with the additional traffic by putting in 
new lanes, left-turn pockets and other mitigation measures, eight intersections 
would still be overloaded, according the Park Labrea report. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Farmers Market report found that traffic would suffer 
significant impacts at six intersections. 
</P>
<P>
Although the projects are being examined separately, city officials said they 
will make sure to take each project into account when they consider the other. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to hold public hearings on the same day, if not at the same time," 
said Kei Uyeda, deputy director of the Planning Department. "It depends on how 
quickly the (final environmental reports) get done. If one gets done many 
months before the other, it would be difficult to hold the first one up." 
</P>
<P>
The point, Uyeda said, is to decide on a "level of entitlement that the city 
feels comfortable with, and that is the issue that the hearing examiner, then 
the city Planning Commission, then the Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee of the City Council, then the City Council, are all going to look at. 
And, of course, the mayor has to sign off on it, so it goes through a rather 
thorough review process." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, the release of the draft environmental reports set off an 
avalanche of responses from the public to which the developers will have to 
respond before the final reports can be issued and the planning process can 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"I would estimate about 60 responses," said Robert Heredia, an associate in the 
Planning Department who is in charge of the Park Labrea report. The major 
issues raised, he said, are traffic, air quality, noise and a more generalized 
concern that the scale of the development is "too large, and consequently that 
it's going to have an impact on the whole area." 
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints came in about Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
Forest City has been stymied, however, because of its decision to go for an 
office complex at the existing May Co. site at the corner of Fairfax and 
Wilshire instead of the shopping mall it originally proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The firm decided to opt for the office towers after City Councilmen John 
Ferraro, whose district includes both projects, and Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
represents a neighboring area, said in a joint statement that two major 
shopping malls within six blocks of each other would be too much. 
</P>
<P>
"The practical reality of real estate today is that you've got to do something 
that works in the community and that the community can accept," Albert said. 
"It became clear that (the office complex) would work a lot better than a 
shopping center, and that's why we changed it." 
</P>
<P>
But the change means that Forest City will to have draft a new environmental 
impact report and circulate it for another round of public comment, said Linn 
Wyatt, the city planner who is overseeing both projects. 
</P>
<P>
There was "some discrepancy as to what the project actually was," she said. "We 
asked them to define their project in absolute terms." 
</P>
<P>
As could be expected, Albert was unhappy at having to revise the environmental 
report, a process that could delay his project by several months at a time when 
Gilmore expects to go into the first of several public hearings on its project 
sometime in January. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually everybody has said that we don't want to do this piecemeal, that 
these two major projects should be looked at together," he said. "You don't 
want to do this a nickel at a time." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilmore's Handelman said: "There's no way for them to stay in step with us. 
We're going to do what we have to do, and we ain't going to wait." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, "you don't have to have them tracking at the same time to talk 
about them together," said Vivian Rescalvo, Yaroslavsky's planning deputy.

Originally known as Linda Vista (Pretty View) Park, the 26-acre Palisades Park 
stretches along Ocean Avenue overlooking Santa Monica Bay. It includes an 
Alaskan totem pole; the Cabrillo Monument, erected in 1949 to commemorate the 
400th anniversary of the discovery of the bay; and the statue of St. Monica, 
sculpted by Eugene Morahan for the 1934 Federal Arts Project.

LATINOS FIGHT FOR RECOGNITION; 
</P>
<P>
VETERANS: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY MEN ARE RAISING FUNDS TO BUILD A MEMORIAL THAT 
WILL COMMEMORATE THEIR WARTIME SERVICE. 
</P>

<P>
Silviano Madrigal has no beef with the Army. When he got out of the service in 
1952, in fact, Madrigal thought the Army had probably given him the best eight 
years, nine months and 27 days of his life. "It was one of the better homes I 
had," he says. 
</P>
<P>
No, the worst part of being a young Latino in era of lacerating intolerance 
came long before the Army, says Madrigal, 61, a brawny man with a gravelly 
laugh and arms like battering rams. 
</P>
<P>
There was the segregated school system in La Puente, which relegated Latino 
kids like "Sil" Madrigal, the son of farm workers, to the "slow" school. 
(Absolutely true, says Hacienda La Puente Unified School District 
Superintendent James Johnson. The all-minority Central Elementary School stayed 
open in La Puente until 1945.) 
</P>
<P>
There was Madrigal's sudden separation at 16 from the city's public school 
system, thanks to a La Puente High School administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"One day he just called me into the office and sent me out to pick lemons," 
says Madrigal, an instructor for Veterans in Community Service, a federally 
funded manpower program, who still lives in La Puente. "He said, 'That's what 
you're going to be -- a lemon picker,' and he threw me out." 
</P>
<P>
And there was the sorry spectacle of the 1942 "zoot suit" riots, with mobs of 
white servicemen, spurred on by hatemongers and biased media reports, traveling 
to East Los Angeles to beat up young Latino pachucos. Some of the zoot suiters 
were themselves GIs on leave. 
</P>
<P>
Madrigal, a proud zoot suiter himself in those days ("shark skins, English tie, 
Adams hat and triple-sole brogues," he says, describing his outfit), laughs at 
the memory of it. "We hurt some of those sailors from the Midwest," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And then Madrigal went to war. 
</P>
<P>
Young Latino men often have had to make a major leap of faith before they 
fought for their country. Called on to defend what many perceived as a 
far-from-perfect nation, the vast majority signed up. They may have paused a 
moment, Madrigal and other Latino veterans say, but then they leaped with 
alacrity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember any Hispanics who didn't want to go and do their duty for 
their country," says Madrigal, who was awarded three Bronze Stars for valor in 
World War II and the Silver Star for heroism in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Latino servicemen's contributions often were greater than those of any 
other group, say representatives of Latino veterans groups, who have begun 
raising funds for a Latino Veterans Memorial. One-fifth of the Latinos who 
served in Vietnam were killed in action, for example. One in three was wounded. 
On a per-capita basis, more Medals of Honor have been awarded to Latinos -- 37 
of them -- than to any other minority group. 
</P>
<P>
Latino veterans may gloss over injustices they feel they have suffered in the 
United States. But the lack of acknowledgment of Latino war sacrifices is an 
indignity that many of them are not prepared to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, the government is saying now that Hispanics were there," says Gonzalez, 
head of the Assn. of Hispanic Vietnam Era Veterans, citing President Bush's 
acknowledgment on Veterans Day that one-quarter of the names of casualties 
listed on a Texas Vietnam Veterans Memorial were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
But the message isn't getting to the most important audience -- elementary and 
high school students of Latino heritage, says Gonzalez, a salesman for an El 
Monte printing company. "What we usually get is recognition in election 
campaign speeches and on holidays," he says, "but it's not filtering down to 
the level we'd like to see." 
</P>
<P>
The planned memorial -- complete with the names of more than 20,000 Latino 
servicemen who have died in American wars since World War II -- will serve as a 
focus for educational programs, says Gonzalez, whose group is leading the 
efforts to raise about $300,000 for the project. It's expected to be unveiled 
in about two years at a San Gabriel Valley location that Gonzalez said he could 
not reveal. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, this is a do-it-yourself project, those who are involved say. 
"We've always had to initiate things like this," says Ruben Treviso, a member 
of American GI Forum and public affairs director for Veterans In Community 
Service, based in Whittier. "We're not bitter. We're just going to build our 
own memorial." 
</P>
<P>
Put a group of Latino veterans together and the conversation seems to flow 
inevitably from battle stories to fallen friends to the gnawing issue of 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at all the John Wayne movies," says Gonzalez. "Very few Hispanics. Once 
in a while, they dressed up Anthony Quinn or Cesar Romero as a soldier." Recent 
movies about the Vietnam War, such as "Platoon" and "Full Metal Jacket," have 
not been much better because they acknowledged Latino soldiers only in passing, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
This is a bitter pill for those who grew up in Latino communities during the 
1960s and 1970s, says Treviso, who is from East Los Angeles. "All we saw in 
those days were hearses pulling into people's driveways," says Treviso, the 
holder of three Bronze Stars and a Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry from the South 
Vietnamese government. "All the kids we grew up with were coming home in 
coffins." 
</P>
<P>
The recognition issue can be highly personal for Latino veterans in the San 
Gabriel Valley. War service has become a pivotal life experience for many. 
</P>
<P>
Art Cisneros, a Hacienda Heights resident who is deputy director of Veterans In 
Community Sarvice, remembers an East Los Angeles neighbor from his World War 
II-era childhood. "I was only about 12, and Alfonso Esparza used to come home 
from Camp Pendleton," says Cisneros, a Korean War-era Air Force veteran. "I 
used to go over to his house, watch him polishing his boots, try on his hat. He 
died in Guadalcanal when I was 14. I remember the misery his family went 
through." 
</P>
<P>
For Madrigal, who grew up in crushing poverty, the military provided escape, 
self-esteem and, ultimately, disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
He still relishes telling stories about his days in the Army. "Hey, suddenly I 
had sheets most of the time," Madrigal recalls. "I didn't have to try and buy 
surplus boots at the (Civilian Conservation Corps) camp. For the first time in 
my life, I was wearing underwear." 
</P>
<P>
An exuberant, brawling young man, Madrigal fought for respect in his 9th 
Infantry Division unit, he says. "I'd look for the meanest, toughest guy 
around, and we'd have to tangle so I could establish my credentials," says 
Madrigal, who fought briefly as an Army welterweight contender. 
</P>
<P>
He came home to California briefly as a civilian after World War II. "I said to 
myself, 'I must be nuts,' " he says. "I'd been living high on the hog over in 
Europe, staying in plush hotels. I was somebody over there." So he signed up 
again, just in time for Korea. 
</P>
<P>
But the Korean War soured him on the military, he says. "There was no 
commitment to that war," he says. "We had just beaten the two best armies in 
the world. Why were these guys kicking the hell out of us?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, Madrigal was discharged and began raising a family. When his two sons 
were old enough for military service, Madrigal advised them against signing up. 
"I told them I didn't want them getting involved in these penny-ante political 
situations (with the U.S. military)," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Madrigal still tends to look at things from the worldly perspective of the 
frontline trenches. "We always caught the brunt of it," he says of the Latino 
servicemen. "We were always called upon to do our bit. But I don't think the 
government ever did its bit. The Latinos got shoved aside. That's always been 
my feeling."

On the top of a bookshelf in the office of Rabbi Earl Kaplan at Temple Beth 
Israel in Pomona sits an old Russian encyclopedia that has made a journey to 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The yellowed volume, about 70 years old, was given to Kaplan last month in 
Moscow by Norbert and Natasha Magaznik, a refusenik couple who have been trying 
to leave the Soviet Union for 15 years. The Magazniks have been repeatedly 
denied exit visas on grounds that Natasha saw a secret project in 1968 while 
working in the government patent office. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said the claim that Natasha possesses secret information is false and 
just a "trumped-up reason" to keep her from leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Magazniks gave him the book as a gesture of friendship, Kaplan said, but it 
also serves as a reminder that although thousands of Jews have been permitted 
to leave the Soviet Union this year, others are being denied visas. 
</P>
<P>
And Kaplan said it is not just the Soviet Union that is an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has also imposed barriers. This country, which had formerly 
promised to accept all Soviet citizens who won permission to leave, has 
tightened its restrictions on immigration in response to a dramatic surge in 
the number of Soviet citizens receiving exit visas. 
</P>
<P>
The United States estimates that 150,000 Soviets will be issued exit visas in 
the current fiscal year. The U.S. immigration quota for refugees from the 
Soviet Union is 50,000, although several thousand more could be admitted under 
a program granting parole status to those with family members already in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan visited Moscow, Rome and Vienna last month on a fact-finding mission to 
assess the problems facing Jews fleeing religious persecution in the Soviet 
Union. The trip was sponsored by the Pacific Assn. of Reformed Rabbis, the 
United Jewish Appeal and the Assn. for Jewish Emigrees in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan was given the assignment because of his longstanding interest in the 
issue and because of the efforts by Temple Beth Israel to help Soviet 
refuseniks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, children at the synagogue "adopted" a refusenik couple, Leonid Byaly 
and Judith Ratner-Byaly, and began sending them cards, letters and pictures on 
Jewish holidays. The Byalys had been trying to leave the Soviet Union since 
1977 but had been turned down, ostensibly because Byaly had access to state 
secrets while he was working as a radio engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the mail from the children was intercepted by Soviet postal authorities 
and never reached the Byalys. The couple learned of the waylaid correspondence 
after they left the Soviet Union as one of 26 Jewish families granted exit 
visas in December, 1987, as a good-will gesture before a summit meeting between 
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The Byalys, who now live in Israel, came to Pomona a year ago to thank the 
children of Temple Beth Israel for their encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
On his journey last month, Kaplan found the Byalys' daughter, Irini Gertzman, 
in Rome with her husband, Valery, and their 11-year-old son, Jonathan, waiting 
for permission to enter the United States. He intervened with U.S. immigration 
officials in Rome to speed approval of their entry into the United States, and 
a few days later they were on their way to begin new lives in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said there are 15,000 Soviet Jews in or near Rome waiting to enter the 
United States. Before Oct. 1, he said, Jews who had permission to leave the 
Soviet Union could get Israeli visas, fly to Vienna, exchange them for U.S. 
visas and then go to Rome to await processing for admittance to the United 
States. Since Oct. 1, Kaplan said, the United States has required Soviet Jews 
to obtain U.S. visas in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
More than 53,000 Jews have already left the Soviet Union this year for the 
West, more than at any time since World War II, Kaplan said. But many more 
would like to leave. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to 650 Jews who have been denied exit visas and are classified as 
refuseniks, Kaplan estimated that 500,000 of the 2 million Jews in the Soviet 
Union would emigrate if they could arrange a destination. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way possible that the state of Israel could absorb all the Jews 
who want to get out," Kaplan said. Thus, he said, it is important that the 
United States increase the number it will accept. But Duke Austin, a spokesman 
for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, said the United States is 
already accepting more refugees than any other nation in the world. "We take 
more refugees than the rest of the (countries) combined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the United States has long taken the position that people have a right to 
leave a country, Austin said, it has also recognized the need to limit 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said conditions that have improved in the Soviet Union but that there is 
still religious persecution not only of Jews but also of Baptists and 
Pentecostals. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said the Gertzmans, for example, were "anti-Semitically harassed. The 
young kid was beaten up by a group of nine or 10 young punks. They beat him 
bloody. They sprayed a Jewish star on him, and when the parents went to school 
officials, the school officials dismissed it as somewhat less than trivial." 
</P>
<P>
The Gertzmans managed to get out of the Soviet Union and planned to resettle in 
Chicago, where they have friends, but languished for six months in Rome while 
their refugee status was reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan took the Gertzmans with him to see the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, 
Thomas Melady. Kaplan said the ambassador was moved by the boy's story of 
persecution and asked how he could help the refugees. Kaplan said he urged 
Melady to ask President Bush to admit more refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said: "Bush thinks he will embarrass Gorbachev if too many Soviet Jews 
comes to the United States. I think they both could look terrific." 
</P>
<P>
The coming summit meeting between Bush and Gorbachev, Kaplan said, would offer 
an ideal opportunity for the leaders to "create some kind of freedom-of-choice 
time period -- three months, six months or whatever -- so that anybody who 
wants to go from East to West or West to East can do it. Then, when the time 
period is over, that's it. You've made your decision, and there are no more 
problems and no more pressure." 
</P>
<P>
But if that sort of agreement is beyond reach, Kaplan said, then President Bush 
should raise the immigration quota.

Kaplan said the United States also should be doing more to help Jews and 
members of the Bahai faith who have fled from Iran. He said he met a community 
of 500 Jews in Vienna who are living there after escaping from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi said he is maintaining contact with Ambassador Melady and Rep. David 
Dreier (R-La Verne), who heads the Republican Task Force on Foreign Policy, to 
urge them to influence Administration policies to help refugees.

PUBLISHERS SELL SPACE: TIME TRAVEL, THAT IS; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLISHING: 'IT'S A LABOR OF LOVE. THIS MAGAZINE IS FOR THE HUNDREDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO THINK OF TIME TRAVEL NOT AS FICTION, BUT AS A REAL 
POSSIBILITY,' SAYS ONE OF THE PARTNERS WHO PUT OUT TRAVELS IN TIME.

<P>
Bill Hicks wants to travel back in time and get to know the father who deserted 
him when he was 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Darrow Baker has a longer journey in mind -- back 4 billion years to 
the Precambrian Age, before life on Earth began. 
</P>
<P>
Though many believe that time travel is out of this world, neither Hicks nor 
Baker are passively waiting for scientists to come up with a device capable of 
bursting through the time barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the two San Fernando Valley residents are doing their part by 
publishing a slick newsletter every other month called Travels in Time in hopes 
that it will spur a major breakthrough in time travel. Although they also hope 
that the publication will eventually make a profit, both men acknowledge that 
they are unlikely to see a return on their $10,000 investment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a labor of love. This magazine is for the hundreds and thousands of 
people who think of time travel not as fiction, but as a real possibility," 
said Hicks, 42, a computer systems manager at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone on the East Coast -- New York for instance, could read something we 
print that someone on the West Coast has thought of, and the whole puzzle of 
time travel could be solved," said Baker, 30, who worked as a technical writer 
before establishing his own barter company. 
</P>
<P>
But even science fiction buffs, many of whom believe in the power of dreams to 
foster technological advances, are skeptical about the prospects of time 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't rule it out entirely, but let's just say I'm not ready to buy my 
ticket," said Lydia Marano, who owns Dangerous Visions, a science fiction and 
fantasy bookshop in Sherman Oaks. Marano is one of several bookstore owners in 
Los Angeles who are carrying free promotional copies of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Hicks are not fazed by such skepticism. They say they are on a quest 
to unravel the mystery of time, and to prove it, they have spent about $10,000 
so far to publish their newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"Time travel is the most important topic around," Hicks maintains. "Just look 
at all the movies and TV shows and books written about it." 
</P>
<P>
But since the first issue was published in August, only about 200 people have 
bought subscriptions, which sell for $17.50 and include a T-shirt imprinted 
"Time Traveler" and a plastic membership card identifying the holder as willing 
to hop on a time machine, should one be invented in their lifetime. Astronomer 
Carl Sagan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and TV personality, is a 
subscriber, but Hicks and Baker are sending him the newsletter for free. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Pelz, a librarian at UCLA's engineering library and a science fiction 
historian, said Travels in Time is one of about 350 "fanzines" published 
monthly in the United States. He describes fanzines as magazines published by 
one who is fanatical about some aspect of science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
But Pelz said Hicks and Baker's fanzine is unusual because they pay to have it 
printed, rather than typing it up on a home computer or typewriter and then 
photocopying it. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, the younger and more effusive of the two, said he was fascinated by time 
travel even as a small boy. Sitting in a trendy restaurant near Universal 
Studios, Baker broke into song upon request, dredging up from memory ditties 
from defunct TV shows such as "It's About Time." Patrons looked up from their 
pizzas when Baker trilled, "It's about time, it's about space, it's about 
people from a different place. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Yet both men say their venture generally has been greeted with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Oh, how original,' but I think they mean it tongue in cheek," Hicks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, on a day Baker and Hicks hope will be entered in the annals of time 
travel history, they were jogging in Griffith Park. They were talking about 
their favorite subject -- the possibility of traveling backward or forward in 
time -- when Baker proposed putting out a newsletter on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
Time has whirled by since, as the two novices set out to master the art of 
publishing, including how to send things at bulk mail rates. (All you need do 
is send 100 identical pieces to qualify, Baker said.) 
</P>
<P>
The six-page newsletter is printed on glossy paper sprinkled with time motifs 
such as drawings of clocks and hourglasses. There are articles on the physics 
of time travel, short stories, editorials and reviews of movies and TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he may run a classified ad in mainstream newspapers to find people 
who have been in comas for long periods of time. He believes they would make 
interesting subjects to interview for the newsletter because "they are time 
travelers who have stepped out of the normal flow of time." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the ultimate time traveler would be someone who was frozen and awoke 
in the future, Baker and Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Then why are they personally more interested in traveling back, rather than 
forward, in time? 
</P>
<P>
"It's human nature to think, 'What if I had done that differently?' -- to erase 
your regrets," Hicks said.

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY IS EVERYWHERE IN THE MOVIES; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: IT CAN LOOK LIKE AFRICA, LIKE VIETNAM, LIKE THE WILD FRONTIER, LIKE A 
FUTURISTIC DESERT. FOR DECADES, FILM MAKERS HAVE GONE ON LOCATION IN THE SANTA 
CLARITA VALLEY'S VARIED TERRAIN. AND THEY STILL HAVE GOOD REASONS TO DO IT 
TODAY.

A housing tract under construction in Valencia passed for a developing San 
Fernando Valley neighborhood in the late 1940s in "The Two Jakes," the sequel 
to the Academy Award-winning movie "Chinatown." 
</P>
<P>
The old Saugus train station, built in 1876 and since moved to Newhall, was 
used for a scene featuring two down-and-out travelers in "The Grifters," the 
Martin Scorsese film now in production. Magic Mountain in Valencia was a 
destination for "National Lampoon's Vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Newhall's Pico Canyon doubled as part of Africa in "The Color Purple." The 
Santa Clara River and its lush vegetation became a Vietnam jungle in 
television's "China Beach" and "Tour of Duty." Sand Canyon's luxurious ranches 
have been Northern California wine-country mansions in the nighttime soap 
"Falcon Crest." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Valley, with its varied terrain of hills, valleys and housing 
developments, is so popular as a location for film productions that it is 
sometimes jokingly called "Hollywood North" or "New Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
"I really consider this part of Hollywood," said Louis Rios, location manager 
for Newhall Land and Farming Co., which has allowed production companies to 
film on its 38,000-acre Newhall Ranch for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The valley is a kind of "mini-Hollywood," said Lisa Rawlins of the California 
Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood has brought its productions to the Santa Clarita Valley since the 
silent film era, when early cowboy stars such as Tom Mix, William S. Hart and 
Hoot Gibson were drawn there because of its Old West look. 
</P>
<P>
Today, while Los Angeles and other California cities are seeking ways to 
reverse the number of runaway film operations, the valley, without too much 
effort, remains a favorite location for feature films and television shows. 
</P>
<P>
Movie makers like the area because of its proximity to Los Angeles, the fact 
that it is not in a major aircraft flight pattern and its variety of settings. 
It is especially attractive because most of its locations are within the 
so-called studio zone, a 30-mile radius centered at La Cienega and Beverly 
boulevards. Within that area, labor costs are lower because union contracts do 
not require payment for extra travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, asked location manager Richard Davis, "Where else can you find all that 
open space?" 
</P>
<P>
For "The Grifters," he found an area reminiscent of an Arizona of the past. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Santa Clarita alone, 111 permits were issued for feature films, 
television series, commercials and student projects during the last fiscal 
year, which ended June 30, according to Jim Thornton of the Los Angeles County 
Office of Motion Picture and Television Development, which processes permits 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
No statistics are available for the entire valley, but a new Santa Clarita 
Valley Chamber of Commerce committee formed to encourage more filming in the 
area estimates that more than 1,000 locations are used there each year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were a state, we would be third in production behind California and New 
York," said Jeff Morton, committee chairman. "That 1,000 figure doesn't tell 
you how many days they were filming." 
</P>
<P>
Morton is manager of Valencia Studios, one of two that opened in the Santa 
Clarita Valley about three years ago that have attracted more budget-minded 
producers to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia Studios, owned by David Witt and Robert Thompson, has four buildings 
and 125,000 square feet of production space. Sets can be built to specification 
in its converted warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Our studio is a converted warehouse with 17 stages either built or under 
construction," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey Studios, also in the Valencia Industrial Center, is owned by former 
location manager John Warren and offers half a dozen constructed sets, 
including a 1950s diner, hospital interiors, a morgue, a jail and a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
A third studio, Santa Clarita Studios, is under construction by Herman B. 
David, studio manager of 20th Century Fox from 1982 to 1987, at an estimated 
cost of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry needs a quiet place away from traffic and aircraft noise," David 
said. "The location has lots of advantages. Costs are lower, there's parking, 
it's convenient." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber committee estimated that filming brings in between $30 million and 
$40 million a year in sales to valley businesses, such as lumber companies, 
restaurants, hotels and caterers, and it wants to encourage even more business. 
</P>
<P>
Companies filming on location spend an average of $26,222 a day locally, 
according to a committee survey. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which includes representatives of local movie ranches and other 
filming locations, such as Magic Mountain and CalArts, has photographed 
possible film locations to show to location managers. 
</P>
<P>
It also has joined FLICS (Film Liaisons in California Statewide), a part of the 
California Film Commission, and is printing a brochure that will be mailed by 
the commission to about 1,400 location managers and others in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we'll do our own mailing, which will include a services 
directory," said Cheryl Adams, a chamber employee who has been serving as the 
committee's liaison to the industry. "We want film companies to know they can 
get a lot of what they want right here. They don't have to bring a caterer from 
Beverly Hills. If they need extra lumber, they can buy it right here." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said a committee goal is to find a way of funding a full-time liaison for 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"You need somebody there to plan ahead for potential problems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will propose that the city of Santa Clarita fund the liaison, at 
least in part, early next year, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
As temporary liaison, Adams said, she often is asked by filmmakers to find 
specific items. 
</P>
<P>
"Most recently, we had a call for a mare with a foal," she said. "Well, it 
wasn't the season for foals. But we called around and we found a couple." 
</P>
<P>
The California Film Commission's Rawlins said Santa Clarita is growing rapidly 
as a production area. She commended the chamber committee for its work, saying, 
"I've never seen a group get so much accomplished so fast." 
</P>
<P>
A recent commission study found that California is losing $3 billion a year to 
other states, especially to Florida and Texas, Rawlins said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to reverse the number of productions leaving the state," she 
said. "Santa Clarita is one of the ways California can remain competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new studios, the Newhall Ranch remains the valley's most popular 
film location. "Tour of Duty" and "China Beach" are filming there almost side 
by side on an area called the "turkey ranch." 
</P>
<P>
Rios said the company maintains several permanent sets, including a moving 
train and a railroad track, a Western-style barn, an Asian village and a 
motorcycle park. On the ranch, there also are two airstrips, riverbeds, swamps, 
ponds, a lake, livestock, oil wells, forests and a military base. 
</P>
<P>
"Our file on the Newhall Ranch is as thick as the Sears, Roebuck catalogue," 
said one film location scout. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been pretty busy lately because we've seen an increase in 
action-adventure films," Rios said. "We're also getting more commercial work. 
We've kind of cornered an HBO series called 'War Stories.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rios noted that the area has a rich history with the movies. The Santa Clarita 
Valley Historical Society honored that association with its 1990 calendar, 
which features movie location scenes. One from "The Lost Planet," made in 1952, 
shows a group of robots with two military officers at Vasquez Rocks in Agua 
Dulce, Los Angeles County's second most popular filming site. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Valley and particularly the town of Newhall "helped shape the 
celluloid image of the American Western," wrote Santa Clarita Councilwoman 
JoAnne Darcy in an essay about film making in the valley. Darcy, who also 
serves as executive director for Newhall's Western Walk of Fame, is a local 
history buff. 
</P>
<P>
"Broncho Billy's Christmas Dinner," a 1911 release featuring Newhall resident 
Gilbert (Broncho Billy) Anderson, was the community's introduction to the 
silver screen, according to Darcy. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mix built the first studio in the community about 1918 and named it 
Mixville. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Hickson relocated the Western-style sets of Monogram Pictures from 
Hollywood to Placeritos Canyon Ranch in 1930. Cowboy great Gene Autry bought 
the site in 1952, renamed it Melody Ranch and filmed his television series 
there. Most of the ranch was destroyed by a brush fire in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, Walt Disney purchased the Golden Oak Ranch on Placerita Canyon Road in 
Newhall. Many Disney films were made there. The ranch, which still remains, was 
transformed into the small town of Henning, Tenn., for Alex Haley's miniseries, 
"Roots."

SWEATSHOPS EXPANDING INTO ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
GARMENT TRADE: L.A. NO LONGER HAS A MONOPOLY ON LOW WAGES AND THIRD WORLD 
CONDITIONS FOR IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They have survived war, prison, famine, terrifying voyages across 
pirate-infested seas and long stints in refugee camps. Now, in the land of 
their dreams, thousands of Vietnamese immigrants spend long days hunched over 
sewing machines in sweatshops in suburban Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Some earn as little as $1 an hour. Most are glad to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Beside them toil Latino immigrants who have fled impoverished homelands for 
prosperous Southern California, only to land Third World-style jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
At least 400 sewing shops have sprung up in and around Orange County's Little 
Saigon, employing upward of 5,000 immigrants. In fact, the majority of the shop 
owners are themselves former boat people who have been in this country less 
than five years. 
</P>
<P>
These suburban sweatshops are tucked into clean new industrial buildings, just 
out of sight of their affluent neighbors, and out of mind of the consumers who 
buy their products in some of the nation's priciest department stores. Seeing 
"Made in USA" labels, most shoppers are utterly unaware that some of these 
garments have been made by immigrants and refugees -- sometimes children -- 
working long hours for a fraction of the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just money but a certain resignation to hardship that keeps these 
immigrants at their sewing machines. Ngoc Pha Nguyen, 46, has worked at several 
sewing shops that cheated and underpaid her. Now she earns $4.25 an hour, the 
California minimum wage. She is deeply grateful. 
</P>
<P>
It took Nguyen four attempts to escape from Vietnam. Two of her daughters and 
14 other family members didn't make it. "I'm very sad, so when I get to work, I 
forget about it for a while," she said through an interpreter. "If I stay home, 
I look at the family shrine and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen bends over to stitch the flounces on party dresses -- a tedious task 
performed over and over under hot lights in a crowded, airless garage. The 
truth is, she hates to sew. But, she says, she can't find a better job. 
</P>
<P>
The shop where Nguyen works is paid $6.75 for each dress she stitches. 
Identical dresses with the same labels were selling at a South Coast Plaza 
department store for $64 each. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are really making the big money are the retailers and the 
financiers of the retailers, and some of the manufacturers," said Edna 
Bonacich, a UC Riverside sociology professor studying Asians in the California 
garment industry. "The workers are totally exploited." 
</P>
<P>
Once a backwater in the $6-billion-a-year Los Angeles-area garment industry, 
Orange County now produces everything from junior knits to inexpensive evening 
wear. But it is a transformation that comes with a price tag of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities warn that these new suburban sweatshop workers -- particularly in 
Orange County but also in immigrant strongholds throughout Southern California 
-- are becoming the latest victims of an industry that has been nourished by 
cheap immigrant labor for nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
Far from the downtown Los Angeles garment district, where enforcement officials 
know the turf, offenders are hard to catch. And federal and state labor 
officials say that when they do find them, enforcement is often stymied by the 
same dynamics that have kept sweatshops in business for more than a century. 
Owners insist they'll go bankrupt if they pay the minimum wage. Workers won't 
complain no matter how bad their treatment because they are undocumented 
aliens, are receiving public assistance or are simply afraid. And manufacturers 
have few incentives to investigate the conditions under which their products 
are made. 
</P>
<P>
Suburban Sweatshops 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, Orange County sweatshops bear little resemblance to the ones 
found in dilapidated buildings in teeming garment districts in downtown Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Most are in brand-new complexes of light-industrial buildings that tend to be 
located just behind the restaurants and mini-malls that line the thoroughfares 
connecting Garden Grove, Westminster and Santa Ana, where about 100,000 
Vietnamese-Americans have settled since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweatshops flourish wherever you have pockets of immigrants," said Allen J. 
Scott, professor of urban and economic geography at UCLA. "It's not just 
happening in Orange County, it's happening in the San Fernando Valley and in 
Long Beach. . . . And there's a big new Korean community growing up around Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"What has been happening recently is a decentralization in all directions out 
from the garment district, not only to tap . . immigrant populations but also 
to take advantage of the cheaper land," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Scott studied garment subcontractors and found that nearly all were 
located in downtown Los Angeles. He found only two in Orange County. Last 
spring, Bonacich analyzed the ethnic makeup of the state's 4,589 registered 
garment contractors and found 172 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of 102 of them were Vietnamese. One was Chinese, 11 Latino and 10 
Korean; 24 were owned by other Asians whose national origin was unclear, and 
the rest were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Including the 20% to 30% of shops that are unregistered and the scores of 
mini-sweatshops hidden inside single-family homes and garages, Bonacich 
estimates Orange County now has at least 400 sewing shops. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't run into a single Vietnamese who's been in business here for more 
than two years, so this seems like a brand-new business for Orange County," 
said Rolene Otero, director of enforcement for the U.S. Department of Labor's 
Wage and Hour Division in Santa Ana. "In the last two years, it's just 
exploded." 
</P>
<P>
But while wages and working conditions in Los Angeles have on the whole 
improved thanks to heavy enforcement, officials said, labor abuses in Orange 
County are widespread. 
</P>
<P>
A recent crackdown spearheaded by Otero found 18 Orange County sweatshops that 
had been violating minimum wage, overtime and child labor laws -- including the 
shop that employed Ngoc Pha Nguyen, according to documents obtained by the Los 
Angeles Times under the Freedom of Information Act. So far, the shops have been 
ordered to repay more than $180,000 to at least 220 workers, and some cases are 
still pending, Otero said. 
</P>
<P>
"The extremely low wages across the board in Orange County are not the case in 
Los Angeles," Otero said. "In L.A. you will find $10-an-hour employees. In 
Orange County, we have yet to find a single employee paid any more than the 
minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
The suburbanization of sweatshops is an outgrowth of the changes that are 
reshaping the garment industry, scholars and officials said. First, foreign 
competition has driven down prices in the domestic sewing industry. But at the 
same time, manufacturers need flexible production capability because rush 
orders for more of a hot-selling item cannot be filled fast enough overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The solution -- especially in inexpensive clothing, women's and junior wear, 
where fashions change overnight and quality is often second to price and timing 
-- is to subcontract the sewing. This enables manufacturers quickly to shift 
their designs and output to ride out the treacherous market tides -- while 
largely escaping legal responsibility for any labor abuses committed by the 
companies that sew for them, officials and garment-industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've created a Third World labor force here to match the Third World labor 
force with which they're competing abroad," Bonacich said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all need work, and we take anything we can get," said one Vietnamese shop 
owner, who said she cannot possibly pay her workers the minimum wage because 
the price she gets for finished garments is so low. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Police 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that labor police have never succeeded in crushing sweatshops in the 
past and are unlikely to do so now because the market demands them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you really tried to enforce immigration and other laws about working 
conditions, in both the garment industry and the electronics industry in 
Southern California, the effect on the economy would be disastrous," Scott 
said. "So the enforcement is symbolic more than it is systematic." 
</P>
<P>
In a typical suburban sweatshop, fluorescent lights beat down on rows of sewing 
machines. Heaps of pre-cut fabric spill out of plastic bags onto cement floors 
littered with scraps of cloth, threads and cigarette butts. Remnants of meals 
linger in odd corners, and the air smells sour. 
</P>
<P>
In many shops owned by Asians, the office decor includes a red-and-gold 
lacquered shrine with an incense holder and a porcelain statue of Than Tai, the 
Vietnamese god of money. Perhaps no less symbolic are the time clocks and 
posters nearby that detail, in English, the California minimum wage and 
overtime laws. They pacify the authorities, but few of the workers can read, 
write or speak English. And the time cards are rarely used to determine wages, 
because most workers are paid by the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Labor abuses exist in part because both shop owners and the workers themselves 
are participants in a vast underground economy. Authorities say the sweatshops 
prey on two particularly vulnerable groups: illegal Latino aliens and Southeast 
Asian refugees who work illegally and collect welfare at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"My former boss used to pay us 10 cents a piece for ironing," said Maria del 
Pilar Solano, 23, a sweatshop worker who has since applied for immigration 
amnesty and is not receiving public assistance. "We would work from 7 a.m. to 8 
p.m. We got $8 or $9 a day, sometimes $4 or $5. At the end of the week we would 
add it up and we would get only $50 a week. The owner used to say it was a lot 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
And to Solano, it was a lot of money. In Mexico, where she worked as a knitter, 
she earned $12 every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Federal inspectors raided the shop where Solano worked and found that it had 
been paying less than the minimum wage and had illegally employed 12 home 
workers, federal documents show. The garments Solano and her colleagues made 
were sold to Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores, documents show. 
Solano said the shop has since changed hands and is now paying $4.25 an hour. 
Even some of the immigrants who have working papers accept between $1 and $3 an 
hour because they have no skills, speak no English and are often desperate to 
earn money to send home, authorities and Vietnamese community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam for $10, one person can live for a month," said Ly (Louis) Cao of 
Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. in Santa Ana, which provides 
retraining for scores of refugees who are in the garment industry but want 
better jobs. "Ninety-nine percent send money home." 
</P>
<P>
Some also are willing to stay in the sweatshops or stitch at home in secret for 
a fraction of the minimum wage because they are collecting welfare, housing 
subsidies or food stamps, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of sweatshops, where wages are paid in cash, and records, where 
they exist, are sketchy, it is tricky to identify the true victims, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietor of one floundering shop in the Euclid Business Center in Garden 
Grove, $3,000 behind on his rent, stunned his landlord by coming in to pay the 
entire sum in $5 bills. And state welfare fraud inspectors tell of refugees 
who, by putting every family member to work, continuing to collect benefits, 
living three families to a house, and scrimping for years, have managed to buy 
$200,000 homes or businesses of their own -- again, all purchased in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Beds and Bassinets 
</P>
<P>
Even deeper in the shadows are the uncounted workers who assemble garments 
illegally in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will not even guess at how many there are, but the practice of home 
sewing both by families and by sweatshop workers who take work home with them 
after hours is certainly widespread. Nine of the 18 sweatshops cited by Otero 
were employing such illegal home workers. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Lam, who runs a sewing machine shop in Garden Grove, estimates that he 
sells about 20 industrial machines a month to Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, 
Korean and Mexican families who tell him they plan to sew at home. And Lam has 
three competitors in Orange County alone. 
</P>
<P>
The first authorities to notice the burgeoning home sewing industry were Orange 
County welfare fraud inspectors sent to check out tips that some of the 
county's 22,000 refugees who receive public assistance were working on the sly. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go to (their) houses to do welfare fraud investigations, 70% to 80% of 
the time we find sewing machines," said Van Nguyen, a welfare fraud 
investigator for the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Labor Commissioner Craig Cubberly began accompanying Nguyen and 
her partner on their monthly rounds to search out labor violations. From June, 
1987, through September, 1989, they raided 66 businesses and 21 homes where 
welfare violations were suspected. Cubberly issued 85 labor citations assessing 
nearly $45,000 in fines -- including 13 child labor violations involving 
children ages 13 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
At one home in Westminster, they confiscated 757 knit cardigan sweaters, in 
various stages of completion -- enough to fill six large plastic trash bags, 
Nguyen said. The homeowner, who was collecting welfare, "says he's the only one 
working, making $120 a month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, state officials seized 5,022 garments, which were donated to 
charity, Cubberly said. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women who sew in such homes -- and their children -- risk inhaling dust 
and fibers from the heaps of cut fabric in poorly ventilated spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we're going to see tuberculosis, respiratory problems," Otero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the garments seized in homes or found in factories paying less than the 
minimum wage bear the label of major manufacturers. When called for comment, 
several said they had given cut pieces to reputable, state-registered 
contractors to be sewn. Each one vehemently denied any direct or indirect 
knowledge of the sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Wolk, controller of Oops of California, a women's and children's dress 
manufacturer with annual sales of $20 million, said he had no idea that his 
goods had been confiscated by state inspectors after they were discovered in a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of that. They never talked to me," Wolk said. "As far as I know, 
we only deal with reputable contractors. What the contractors do, I have no 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
When such operations are discovered, illegal aliens are reported to the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and welfare frauds are referred to the 
district attorney's office for prosecution, officials said. The sweatshop 
owners are fined for each state labor violation and usually are forced to 
compensate the manufacturer for the cost of the confiscated garments. But, 
state officials said, manufacturers are almost never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to catch the manufacturer in the house with the garments and the 
machines," said John B. Carter, senior deputy labor commissioner for the state 
Division of Labor Enforcement in Santa Ana. "It's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LABOR LAWS 
</P>
<P>
 These are the state and federal labor laws that apply to garment workers: 
</P>
<P>
 Minimum Wage: President Bush recently signed legislation to raise the federal 
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by 1991, but that move will not affect 
California, where the state-mandated minimum wage is already $4.25 per hour. 
Trainees with no experience may be paid $3.60 an hour for up to 160 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Overtime: Garment workers, like other non-salaried employees, must be paid 
time-and-a-half if they work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Home Sewing: Sewing commercially at home is a misdemeanor under California law. 
The state law supersedes federal law, which allows some types of home work but 
prohibits sewing women's garments at home. 
</P>
<P>
Registration: Under the Montoya Act, all garment contractors must register with 
the state and pass a licensing exam that covers all applicable laws. The 1981 
law also requires shops to keep wage and hour records. 
</P>
<P>
Child Labor: Children under 12 may not work. Children ages 12 to 14 may not 
work on school days. All those under 18 must have a permit from their school 
districts, and in any case may not work more than 36 hours per week.

PLANE FERRYING MISSILES CRASHES IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER and RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PIEDRA PACHA, El Salvador 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Cessna 310 airplane crashed Saturday in a Salvadoran soybean field with 25 
anti-aircraft missiles that U.S. and Salvadoran officials said were sent from 
Nicaragua for Salvadoran guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the wreckage is proof that Nicaragua's Sandinista government 
is arming leftist rebels who launched a major military offensive this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran military flew journalists to the crash site. They spoke to a 
farmer who corroborated the government story, but they were given little time 
there and interviewed no other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega denied that his government sent the weapons, 
and a rebel spokeswoman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are bored with these accusations," Ortega told reporters in Tipitapa, 
Nicaragua. "They are false accusations." 
</P>
<P>
A delivery of missiles to the guerrillas would dramaticly alter the balance of 
forces in the decade-old war. Since 1984, the U.S.-supplied Salvadoran air 
force has been the key to the government's success in preventing a rebel 
victory. The rebels have never used sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Air force attacks allowed the military to retake the initiative in the urban 
offensive that the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels launched 
Nov. 11 in San Salvador and the eastern provincial capital of San Miguel. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have damaged 12 army helicopters during the fighting, but 
brought down only one aircraft, an A-37 Dragonfly bomber. It was shot down with 
a heavy machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two reporters in a low-flying helicopter approaching the scene of 
the Cessna crash were wounded by a burst of gunfire, apparently from a rebel 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Both were rushed back to San Salvador. Hugo Burgos, 28, a Salvadoran cameraman 
for Cable News Network, underwent surgery to remove a bullet from his side. 
Alfredo Hernandez Lopez, 31, a Mexican radio reporter, was hospitalized with a 
shoulder wound. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who reached the crash scene were shown 24 Soviet-Bloc SAM-7 missiles, 
one U.S.-made Redeye missile and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador William Walker said the introduction of the heat-seeking 
missiles was "definitely an escalation" of the war. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts to rest the claim that no one from outside has been putting weapons in 
here," he said. "It is some outside supplier who has a lot of SAM-7 missiles 
and the willingness to introduce them." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Salvadoran officials have made frequent allegations of Nicaraguan and 
Cuban aid to the FMLN. The charges were the original justification for the 
Ronald Reagan Administration's support of right-wing Contras in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations, and the official Sandinista and Cuban denials, have always 
been difficult to prove. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration revived the issue early this year after rebels in El 
Salvador were seen with Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifles, the most common 
weapon of the Sandinista army. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Central America believe many of the rifles probably came from the 
Sandinistas. But they also note that fighters abandoning the Contra army's 
camps in Honduras have been selling their U.S.-supplied AK-47s on the black 
market in recent months; some might have ended up with the FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster their allegations, the Salvadoran army showed off in May nearly 300 
AK-47s and thousands of rounds of ammunition they found in a lumber yard in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's display of the downed plane recalled a headline-making propaganda 
coup during the last major rebel offensive in January, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran and U.S. governments said then that 100 guerrillas in five boats 
had landed from Nicaragua on a Salvadoran beach with Soviet- and Chinese-made 
weapons. Later investigation by journalists and American officials found the 
"landing" to be a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran officials said Saturday that the Cessna flight originated in 
Managua. They showed reporters a blank leasing bill from the Nicaraguan air 
taxi service, SETA; maps of Central America and El Salvador, and a piece of 
cardboard with a handwritten flight plan in code. 
</P>
<P>
About 5:30 a.m., the white, twin-engine Cessna apparently ran out of gasoline, 
sputtered and crashed in this farming village in San Miguel province, about 75 
miles southeast of San Salvador, according to officials and Freddy de Jesus 
Garay, a 22-year-old farmer at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft appeared to have been flying east to west. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of four Latin men lay next to the crumpled aircraft, three of them 
in military fatigues. Officials and the farmer said the bodies had been pulled 
out of the plane. Two died immediately, one died later of his injuries and a 
fourth shot himself in the head, Garay said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he saw soldiers pull the weapons out of the back of the plane. In 
addition to the shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, the shipment included 
21 82-millimeter mortars, a 75-millimeter recoilless rifle and three boxes of 
boosters for the missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons appeared to be relatively unscathed, although the U.S. official 
pointed out a broken heat-seeking sensor on one of the missiles. The back of 
the plane, where the weapons would have been stored, was relatively intact 
after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the army's 6th Infantry Brigade showed reporters a cardboard set 
of handwritten instructions for using the missiles: "Height of destruction of 
object, 2,300 meters. . . . Maximum range of destruction, 4,200 meters. . . . 
Velocity of the target for destruction, begins 950 kilometers. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The United States has supplied SAM-7 and Redeye missiles to the Nicaraguan 
Contras, and both types of missiles have been captured by the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1986, Sandinista soldiers shot down a secret U.S. supply flight 
from El Salvador to the Contras in southern Nicaragua. One of the American 
pilots, Eugene Hasenfus, survived, and the incident helped to expose the 
illegal Contra aid network of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said of Saturday's crash here: "This is sort of a reverse Hasenfus." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the scene pointed out a 9-millimeter Browning pistol that they 
said the suicide victim used to shoot himself in the temple after crawling out 
of the Cessna's wreckage. The words "Nicaragua National Guard" were engraved on 
the gun. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan National Guard was the army of dictator Anastasio Somoza, who 
was ousted by the Sandinista guerrillas in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The four dead men allegedly carried no identification, but a Salvadoran army 
major showed reporters a color instant photograph of a woman with the 
handwritten inscription, "Berta, with love for my beloved Williams . . . 
Encampment 26th of July, Havana." 
</P>
<P>
The map of El Salvador was marked with two yellow dots, apparently drop-off 
points. One was Piedra Pacha and the other was Amatecampo, south of 
Zacatecoluca in La Paz province. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Carlos Armando Aviles, head of psychological operations for the Salvadoran 
armed forces, said the army had "unconfirmed reports" that a second aircraft 
burned in La Paz province. He said peasants reportedly saw weapons and boxes of 
ammunition being unloaded from the aircraft before it caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
There was no confirmation of that report. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Salvadoran officials at the San Miguel crash site said they assume the 
rebels have received other missile shipments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big threat," said Lt. Col. Luis Mariano Turcios of the Atlacatl 
Battalion. "We will have to reanalyze the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Miller reported from Piedra Pacha and Richard Boudreaux from San 
Salvador. Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson also contributed to this story.

THE REV. LOUIS SHELDON IS PART FIERY PREACHER, PART COOL-HEADED LOBBYIST.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At stake was the way public schoolchildren would be taught the origins of life, 
and lobbyist Louis P. Sheldon was playing the game of secular politics at the 
furious pace that has made him both feared and revered. 
</P>
<P>
With a dogged diligence, he grabbed a front-row seat at a recent State Board of 
Education meeting and set out to work the crowd. State educators on a 
first-name basis with "Reverend Lou" got a quick lesson on the "danger" of 
teaching evolution as dogma. Newcomers to the debate got his Anaheim business 
card. Media crews got quick and quotable "sound bites." 
</P>
<P>
God got nary a mention. 
</P>
<P>
But a few hours later, fresh off a chartered flight to Ventura, Sheldon the 
lobbyist became Sheldon the visiting preacher. Gone was the cool Capitol tone 
as Sheldon quoted the Book of Chronicles in fiery indignation, urging 
churchgoers to stand up and shout against homosexuality, abortion and other 
modern-day "evils." 
</P>
<P>
At once preacher and political player, the scrappy, 55-year-old Anaheim 
resident has parlayed this ability to adapt his message to fit his varying 
audiences -- to temper tone and style at a hallelujah's notice -- into a 
growing visibility around the state as a self-proclaimed spokesman for the 
religious right. 
</P>
<P>
Today, riding a crest of national publicity from three startling election 
victories by opponents of gay rights in California, Sheldon is basking in a new 
prominence that seems to assure that he can no longer be dismissed by his 
detractors as merely an Orange County religious gadfly. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon's roles have been many over the last three decades: small-town Midwest 
pastor; alienated rabble-rouser in the mainline Presbyterian church; North 
Dakota congressional aide and Delaware gubernatorial campaign worker; Christian 
educator and aide to televangelist Pat Robertson; would-be businessman, and 
failed investor. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheldon now seems to have found his most influential niche, much to the 
chagrin of a growing chorus of critics who say that his power may be more 
illusion than reality. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon's assertion of "representing" about 6,500 churches and thousands of 
other individuals in the state's religious community may well be exaggerated, 
according to interviews with both religious allies and opponents. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, may be the role he contends he played in conservative-religious 
victories, such as those over gay rights advocates at the polls on Nov. 7 in 
Irvine, San Francisco and Concord. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even his staunchest critics acknowledge that, if success as a lobbyist 
means staking out a spot in the public eye, gaining access to people with power 
and creating at least the appearance of influence, Sheldon is nothing if not 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a man who does a tremendous job of spreading hatred and fear to 
further his own career," said Leonard Graff of the San Francisco-based National 
Gay Rights Advocates. "He's very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon says he has no aspirations to seeking elected office or even a formal 
position in the religious Establishment, saying that such a career route would 
be too stifling for the opinionated minister. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not me, I don't think," Sheldon says. "I'd have to become more cautious, 
more diplomatic." No, the role of free-agent lobbyist for God is "my calling," 
says the bespectacled man in the oft-rumpled suit who rushes through Sacramento 
crosswalks with a loaded briefcase caddy in tow. 
</P>
<P>
Among the targets of Sheldon's wrath are homosexuals, whom he contends are 
attacking the "heterosexual ethic" by imposing their "chosen life style" on 
others; "anti-religious" public educators, who he says corrupt young people, 
contradict the Bible and promote promiscuity; pro-choice "murderers," and 
"sleaze" pornographers and immoral gamblers who he says tear away at the fiber 
of society. 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic Success 
</P>
<P>
In city halls and election campaigns from San Francisco to Santa Ana and from 
Riverside to Irvine, Sheldon has lashed out with sporadic success against these 
perceived threats and others, all in the name of God and in his own small, 
7-year-old nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
But myriad critics, fearing the potential statewide clout of Sheldon and his 
Traditional Values Coalition of Anaheim, question whether Sheldon represents 
anything but himself. 
</P>
<P>
"A media creation," some say of the man who just last week was described in a 
USA Today profile as "a prophet" and a "California Falwell." 
</P>
<P>
A savvy strategist, others suggest, with a sharp sense of timing and a mastery 
of the media, but with no real constituency or broad financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as the evangelist has reached new heights of exposure, opponents have 
in turn stepped up their charges of deception, misrepresentation and bigotry 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Said state school Supt. Bill Honig: "He takes the most volatile and extreme 
issues and uses them to arouse people's emotions. And until very recently, I 
think he's pulled the wool over a lot of people's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
It is the public persona of Lou Sheldon that grates on critics such as Honig 
and Graff, the singular and unwavering image of a fervent Bible-thumper, a 
modern-day Billy Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But the private Sheldon offers a more enigmatic portrait. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in 1934 in Washington, D.C., to a Protestant father and an Orthodox 
Jewish mother. But he shunned religion until age 16, he says, when he became a 
"born-again" Christian, persuaded to go to church by a local wino who told him: 
" 'What you need is some old-fashioned religion.' " 
</P>
<P>
He is an ordained minister trained at Princeton Theological Seminary. But he 
has intermittently moved in and out of politics over the last three decades and 
now, by his own choosing, has no congregation of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Lives Modestly 
</P>
<P>
He appears to wield power and prestige in Sacramento. But, in an age when some 
high-profile religious figures have struck it rich and staked out empires, he 
has a staff of just 10 paid and volunteer employees, including his 99-year-old 
mother-in-law, his wife, Beverly, and one of his four children. And he lives 
modestly in an older, two-story Anaheim house on a reported $21,000 annual 
income, driving a 1984 Pontiac and staying with friends or relatives during his 
frequent lobbying trips to the capital. 
</P>
<P>
He professes "no interest in wins and losses." But he nonetheless claims credit 
that even some allies say he doesn't fully deserve, and he readily lists his 
"coalition's accomplishments" in his literature. 
</P>
<P>
Among the legislation he says he has influenced: a measure clarifying child 
abuse laws to say that parents can spank a child as a means of discipline; 
another encouraging that sexual abstinence be included in school curricula; one 
strengthening the criminal definitions of obscenity and pornography, and Gov. 
Deukmejian's veto of a bill that would have provided school-based pregnancy 
testing, abortion referrals and contraceptives to students. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon's scorn has been vented most fiercely of late against homosexuality, an 
issue that he says will soon surpass abortion as the most pressing moral battle 
for the religious community. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring "open warfare," he says homosexuality is an immoral but chosen and 
curable illness, like alcoholism or drug abuse. He accuses gays of trying to 
subvert the "heterosexual ethic" by flaunting their "promiscuity," by promoting 
homosexuality in the schools through gay counseling programs, and by seeking 
"special rights" under the law. And he suggests that AIDS victims be segregated 
in "cities of refuge" for the good of themselves and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a gay basher," Sheldon insists. "I'm not homophobic. I feel sorry for 
a guy who can't lay with a woman." And he answers the mocking charges from gay 
activists who say his seeming obsession with their lives must mean that he is a 
latent homosexual: "I know what gets my juices going. I know what turns me on. 
I know my sexual identity." 
</P>
<P>
Public Tactics 
</P>
<P>
The public tactics Sheldon uses to make his points are often explosive. 
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the city of Santa Ana withdraw permits for this fall's Gay 
Pride Festival at a public park and, when they refused, published their home 
addresses and helped mount an ongoing recall campaign against City Council 
members who defied him. 
</P>
<P>
And through his emotional newsletters, he has been able on occasion to muster 
hundreds of outraged protesters at public meetings and avalanches of letters to 
government officials -- enough a few years ago, for example, to help bury a 
proposal by the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission making religious 
institutions subject to certain anti-discrimination hiring measures. 
</P>
<P>
"He made the commission very aware, very quickly, that a large number of people 
were against (the proposal), and that certainly had something to do with it 
being killed," recalled Steven Owyang, an aide to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The response from critics has been swift and similarly forceful. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon's Anaheim home has been picketed. He has been spat at, encircled by a 
chain of counterprotesters at the Gay Pride Festival in Santa Ana, and burned 
in effigy. He is Public Enemy No. 1 in California among a host of civil rights 
and liberal-oriented interest groups that accuse him of religious hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheldon appears unfazed, saying that even negative exposure is better than 
none at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I just make sure they spell my name right," he said. "I don't care what other 
people say. I'm no paper tiger. . . . I am representing people who want to save 
the Judeo-Christian ethic. It's a way of life that's at stake here." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), an ally, says that "Lou Sheldon is in 
the forefront of a political struggle to say that the First Amendment does not 
guarantee freedom from religion, but freedom of religion." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon's organization is small by Sacramento lobbying standards, but its 
financial course parallels his recent growth in exposure: Donations to his 
Anaheim coalition and his other nonprofit creation, the American Liberties 
Institute, are up 154% since 1985 to about $286,000 last year, state records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Early Support 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon credits retired food company executive Herbert B. Leo, an Orange County 
civic booster sometimes called "Mr. Anaheim," with early organizational and 
financial support. Over the last five years, Leo has given Sheldon more than 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Leo serves as chairman of the board of both the Traditional Values Coalition 
and the American Liberties Institute, and says he stays in almost daily contact 
with Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand upon the shoulders of Herb Leo," Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for Herb Leo," Beverly Sheldon agrees, "God might have done it 
another way." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon and Leo also sought to use their mutual interest in religious issues to 
turn a profit in 1983, but that proved a flop. Both men invested in a a 
"Christian" financial institution called the New City Bank of Orange, set up to 
give loans to churches. But after some non-church loans went bad, the bank 
failed. Leo says he lost about $750,000 and Sheldon lost $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few years earlier, Sheldon had lost more than $40,000 on a failed 
housing redevelopment and resale project in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
His coalition, however, shows no signs of ill health. Beyond the recent 
financial growth of his organization, further testimony to Sheldon's appearance 
of influence is that several Southland politicians contacted for this article 
declined to talk about him for fear of a political backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already survived this guy," said one elected official in Orange County 
who tangled with Sheldon recently. "He's gone for now." 
</P>
<P>
Said state Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale), a Sheldon ally who has worked with 
him to pass a law encouraging student abstinence: "Sure, he's written off by 
some people as a preachy, goody-two-shoes person, and he ruffles a lot of 
feathers. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he represents a legitimate constituency. And he's a tireless 
worker and gets the job done probably more effectively than anyone else on our 
side of these traditional issues." 
</P>
<P>
One key to Sheldon's success has been his mastery of a bit of advice given to 
him in his days as a self-described political "greenhorn." 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1985, the forum a state Assembly committee hearing on an 
ultimately unsuccessful bill that would have outlawed workplace bias against 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon had just finished testifying against the bill -- railing in fiery 
rhetoric on the sin of homosexuality and the scourge of AIDS -- when he was 
cornered by liberal panel member Rep. Dick Floyd (D-Carson). 
</P>
<P>
"Don't tell us what the Bible says -- we don't want to hear about that," the 
Democratic assemblyman told Sheldon sternly. "Tell us about public policy." 
</P>
<P>
A Lesson Learned 
</P>
<P>
The message hit home. By his own acknowledgement, Sheldon can still be as 
abrasive and outspoken as ever -- the same person who caused a stir back in 
high school when he tried to start a Bible class; who did the same in North 
Dakota in the 1960s when he started a governor's prayer breakfast, and who left 
the mainline United Presbyterian Church in 1980 over disagreement about his 
outspoken style. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the kind of person who can go into a room and sit quietly," Sheldon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But increasingly over the years, Sheldon has learned to shape his pitch to fit 
the audience, offering more subdued political input to legislators, quotable 
commentary to the media and old-time preaching to his religious audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes him effective," suggests state Board of Education member Joe Stein, 
a frequent target of Sheldon's lobbying, "is what makes any salesperson 
effective -- he's keeping at you aggressively with a definite message, he seems 
to have some backing, and he's very visible." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, assert that Sheldon's effectiveness is largely an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism comes not just from such traditional opponents as pro-choice and 
gay rights activists, but also from conservative religious figures. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Burchett, a Sacramento pastor and a leader of the California branch of 
the National Assn. of Evangelicals, said: "You have to honor the guy for his 
energy, but he just doesn't have the bona fide organization or the support that 
he claims. He's ego-motivated -- it's a hype approach that he puts in high 
gear." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon refuses to identify the 6,500 churches that he says his coalition 
represents. But he acknowledged that many of those he counts as supporters may 
only be receiving his newsletter free of cost, without giving money or taking 
an active role in the Traditional Values Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes it sound like he's speaking for all of us (on the 
conservative-religious right)," said Leslie Dutton, head of the Santa 
Monica-based California Pro-Family Coalition, a Santa Monica group that opposes 
homosexuality and pornography, "and that's simply erroneous." 
</P>
<P>
"The way he does business is to wait for a movement to get started, run along 
with it and pop up and take credit," Dutton charged. "He's out for the 
headlines." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sheldon's high visibility in part got him headlines around the country 
earlier this month for having led pressure from the religious right against the 
state Board of Education, prompting the board to tone down language in a 
curriculum statement that was seen as hostile to the teaching of creationism. 
</P>
<P>
"Censorship." "First Amendment rights." "Freedom and flexibility." Sheldon 
pushed the phrases over and over before the television cameras, in lobbying 
sessions and instant mailers during several days of debate over the state's 
position on the teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
And he again demonstrated his media know-how when it came time to assess the 
impact of this month's three electoral defeats of gay rights causes around 
California. 
</P>
<P>
After Irvine residents voted in November to repeal the city's 15-month-old ban 
on discrimination against gays, Sheldon -- despite having no official role in 
the campaign, moved quickly. He wanted to set up a press conference to hail the 
victory over "special rights" for a "chosen life style." But local organizers 
of the Irvine campaign wanted to wait a few days and and savor the win, 
annoying Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon met the press the day after the vote anyway -- without the Irvine 
campaigners. And when his remarks showed up prominently in newspapers around 
the state and country, it was the Irvine organizers' turn to be annoyed. 
</P>
<P>
The gay rights vote came just two days before the Board of Education debate on 
evolution, swamping Sheldon with more than two dozen phone calls from reporters 
nationwide who wanted to know about both issues. Even the usually exuberant 
Sheldon seemed dazed. "This is too much," he said at one point, shaking his 
head between phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he says he has no interest in slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon says he wants to expand his lobbying and step up his attacks on the 
"homosexual agenda," in part by organizing a national conference on 
homosexuality next year in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He is also working on his first book, a look at the "ungagging" of churches 
through political activism. His long-term goal is to expand his coalition to 
half a million supporters and launch a statewide initiative to dramatically 
reorganize the public schools, giving local districts more power to put into 
practice their own educational values. 
</P>
<P>
Such a campaign would likely put to the test Sheldon's assertion of deep 
support among the religious right, a claim that Orange County political 
consultant Harvey Englander likens to a poker game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been playing like he's got a strong hand," Englander said. "But at some 
point, someone's going to call him, and he's either going to produce thousands 
of people to walk the precincts and fill the voting booths, or he's going to 
have to fold and walk away from the table. It'll be interesting to see."

NEW LEBANON LEADER DUMPS AOUN CABINET

<TEXT>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi formed a new reconciliation government Saturday 
just eight hours after his election and moved rapidly to dismiss the interim 
military government headed by Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
Setting the stage for a confrontation with the embattled Christian forces 
commander, Hrawi abolished Aoun's three-member Cabinet and launched 
consultations aimed at appointing a new army commander, perhaps as early as 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
But Aoun, barricaded in a bunker beneath the presidential palace in Christian 
East Beirut, announced that he does not view the election of Hrawi as any more 
valid than that of his predecessor, Rene Mouawad, elected Nov. 5 and then 
killed in a massive bomb blast 17 days later. 
</P>
<P>
"Both have been elected under Syrian occupation," Aoun said in a statement 
released Saturday. "They should have waited to find out who killed Mouawad 
before appointing a new president." 
</P>
<P>
Mouawad was buried Saturday in his hometown of Zagharta with six of the 
bodyguards who were among the 23 others slain in Wednesday's bomb blast. Tens 
of thousands of mourners lined the streets, and weeping women threw themselves 
on the coffins before they were lowered into their graves, according to news 
agency reports from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II sent an envoy to convey his "deep sorrow and condolences" to 
Mouawad's family, and in a message read at the funeral urged the Lebanese to 
"practice self-restraint, reject desperation and proceed with reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, who did not attend the funeral because of security concerns, appointed 
veteran Sunni Muslim politician Salim Hoss as his prime minister. Hoss named 
the remainder of the 14-member Cabinet that will attempt to assert authority 
over a country that has been without a unified national government for more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet includes representatives of all of Lebanon's warring sectarian 
communities, including the Maronite, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic and 
Armenian Christians, the Sunni and Shiite Muslims and the Druze. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful Muslim militia chieftains Walid Jumblatt and Nabih Berri won posts as 
minister of transportation and public works, and minister of electrical, water 
resources and housing, respectively. Both had served in the Muslim government 
headed by Hoss that has rivaled Aoun's Christian government since the Lebanese 
Parliament was unable to elect a president in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The new Cabinet list also includes hard-line Christian Parliament deputy George 
Saadeh, head of the Falangist Party and a coalition of other right-wing 
Christian groups, in an apparent attempt to draw Aoun's historic base of 
support into the new reconciliation government. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was not clear whether Saadeh would accept the appointment. Saadeh, 
like some other Christian deputies who defied Aoun and voted for a new Arab 
League peace plan last month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, has not yet returned to 
Lebanon and did not participate in the presidential balloting Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun ordered the Christian deputies not to endorse the accord because it 
contained no provision for immediate withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops 
still in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate. The latest round of 
fighting started last spring when Aoun vowed to forcibly eject the troops, and 
ended with a cease-fire Sept. 23 after more than 800 had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised by my appointment," Saadeh said in a statement broadcast by 
the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio. "I don't oppose the new government, but 
the question of my participation must first be approved by the Falange 
politburo." 
</P>
<P>
The fear of reprisals may be well-founded. The houses of seven Christian 
Parliament members in East Beirut have been bombed since approval of the peace 
accord in Taif, and a caller to a Western news agency Thursday, identifying 
himself as a spokesman for the Christian Solidarity Front, warned the 
legislators that they would face the same fate as Mouawad if they elected a 
president to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Mouawad was killed despite stringent security measures taken by Syrian 
authorities to protect him. His apartment, located adjacent to the Syrian troop 
headquarters, was protected by steel sheets and bulletproof glass, and his car 
was surrounded by armed escorts as it paraded through West Beirut during 
Wednesday's independence day celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb that killed him, authorities said, was placed in an empty store along 
the motorcade route and detonated by remote control. It was large enough, 
containing an estimated 550 pounds of explosives, that it could hardly miss. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what steps the new government will have to take in order to 
dislodge Aoun. Mouawad had remained at a standoff with the feisty military 
commander throughout his 17 days in office, in large part because of the 
10,000-strong Christian Lebanese Forces that so far have refused to come over 
to the new government. 
</P>
<P>
They are no match for the 40,000 Syrian troops that control two-thirds of 
Lebanon and are now available to back Hrawi's government. Officials of the new 
government appeared more inclined to focus on other means of persuasion, but 
Hrawi, in his inaugural address, said that while he is seeking to cooperate 
with all Lebanese "without any exceptions," the move toward peace "is capable 
of wiping out whoever stands in its way."

CENTRAL AMERICA: LOS ANGELES' MAHONY CALLS FOR GREATER RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

In a highly symbolic show of support for El Salvador's beleaguered church, Los 
Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony delivered 20 tons of medical supplies to his 
Salvadoran counterpart Saturday and called for a "deeper level of justice" and 
respect for human rights here. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony flew into El Salvador's Comalapa International Airport on a chartered 
Boeing 727 loaded with donated sutures, bandages, antibiotics and food. He and 
Salvadoran Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas watched as workers hoisted the 
crates onto four trucks parked on the tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
The relief supplies were destined for civilian victims of the Salvadoran civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said his visit represented a "very visible, public" show of support for 
El Salvador's bishops in the wake of "shocking and intolerable" threats against 
priests and religious workers. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 16, six Jesuit priests, their cook and her daughter were dragged from 
their beds at the Central American University and shot to death. Church 
officials have blamed the slayings on right-wing extremists who may be linked 
to the military. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera y Damas has since been threatened and soldiers have raided churches and 
arrested Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Episcopal priests and religious workers 
as part of a crackdown following the recent guerrilla offensive in San 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The threats and murders "raise very serious questions about the ability of the 
(Salvadoran government) to protect its citizens and offer security. These 
questions should be answered," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe our government should be making certain that the government here is 
working hard to find the people who perpetrated these crimes, bring them to 
justice and to secure all citizens of El Salvador . . . (from) threats." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony called on the U.S. government to condition military aid to El Salvador 
on the government's respect for human rights. Washington gives El Salvador 
nearly $1 million a day in military and economic support. 
</P>
<P>
Though Mahony has been known for a somewhat liberal position on immigration and 
refugee issues, he suggested that recent events may be forcing a shift in some 
sectors of American public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation has changed," Mahony said as he stood beside the plane in 
stifling heat. 
</P>
<P>
"When six priests are murdered, and the government is seemingly not able to 
give protection to its citizens, that's a new situation. That is not the 
situation of a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
The head of the United States' largest archdiocese -- where about 350,000 
Salvadorans now live -- called for a "deeper level of justice, equality and 
distribution of wealth" if El Salvador is to flourish as a nation. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera y Damas, accompanied by Auxiliary Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez of San 
Salvador, seemed satisfied with the support from Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
"Where human rights are violated, it reverberates in all humanity," he told 
Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera y Damas said the aid, valued at $600,000, would be distributed through 
18 Catholic parishes in San Salvador -- though two of the churches are still 
closed by military occupation. 
</P>
<P>
The supplies were stockpiled by two Los Angeles-based organizations, Operation 
California and Medical Aid for El Salvador. Operation California has flown 
relief missions to more than 30 countries over the last 10 years, including an 
airlift to El Salvador after the 1986 earthquake and to Nicaragua after the 
devastation of Hurricane Joan last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money to charter the plane was raised among Hollywood celebrities, 
producers and screenwriters, who form part of a large network of political 
activists who follow the Salvadoran developments. 
</P>
<P>
Airlift organizers insisted on assurances from the Salvadoran government that 
the supplies would be consigned to the Catholic archdiocese for delivery to 
parishes or hospitals. They said they wanted to avoid making it possible for 
the army to seize the material. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony was met at the airport by U.S. Ambassador William Walker. No Salvadoran 
government representatives were present. Nor were any airport workers present 
at first, forcing Mahony to wait on the plane for about five minutes. Only when 
Walker stepped over and personally started to move a portable stairway did 
workers appear. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony also presented the Salvadoran prelate with a check for $100,000 and said 
he had asked Gov. George Deukmejian to provide government planes for future 
airlifts. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony did not leave the airport and boarded the same chartered plane back to 
Los Angeles about two hours after he arrived.

ENTHUSIASM HIGH FOR GORBACHEV'S VISIT TO ITALY;

EXPANDED TRADE AND INVESTMENT.

<P>
One of Italy's favorite politicians, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
ventures into this blase Roman Catholic bastion of honest-to-God capitalism 
this week with results as foreseeable as the traffic tangles they will 
engender: popular adulation, political embrace and economic blandishment in 
support of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
The Romans, who have seen it all, Caesar to Charlemagne, are as wild about 
"Gorby" as the rest of a country that has made clunky Red Army wristwatches a 
symbol of both fashion and feeling. Even back when the United States was still 
warily watching nascent glasnost, an Italian poll showed that among Italians, 
Gorbachev was more popular than then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Italy was one of the earliest West European champions of Gorbachev's reforms, 
and his Wednesday-Friday visit here en route to a weekend summit at sea with 
President Bush will be a Roman circus of three rings. 
</P>
<P>
History may best remember his coming Friday encounter at the Vatican with Pope 
John Paul II, but as important for Italy is Gorbachev's impact on Europe. More, 
the Soviet leader casts a giant shadow on the soul-searching within the largest 
Communist Party in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian government will receive Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, in the 
conviction that accelerating change in the Soviet Union and East Europe demands 
an immediate, positive and comprehensive Western response. 
</P>
<P>
"Italy decided early on to take Gorbachev at his word -- and to test him. This 
view is now accepted within NATO and echoed by the upcoming summit," said Marco 
Carnovale, a security specialist at the Institute for International Affairs in 
Rome. 
</P>
<P>
In the tumult of change in East Europe, there is no longer much debate among 
Italy and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Community allies 
over the "let's help" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no more discussion in the West between cautious people and 
risk-takers," Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said in an interview. 
"Change is not only so rapid but, in my view, so irreversible, that now the 
only thing is to define the strategy to cope with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is how to manage it from an economic and political view." 
</P>
<P>
In a reaching-out policy begun in 1987 when the current Christian Democratic 
Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti was serving as foreign minister, Italy has 
argued that the surest means of making change in the East a lasting reality is 
to support it vigorously. "The best way to influence the process is to open 
ourselves to it," De Michelis said. 
</P>
<P>
In a round of meetings with Italian government officials, Gorbachev will sign 
15 bilateral accords ranging from cultural exchanges to the conversion of arms 
industries, Italian spokesmen say. Italian government and private corporations 
are not only seeking to expand trade with the Soviet Union and East Europe but 
also to markedly increase their own investments there. 
</P>
<P>
New joint agreements are pending that would produce more Italian-Soviet cars, 
tires, traffic signals, computer software, power stations, gas turbines and 
pipelines and shoes in the Soviet Union. One agro-industrial project will 
transform 400,000 acres in the Soviet Union into a modern truck farm and 
canning center. 
</P>
<P>
Of about 680 joint ventures under way in the Soviet Union, almost 10% are with 
Italian firms. For a time, Italy proposed that West Europe sponsor a 1990s 
Marshall Plan to help the East catch up, but that idea has been overtaken by 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"Until yesterday, the problem was one of economic help to smooth the political 
process," said De Michelis, "but now the political process is faster than the 
economic one. So the problem of the economic sector is not aid but cooperation; 
the creation of involvements -- not only of a one-way transfer of resources." 
</P>
<P>
However challenging, the Italian goal of peacefully tying West and East seems 
more achievable than untying the knots in the West's largest Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev will encounter Italian Communists at a noisy crossroads. The irony is 
that Italian communism got to perestroika, or restructuring, long before 
Gorbachev, but now finds itself a step too short. The party is riven by debate 
over how much more to liberalize. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years, Communists have formed Italy's second-largest political party -- 
and the eternal opposition -- in a country where governments are fashioned by 
coalitions that never include Communists except at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
Italian Communists began drifting away from the Soviet party in the 1960s and 
broke entirely with it in 1980 over the invasion of Afghanistan. By now, the 
Italian party is virtually social democratic; its Marxists are a small, 
hard-core, change-resisting minority whose roots lie in their struggle against 
wartime fascism. 
</P>
<P>
Although modernization enabled the Communists to avoid the disintegration of 
their counterparts in France and Spain, the party struggles today with the same 
identity crisis as the rest of world communism. 
</P>
<P>
Implicitly acknowledging that there is no chance they will ever share national 
power as Communists, the party's leaders are trying to weld a new union of the 
Italian left. Along the way, they plan to overcome furious internal opposition 
and change the party's name, dropping the word Communist and such symbols as 
the hammer and sickle. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, the Italian Communists anticipated Gorbachev, but now realize 
they can't become just progressive capitalists. To survive, they must stress 
ideas that are significantly left and credibly alternative," said Gianfranco 
Pasquino, a professor of political science who sits in the Italian Senate as an 
independent leftist. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev knows the Italian Communist Party, by reputation, and at firsthand. 
In 1984, he was a middling member of a Soviet delegation that came for the 
funeral of Italian party leader Enrico Berlinguer. 
</P>
<P>
Middling no more, Gorbachev must walk on eggs in his meetings with Italian 
Communists this week. In projecting themselves as an honest party with strong 
managerial capacities and a commitment to both protecting civil rights and 
enforcing civic duties, the Communists need a strong statement from Gorbachev 
acknowledging their positive, peaceful role, Pasquino says. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev can prove either an asset or a liability to Italian Communists," 
Pasquino said. "On the one hand he is 'the Liquidator,' a visible sign that 
communism can't work. On the other, he's an attractive, progressive leader 
who's not changing the name of his Communist Party."

ARMS CONTROL ISSUES LOOM OVER MALTA SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE SUBJECT IS NOT OFFICIALLY ON THE AGENDA, BUT GORBACHEV MAY HAVE 
A SURPRISE FOR BUSH. 
</P>

<P>
Even though arms control is not formally on the Malta summit agenda, some Bush 
Administration officials expect Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to make 
new offers to speed up the negotiations now under way on reducing long-range 
nuclear arms and non-nuclear weapons in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But for Gorbachev, there is a significant risk, these officials say. Any such 
dramatic move could trigger a negative reaction from President Bush. Viewing it 
as grandstanding, the President is likely to respond by slowing the 
negotiations to prevent Gorbachev from stealing the credit for progress or by 
showing his displeasure in some other aspect of U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing Gorbachev hasn't learned yet is not to play games with us in these 
kinds of circumstances," a senior State Department official said. "I suspect 
he'll play some game, either some big START (strategic nuclear arms) initiative 
. . . or some CFE (Conventional Forces in Europe) initiative plunked on the 
table -- all of it aimed at either getting us to buy it or look uncooperative 
and uncreative when we leave Malta." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone expects a dramatic Gorbachev move. "This is not a summit in which 
you try something and want to run the risk of getting it thrown back in your 
face," one U.S. official said in discussing the likely Soviet approach to 
Malta. "This is a win-win summit. You do not want to risk bold steps that end 
up casting a pall over the meeting after it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Gorbachev's strategy at the summit, the concern of Administration 
officials about the potential impact of any step involving arms control -- long 
the centerpiece of U.S.-Soviet summits -- reflects the unique power that issue 
still has to force itself into the spotlight in a significant, even disruptive 
way. 
</P>
<P>
One factor pushing Gorbachev toward taking risks at Malta is that his political 
priorities may be different and his requirements more urgent than Bush's, 
particularly in the wake of the East European upheavals in the weeks since the 
Malta meeting was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that, the Soviet leader clearly was more anxious for a START 
agreement than Bush has been, according to U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet negotiators also have acknowledged greater emphasis on START than on the 
CFE talks. While the Soviets admit that more savings can be achieved through 
conventional force cuts, according to American officials, they believe START 
will free more high-technology manpower for civilian work -- a critical element 
in reviving the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
More subjective factors may also be in play, such as Soviet awareness that 
nuclear weapons pose a greater threat to their homeland than tanks and ground 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Bush set ambitious deadlines of mid-1990 to complete both the START agreement, 
which would cut offensive nuclear arms by about 50%, and the CFE treaty, which 
would cut manpower, tanks and other weapons of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the Warsaw Pact to lower, equal ceilings. Soviet ground forces 
would be cut more than 50%, while NATO forces would be reduced about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The almost unanimous view of U.S. officials, however, is that neither of the 
negotiations are likely to be completed by mid-1990. A few matters of principle 
still separate the U.S. and Soviet sides in START, but the delay results mainly 
from difficulties in ironing out technical details. With CFE, the United States 
and its European allies are still arguing about exactly what NATO should 
propose to the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush did not express the timetable for finishing START very 
forcefully. He said he hoped the treaty would be ready by the time of the arms 
control summit that he and Gorbachev have scheduled for late next spring or 
early summer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Key U.S. arms negotiators said they did not interpret his words as marching 
orders. And while not ruling out completion by then, they said the START treaty 
would more likely be finished in late 1990 or early 1991, in time for signing 
at a third Bush-Gorbachev summit, expected to be held in the Soviet Union in 
mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
Formal completion of START a year before the U.S. presidential elections has "a 
certain political logic to it," as one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bush in May called for a CFE agreement in six to 12 months. But his 
new chief negotiator at those Vienna talks, R. James Woolsey, later said the 
clock on that deadline did not begin running until September because four 
months were needed for NATO to convert Bush's words into a formal new proposal 
to the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
As for CFE, even before the upheaval in Eastern Europe, the consensus among 
U.S. officials was that the conventional arms treaty would not be completed by 
mid-1990, as Bush initially envisioned. White House officials have offered only 
a 50-50 chance that the agreement will be finished even by the end of 1990, and 
some experts forecast completion in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
These conventional force talks are more complex than START in several respects. 
</P>
<P>
One major difficulty is defining what weapons to include in the proposed 
agreement and designing verification measures to police the treaty. A 
particular sticking point is the Warsaw Pact proposal to limit only "strike," 
or ground attack, warplanes, thereby excluding more than 5,000 of its warplanes 
because those aircraft are officially assigned air defense and training 
missions. Since the aircraft could in fact be used in offensive roles as well, 
NATO strongly opposes this approach. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gorbachev insists on his one-sided definition of aircraft," said Ronald 
Lehman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, "it's highly 
unlikely that we'll get a CFE treaty." 
</P>
<P>
Another complication, less tangible but equally significant, is that the CFE 
talks are bloc-to-bloc rather than one-on-one negotiations. Proposals must be 
coordinated in time-consuming consultations among the 16 NATO nations and seven 
Warsaw Pact countries. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO members have always been independent; the age-old animosity between 
Greeks and Turks continue to delay agreement on the NATO position, for example. 
Now, Soviet allies are becoming increasingly independent within the Warsaw 
Pact, and this is creating new problems for Gorbachev that are expected to be 
reflected in his maneuvering at Malta. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev will push hard (at Malta) . . . to really rev up the CFE process 
quickly," one highly placed U.S. expert on Soviet affairs predicts, because 
"that negotiation is about to be overtaken by events in Eastern Europe. In some 
ways, it already has," he said, citing the end of "ideological coherence" in 
the Warsaw Pact nations and the increasing divergence from Moscow of the 
foreign and security policies of East European states. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a window . . . probably a year or two" before the CFE 
negotiations become irrelevant, he added. Before the window of opportunity 
closes, Gorbachev would like to nail down the deal to help stabilize conditions 
in Eastern Europe and legitimize the Soviet presence there while the agreed 
force reductions are carried out, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The best way for Gorbachev to speed up the CFE talks, he continued, would be to 
drop aircraft from the list of conventional weapons to be reduced. Moscow 
insisted on including aircraft in the first place, and it could now be the one 
to set the issue aside for subsequent talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader may also try to speed up CFE by persuading Bush to ease U.S. 
verification demands for the treaty, thereby simplifying and smoothing the way 
to agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is insisting on tough measures that affect mainly West Europeans, 
whose territories lie in the Atlantic-to-the-Urals zone covered by the 
negotiations. The potential impact of verification inspections on U.S. 
facilities would be minimal. The West Europeans would prefer on-site 
inspections only after reductions have occurred, to ensure that no cheating 
occurs after the cuts, and would forgo monitoring the reductions as they occur. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets could live with the European view" on CFE verification measures, 
the official added, if Bush can overrule the Defense Department on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
In the START talks, Gorbachev may seek to give new impetus to the current 
negotiations by outlining his vision of the next phase of strategic talks -- 
START II, as some experts refer to them. 
</P>
<P>
An obvious proposal would be to call for a second 50% cut, which would reduce 
the arsenals of each superpower to 3,000 long-range offensive nuclear weapons. 
Or, if Gorbachev continues to hold utopian views on disarmament, he could 
expound on the goal of a "minimum deterrence" force of only 500 nuclear 
warheads on each side. 
</P>
<P>
"Just discussing broad goals for START II, and setting a schedule of 
ministerial talks (between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze), will increase pressure on the bureaucracies 
on both sides to finish START I," the official added. For beyond the well-known 
skepticism toward arms agreements in the Pentagon, U.S. negotiators in START 
believe the Soviet military is also foot-dragging in discernible ways. 
</P>
<P>
START I needs no huge breakthroughs to be completed, officials said, thanks 
largely to Soviet concessions in September. One or two important political 
issues need to be solved, however, and ideas may be exchanged at Malta on how 
to tackle them in preparation for the arms control summit next year, when they 
can be formally resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Most important of these issues is how many air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) 
will be attributed to each bomber. "We think it's not a treaty buster," said 
one U.S. official, both on its merits and because Gorbachev has said the ALCM 
issue is "ripe" for solution. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 6,000 offensive nuclear weapons permitted under START, no more than 
4,900 can be warheads on ballistic missiles. The rest would be bombs and 
warheads on bombers and cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Since aircraft are comparatively slow flying and recallable, the United States 
argues they are less threatening than ballistic warheads and that their 
construction should be encouraged in future forces. 
</P>
<P>
This can be done by "discounting" these weapons in the START treaty, i.e., 
counting ALCM-delivered warheads less than ballistic missile warheads. So the 
United States wants to "attribute" to each aircraft a fixed number of ALCMs -- 
10 to the B-52, for example -- no matter how many they in fact carry. But the 
Soviets want to count every missile each bomber carries, which for the B-52 is 
as many as 22.

A surprising 10% of East Germany's 2.3 million Communist Party members have 
quit the party in the past two months, the official party daily Neues 
Deutschland reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Since the exodus of East Germans began over the past few months, the 
beleaguered Communist Party has been wrenched by a shake-up of the leadership, 
and charges of corruption and misrule are now being leveled against such people 
as former party chief Erich Honecker. The party newspaper quoted Central 
Committee member Heinz Mirtschin as telling an East Berlin meeting, "Since the 
end of September, 200,000 members have left the SED (Communist Party)." 
</P>
<P>
Mirtschin said that 70% of those who had quit the party were workers -- the 
core of its strength. 
</P>
<P>
Neues Deutschland said the report of the party's diminishing numbers came as no 
surprise and warned the membership that such erosion could be deepened by 
public hearings on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
Politburo member Werner Eberlein told the paper that all German leaders guilty 
of abusing power will face punishment. Eberlein, who is investigating 
corruption, suggested that many former top officials will be accused of 
misusing their power and enriching themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Woetzel, a party official in Leipzig, said the party needs "a new 
program, new charter -- and maybe even a new name."

OPEC MINISTERS STILL SPLIT OVER OIL OUTPUT QUOTAS

Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Saturday made 
what delegates said was agonizingly slow progress toward reconciling rival 
ambitions to sell more oil within a new system of output quotas. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 oil ministers held a brief formal opening session and then adjourned 
with differences unresolved. The ministers resumed bilateral talks at their 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Two days of informal pre-conference haggling failed to produce an OPEC response 
to the threat of lower world oil prices posed by the excess production of two 
Persian Gulf states, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing concrete on the table, only ideas," said Indonesian Oil 
Minister Ginanjar Kartasasmita. 
</P>
<P>
Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, a veteran consensus-builder who was elected to an 
eighth term as OPEC president, pleaded in a speech: "We must . . . relax some 
of our entrenched positions." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the UAE are at present outside OPEC's quota system, saying their 
assigned quotas are unfairly low. Delegates said one problem in the talks 
Saturday was the UAE's inability to commit itself so far to any suggested 
quota.

SOVIETS QUIETLY APPROVE PRAGUE SHAKE-UP; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: EASTERN EUROPE HAS CHANGED SO MUCH THAT CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S REFORMS ARE 
SEEN AS ALMOST ROUTINE.

<P>
Twenty-one years ago, the Soviet Union sent its troops into Czechoslovakia to 
install an orthodox Communist leadership in place of the liberal reformers and 
their "Prague Spring." The gains of socialism, Moscow declared, would always be 
defended everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
When that Soviet-installed leadership was swept from office over the weekend, 
still clinging to communism's old and rigid doctrines, the Soviet Union reacted 
with quiet approval. 
</P>
<P>
Not only had the Prague leadership lost popular support, Moscow said, perhaps 
it had even been illegitimate from the beginning. And nothing was said about 
defending socialism. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television's main nightly news program, "Vremya," on Saturday showed the 
huge crowds in the streets of Prague cheering the ouster of the old Communist 
Party leadership. The Soviet correspondent explained in friendly, approving 
tones their hope that Czechoslovakia now is about to embark on a course of 
fundamental reform. 
</P>
<P>
In its initial reports, the Soviet media treated the developments with sympathy 
-- but as almost routine. A senior editor at the Tass news agency remarked that 
after similar events in Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary and Poland, the changes 
in Czechoslovakia were, as he put it, "to be expected." 
</P>
<P>
So much has changed, first in the Soviet Union and more recently in much of 
Eastern Europe, that Moscow had actually grown impatient for Czechoslovakia and 
the other East European laggards to catch up -- to adopt the new policies of 
political openness, economic reform and democratization that are now 
transforming the other East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Society as never before needs a reasonable dialogue," the Soviet Communist 
Party newspaper Pravda said in a commentary from Prague before the leadership's 
resignation. "It is very important that each side can express its point of view 
and listen to the other." 
</P>
<P>
But Czechoslovakia, of course, differs significantly from the other East 
European countries, for it had begun its own reforms in 1968 -- only to see 
them crushed by the tanks of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. 
</P>
<P>
Much like the measures now promoted by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
the Prague Spring reforms were meant to give socialism "a human face" -- in the 
words of former Czechoslovak party leader Alexander Dubcek -- by opening the 
political system to broader participation, by developing a mixed economy and by 
easing the country out of the East-West confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Appraising the August, 1968, intervention under the late Leonid I. Brezhnev, 
prominent Soviet writer Daniil Granin wrote in the current issue of the 
avant-garde newspaper Moscow News that much time was lost here, as well as 
elsewhere in Eastern Europe, in reforming socialism as a result of the crushing 
of the Prague Spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The dream of perestroika belongs to you," Granin wrote, addressing his friends 
in Czechoslovakia. "Your economic ideas, democratization and glasnost -- that 
was all begun by the Prague Spring. 
</P>
<P>
"And if the Brezhnev clique had not smothered your perestroika, how much easier 
it would be for us now." 
</P>
<P>
The past 20 years "show us exactly what could happen if perestroika is 
defeated," Granin continued. "A swathe of vengeance swept aside the flower of 
the nation and snuffed out the energy, the thought and the enthusiasm of not 
just the intelligentsia. 
</P>
<P>
"How many lives have been wrecked and people destroyed, and how much 
disillusion, bitterness and spite have built up over these years for your own 
dogmatic Stalinists who triumphed then -- and for us, their protectors?" 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union had been gently pushing Czechoslovakia for several months 
toward fundamental reforms, just as it had East Germany and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, commenting last week on the latest developments in Eastern Europe, 
told journalists that leaders in the region had misjudged events in the past 
and that rapid change is needed now "to make up for lost time." 
</P>
<P>
The Prague leadership was publicly nudged a week ago when Vadim A. Medvedev, 
the ideology chief of the Soviet Communist Party, told his Czechoslovak 
counterpart that the events of 1968 needed to be "reassessed," and the 
Czechoslovak party newspaper Rude Pravo published this in an article from 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The intention was to "tell our comrades in Czechoslovakia that we would not 
stand in the way of reforms and that we in fact encouraged them to take an 
honest look at their current situation and at history," a Soviet foreign 
affairs analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"What that really told everyone was that we would not intervene, that 1968 had 
been a mistake that they should now correct, and that we favored this very 
course of action." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's attitude has evolved over the past six months as developments have 
raced ahead of policy throughout Eastern Europe. Even last week, "Vremya" was 
describing the demonstrators in Prague as "anti-socialist" and the street 
politics there as threatening the country's stability. On Saturday, Tass 
correspondents in Prague used as a counterpoint in their story on the 
leadership changes all the problems that faced opposition groups in agreeing on 
their goals and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's willingness to cooperate on a continuing basis with the new 
leaders now taking office in Eastern Europe was praised here Saturday by 
Poland's non-Communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who completed two 
days of talks with Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reached mutual understanding," Mazowiecki said. "This is an important 
factor, the most important objective of this meeting. And this was an unusual, 
even extraordinary visit." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki said that he had reaffirmed the intention of his government, a 
coalition in which the Solidarity labor movement and its allies are 
predominant, to improve and strengthen Poland's ties with the Soviet Union even 
as it transforms its political and economic system. 
</P>
<P>
Good relations with the Soviet Union help to promote stability in Europe and 
thus to preserve peace on the Continent, Mazowiecki said. 
</P>
<P>
"These relations are of great importance to us . . . (and), under the new 
conditions prevailing today, we can create a wider public consensus or support 
for them," he said.

The Ethiopian government and rebels from the northern province of Eritrea have 
agreed on a framework for peace negotiations, sources close to preliminary 
talks said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They said the government and the separatist Eritrean People's Liberation Front 
(EPLF) had settled on a list of seven international observers to attend 
negotiations to end the 28-year-old war, Africa's longest conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed earlier this week that former President Jimmy Carter and 
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere should be co-chairmen of the 
negotiations and should choose a secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
These were among procedural issues still outstanding after a first round of 
preliminary talks between the Soviet-backed regime and the EPLF in Atlanta in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said agreement, achieved Saturday, the sixth day of the Nairobi 
talks, would be announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Marxist Ethiopian government and the EPLF each chose two observers, and 
Carter, chairman of the Nairobi talks, picked the remaining three. 
</P>
<P>
The sources did not identify the observers but said they were from various 
countries and organizations.

NEW ELECTION ORDERED IN GANDHI'S DISTRICT; BALLOT-RIGGING SUSPECTED

<P>
Indian election officials today ordered new balloting in Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi's district because of vote fraud, dealing a major blow to Gandhi in his 
effort to maintain his leadership in the national election. 
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission also said two police chiefs in the district, Amethi, 
should be fired for their role in the ballot-rigging. 
</P>
<P>
The voting has been marked by allegations of fraud since it began Wednesday, 
and it is shaping up as the most violent in independent India's 42-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The new balloting in the 98 precincts covered by the commission's ruling will 
take place on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At least six more people died in election-related clashes Saturday, including a 
state assembly candidate killed by a bomb as he rode his motorcycle in the 
northern town of Allahabad. That brought the death toll to 107 since Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A respected weekly released a poll saying Gandhi's beleaguered Congress-I party 
would be "hard pressed" to win 200 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, 
Parliament's lower house, which will choose the next prime minister. Sunday 
magazine based the poll on interviews with 11,500 voters. 
</P>
<P>
The top candidate to become prime minister should the opposition win told the 
Associated Press he would not take the job. 
</P>
<P>
Vishwanath Pratap Singh, who heads the five-party opposition coalition known as 
the National Front, said he would run the party instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It is political suicide to depend too much on an individual," Singh said. "So 
I have decided not to accept any proposal to become the prime minister." 
</P>
<P>
There was no voting Saturday, but violence persisted. 
</P>
<P>
In Calcutta, India's biggest city, political activists battled, and a polling 
agent was killed in the turmoil. Police fired in the air and used tear gas to 
disperse the angry mob. 
</P>
<P>
Two other people were killed in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil 
Nadu. At least 150 Indians fled into Bangladesh because of political clashes in 
the far eastern state of Tripura.

OFFICIALS OPT NOT TO SET UP CRECHE IN SECULAR DISPLAY 
</P>

<P>
Allegheny County officials have decided not to set up a Nativity scene 
surrounded by reindeer and Santa Claus, even though the U.S. Supreme Court says 
a secular display is permissible. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled in July that the county's traditional Nativity scene 
crossed the constitutional boundary between church and state. But the court 
upheld the city of Pittsburgh's right to display a Jewish menorah, which stood 
alongside a Christmas tree in the City-County Building. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said placing secular items around the Nativity scene would 
make the display acceptable. Given that choice, the county chose to not display 
the creche at all. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to ask yourself, how much do you want to junk it up? Then who do you 
offend?" said Maura Minteer, manager of the county's Bureau of Cultural 
Programs. "Do you put in a reindeer and a blue Smurf? I'd just as soon not do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
As in past years, the county will erect a 12-foot Christmas tree in the 
courthouse Wednesday, along with wreaths and poinsettias, Minteer said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Jewish group in the Pittsburgh area is asking the city to 
reconsider its decision not to place a menorah on the steps of the City-County 
Building this year. The menorah marks the celebration of Hanukkah, which begins 
at sundown Dec. 22 and lasts eight days. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Solicitor Dan Pellegrini said the city agreed not to display the 
menorah if the county could not place the creche in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The group Chabad, which began erecting the menorah in 1980, since has held 
talks with Mayor Sophie Masloff's office. Charles Saul, attorney for Chabad, 
said he last met with city officials Nov. 13 and is awaiting a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decision stemmed from a 1986 lawsuit filed by the American 
Civil Liberties Union and several city residents who objected to the Nativity 
display and the menorah. 
</P>
<P>
The Holy Name Society, a Catholic organization that owns the creche, also does 
not want to see the display surrounded by secular items. 
</P>
<P>
The society is working with County Commissioner Lawrence Dunn to find an 
alternative downtown location for the creche.

11 INJURIES, SABOTAGE ATTEMPT MAR RACE

<P>
A 135-mile off-road motorcycle race across the Mojave Desert that had been 
opposed by environmentalists was marred Saturday by almost a dozen injuries and 
an attempt at sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the American Motorcyclists Assn. contended that someone had tried 
to interrupt the race from Barstow to Las Vegas by dumping four-pronged spikes 
along the course. The attempt was unsuccessful, however, because the spikes 
were dropped on a dummy course that had been set up to fool those protesting 
the race, association spokesman Ken Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that saboteurs also moved some of the course markers. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Wilderness Society, which opposed the race, said that 
instructing the 1,100 bikers to stay on course and avoid the tortoises was just 
"a few token bones tossed to the tortoise for a one-day joy ride." 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see this be the last race," said the society's regional director, 
Patricia Schifferle. 
</P>
<P>
During the race, 11 bikers were injured, three of them seriously, Bureau of 
Land Management spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield said. BLM officials went over the 
course before and after the race and found no desert tortoises, she said.

BALLOON DAMAGED BY FROST; TRIP FROM JAPAN CANCELED

<P>
A trans-Pacific balloon flight from Japan to California was scrubbed 30 minutes 
before takeoff Saturday when frost damage caused a section of the balloon 
fabric to separate as the sky ship was being filled with hot air. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, said he and his flying 
partner, Swedish balloonist Per Lindstrand, might "end up in the Pacific" 
instead of in America if they took off in the damaged balloon. 
</P>
<P>
When Branson announced the cancellation, disappointment filled a Santa Monica 
Airport hangar, where a small crowd of Virgin Atlantic Airways executives and 
flight coordinators had gathered to view the takeoff via closed-circuit 
television from Miyakonojo, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just sick. We're in shock," said Candace Block of Vic Olesen and 
Partners Inc., the Los Angeles advertising firm that represents Virgin 
Atlantic. The airline is scheduled to begin service in May from Los Angeles to 
London. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's that," said Christian Flood, an English public relations 
executive who represents the flight sponsor, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Moments 
earlier, Flood said he couldn't wait for the balloon to get up, explaining 
"this project has taken two weeks of my life." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica group said the pilots probably would try the flight again in 
two months. It would take that long, Flood said, to make a new balloon. 
</P>
<P>
The balloon is 19 stories tall when it is inflated and would be 17 miles long 
if its three layers of synthetic fabric were stretched out. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the adventurers set a record crossing the Atlantic in the "Virgin 
Flyer" but had to be plucked from the Irish Sea by helicopter when they were 
forced to ditch the balloon in the ocean after touching down briefly in 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific trip was to be 6,200 miles, twice as long as the trip two years ago 
from the United States to Great Britain. The trip was to have taken three to 
five days.

IRVINE'S 11-POINT LEAD VANISHES QUICKLY, USF BEATS ANTEATERS, 79-71

<P>
It took nearly the entire game, but UC Irvine's basketball team finally 
accomplished what it seemed bent on doing Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters lost their season-opener to the University of San Francisco, 
79-71, in front of 1,622 at Memorial Gymnasium. It was a game in which UCI 
committed 21 turnovers, shot just 52% from the free throw line and 47% from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, almost in spite of themselves, the Anteaters found themselves leading, 
59-48, with 8:50 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was at that point that USF Coach Jim Brovelli used a full-court press and 
trapping zone half-court defense that forced four consecutive UCI turnovers. In 
a little more than three minutes, USF had tied the score at 59-59 on center 
Scott MacDonald's layup. 
</P>
<P>
"The trap was the difference for us," Brovelli said. "Defense really turned it 
around for us in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
UCI did not score for more than five minutes, and when it did, on Rob 
Doktorczyk's tip with 3:08 left, the Anteaters trailed 63-61. 
</P>
<P>
USF came right back with two straight baskets to stretch the lead to 67-61 with 
2:15 left, and UCI never got closer than four down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really hurt by their fullcourt press," said Bill Mulligan, UCI coach. 
"We couldn't handle their trap. We tried three different things against it. It 
probably didn't look like it, but we did try some things against it. We just 
completely lost our poise." 
</P>
<P>
USF had jumped out to a 30-17 lead with a little more than seven minutes to 
play in the first half on the strength of three consecutive three-point shots, 
two by reserve forward James Bell. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's offense had done a good job of getting the ball inside in the first 10 
minutes -- five of the Anteaters first six field goals came on layups and 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
"They were setting a lot of back picks and no was talking on our team," said 
USF forward Joel DeBortoli. 
</P>
<P>
So USF went to a zone, one that the Anteaters couldn't penetrate, so they were 
reduced to perimeter passing and poor shots. 
</P>
<P>
With UCI in such disarray, it appeared the game was USF's for the taking. But 
just as quickly, the Dons faltered. They scored just six points in the last 
4:30 of the first half and UCI rallied, outscoring USF, 12-6, to pull to within 
39-35 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a real streaky game," Brovelli said. "There were times when we looked 
dead in the water, and then all of sudden, they looked dead in the water." 
</P>
<P>
UCI actually shot better than USF in the first half, making 56% (13-23) 
compared to the Dons 47% (16-34). But UCI's first half free throw shooting was 
abysmal, making just seven of 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters continued to streak in the second half. Led by center Ricky 
Butler (21 points), forward Jeff Herdman (21) and guard Rod Palmer (16), they 
outscored the Dons, 24-9 in the first 11:30 of the second half to take its 
59-48 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Butler was nearly unstoppable inside, making 10 of 13 shots, but getting the 
ball to him became increasingly difficult due to a combination of good USF 
defenseand poor UCI ball handling. 
</P>
<P>
It was with 8:50 left that things fell apart for UCI. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to look at the fact that our defense starting taking away a 
lot of the easy shots they were getting," Brovelli said. "The changes we made 
defensively in the second half took that away." 
</P>
<P>
USF's MacDonald, a junior college transfer, made an auspicious debut by leading 
all scorers with 25 and forward Joel DeBortoli added 16. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-8 MacDonald, who shoots left handed, did much of his damage from outside 
of the key. For example, four of his five first half baskets came from 10 feet 
or farther. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my game," he said. "It felt good from the start, I really didn't have 
time to think about this being my first (Division I) game." 
</P>
<P>
Brovelli said: "I thought Scott looked great. But hey, I love those left handed 
post players." 
</P>
<P>
At USF, that's almost a given. Bill Russell won a couple of NCAA championships 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
UCI looked liked anything but a NCAA tournament team. Of course it's early. But 
with a tough, balanced conference to play in, Mulligan realizes there are few 
games that can be given away without some sort of payment. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be nonconference, but its important," Mulligan said. "You can't play 
this way, you can't do things like this even if it is the first game of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
UCI Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Herdman, who shot 47% from three-point range last season, picked right up 
Saturday, making four of eight shots from that distance. . . . Justin Anderson, 
also expected to pitch in with some long range offense, had a forgettable 
night, going zero for seven from the field. . . . Freshman Dylan Rigdon appears 
to be the Anteaters' backup point guard of the moment. He played about four 
minutes and got one rebound. The other reserve point guard, Brett Pagett, did 
not play. . . . USF guard Kevin Bell, the smallest man on the court at 5-10, 
had eight rebounds, which made him second on his team in that category.

BOWL BID ASSURES SOUTHWEST LATE LOSS DIDN'T SPOIL FINE YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: COACH HENRY WASHINGTON'S COUGARS (7-2-1) GAIN RESPECT FROM OPPONENTS, 
ATTENTION FROM SCOUTS AND THE REWARD OF POST-SEASON PLAY.

L.A. Southwest College is bowl-bound, and though it's not the most prestigious 
bowl -- or an opportunity to capture the mythical national championship -- it's 
quite an honor for the Cougars, who completed their best season ever last week 
against Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest will gladly take a lengthy bus ride to Palm Desert to meet Foothill 
Conference champion College of the Desert in the Southern California Bowl at 7 
p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected bowl invitation helps make up for last Saturday, when Moorpark 
(9-1, 8-1) handed Southwest its worst loss of the season, a 17-0 shutout at 
home, where the Cougars were previously undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strange (to lose at home)," said Southwest's star defensive end, Chris 
Mims. "It was just hard to be out there. They just cracked us." 
</P>
<P>
The sour ending, however, can't erase a successful campaign (7-2-1, 6-2-1). 
Southwest finished second to Moorpark in the Northern Division of the Western 
State Conference. The Cougars were also invited to the Western State Bowl, 
hosted by Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Not too shabby for a school that didn't have a football team three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, financial problems in the L.A. Community College District forced 
Southwest to cancel football for one year. Before that, the Cougars had had 
only one winning season since Henry Washington took over as coach in 1982. They 
went 6-4 in 1984 and 5-5 in 1983. The year before the program was discontinued, 
Southwest finished a disappointing 2-8. 
</P>
<P>
But after reinstating football, the Cougars have improved steadily. In 1987 
they went 3-7, and last year, their first in the WSC, they finished 5-5 despite 
being in a tough league with Bakersfield, the national champions, and Glendale, 
also a California powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
This season Southwest broke into the state's top 10 and the nation's top 20 
after beating L.A. Pierce on Oct. 14. A week later, after defeating Glendale 
26-10, Southwest received its highest national ranking, No. 17, by the JC Grid 
Wire. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat a lot of teams that people thought we shouldn't have," Mims said. "We 
worked hard, and it helped us get noticed. Now we're ready to go to this bowl 
game and win because we want to go out on a good note." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Washington said: "I think people respect what we're doing and what we've 
accomplished. We've come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
Before falling to Moorpark, the Cougars were ranked 10th in the state by the JC 
Athletic Bureau. Their only other loss was to Ventura on Oct. 28, when Ventura 
was ranked sixth in the state and No. 1 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt L.A. (Southwest) was one of the more physical teams we've played all 
year," said Ventura Coach Phil Passno, whose team will play in the Hall of Fame 
Bowl on Saturday. "They've got a lot of tools. It was a very hard-fought 
football game. They hurt us a lot. We haven't been the same since." 
</P>
<P>
Southwest's tie came Oct. 7 against Bakersfield, a team that whipped the 
Cougars, 56-3, last year. This year's score was 17-17, satisfying considering 
that Southwest had to play in front of a large and rowdy Bakersfield crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"The best part of the season," Washington said, "was going up and having a shot 
at beating Bakersfield. It brought a lot of confidence in me and my assistant 
coaches and the program in general." 
</P>
<P>
There have been a lot of other good things about this season. The biggest is 
that this is undoubtedly Southwest's deepest and most talented team ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had more (college) scouts than ever," Washington said. "Not a day has 
passed without at least one out there watching us. We have 17 sophomores, and 
about 10 to 14 will get scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
Most will go to the defense, which Washington credits with a great deal of the 
team's success. The Cougars rank among the state's top 10 in that area, thanks 
to a tough line and outstanding performances by defensive back Lorenzo Dickson 
(6-foot-3, 190 pounds) and ends Bernard Dafney (6-7, 285) and Mims (6-6, 230). 
</P>
<P>
"They're big and they're very physical," said West L.A. Coach Dick Jones, whose 
team was shut out by Southwest, 41-0. "They just come after you. They have a 
lot of great players." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' offense has also been productive though young and often 
inconsistent. Freshman quarterback Craig Manigo (Leuzinger High) has completed 
136 of 235 passes for 1,672 yards and 19 touchdowns. His top receiver is 
sophomore Ansel Littlejohn (6-0, 170), who has 45 receptions for 738 yards and 
11 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we're in for a long evening," said College of the Desert assistant 
coach Richard Davis. "They're very gifted athletic-wise." 
</P>
<P>
And most of the coaches in the 12-member WSC agree with him.

AYSO COACH HECTOR MENDOZA TEACHES HOW TO WIN, MEXICAN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hector Mendoza, a native of Mexico's Pacific coast, can't recall exactly when 
he came to live in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe 13, 14 years ago," he said in English heavily affected by his 
native tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of South Redondo Beach Region 34 of the American Youth Soccer 
Organization say Mendoza, a volunteer coach, often leaves the details to 
speculation and lets others blame the language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes in handy, especially when dealing with parents," said Judy Deierling, 
whose son, Adam, plays for Mendoza on the undefeated Los Gatos Negros team. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to coaching soccer, however, Mendoza and his charges speak the 
same language. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Harbor City, Mendoza is rapidly becoming one of the South Bay's 
finest age-group instructors, an architect of raw talent. Last year he guided 
the region's 10- and 11-year-old boys' all-star team to a sectional title and 
into the Southern California championship game, where it lost, 1-0, to Buena 
Park. It was the highest finish by any age-group team from Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Zelenay, a region official, says Mendoza is already a legend. "He lives for 
soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Given the Latin passion for passing the ball, Mendoza, who played in Mexico's 
semipro league for 10 seasons, teaches a style most Anglo teams have difficulty 
with -- one that requires an inordinate amount of conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"Run, run, run. I give them lots of exercise," Mendoza said. "I teach them how 
to pass, kick and control." 
</P>
<P>
Said Judy Deierling: "His teams are second-half teams. It's not that Hector's 
teams come on stronger; it's that other teams just run down. His keep going." 
</P>
<P>
He's also good with futbol egos: "There are no glory hogs here," said Team 
Mother Evelyn Angelone. Her son, Paul, is a sweeper for Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
A distinctive Latin style of play was evident in the precision foot-passing by 
the black-and-orange-shirted Los Gatos Negros (Black Cats) at a recent game. 
The team, undefeated in boys' Division 3, is made up of 12- and 13-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Said region Commissioner Kathy Thomas, "His teams definitely play that Latin 
style: dribble and pass, dribble and pass." 
</P>
<P>
Differences in futbol style and philosophy usually follow ethnic lines 
worldwide. Burly Europeans, for example, prefer a harder-charging, more 
aggressive approach. Latins, who are usually smaller, prefer finesse. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, different soccer styles confound average sports fans, 
most of whom spend their weekends watching American football, not soccer. 
Internationally, developing a style has been an obstacle for the current U.S. 
national team, which defeated Trinidad and Tobago, 1-0, on Nov. 19 to qualify 
for the 1990 World Cup. The United States will host the World Cup in 1994, but 
without the support of its countrymen, the event will struggle here. 
</P>
<P>
All that hasn't been lost on Mendoza, who is proving that Americans can succeed 
in soccer if they develop style. AYSO rules insist that every player on a team 
play at least a half. Stacking of rosters with premier players is forbidden. To 
Mendoza, those rules are superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
"He plays with whatever he gets, and he still wins," said Judy Deierling. Los 
Gatos Negros defeated a well-respected private boys' club team from Manhattan 
Beach earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Every kid wants to play for Hector," said Deierling. "If they make Hector's 
team, they think they have it made." 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza has instilled his style by scheduling several games with a Mexican team 
in Ensenada over the Thanksgiving weekend. The trip is the third time a group 
of boys from Redondo Beach has crossed the border to play soccer. Mendoza says 
he wants to add more games with teams from mainland Mexico and La Paz to give 
his players what he says American children lack: exposure to international 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"Five or 10 more years, and soccer will be very powerful here," Mendoza said. 
"There are some really good players here. The U.S. is going to be very good." 
</P>
<P>
Adam Deierling, a center halfback, recognized the benefit of playing Mendoza's 
game when he was only 8. 
</P>
<P>
"I played against the team he was coaching, and I realized he was a really good 
coach," he said. "They passed a lot and controlled the game." 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza isn't cut in the mold of the stereotypical American Little League 
coach, either, parents say. On the sidelines at a recent game at Alta Vista 
Park, Mendoza was rather laid-back, choosing only to offer a few instructions 
to his players. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the kind to yell and shout at the games," said Judy Deierling, a 
league secretary. "He does his coaching in practice and lets the kids play the 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas says Mendoza's practices differ from those held by Anglo coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets right out there and plays with the kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mendoza, 34, could almost pass as one of the players, with his boyish 
grin and easy demeanor. He's still active as a player too, in a predominantly 
Mexican-American league that plays in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
As with most of his countrymen, Mendoza crossed the border in search of a 
better life. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot of money (in Mexico)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Southern California on the advice of his mother, Susanna, who has 
also resettled here. Mendoza got a passport and moved first to Lomita, then to 
Harbor City, where he took a job in a ceramics factory. He now works for an 
auto repair company. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Mendoza and his wife, Antonia, were at a carnival in Redondo 
Beach when he saw a booth advertising soccer sign-ups. The couple's oldest son, 
Hector Jr., now 12, was eligible to join the Kindergarten Division, and Hector 
Sr. jumped at the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big fiesta, with big parade. I wanted my kids to play soccer," said 
Mendoza, who has three sons. 
</P>
<P>
A year later Mendoza wanted to coach, but "I don't speak very good English." He 
wound up assisting on Hector Jr.'s team. Antonia, who is fluent in English, 
translated for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody (understood) me at the time," Mendoza said. "I just (pointed)." 
</P>
<P>
Gaining confidence in his English, he headed his first team in 1985. Since 
then, he has also coached a women's club team, but he discontinued that because 
"I (don't) have that much time." 
</P>
<P>
He has found a home, however, in AYSO Region 34, where, Mendoza says, "it's 
open play. Everyone can play." 
</P>
<P>
"I get different kids each year. I teach them best I can. I think (they) all 
enjoy."Adam Deierling of Los Gatos Negros moves around a defender during a

Youth Soccer -- A recent story mentioned that a boys' all-star team from 
Redondo Beach Region 34 of the American Youth Soccer Organization had the best 
finish of any team in the region's history when it finished second in the state 
last year. According to Region 34 officials, who supplied the original 
information, the boys fared better than any all-star team that region has had. 
Three divisional teams, two girls' and one boys', from Region 34 have won state 
age-group titles in the past.

WESTCHESTER HIGH APPEALS PROPOSAL TO SWITCH LEAGUES; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: SHOULD WESTCHESTER MOVE TO THE SOUTHERN-PACIFIC CONFERENCE IN 
PLACE OF PERENNIAL DOORMAT NARBONNE, WHICH WANTS OUT? L.A. CITY SECTION 
OFFICIALS LIKE THE IDEA, BUT WESTCHESTER PARENTS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS SAY 
NO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The stage is set Monday for perhaps the fiercest high school releaguing battle 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by concerned parents, Westchester High will appeal an L.A. City Section 
proposal to move the school to the Southern-Pacific Conference in place of 
Narbonne, which requested a change because of its continued failure to compete 
on that level. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne has a two-year conference football record of 0-14, playing a demanding 
schedule that includes Carson, Banning, Dorsey and Crenshaw. In basketball, the 
Gauchos were 1-9 in the conference last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think Narbonne should stay there," Westchester football Coach Larry 
Wein said, "but we don't think they should put another school in there to 
suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Will Westchester suffer? Several South Bay coaches believe the Comets are 
capable of being competitive in the Southern-Pacific Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester's football team has reached the L.A. City 2-A and 3-A Division 
finals each of the last two years and will play a second-round 3-A playoff game 
Friday against South Gate. The basketball team regularly qualifies for the 4-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything wrong with it," Carson football Coach Gene Vollnogle said 
of the proposal. "I have no respect for coaches who don't want to move up." 
</P>
<P>
Wein, though, said Westchester's reluctance to move from the Coastal Conference 
to the Southern-Pacific Conference involves more than potential wins and 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
He outlined three reasons: 
</P>
<P>
* The community is concerned about the prospect of gang activity after two 
football games this season at Southern-Pacific Conference schools (Washington 
and Dorsey) were suspended in the fourth quarter because of gunfire outside the 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
* By placing Westchester in the Southern-Pacific Conference, four of the City 
section's five high schools with black enrollments of at least 60% (Crenshaw, 
Dorsey, Washington and Westchester) will compete in the same conference, thus 
creating a segregated conference. 
</P>
<P>
* With an enrollment of 1,600 students in grades nine through 12, Westchester 
is the second-smallest high school in the City section and will have trouble 
competing in football with larger schools such as Banning, Carson and Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Wein also argued that moving Westchester from the Coastal Conference will 
terminate longtime rivalries with Venice, Palisades and University. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here eight years ago, the football team had won two games in five 
years," said Wein, whose team is 19-5 over the last two seasons. "We've come a 
long way. To see the program destroyed in a year or two, along with the 
school's spirit, would be a shame. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just looking for an equal situation. None of the Westside schools have 
large student pools. Give us 3,000 students, and we'll go anywhere you want us 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed switch with Narbonne involves moving Westchester to the 3-A 
Division Southern League with Gardena, San Pedro and Washington, and in the 
conference with 4-A Pacific League members Banning, Carson, Dorsey and 
Crenshaw. Narbonne would be grouped in the Coastal Conference with 3-A Metro 
League members University, Venice and Los Angeles, and 4-A Western League 
schools Manual Arts, Hamilton, Fairfax and Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
The changes would affect all sports for the 1990-92 cycle beginning next fall. 
</P>
<P>
If Westchester loses its appeal Monday before the releaguing subcommittee, Wein 
said the school will appeal the matter to the Interscholastic Athletics 
Committee, the governing body of L.A. City athletics.

Winning the CIF State Division I cross-country title should be old hat for 
Palos Verdes High Coach Joe Kelly by now, but his latest crown could be the 
most satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
"This is without a doubt the best I've ever seen a Palos Verdes girls team 
run," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea King girls exploited their closely bunched running to nip favored 
Agoura by seven points, 68-75, and capture the school's third consecutive state 
team title Saturday at Woodward Park. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes placed five runners in the top 20 of the team competition to 
offset the championship run of Agoura's Deena Drossin who won the individual 
title in 17 minutes, 27 seconds on the hilly, 5,000 meter course. 
</P>
<P>
In the Division I boys race, three South Bay runners placed in the top 12. 
Torrance Junior Israel Pose finished eighth overall in 15:30, a personal best 
for 5,000 meters.

Imagine the elation the Lakers had to suppress here Saturday night when they 
looked across the court and saw Utah Jazz guard John Stockton dressed in a 
pastel shirt and khaki pants, not his regular work clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Almost to a man, the stone-faced Lakers said they would have rather taken their 
chances against the Jazz with Stockton, the catalytic point guard who was 
sidelined because of a sprained left ankle, rather than take advantage of Utah 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, those pronouncements came after the Lakers had secured a 92-86 
victory, a rare win at the Salt Palace. Had Stockton played, perhaps the 
outcome would have been different. Perhaps not. Certainly, the Lakers would 
have had an even tougher time than usual with their main Western Conference 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we got a good win," Laker center Mychal Thompson said. "But you could 
say that it's (tainted). It's like them beating us without Magic (Johnson) or 
James Worthy. We didn't beat the Jazz at their best. But that doesn't mean we 
won't take it." The Lakers, coming off a five-day layoff, are playing so well 
that maybe even Stockton's appearance might not have made a difference. 
Improving the NBA's best record to 9-1, the Lakers built as much as a 19-point 
fourth-quarter lead before the Jazz rallied to pull to within three points with 
three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
But behind Johnson, who had 25 points and 11 assists, and Worthy, who added 24 
points, the Lakers held on to win here for the first time in regular-season 
play since Dec. 26, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the Lakers struggled with how much importance to place on the 
victory. The consensus was that, with or without Stockton, the Lakers should 
covet this road victory, not put an asterisk next to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they missed John," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "He's a great 
player. But the bottom line is we needed a win. We wanted a win. We got the 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said facing little-known point guards Eric Johnson (brother of Vinnie of 
the Detroit Pistons) and Delany Rudd caused problems. Riley said the Lakers had 
prepared a game plan to keep the ball out of Stockton's hands, and they needed 
to scrap that shortly before game time. "That kind of messed us up," Riley 
said. "We had to make some changes. But when it comes to competition, we're not 
looking to avoid anybody. I'm not searching for the meaning of life by having 
John Stockton out of the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
No, but it sure made the search for a victory much easier. The only Laker who 
acknowledged that Stockton's absence was a break was Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious they missed their floor leader," Worthy said. "I mean, we always 
have problems against him. He's a troublemaker, a gutsy player who makes things 
happen. That was just one less headache we had to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Utah still is a dangerous team without Stockton. There still is forward Karl 
Malone, who led all scorers Saturday night with 31 points and grabbed eight 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But despite playing 42 minutes, Malone could not beat the Lakers by himself. 
</P>
<P>
Rudd and Johnson, the rookie guards, simply could not emulate Stockton's 
creativity and quickness with the ball. Johnson, the starter, was held 
scoreless and sat out most of the second half. Rudd, however, scored 10 of his 
14 points in the second half and spurred the Jazz's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers shot slightly better than the Jazz (47.4% to 47.2%) and were 
outrebounded, 36-34, in a game that neither team will remember as a thing of 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still a good team without him," Worthy said. "But with Stockton in 
there, you always have to look out when he's in the game. We didn't need that." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. The Lakers had enough problems holding back the Jazz in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After rookie forward Theodore (Blue) Edwards stole the ball from Worthy and 
scored on a reverse dunk with 2:58 to play, reducing the deficit to 84-81, the 
Lakers seemed on the verge of losing for a fourth consecutive time in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
After a timeout, the Lakers set up the basket that secured the victory. Johnson 
received the ball in the low post with the option of spinning to the basket or 
passing to Worthy cutting through the lane. 
</P>
<P>
He chose to pass to Worthy, who soared past for a dunk and an 86-81 lead. From 
there, the Jazz never pulled closer than five points. 
</P>
<P>
"I could've gone to the hole myself, but I saw James' man turn and look toward 
me," Johnson said. "That's when I gave it to him. James and I, we play off each 
other (well)." 
</P>
<P>
So, too, do Malone and Stockton. But without one of their most vital 
instruments, the Jazz could not make much noise. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lakers certainly were not boasting after the victory, knowing the 
impact Stockton would have had, they were not ready to concede defeat had 
Stockton played. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say that," said Riley when asked if the Lakers would have lost had 
Stockton played. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never know, I guess. But our guys played a good game. We played hard the 
whole way. When they are without their best player, you have to work harder to 
not let down. I still think this was a little bit of a breakthrough for us." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson shook his head when asked about Stockton's absence. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a good game," Johnson said. "You can't worry about if, if, if." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward Mel McCants, who suffered a sprained right ankle during 
Friday's practice, did not make the trip to Utah. X-rays of McCants' ankle 
showed no fracture, but it is not known whether he will suit up for tonight's 
game against the San Antonio Spurs. . . The Lakers on Saturday extended their 
winning streak to eight games, longest in two seasons. Last season, the Lakers 
won seven in a row, from Nov. 28 to Dec. 10. They also won six straight games 
in early to mid-March. . . Mychal Thompson and A.C. Green each had 11 rebounds 
to lead the Lakers. Michael Cooper scored six of his 11 points during the third 
quarter, when the Lakers outscored the Jazz, 30-19. . . The last time the Jazz 
lost back-to-back home games was during the 1987-88 season. Both losses this 
season have come without John Stockton, who is not expected to play again until 
Wednesday night.

MORNING BRIEFING: SCHMIDT CALLED GREATEST PLAYER ON BASEBALL TEAM OF DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who were the best baseball players of the '80s? Tom Verducci of Newsday offers 
his Team of the Decade (the numbers after each player's name denote his average 
season in the '80s): 
</P>
<P>
C: Gary Carter (.264, 21 home runs, 80 runs batted in). Lance Parrish might 
have hit 18 more homers, but no one handled pitchers better or blocked the 
pitch in the dirt better than Carter. 
</P>
<P>
1B: Eddie Murray (.293, 27, 100). He has the best numbers across the board of 
any player in the decade. Yet Murray never won the MVP award and never led his 
league in any offensive category other than in the strike season. 
</P>
<P>
2B: Ryne Sandberg (.285, 14, 55). Despite only eight full seasons in the 
decade, Sandberg had 69 more hits than Willie Randolph, 94 more RBIs than Steve 
Sax and a glove that nobody matched, not even the slick Frank White. 
</P>
<P>
3B: Mike Schmidt (.277, 31, 93). He might be the best third baseman of all 
time, not just this decade. 
</P>
<P>
SS: Robin Yount (.305, 17, 82). OK, nobody played the position like Ozzie 
Smith. But Yount, who played the first five years of the decade at shortstop 
and the last five in the outfield, cannot be left off this team. 
</P>
<P>
LF: Rickey Henderson (.291, 14, 54). Nobody comes close to Henderson in runs 
scored, stolen bases or pitchers distracted. 
</P>
<P>
CF: Dale Murphy (.273, 31, 93). He won five Gold Gloves and two MVP awards, hit 
more homers than everybody but Schmidt, drove in more runs than everybody but 
Murray and missed only 23 games the entire decade. 
</P>
<P>
RF: Dwight Evans (.280, 26, 90). Nobody played right field like Evans for the 
first six years of the decade. Dave Winfield, because of his back injury, and 
Andre Dawson, because of two off years, just missed this spot. 
</P>
<P>
DH: Harold Baines (.288, 19, 84). Without much speed, Baines ranks fifth in 
hits over the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Right-handed starting pitcher: Jack Morris (16-12, 3.66 earned-run average). 
Even with his 6-14 disaster this year, Morris won 22 more games and threw 114 
more innings than any other pitcher in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Left-handed starting pitcher: Fernando Valenzuela (13-10, 3.19). Valenzuela, 
despite a 29-35 record in the past three years, gets the nod for his run from 
1981 to 1986 in which he was 97-68 and made the All-Star team every year. 
</P>
<P>
Right-handed reliever: Jeff Reardon (6-6, 2.75, 26 saves). He saved 25 more 
games than anyone else in the decade and yet was traded twice. 
</P>
<P>
Left-handed reliever: Dave Righetti (7-6, 2.91, 31 saves). Righetti set the 
major league save record (46) and saved more games in the '80s than any other 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Manager: Whitey Herzog (87-75). No manager gets more respect from opposing 
players than Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
Player of the decade: Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Pete Holohan of the Rams and Eric Sievers of the New England 
Patriots lead NFL tight ends in receptions. Whom did they play behind in 1983? 
</P>
<P>
A sock in the buckeye: The state of Ohio wore the collar against the state of 
Michigan this week. The Cleveland Browns were beaten by the Detroit Lions, 
13-10, on Thursday, the Cleveland Cavaliers lost to the Detroit Pistons, 
101-82, Friday night, and Michigan beat Ohio State, 28-18, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Kellen Winslow, when the three played for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>

for fighting Gerry Cooney: "The only guy who George Foreman should be talking 
about fighting is Hulk Hogan." GARR KLUENDER

FOX, PLAGUED BY KNEE INJURIES, RETIRES IN 10TH SEASON WITH KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The knee problems that kept Jim Fox off the ice all of last season have forced 
his retirement. Fox made the announcement Saturday, early in his 10th season 
with the Kings, his only NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
After surgery on both knees, after an entire season of working with therapists, 
after an all-out effort in training camp and in 11 games this season, Fox said: 
"I just wasn't able to do a lot of the things that I did before. I was digging, 
digging, digging. I was getting frustrated. Five or six times that I can think 
of defensemen were getting a piece of me when, in the past, that wouldn't 
happen. My game was stopping, starting, darting in out, using my quickness. I 
didn't have that." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, who suffered an injured right knee in March of 1988, played in 11 of the 
team's first 22 games and had one goal and one assist. His only goal was a 
game-winner at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
He asked to be put on waivers Monday, and he cleared waivers. "I wanted to see 
if there was any interest, and there wasn't," Fox said. "I guess everyone else 
could see it was time for me to retire, too." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, who worked in community relations for the Kings last season while he was 
trying to rehabilitate his knees, has been offered a job in the Kings' front 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a disabling injury that is forcing his retirement, he will also 
file a claim to collect $120,000 in disability insurance from Lloyd's of 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Fox was acquired by the Kings with their second choice in the 1980 entry draft. 
He played in 578 games, getting 186 goals and 292 assists for 478 points.

MCPHEE LEADS CANADIENS TO 5-3 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike McPhee, one of the key players for the Montreal Canadiens for several 
seasons, has battled injuries this season. 
</P>
<P>
He returned just in time to lead the Canadiens to a 5-3 victory over the Boston 
Bruins Saturday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee, playing in only his fifth game of the season, scored his first two 
goals to help end the Bruins' unbeaten string at nine games. It also kept the 
Canadiens in a tie with Buffalo for first place in the tight Adams Division 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have not won at the Forum since Dec. 13, 1986. During that period 
the Canadiens are 11-0-1 against them. 
</P>
<P>
Goals by McPhee, who has been nursing a strained abdominal muscle, and Stephane 
Richer in the first three minutes gave the Canadiens a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Cam Neely scored his 16th and 17th goals to get the Bruins even. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee put the Canadiens ahead to stay at 4:01 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Back-to-back victories against a good team are 
difficult. Even though they came home after beating Washington at Landover, 
Md., Friday night, the Penguins had little chance. 
</P>
<P>
Washington goaltender Don Beaupre, sent to an early shower after giving up six 
goals in barely half the game Friday night, came back to play brilliantly in 
Pittsburgh. He stopped 15 shots, losing a shutout with less than 12 minutes 
remaining when Mario Lemieux scored a short-handed goal. 
</P>
<P>
Beaupre was hurt on the play in which Lemieux scored and had to leave a few 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Courtnall set up three goals as the Capitals dominated from start to 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 seconds remaining, the teams engaged in a free-for-all involving all 
the players on the ice except the goaltenders. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Calgary 3 -- The Flames led, 3-1, with five minutes to play at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
But Adams Oates scored on a deflection at 15:02, and Rony Hrkac tied it with 
1:45 left in regulation. The tie gave Calgary's Stanley Cup champions an 0-5-4 
record in the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 7, New York Islanders 2 -- Normand Lacombe, benched for 12 games after 
going scoreless in eight in a row, was ready when he was reinstated for the 
game at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Lacombe scored his first three goals and had an assist to lead the Oilers to an 
easy victory over the Islanders, who fell to 5-17-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers are 4-1-0 in their last five. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Quebec 2 -- Pierre Turgeon scored with just 16 seconds remaining in 
regulation at Quebec to keep the Sabres in a tie for first place in the Adams 
Division with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon took a pass from Dave Andreychuk and beat goalie Ron Tugnutt for his 
11th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres built a 2-0 lead but couldn't hold it. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Ron Francis and Scott Young scored power-play 
goals less than five minutes apart in the second period at Hartford, Conn., to 
break open a close game. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Mike Liut stopped 18 shots, lowered his goals-against average to 
2.31 and ended the Whalers' three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, New York Rangers 4 -- Gary Leeman scored twice at Toronto to help 
the Maple Leafs end a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers lead the Patrick Division by five points. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring four times in the first two periods against Bob Froese, the Maple 
Leafs scored three times off John Vanbiesbrouck in the final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 3, Winnipeg 1 -- John MacLean and Sylvain Turgeon scored 
first-period goals and the Devils held on to win at Winnipeg and move into a 
tie for second place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
A late onslaught enabled the Jets to outshoot the Devils, but goalie Chris 
Terreri was superb, stopping 38 shots, 18 of them in the last period. DAN

TAGLIABUE TO MEET WITH NFL OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Tagliabue, the new NFL commissioner, will hold a three-day series of 
executive sessions with club presidents in Dallas early next month to discuss 
the player-owner impasse and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings are planned with owners representing two divisions each day on the 
following schedule: 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 5 -- NFC West, AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 6 -- Both Central divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 7 -- NFC East, AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Raider owner Al Davis and two or three other presidents favor some form of free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Other owners have discussed a salary cap combined with a player wage scale. 
</P>
<P>
In former years, NFL meetings have normally involved all 28 clubs. Tagliabue 
said that in sessions with small groups of owners, more of them may feel like 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an imaginative way to get into some tricky issues," a club executive 
said. "I hope some of the ideas proposed will be equally so." 
</P>
<P>
Other subjects on Tagliabue's agenda are television, international plans and a 
review of NFL office procedures. BOB OATES

NEWSWIRE: FAN WHO WAS HIT BY FOUL BALL WINS LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delbert Yates Jr. won a rare injury lawsuit against a baseball team when a Cook 
County Circuit Court jury awarded him $67,500 for being hit in the eye by a 
foul ball off the bat of the Chicago Cubs' Leon Durham in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Yates, a 10-year-old from Valparaiso, Ind., revived the question of 
how far a baseball club should go to protect fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy about the whole thing because other people got injuries from foul 
balls and nobody got anything out of it before," said Yates, now 16. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's attorney, Mario Cirignani, said it is the first verdict of its kind 
against a Chicago major league baseball team. He was seeking $75,000 in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
Cub attorney William Cremer said the club would appeal the verdict.

Defending World Cup ski champion Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, who fell on 
her first run of the season, turned in two flawless runs to win the women's 
slalom Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, coming off the best season in the history of the World Cup tour with 
14 victories last year, negotiated the 427-meter course in 47.77 seconds on her 
first run and in 46.88 on her second for a total of 1:34.65. 
</P>
<P>
She easily beat Monika Maierhofer of Austria, who was timed in 48.26 on her

</P>
<P>
Schneider, in her season debut Friday, fell in her first giant slalom run.

The last time Ray Tarasi tried to kick a field goal to win a game for Penn 
State, Alabama blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Tarasi kicked a 20-yard field goal with 13 seconds Saturday left to 
give the No. 22 Nittany Lions a 16-13 victory over No. 19 Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to make that kick," said Tarasi, who had a potential 
game-winning 18-yarder blocked on the final play in Penn State's 17-16 loss to 
No. 4 Alabama. "The Alabama game wasn't on my mind at all. That was just a 
fluke." 
</P>
<P>
Backup quarterback Tom Bill converted two key third-down pass plays in the 
final 2:10, setting up Tarasi's kick. 
</P>
<P>
Bill, who replaced starter Tony Sacca for the final 2 1/2 quarters, hit Dave 
Daniels for 19 yards and Leroy Thompson for 29 on third-down plays before 
Tarasi kicked his 20-yard field goal, completing a nine-play, 58-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Bowl-bound Nittany Lions (7-3-1) got 131 rushing yards from Blair 
Thomas to overcome Curvin Richards' 152 yards and beat Pitt (6-3-1) for the 
first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had his sixth consecutive 100-yard game and his eighth of the season to 
become the school's second-leading career rusher with 3,301 yards, 97 behind 
Curt Warner (3,398). 
</P>
<P>
Pitt, which accepted a John Hancock Bowl bid, was trying to beat the Lions 
three consecutive years for the first time since 1943-46. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt, which tied the score, 13-13, on Ed Frazier's 40-yard field goal with 2:23 
left, got one more opportunity to pull out the game, but Alex Van Pelt's 
desperation pass from his 48 on the final play was intercepted by Sherrod 
Rainge. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams fought briefly in front of the Pitt bench after Rainge was 
knocked out of bounds on his 58-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt, losing for the third time in four games, hadn't threatened in the second 
half until Van Pelt, who completed only two of nine passes in the half to that 
point, found Henry Tuten behind cornerback Hernon Henderson for a 54-yard 
completion to the Penn State 32. 
</P>
<P>
After Richards ran for 18 yards, Adam Walker apparently scored from the 14, but 
the play was called back because of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the boos of his own crowd, Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried elected to run 
Walker, his backup tailback, into the middle of the line for three consecutive 
short gains before settling for Frazier's tying field goal. Frazier missed from 
48 yards out earlier in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Gottfried declined to answer questions about the Panthers' final possession, 
but center Chris Sestili said: "We were running the ball real well and that's 
what we wanted to do. They couldn't stop us and they didn't. We beat ourselves 
(with the penalty). We're better than Penn State, but we couldn't push it in 
when we had to." 
</P>
<P>
Penn State turned a long scoring drive and Richards' fumble into a 10-0 
first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sacca, ended a 12-play, 75-yard drive with a 19-yard touchdown pass to Daniels 
for a 7-0 lead. Sacca kept the drive going by passing to Daniels for 11 yards 
on a third-and-eight and Thomas for 13 yards on a third-and-nine. 
</P>
<P>
Richards fumbled on Pitt's next play from scrimmage, with Reggie Givens 
returning 19 yards to the Pitt 32. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions settled for Tarasi's first field goal, a 19-yarder, after tight end 
Dave Jakob jumped offside on a third-and-goal play from the one. Sacca got the 
five yards back on a keeper, but Paterno settled for the short field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt then drove 73 yards on 14 plays for Frazier's 27-yard field goal and, 
after Penn State punted, Van Pelt tied the score, 10-10, with 1:46 left in the 
half with a two-yard scoring run, one play after hitting Tuten for 44 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished the result season with 1,341 yards. Richards has 1,038 yards 
with one game left, giving him 2,266 yards in two seasons.

HURRICANES PUT DENT IN HOPES OF ORANGE BOWL FOR SHOWDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
BOWLS: MIAMI GOES TO SUGAR BOWL AGAINST SEC CHAMPION. IT ALSO ADDS A FLAW TO 
THE NOTRE DAME-COLORADO MATCHUP.

<P>
Even before Miami knocked off top-ranked Notre Dame, 27-10, Saturday night, the 
Hurricanes and Fighting Irish accepted bids to New Year's Day bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
However, seventh-ranked Miami's victory over the Irish spoiled the Orange 
Bowl's hoped-for showdown for the national championship between Notre Dame 
(11-1) and second-ranked Colorado (11-0), which earned an automatic berth by 
winning the Big Eight Conference championship outright for the first time since 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said the Irish accepted the Orange 
Bowl bid because they haven't played in the New Year's Night game since 1975. 
Rosenthal said the Fighting Irish also considered bids from the Sugar, Cotton, 
Fiesta and Citrus Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Because the game is at night, the Orange Bowl could still get its showdown if 
things break just right earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado last played in the Orange Bowl in 1977, when it was Big Eight 
co-champion. Nebraska or Oklahoma has been the conference representative at 
Miami every year since. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (10-1) accepted a bid to play the Southeastern Conference champion -- 
either No. 4 Alabama (10-0), No. 10 Auburn (8-2) or No. 8 Tennessee (9-1) -- in 
the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC runner-up, or possibly an SEC co-champion that does not go to the Sugar 
Bowl, will play in the Cotton Bowl against ninth-ranked Arkansas (9-2), the 
Southwest Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked Michigan (10-1) joined No. 12 USC (8-2-1), the Pacific 10 
Conference champion, in a rematch at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena by beating Ohio 
State, 28-18, to clinch the Big Ten Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (8-3) will play the odd team out in the SEC on Jan. 1 in the Hall of 
Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Florida State (8-2), the only team to beat Miami, will play No. 6 
Nebraska (10-1), which lost only to Colorado, in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1 at 
Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Clemson (9-2) will play No. 17 West Virginia (9-2) Dec. 30th in the 
Gator Bowl at Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ten runner-up and 11th-ranked Illinois (9-2) and Atlantic Coast Conference 
co-champion Virginia (10-2), No. 16, accepted bids to play in the Florida 
Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day. Illinois lost only to Michigan and Colorado. 
Virginia lost only to Notre Dame and Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Bowl was hoping to invite Indiana and its All-American running back 
Anthony Thompson, but the Hooisers were upset, 15-14, Saturday by Purdue. So 
the game at Anaheim Stadium will have Florida (7-3) and Emmitt Smith against 
Washington (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Penn State (7-3-1) accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl Dec. 29 
against BYU after beating No. 19 Pitt, 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
'It won't be 16-13 (in the Holiday Bowl)," Paterno said. "Maybe (BYU Coach) 
LaVell Edwards will take it easy because I'm his buddy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe we'll throw and he'll run," added Paterno, drawing laughter because 
the suggestion went contrary to the teams' offensive philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
No. 21 BYU (10-2) clinched the Western Athletic Conference championship and the 
automatic berth in the Holiday Bowl that goes with it by beating San Diego 
State, 48-27, Saturday night at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego -- site of the 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its defeat, Pitt (6-3-1) will play No. 14 Texas A&amp;M (7-3) in the 
John Hancock Bowl Dec. 16 at El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (6-4) will play Syracuse (6-4) in the Peach Bowl at Atlanta Stadium on 
Dec. 30. Georgia and Syracuse each has one game remaining -- Georgia at 
archrival Georgia Tech and Syracuse against Louisville in Tokyo. Both games are 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Michigan State (7-4), with losses to Miami, Notre Dame, Michigan and 
Illinois, won its fifth consecutive game Saturday, 31-3, over Wisconsin, to 
earn a spot in the Aloha Bowl on Christmas Day against No. 24 Hawaii (8-2) in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (7-4) beat Mississippi State, 21-11, Saturday and accepted a bid to 
the Liberty Bowl on Dec. 28 at Memphis, Tenn., against Air Force (8-3). The 
Falcons were eliminated from the WAC race and Holiday Bowl consideration by 
BYU's victory. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (6-4-1), by beating archrival Arizona State, 28-10, on Saturday, will 
stay at home in Tucson to play North Carolina State (7-4) in the inaugural 
Copper Bowl on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
In the Independence Bowl, Tulsa (6-5) will play Oregon (7-4) at Shreveport, 
La., on Dec. 16 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Texas Tech (8-3), despite a 40-24 loss to 13-ranked Houston on Saturday, 
will face No. 23 Duke (8-3) in the All-American Bowl on Dec. 28 at Birmingham, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Houston (8-2) is on NCAA probation for recruiting violations and is ineligible 
for post-season play. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (9-2), champion of the Big West Conference, will play Ball State 
(7-2-2), the Mid-American Conference titlist, in the California Raisin Bowl on 
Dec. 9 at Fresno.

Liberty Bowl-bound Mississippi knows how to take advantage of the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Rebels earned a 21-11 victory over arch-rival Mississippi 
State Saturday and will carry that momentum into their Dec. 28 bowl game where 
they probably will play Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't one of our better performances. Give Mississippi State a lot of 
credit, they played good, solid football," said Mississippi Coach Billy Brewer, 
who is taking his third Rebel team to a bowl in his seven seasons at his alma 
mater. 
</P>
<P>
"We were patched up and we played hard for 11 games. This is probably as good 
an overall performance by a team that I have coached. To accomplish the seventh 
win today against a solid intrastate rival makes this victory very meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
In a Southeastern Conference defensive struggle before a crowd of 43,218, Ed 
Thigpen and Randy Baldwin scored on one-yard runs and opportunistic Ole Miss 
(7-4) won for the sixth time in the last seven games of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Ending a two-game losing streak, Mississippi, 4-3 in the SEC, used a fumble 
recovery to set up a short second-quarter touchdown drive and then went 93 
yards after a pass interception for one of its two fourth-quarter scores. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State (5-6 overall, 1-6 in the SEC), was in the game until a gamble 
backfired late in the third quarter and Ole Miss scored two fourth-quarter 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-3, Mississippi State had a fourth down and a yard for a first down 
at the Ole Miss seven, but Todd Jordan's pitch to Jesse Anderson went awry and 
the Bulldogs lost five yards. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was particularly disappointing for Mississippi State, which was 1-10 a 
year ago and had a shot at a bowl game until a loss last week at Louisiana 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a physical game and I think we played really well in some spots," 
Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said. "But when we had the opportunities, 
we didn't take advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the fourth-down call from inside the 10. It seemed after that, 
all the momentum swung over to the Ole Miss side." 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State hurt itself with turnovers -- losing the ball three times -- 
and had a couple of costly penalties in key situations.

Tommy Hodson completed nine consecutive passes in a 24-point second quarter 
streak to lead Louisiana State to a 27-7 victory over Tulane Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
LSU finished its season 4-7, and Tulane finished 4-8. 
</P>
<P>
Hodson completed 17 of 25 passes for 265 yards and a touchdown. In the second 
quarter, he completed nine of 11 passes for 183 yards, including a 23-yard 
touchdown pass to Ronnie Haliburton. 
</P>
<P>
David Browndyke kicked field goals of 34 yards in the first quarter and 32 
yards in the second, giving him 14 for the season without a miss. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Moss scored on a 32-yard pass from tailback Eddie Fuller in the second 
quarter, and Jay Egloff ran 19 yards for a touchdown with 35 seconds left in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane scored on an 11-yard pass play from Jerome Woods to Melvin Ferdinand in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Woods came into the game on the scoring drive after starter Deron Smith 
suffered and injured shoulder. It was the first collegiate touchdown for both 
Woods and Ferdinand. 
</P>
<P>
Hodson finished his LSU career with 9,115 passing yards, only the 12th player 
in NCAA history to pass for more than 9,000 yards.

A BIG TURNAROUND FOR BAYLOR: 50-7 OVER TEXAS

Safety Robert Blackmon returned two interceptions for touchdowns and set up 
another with a third interception Saturday as Baylor routed Texas, 50-7, for 
its first victory at Austin since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 points were the most scored by Baylor against Texas in a series that 
started in 1901, and the victory margin was the greatest for Baylor in 79 games 
against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was quite a turnaround for Baylor, which lost, 6-3, to Rice last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon reached below his knees to intercept Texas quarterback Peter Gardere's 
pass, which was tipped by Texas receiver Tony Jones, and ran 20 yards for a 
touchdown with 9:36 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon out-jumped Jones for reserve quarterback Donovan Forbes' pass and ran 
35 yards with the interception for his second touchdown with 11:42 remaining in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon's third interception, off Gardere, and his 26-yard return set up a 
two-yard touchdown by Anthony Ray to give Baylor a 43-0 lead late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor, ranked No. 11 nationally in defense, finished its season with a 5-6 
record, 4-4 in the Southwest Conference. Texas is 5-5 and 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
The loss by Texas clinched the SWC football championship for Arkansas, which 
defeated Texas A&amp;M, 23-22, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Texas had eight turnovers and never started a possession beyond its 25 until 
Baylor lost a fumble fumble at its 2. Texas then scored on Adrian Walker's 
1-yard dive to avoid its first shutout since 1980.

LONG BEACH WINS ONE FOR DEPARTING REISBIG

<P>
Cal State Long Beach won a football game Saturday for outgoing Coach Larry 
Reisbig, defeating Utah State, 31-18, at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice way to end it," said Reisbig, who was hoisted by his players 
after finishing with a three-year record of 11-24. He announced his resignation 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who built a 21-0 lead in the first quarter on three touchdown passes 
by quarterback Paul Oates, snapped a five-game losing streak and ended the 
season with a 4-8 overall record, 2-5 in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State (4-7, 4-3) trailed, 24-18, late in the game, but Kirk Johnson's pass 
was intercepted by Greg Svitenko of Long Beach and returned 51 yards for a 
touchdown with 3:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
Oates, who had season passing totals of 2,621 yards and 19 touchdowns, threw a 
50-yard pass to Sean Foster in the end zone on Long Beach's first play from 
scrimmage. On the 49ers' second possession, he connected with Derek Washington 
for an 18-yard touchdown. The third time Long Beach got the ball, he threw a 
47-yard scoring pass to Michael Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson brought Utah State back with scoring passes to Rod Moore and Tracey 
Jenkins. And he narrowed the deficit to 21-18 when he hit Patrick Newman for a 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
But when it looked as if a victory might elude them again, the 49ers turned to 
running back Jeff Fassett, who gained all of his 110 yards in the second half. 
His 30-yard run set up a 29-yard field goal by Kenneth Allen that increased 
their lead to 24-18 with 4:36 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, which had been giving up an average of 35 points a game, had one of 
its best defensive efforts. The 49ers were led by senior linebacker Gene 
Lemmers, who had 20 tackles. DICK WAGNER San Jose State 38, UNLV 28 -- Sheldon 
Canley ran for 102 yards and the Spartans defeated the Rebels in at San Jose. 
Canley had 221 all purpose yards and moved into fifth place on the NCAA 
single-season all purpose running list. Ralph Martini threw three touchdown 
passes, two in the second quarter, to Doug Hooker as the Spartans (4-7, 3-4) 
took a 24-0 lead at halftime. UNLV (6-5, 5-2) scored three touchdowns in the 
fourth quarter to cut San Jose State's lead to 31-28, but Jim Francis put the 
game away on an 18-yard touchdown run with three minutes left.

Greg Johnson rushed for three touchdowns and quarterback Dee Dowis ran for two 
others as Air Force held off Utah Saturday for a 42-38 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force running back Rodney Lewis rushed for 176 yards in 23 carries and one 
touchdown as the Falcons improved to 8-3 overall and 5-1 in the Western

Air Force will play Mississippi (7-4) in the Liberty Bowl on Dec. 28 at

Utah tight end Dennis Smith scored four touchdowns, catching seven passes for 
139 yards. The performance gave Smith the WAC record for touchdown receptions 
for a season at 18, breaking the mark of 15 set by BYU's Clay Brown in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force built a 42-18 lead with 11:30 remaining in the third quarter when 
Johnson scored his third touchdown of the day on a nine-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
But Utah backup quarterback Mike Richmond, substituting for injured Scott 
Mitchell, threw three touchdown passes to pull the Utes to within four points. 
The Utes, who ended the year at 4-8 and 2-6, gave up the ball on downs as the 
clock wound down.

Brigham Young University clinched the Western Athletic Conference title and 
earned its first Holiday Bowl berth since its 1984 national championship by 
defeating San Diego State, 48-27, Saturday night as Ty Detmer passed for 327 
yards and accounted for five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 21-ranked Cougars (10-2 overall, 7-1 in the WAC) will return to San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium to play No. 22 Penn State in the Holiday Bowl on Dec. 
29. Penn State beat Pitt, 16-13, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer, who passed for three touchdowns and ran for two, completed 23 of 33 
passes and finished the season with 4,560 yards, falling just short of the 
major-college record of 4,571 by BYU's Jim McMahon in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' Stacey Corley rushed seven times for 121 yards, including runs of 
57 and 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State (6-5-1, 4-3) finished with its first winning record in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec quarterback Dan McGwire missed much of the first half due to a back 
bruise on the Aztecs' first possession but returned to complete 14 of 21 passes 
for 215 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs trailed, 35-14, in the third quarter before closing to 35-24 on a 
32-yard pass from McGwire to Tony Nettles and a 46-yard field goal by Andy 
Trakas. 
</P>
<P>
But Detmer put the Cougars comfortably ahead again with a one-yard touchdown 
run late in the quarter after Dave Porter recovered a fumble by Monty Gilbreath 
on a punt return at the Aztecs' 19. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Trakas added a 38-yard field goal and BYU's Fred 
Whittingham scored on a 34-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars trailed, 14-13, after one quarter but scored 22 points in the 
second quarter for a 35-14 halftime lead. Jeff Frandsen put BYU ahead, 21-14, 
early in the second quarter when he caught a 27-yard pass from Detmer, his 
second touchdown reception. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars added two touchdowns in the final 2:33 of the half when Matt 
Bellini scored on a three-yard run and Andy Boyce made a diving catch of 
Detmer's nine-yard scoring pass with 18 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Butts and Ron Slack scored on short runs for San Diego State in the 
first quarter. Frandsen scored on a 67-yard pass play, and Detmer scrambled 12 
yards for BYU's touchdowns in the first quarter.

GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-ranked Arizona surprised defending NCAA champion Michigan both at the 
start and at the finish in the 11th annual Hall of Fame Tip-Off game Saturday 
at Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The young Wildcats attacked fourth-ranked Michigan's big players and the 
strategy worked in a season-opening 82-75 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Rooks, a 6-foot-11 sophomore from Fontana High, scored 20 points, 
including six consecutive free throws down the stretch, as the Wildcats 
outscored the Wolverines, 16-7, in the final 1:30. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona had its largest lead, 54-45, early in the second half, but Michigan 
went ahead, 66-63, on a three-point shot by Rumeal Robinson and a free throw by 
Terry Mills with eight minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Muehlbach then tied the score with a three-point basket. Michigan regained 
the lead briefly, 68-66, but Brian Williams, a sophomore transfer from 
Maryland, triggered the decisive charge by Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who had 12 points in limited action while recovering from a foot 
injury, tied the score, 68-68, with two free throws. Jud Buechler followed with 
a layup and Matt Othick had two more free throws for a 72-68 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Rooks added his six free throws and Muehlbach had two as the Wildcats spoiled 
the regular-season debut of Michigan Coach Steve Fisher, who took over after 
Bill Frieder resigned just before the NCAA tournament last season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson led all scorers with 27 points. Mills had 16 before fouling out with 
5:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
7. North Carolina 78 
</P>
<P>
Villanova 68 
</P>
<P>
Rick Fox scored 23 points, including the three-pointer that gave North Carolina 
the lead for good, and the seventh-ranked Tar Heels won in the semifinals of 
the Maui tournament at Lahaina, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels needed a miraculous last-minute comeback to beat James Madison in 
the opening round as the Dukes missed three free throws down the stretch. In 
the same situation on Saturday, North Carolina (2-0) fared better at the foul 
line and went on to beat the Wildcats (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Fox's three-pointer with 5:53 left gave North Carolina a 67-65 lead and when 
Villanova went cold from the field, the Tar Heels were just successful enough 
at the foul line, making five of eight, in the final 1:07, to get the win. 
</P>
<P>
Hubert Davis finished with 16 points for the Tar Heels. Freshman Aaron Bain led 
Villanova with 17 points.

<P>
Senior Robert Brickey and freshman Billy McCaffrey each scored 22 points to 
lead seven players in double figures at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The final score represented the biggest lead on a night when Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski had cleared his bench with four minutes left in the first half. When 
reserve Joe Cook scored with 6:16 left to play, he gave Duke a 113-46 lead and 
was the last of the 12 Blue Devil players to score. No one for Duke had less 
than four points in its official season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Henderson scored 12 points, with Christian Laettner, Alaa Abdelnaby and 
Thomas Hill scoring 11 each and Brian Davis getting 10 for the Blue Devils.

the Cardinals in the semifinals of the Maui tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th-ranked Tigers led, 79-57, with 8:03 to play. But Louisville, led by 
Felton Spencer and Jerome Harmon, staged an amazing comeback, getting to within 
80-79 with 51 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri then ran down the 45-second shot clock and Anthony Peeler scored the 
game's final points with 23 seconds left when Spencer was called for 
goaltending on his driving layup. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville worked for a final shot, but a three-point attempt by Everick 
Sullivan with five seconds left bounced off the rim and the Tigers had the 
rebound and the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (2-0) will meet No. 7 North Carolina, which beat Villanova, 78-68, 
in the other semifinal, in tonight's championship game.

</P>
<P>
Miami (Ohio) 66 
</P>
<P>
Calbert Cheaney, one of Indiana's seven freshmen, had six of his 20 points in a 
decisive second-half streak as the 14th-ranked Hoosiers won their season opener 
at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Miami cut Indiana's lead to 54-51 with 10:51 to play, but Cheaney's basket with 
10:31 remaining ignited a 12-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
A dunk by freshman Lawrence Funderburke put Indiana ahead 58-51 with 9:17 
remaining. After two free throws by Miami's David Scott, the Hoosiers scored 
eight consecutive points on a 10-foot shot by freshman Greg Graham, two jump 
shots by Chaney and a basket by Eric Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson finished with 19 points and Funderburke added 10 as Indiana beat Miami 
for the 20th time in 23 meetings. 
</P>

Cincinnati 66 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sanders took an inbound pass from Andre Tate and made a three-point shot 
with one second remaining to give the Bearcats the upset win. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota led, 64-63, when Cincinnati took the ball with 26 seconds remaining. 
Gophers guard Kevin Lynch stole the ball, and began dribbling out the remaining 
time, but then threw the ball away, giving the Bearcats one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
Tate led all scorers with 18 points, while Lynch led the Gophers with 16. 
</P>

past the Volunteers in the Mid-South tournament at Memphis.

The Tigers shot only 32% from the floor in the first half and 41% for the game, 
but used a tough defense to stop Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State caused 39 Tennessee turnovers and allowed the Volunteers to shoot 
only 40% from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State (2-0) beat Tennessee (1-1) for the first time in three games. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers lost a 35-31 halftime lead at the start of the second half when the 
Volunteers pulled even, 39-39, on an inside shot by Ian Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State then went on a 10-0 run capped by back-to-back three-point plays 
by Perry and Ben Spiva that left the Tigers ahead, 49-39, with 14:57 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee pulled to within 51-44 with 13:14 left on a jump shot by Greg Bell,

<P>
The man who would be king, or at least chief executive officer? 
</P>
<P>
The men's professional tennis tour, the ATP Tour, has as its CEO Hamilton 
Jordan, the former Carter White House chief of staff, but last week someone who 
wants Jordan's job threw his racket into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Would you believe, John McEnroe? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anyone better than me," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe revealed his desire to test the murky waters of tennis politics last 
week after playing an exhibition match against Jimmy Connors at the Forum. No 
one is sure whether McEnroe's politics are leftist, only that he swings the 
racket that way. 
</P>
<P>
But McEnroe the reigning authority figure of men's tennis? Better figure that 
the fines for verbal abuse go way, way down. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, maybe Mac's a pretty good idea. After spending his career treading 
water in the shark-infested political pool of men's tennis, McEnroe is 
obviously fairly adept at this fuzzball business. 
</P>
<P>
"Commissioner of tennis, that would be nice," McEnroe said. "My vision of 
tennis is far more interesting than the people who care about money, money, 
money. I don't know who would be better than me. 
</P>
<P>
"Hamilton Jordan is a politician. He doesn't know anything about tennis. He's 
done a great job, but now it's time for someone with vision to carry it into 
the 21st century." 
</P>
<P>
Off the top of his head, McEnroe came up with two planks for his platform. He 
favors a program to establish and support a children's tennis movement. He also 
stands for moving in the service line an inch or two. 
</P>
<P>
"This sport needs some positive change, otherwise it'll be the same old boring 
thing it is now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan recently had his contract extended as the top management officer of the 
ATP for three more years, so the position McEnroe covets is already taken. But 
there could still be room for him in the future, an ATP official said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing, John McEnroe is a very bright guy and has a lot of 
good ideas," said Jay Beck, communications director of the ATP. "I don't know 
what kind of management experience he might have, but I don't think he's saying 
anything out of line when he looks down the road at his future." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, 30, isn't exactly running for office, but he would have to gain the 
support of the players' group, which selects its leaders through various 
committee votes. McEnroe would be a slate of one as a candidate, but he's 
already considering his options if he needed a running mate. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'll get Jimmy," McEnroe said, referring to Connors. 
</P>
<P>
Mac attack: As a member in good standing of the ATP, McEnroe has long been a 
vocal critic of the organization of his peers, just as he has spoken out 
against most every other institution of man. The 1990 ATP Tour may not be a 
shining example of what the players are capable of producing, McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the players taking as much a voice as I hoped," he said. "I'm not 
optimistic. Basically, all they have is Hamilton Jordan and his cronies with 
more power. The special interests have more power. We could do a lot better, 
but at least it's a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said that the top players were not consulted enough during planning 
sessions for the 1990 ATP Tour, that players must play too many tournaments and 
the off-season is not long enough. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe also criticized the U.S. Open for putting together a difficult playing 
schedule because television wants two men's semifinals on Saturday and the 
men's final on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a joke," he said. "The next thing is, we'll be playing at 2 in the 
morning because somebody can get more money from it. We're still pieces of meat 
when it comes down to it." 
</P>
<P>
He's 38 in September: Connors, 37, is scaling back his 1990 tournament 
appearances to about 12 and neither the Newsweek Champions Cup at Indian Wells 
nor the Volvo/Los Angeles events are on his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Last March at Indian Wells, Connors said he planned to play until he is 40, but 
now he is reconsidering. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'll make it until I'm 40," he said. "I'll look at it at the 
end of the year and see. I'll probably play until I'm 39, like Ken Rosewall 
did, when I played him at the Open and he was 39. That would be an appropriate 
ending, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Connors was 22 when he defeated 39-year-old Ken Rosewall in the 1974 U.S. Open 
final, the first of Connors' five U.S. Open titles. Rosewall, who had also lost 
to Connors in the 1974 Wimbledon final, never made it to another Grand Slam 
final. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope to play one more year on this level," Connors said. "I still have 
a chance to do something down the line -- somewhere, sometime -- I just don't 
know the place or the time. Wish I did." 
</P>
<P>
Davis Cup update: U.S. Captain Tom Gorman said that by Jan. 1 he will name the 
U.S. team that will play its first-round match against Mexico that begins Jan. 
29 at La Costa. One player certain not to be named is McEnroe, who has already 
made himself unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
But will he be available after that? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll discuss it after that (Mexico match)," McEnroe said. "I will say that 
I'd like to be part of a team that wins the Davis Cup, but . . . it's sad. The 
Davis Cup doesn't seem right right now. It's just not as big as it was, not as 
important as it was." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said much the same thing when he skipped a first-round match with 
Paraguay, but he played against France and would have played against West 
Germany if he had not injured his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman will consider a number of potential singles players, including Michael 
Chang, Andre Agassi, Jay Berger and Aaron Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles, it appears probable that the team of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh will 
make their Davis Cup debut. If so, they would replace Ken Flach and Robert 
Seguso, who lost their first Davis Cup match ever in this year's semifinals 
against West Germany at Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ken Flach, who injured his ankle while playing doubles with partner Robert 
Seguso at the Wembley Indoors, may not be ready in time for the Nabisco Masters 
Doubles in December at London's Royal Albert Hall. 
</P>
<P>
College-bound tennis players who want to learn how to qualify for scholarships 
might be interested in attending the college and university scholarship 
meetings sponsored by the Southern California Tennis Assn.'s junior development 
program. The meetings will be held at 7 p.m. Dec. 5 at Morley Field Clubhouse 
at Balboa Park in San Diego and at 2 p.m. Dec. 17 at the Los Angeles Tennis 
Center at UCLA. For details, call Mark Winters of the SCTA at (213) 208-3838. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh Senior Grand Prix Masters tennis championships will be played Dec. 
6-10 at Rancho Bernardo Inn in San Diego. Some of the top players in their age 
groups are Bill McQuaid of Tustin and Mike Tunstall of Irvine in the men's 30; 
Leland Housman of San Diego in the men's 45 and Bob Duesler of Newport Beach in 
the men's 50. Bob Perry of San Diego, national men's hardcourt champion, will 
play in the men's 55 singles and team with last year's age-group runner-up John 
Sahratian of La Jolla in doubles. Dodo Cheney of Santa Monica, who has won 190 
national age-group championships, will play in the women's 60 singles and will 
team with Corky Murdock of Los Angeles in the women's 65 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Mueller of Tempe is top seeded in the National Hardcourt women's 
40-and-over singles championship Monday through Sunday at the La Jolla Beach 
and Tennis Club.

WARDE LEADS IRVINE'S UPSET OF STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Tom Warde scored five goals to lead UC Irvine's water polo team to an 
8-7 victory over No. 3 ranked Stanford Saturday to advance to the championship 
game of the NCAA tournament in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (26-6) will play top-ranked California tonight for the title. The 
Bears defeated Pepperdine, 10-9, in their semifinal game, 
</P>
<P>
Irvine took a 2-0 lead, on goals by sophomore Skylar Putman and freshman Pablo 
Yrizar. After a Stanford score, Warde scored his first goal of the game late in 
the first quarter, making the score 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Warde scored two more goals, including a penalty shot past Stanford goalie Todd 
Kemp, to give Irvine a 5-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, it was more Warde, who is the leading scorer in the 
tournament with 10 goals, when he scored his fourth consecutive goal of the 
game for Irvine late in the third quarter, to give the Anteaters a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Irvine had to survive a late Stanford rally, which saw 
the Cardinal tie the score, 6-6 with 4:05 remaining. Warde responded with his 
fifth goal of the game off of an assist from sophomore Putman, to put Irvine 
ahead, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
After John Redd added an insurance goal for Irvine with just 2:40 left in the 
game, Stanford's Jeff Oeding scored his third goal.

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
FANS BOO MAVERICKS ON THE COURT; SONICS BLAST THEM OFF OF IT, 117-70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One-sided games are not unusual these days in the NBA, especially since the 
league added four expansion teams in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But to have a veteran team lose by 47 points on their home court is still a 
rarity. 
</P>
<P>
It happened Saturday night at Dallas when 17,007 fans spent most of their time 
booing the Mavericks during their 117-70 loss to the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
There were people who thought the Mavericks would be a contender this season. 
But morale sagged when their best player, Roy Tarpley, was suspended because of 
a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing only, 25-22, in the first period, Dallas hit rock bottom. In the 
second half the Mavericks committed almost as many turnovers as they scored 
points: 29 points and 25 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, who shot only 36%, had the lowest half and the lowest total in 
the NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Blackman was 11 for 16. Without him the Mavericks would have been 16 
for 59 (27%). 
</P>
<P>
The 47-point deficit was the second-greatest in Dallas history, one point less 
than 116-68 drubbing by Houston in 1981. The 70 points scored by Dallas was its 
lowest at home in franchise history and was the lowest scored by a team in the 
NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, who have been hearing boos at home for lackadaisical play were 
led by Xavier McDaniel with 22 points. They are 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 104, Golden State 91 -- There are few things in sports as exciting as 
watching Michael Jordan take control of a game. 
</P>
<P>
A national television audience and 15,025 fans at the Oakland Coliseum Arena 
saw Jordan take over in the middle of the third quarter Saturday and lead the 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan triggered a 16-3 run that brought the Bulls from four points behind to a 
lead they never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
During the rally, Jordan stole the ball, grabbed rebounds, threw perfect passes 
and made acrobatic baskets. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth game in a Western swing for the Bulls that began Nov. 14 and 
will end tonight against the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who has had the flu and a knee injury, had his usual slow start -- 
making only one of his first nine shots -- but by the middle of the second 
quarter he was his usual self. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when 7-1 center Bill Cartwright was sidelined because of tendinitis in 
a knee, the Bulls needed rebounding. Jordan had 14 along with nine assists and 
29 points. After his poor start, he went 11 for 20 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
And, when the Warriors, who have struggled without a center most of the early 
season, pulled to 83-81 with 7:43 left, he scored eight points in a 21-10 
closing rush by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
New York 125, Milwaukee 108 -- Gerald Wilkins scored 11 of his 23 points during 
a 20-2 run by the Knicks in the second quarter at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks led, 34-31, when Wilkins led the rally that gave the Knicks a 51-36 
lead. The Bucks lost Jack Sikma in the second quarter. Sikma injured a thigh 
and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing sat out the fourth quarter and failed to reach 20 points for the 
first time this season. He finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 85, Cleveland 75 -- All the injury-riddled Cavaliers had left by the 
middle of the third quarter at Richfield, Ohio, were five substitutes, one of 
whom was playing with a broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, already without Larry Nance, Brad Daugherty and Tree Rollins, 
lost Mark Price and backup center Paul Mokeski with injuries in the third 
quarter. The only center left was Chris Dudley, who has a cast on his left 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 108, Boston 100 -- Moses Malone has had some big games, but this one at 
Atlanta has to rank with his best. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, a 34-year-old center in his 17th pro season, had 31 points and 18 
rebounds to lead the Hawks to the win over the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 111, Indiana 103 -- The Pacers were still celebrating a rare 
victory at Boston by the time this game at Indianapolis started. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed, 62-43, at halftime and when they settled down, it was too late to 
catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 112, New Jersey 98 -- After putting Ralph Sampson on the disabled 
list, the Kings won for the fourth time in 12 games in this game at Sacramento. 
Sampson is scheduled to undergo rehabilitation on his injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 107, Miami 88 -- Bernard King, playing mainly in the first and third 
quarters at Landover, Md., scored 26 points to lead the Bullets to an easy 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 81, Minnesota 73 -- J.R. Reid had 18 points and 18 rebounds at 
Charlotte and the Hornets beat the Timberwolves. DAN HAFNER

Once again, San Francisco commuters have ceded the right of way to the lowly 
salamander, detouring around South Park Drive to allow the newts safe passage 
to their breeding grounds just across the usually busy roadway. Each winter, 
hundreds of the semiaquatic salamanders emerge from hibernation in Tilden Park 
and begin pouring across the road in the Berkeley hills to lay their eggs. They 
head back across the road in spring to resume hibernation. As in the past, 
local officials have closed off the street to allow for the annual migration. 
The road closure usually lasts at least three days, a park spokesman said.

THE GEYSERS REGION LOSING ITS STEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world's largest complex of natural geothermal electrical plants, clustered 
in Northern California's The Geysers region, is running out of steam must 
faster than expected, according to energy experts. The area's more than 30 
plants were originally expected to produce enough electricity for 500,000 
households and account for 38% of the world's geothermal capacity. But steam 
pressure in the area has dropped below 200 pounds per square inch, less than 
half what it was when development began three decades ago. State Energy 
Commission Chairman Charles Imbrecht said the potential financial loss could 
reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

San Francisco attorney Vaughn R. Walker, whose nomination as a U.S. district 
judge was delayed for two years because of controversy surrounding his 
membership in a club with a record of discrimination, has won Senate 
confirmation. Walker was a 15-year member in the Olympic Club of San Francisco, 
which had no black members until last year and still excludes women. He 
resigned Feb. 15, but critics said the move came too late and questioned his 
claim to have opposed the exclusion of women.

BETTER TIMES PROMISED FOR HISTORIC MALIBU PIER; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARK: RESTAURATEUR AND PARTNERS, ABOUT TO TAKE CONCESSION RIGHTS IN A 
20-YEAR DEAL WITH THE STATE, SAY THEY'LL TURN THE STRUCTURE INTO A 'CLASS ACT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a leading attraction in a community short on landmarks, the Malibu Pier has 
seldom won much respect. 
</P>
<P>
Long battered by severe storms and neglected by absentee landlords, the 
84-year-old pier collapsed into the Pacific Ocean half a century ago. Once 
rebuilt, it was twice closed as unsafe, the last time, in 1983, for an entire 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nine years after the state spent $2.5 million to acquire the pier in a bid 
to rescue it from decades of neglect, a Malibu restaurant owner who is soon to 
become the pier's new concession manager predicts better times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't aim to come in here just to make a fast buck," said Bob Yuro, 
co-owner of Alice's Restaurant on the pier. "We intend to make the pier a class 
act, in keeping with the kind of place Malibu is." 
</P>
<P>
State officials last month announced plans to award Yuro and three partners 
concession rights at the pier for the next 20 years in exchange for a promise 
to repair and refurbish the neglected landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, to be finalized in two weeks, ends a turbulent year in the life 
of the pier, which state officials say is visited by more than 500,000 people 
from around the world each year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Yuro and his partners say their plans for the pier are incomplete, 
among the ideas being considered are a multilevel gift shop at the pier's 
seaward end, a new restaurant across from Alice's at the landward end and an 
expanded sport-fishing operation. 
</P>
<P>
The group has said it will install new lights, benches and railings. 
</P>
<P>
"This pier is going to become a focal point for Malibu, a place that glitters 
at night, and that is a fun, family-oriented attraction during the day," Yuro 
said. "We may even have jazz concerts out here." 
</P>
<P>
The pier's run-down condition has long been an embarrassment to state officials 
who spent nearly $2 million on structural repairs after acquiring the pier in 
1980 only to have a severe 1983 winter storm leave it in worse shape than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Vallanoweth, who heads the Concession Program Division of the state 
parks department, said the state's main aim in awarding the concession contract 
to Yuro and his partners is to have the pier repaired and properly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the contract, Yuro and his partners, who include Malibu builder 
Fred Patrick, have agreed to make "significant structural improvements" to the 
pier during the next five years, Vallanoweth said. 
</P>
<P>
State and private estimates of the repair cost range from $2 million to $4 
million. However, Yuro said the group expects to do the repairs for less 
because Patrick has expertise in pier work. 
</P>
<P>
Some Malibu community leaders, and the Malibu Chamber of Commerce, criticized 
the state earlier this year for not doing the repair work itself before turning 
the pier over to a private concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
With the choice of Yuro, however, who has operated Alice's on the pier since 
1974, the criticism appears to have dissipated. Besides Yuro and Patrick, the 
other partners are Alice's co-owner, Peter Palazzo, and Andre Guerrero, the 
restaurant's executive chef. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Mr. Yuro and the others will do a good job," said Mary Lou Blackwood, 
the chamber's executive director. "They're familiar with the pier, and know 
what it takes to make sure it is properly repaired and maintained." 
</P>
<P>
The state had been looking for a new operator for months, trying to fill the 
gap created by a former landlord, who abruptly walked away from a 20-year lease 
last year and then sued the state for more than $20 million in damages, 
alleging breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, the state had awarded the concession contract to West Los 
Angeles lawyer Joel Ladin, who promptly announced that he was raising the rents 
of Alice's and Malibu Sport Fishing, the pier's mainstays, by up to 500%. 
</P>
<P>
The sport-fishing enterprise closed its doors amid much fanfare and a huge 
farewell party, and Yuro threatened to move the popular restaurant to Pacific 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Ladin, unable to attract new businesses to the pier, and faced with having to 
spend more money than expected for repairs, walked away from the contract last 
November. His suit against the state, which alleges it did not fully disclose 
the extent of damage to the pier, is pending. 
</P>
<P>
The pier, built in 1905 as part of the private domain of Malibu rancher 
Frederick Hastings Rindge, was nearly destroyed by a severe storm in 1942. 
Rebuilt in 1944, it served as a U.S. Coast Guard security station toward the 
end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
It was acquired by the state in 1980 from Los Angeles businessman William 
Huber, whose father had bought the pier for $50,000 and rebuilt it in 1944. 
Sources familiar with the acquisition say that Huber had tried to sell the pier 
numerous times before persuading the state to buy it. In one well-publicized 
attempt, he even tried to auction off the pier -- on the pier itself -- four 
months before the state acquired it. 
</P>
<P>
But with state funds unavailable for repairs, revenues from the pier's 
businesses lagging and the pier's already poor condition made worse by the 1983 
storm, the state's ambitious renovation plans languished. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some familiar with the pier's checkered history have privately 
questioned whether the new operators will be able to succeed where others have 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
Yuro, however, remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting control of the pier has long been my dream," he said. "But I didn't 
get into this on emotion. If we didn't think there was an opportunity here, we 
wouldn't be doing it."

SIX DEAD AS GUN BATTLES RAGE OVER THANKSGIVING WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
The Thanksgiving holiday weekend brought no respite in the ritual of weekend 
violence in Los Angeles, as at least six people died and several more were 
injured in a string of unrelated shootings Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police responding to a gang-related gun battle in Inglewood Friday night 
fatally shot a Montebello man, and a shoot-out Friday in a Glendale tavern left 
two men dead. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police said Michael Washington, 21, was shot twice after he raised a 
revolver at an officer who was attempting to detain him. He died early Saturday 
at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shooting occurred after officers responded to reports of "gang 
members fighting with guns in the street" on West 85th Street. Washington, 
police said, was one of several men attempting to flee when officers arrived. 
He stopped after being ordered to do so, but then raised a long-barreled 
revolver, police said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Both officers fired once at Washington, striking him with both bullets in the 
upper torso," the statement said. Sgt. Bill Snyder on Saturday declined to 
release the names of the officers involved and said he did not know whether the 
pair were in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, police arrested five suspects early Saturday in connection with 
the shoot-out at a tavern in the city's industrial area the night before. Two 
men were killed in the gunfire and a third left in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The motive behind the shooting at The Rustic Inn -- a pool hall and bar at the 
corner of San Fernando Road and Chevy Chase Drive -- is still being 
investigated, said Sgt. Karl Ward, a Glendale police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials did not release the names of the suspects. The identities of 
the victims also were withheld pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
One victim was taken to Glendale Memorial Hospital, where he died late Friday 
night, Ward said. The second victim was taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center and died Saturday morning. The third victim remains in serious condition 
at Glendale Memorial Hospital after undergoing surgery, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Rivas, 34, who rents an apartment above the bar, said brawls are 
frequent at the tavern. "The police come over three or four times a week here," 
he said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Several gangs are known to be active in the area, but Ward said he didn't 
believe the incident was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
In other incidents, a 42-year-old South Los Angeles man, whose name was 
withheld, died early Saturday after several shots were fired through the front 
door of his home in the 1600 block of West Vernon Avenue. Los Angeles police 
said they did not know the motive for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, police were seeking two gunmen who killed a businessman 
during an apparent robbery attempt. Frank Wade, 40, was shot Friday night as he 
was leaving his business in the 3000 block of South Western Avenue. He died 
later at Brotman Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Clay, the 51-year-old owner of a check-cashing business, also was shot 
to death in a robbery Saturday morning outside his business near Pico Boulevard 
and Burnside Avenue, police said. Three suspects are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Redondo Beach police were investigating the beating of a man found 
near the city pier early Saturday. The man, who was reported in critical 
condition at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, was found in the 300 block 
of South Harbor Drive, Redondo Beach police said Saturday. His name was not 
known.

10 INJURED IN 3-CAR COLLISION IN VALINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten people were injured, four critically, in a three-car collision Saturday 
night at Sunset Avenue and Amar Road in the San Gabriel Valley community of 
Valinda, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash scattered car seats, strollers and other debris from the wrecked cars 
as far as 100 yards from the intersection. Firefighters who responded to the 9 
p.m. accident had to use the Jaws of Life to cut through one of the cars to 
free a trapped victim, a Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims, Eustolio Caldera, 38, was listed in critical condition with 
head and abdominal injuries at Inter-Community Medical Center in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The other victims were transported to several area hospitals. Hospital 
officials could not immediately provide information on their conditions. Their 
names were not released.

Santa's helpers will be parading him all over town today. 
</P>
<P>
And he'll be watched by up to a million and a half people who will have their 
choice of holiday parades in Hollywood, East Los Angeles and Pasadena to signal 
the march into the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Christmas Parade is expected to draw up to 1 million spectators. 
It will take place from 6-8 p.m. and include more than 100 celebrities, 20 
floats, 15 bands, a dozen silver-saddled equestrian units and one Santa on a 
40-foot sleigh float. 
</P>
<P>
The East Los Angeles Christmas Parade is scheduled to take place from 1-3 p.m. 
It is expected to attract a crowd of up to 250,000 with its 30 celebrities, 20 
bands, 18 floats, two grand marshals and one Santa riding atop a supermarket 
float. 
</P>
<P>
The Doo Dah Parade, a spoof of the annual Rose Parade, will begin at noon. The 
loosely organized event will include 1,500 marchers in such tongue-in-cheek 
entries as briefcase -- and chain saw -- drill teams and an unknown number of 
Santas who could show up on anything from bicycles to roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said parade-goers should plan on arriving early to find parking. 
</P>
<P>
The 58th annual Hollywood parade will start on Sunset Boulevard at Van Ness 
Avenue and travel west to Highland Avenue, where it will turn north. At 
Hollywood Boulevard, it will travel east to about the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Its grand marshal will be Sammy Davis Jr., and participants will include pop 
singer Tiffany, actor Sam Elliott and the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles, said 
Linda Sauers of the sponsoring Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. The parade will 
be televised live on KTLA, Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
The 15th annual East Los Angeles parade will start at Eastern Avenue and travel 
east on Whittier Boulevard before turning north on Atlantic Boulevard. It ends 
at 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Its grand marshals will be actors Catherine Bach and Eddie Albert Jr. The 
parade will be telecast live on KMEX, Channel 34, said parade coordinator Art 
Marquez. The parade is being sponsored by the Whittier Boulevard Merchants 
Assn. and the East Los Angeles Jaycees. 
</P>
<P>
The "14th Occasional Doo Dah Parade" will start at noon at Fair Oaks Avenue and 
Union Street and will travel north on Fair Oaks, east on Holly Street, south on 
Raymond Avenue, west on Colorado Boulevard, south on Pasadena Avenue, east on 
Green Street and south on Fair Oaks to Central Park, said coordinator Peter 
Apanel.

SEARCH FOR 3RD BOAT VICTIM CALLED OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday called off the search for the body of a third 
person believed killed in a Thanksgiving Day boating accident off Santa 
Catalina Island that still has investigators puzzled as to a cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We have searched and searched and searched and we have decided no more further 
leads are evolving," said Petty Officer James Schweikhardt of the Long Beach 
Coast Guard station. "The case will be reopened if something develops." 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of an elderly Hemet couple, Robert Reid, 84, and Thelma Reid, 75, 
were found late Thursday amid debris from the wreckage of the Lucky R, the 
cabin cruiser owned by their son, Charles Reid of Long Beach. Relatives told 
Coast Guard officials that Charles Reid also was aboard the boat, which was 
found demolished about 10 miles northeast of Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard investigators are trying to piece together remains of the boat in 
an effort to determine what happened.

PLAYING FROM THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Often in jazz, whatever status an artist has achieved, all roads lead back to 
humble quarters -- after hours sessions in jazz dives where some of the most 
inspired improvisations are coaxed out. 
</P>
<P>
For guitarist Mike Stern, that casual think tank is the 55 Club on Christopher 
Street in Greenwich Village. When Stern first started playing there four years 
ago at the behest of his bassist friend Jeff Andrews, the guitarist was coming 
off the residual high of having played with Miles Davis and Jaco Pastorius. 
</P>
<P>
Now with the acclaim afforded his sideman work, and with three of his own 
albums on Atlantic Records, Stern, 36, is considered to be one of the hottest 
guitarists of the current New York scene, alongside John Scofield (with whom he 
played in Davis's band) and Steve Khan (who produced Stern's last two albums). 
</P>
<P>
Along with his longtime collaborator saxist Bob Berg, Stern will be making a 
West Coast tour following his latest album, "Jigsaw," with a stop at Santa 
Monica's At My Place on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But on an unseasonably pleasant November morning in New York, Stern was doing 
strictly standards, tearing up the tiny subterranean confines of the 55, 
serving up heated solos to the delight of a dense, wee hour crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Amidst the funky ambience, Stern explored new routes of expression during a 
25-minute version of "There Is No Greater Love," spurred on by bassist Lincoln 
Goines and drummer Brian Melvin. 
</P>
<P>
Stern is sold on the 55 Club and its therapeutic value. "It's a great place for 
me to work out and just play," says the amiable guitarist. "It's a seedy little 
place, a perfect place, where there's no constraints and no pressure." There, 
he says, he works on things "that I haven't really documented yet on record." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, though, Stern's recording career is more geared towards his own 
music, an appealing variation on what might be called post-fusion music -- jazz 
melded with rock, R&amp;B and other idioms. 
</P>
<P>
The guitar is a centerpiece around the Stern apartment: Mike's wife of 10 
years, Leni, is a guitarist in her own right, with a recent release on Enja 
Records, "Secrets." While she often collaborates with other guitar players, the 
two Sterns rarely appear together in public, musically speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot to be married and feel so strongly about our work," Mike said. "We 
may do some recording together. I love the way she's writing. She's got a 
really beautiful way of writing -- and of playing. It's great to hear that 
evolve. Around the apartment, we play a lot together, but we keep it separate." 
</P>
<P>
One of the hallmarks of Stern's Atlantic albums is their strength of 
composition. Stern fashions intelligent songs of both infectious melodiousness 
and subtle adventurism. Whereas much of the material being released in the 
rock-inflected jazz sphere tends to be either cover songs or vehicles for 
soloing, Stern's writing shows concern for craft and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be getting harder," Stern notes about the writing process, 
"because there are more pages that I throw away now. The more I do it, the more 
I want to grow. I'll see certain things and think, 'Well, I've repeated myself 
there, I've written that tune already.' " 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City, Stern threw himself himself into jazz at Boston's 
Berklee School of Music. A student of guitarist Pat Metheny's, Stern, on his 
recommendation, landed a job with Blood, Sweat and Tears in the late 1970s. 
Miles Davis, coming out of his 5-year hiatus in 1980, liked Stern's fluency in 
both jazz and rock and hired him. Stern played on Davis's "The Man With the 
Horn," "We Want Miles" and "Star People" albums. Later gigs have included an 
ongoing association with saxist Michael Brecker. 
</P>
<P>
Having just returned from a successful European trip with his current touring 
unit -- Berg on sax, Goines on bass and Dennis Chambers on drums -- Stern, who 
tends to be self-effacing, seemed atypically excited about his project. Is he 
more comfortable these days as a bandleader? 
</P>
<P>
"It's always up and down. I'm definitely getting a little bit more relaxed with 
that. I won't say confident, but a little more relaxed. And it's great to be 
co-leading this band with Bob. We really have a good personal relationship. 
He's one of my closest friends and, of course, he's an amazing player. So that 
makes it more comfortable for me. It feels very natural. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as making records go, that's always difficult. I've actually made four 
records, but three that I actually showed up for," Stern laughs. 
</P>
<P>
His official record debut in the early 1980s was "Neesh" (a hard-to-find item 
on Trio records), recorded at a time when Stern's chemical indulgences were 
getting the best of him. He has since cleaned up his act, but the memory of 
that dark period seems bound up in the memory of the album. 
</P>
<P>
One of Stern's kindred spirits during the early '80s was the late bassist, 
bandleader Jaco Pastorius -- who, in later years, slid into drug excess and 
suffered a fatal beating outside of a Florida night club two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people used to say we were like brothers," Stern recalls, shaking his 
head. "His death was very painful for me. I went a different route; I cooled 
out, and he didn't -- and would not. I could see that it was taking a toll. And 
it took the ultimate toll. It was really tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Like Pastorius, Stern moves convincingly in different stylistic circles. His 
solos will often weave together spidery bebop lines with toothy, rock-oriented 
blues licks. If jazz is his passion, Stern has no aversion to playing the 
venerable riffs reminiscent of Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't particularly like being different for different's sake," he said. "I'm 
more into trying to get the emotion across. That's the bottom line for me in 
music. I want to have things be interesting on a somewhat more cerebral level. 
But, much more than that, it's got to come from the heart as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of attitude, there's a lot of similarity between Jimi Hendrix and 
John Coltrane -- in terms of just raw emotion. Sometimes I try to make music 
without even thinking about the instrument, but the emotion. That's one thing I 
really got a sense of from Miles. He's always looking for a certain kind of 
emotion or attitude . . . That's where he begins and ends. Of course, then you 
have to think about how to get it, the drums should play like this and the bass 
like this. But basically, you don't want to lose that certain feeling you're 
trying to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
Given the vicissitudes in his still-young life, Stern seems to be in a good 
cycle now, with his checkered past serving as a point of comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"It's some serious point of contrast," Stern laughs. "Sometimes (life has) been 
called a gift, it's a blessing. But sometimes it doesn't feel like that -- you 
feel like 'Who needs this anyway?' But I can call upon times in my life when 
things were worse, and it gives me perspective."

EXPERIENCING JIMI HENDRIX; 
</P>
<P>
FOR TODAY'S BUDDING CROP OF BLACK ROCK MUSICIANS, HE'S MORE THAN A GUITAR HERO 
-- HE'S A ROLE MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some sounds speak directly to the subconscious -- the blast of a cherry bomb, 
the howl of a siren . . . the scream of Jimi Hendrix's feedback at the start of 
"Foxy Lady." 
</P>
<P>
If Jimi Hendrix were alive, he would be 47 on Monday. To mark the occasion, the 
Black Rock Coalition -- a nonprofit organization formed to fight racism and 
combat negative stereotypes in the music industry -- will present the first 
"Jimi Hendrix Birthday Celebration" at the Music Machine in West Los Angeles at 
8 p.m. on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a field almost exclusively populated by white musicians, Hendrix has served 
as a role model for a cadre of young black rockers. His achievement was to 
reclaim title to a musical form pioneered by black innovators like Little 
Richard and Chuck Berry in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
For years, critics and musicians in pop circles have hailed Hendrix -- who died 
on Sept. 18, 1970, as a result of inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate 
intoxication -- as one of the most creative and influential rock guitarists 
ever. But his impact on today's budding crop of black rock musicians runs even 
deeper. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of Hendrix in the same context as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm 
X," said Vernon Reid, guitarist for Living Colour and a founder of the Black 
Rock Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he was one of the seminal black figures. Unfortunately, people get so 
wrapped up in his guitar playing that they tend to overlook what he did with 
sound and composition. Like Coltrane, Miles (Davis) and Ornette (Coleman), 
Jimi's presence fundamentally changed the equation." 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Kravitz, whose '60s-influenced solo debut album, "Let Love Rule," has 
received kudos from critics and in college and alternative radio circles, cites 
Hendrix as a crucial link in the development of black music. 
</P>
<P>
"For Jimi radio airplay wasn't the premise," Kravitz said. "He didn't just 
write hit songs or hooks. Back then rock music was about free expression and 
Jimi was an innovative artist at the top of his form. People tend to forget 
that rock 'n' roll is black music -- not just white people either. Black people 
forget too. Hendrix opened the doors for guys like me. He is the perfect 
example of a black artist doing what he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Nelson, who plays bass for the BRC (Black Rock Coalition) All Stars, the 
band that will open the Music Machine bill (local rockers Total Eclipse and 
East Coast rappers Culture Shock are also scheduled), says it would be 
impossible to overestimate 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix's importance in the local black rock community. 
</P>
<P>
"Hendrix did for rock what Charlie Parker did for jazz," Nelson said. "He was 
like a modern-day Bach or Beethoven, a musical mastermind who came in and 
completely changed the entire scene." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the Hendrix tribute will be used by the BRC to underwrite the 
coalition's ongoing campaign to secure a star for Hendrix on the Hollywood 
Boulevard Walk of Fame. Local BRC co-director Ray Jarvis says the coalition 
chose to single out Hendrix's contribution because his music represents the 
"essence of what the BRC is all about." 
</P>
<P>
The BRC was established in 1985 by Vernon Reid, writer Gregg Tate and film 
producer Konda Mason. Local directors MaryAlice Bailey, Norwood Fisher, Mason 
and Jarvis opened the Los Angeles chapter in May. 
</P>

"It's funny, this idea of treating black rock like it's a separate sub-genre of 
rock," Reid said. "When a white band like AC/DC plays rock, they're actually 
playing black music. Rock 'n' roll was created by black musicians." 
</P>
<P>
Reid believes that Hendrix's race is central to his relevance. 
</P>
<P>
"Who could listen to 'Machine Gun' without thinking about black soldiers in 
Vietnam?" Reid asked. "It's because he was black that his version of 'The Star 
Spangled Banner' is so powerful. It's too bad that Jimi was taken from us 
before he could really explore the jazz direction." 
</P>
<P>
BRC member Dr. Frank Gilliam, a professor in UCLA's political science 
department, says one reason Hendrix is so revered is because his music helped 
many middle-class black rock fans overcome a social identity crisis they 
experienced during the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us in the BRC were raised in the suburbs, the first wave of black 
working-class children," Gilliam said. "When we were growing up, rock was not 
cool music for black kids to enjoy. Either you listened to 'soul' music or else 
you were considered 'whitewashed.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Gilliam, Hendrix's music and his anti-war, pro-civil rights 
political stance offered black teen-agers who loved rock 'n' roll a new ethnic 
role model -- a black man internationally respected for modernizing black roots 
music who was unafraid to experiment with Anglo-cultural influences. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimi personified the 'transculturation' of America for middle-class blacks," 
Gilliam said. "He validated our position in society, the fact that we were 
proud to be black, but also not enslaved by the black 
</P>
<P>
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix's penchant for loud, dissonant feedback altered the course of funk 
music too. Many R&amp;B musicians who cut their teeth on James Brown and Sly 
&amp; the Family Stone were stunned by the power of his eclecticism. 
</P>
<P>
George Clinton, whose work has influenced black stars from Prince to De La 
Soul, says Hendrix's psychedelic approach to the pentatonic scale not only 
taught him to respect blues music, but also encouraged him to experiment in new 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimi was definitely the one we held up when we wanted to reach for something," 
Clinton said. "The way he could control feedback and make it sound so symphonic 
truly transcended logic. There were no boundaries to his playing. One minute he 
would sound like Curtis Mayfield, next thing he'd be doing Ravi Shankar. His 
music gave me the freedom to go out and be anything I felt like being 
musically." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members also consider Hendrix to be the first rock musician to 
seriously explore atonal improvisation with amplified feedback and electronic 
distortion. During the late 1960s, his efforts in this regard drew praise from 
respected figures in the jazz community like Miles Davis and Gil Evans. In 
Davis' 1989 autobiography, the trumpeter credits Hendrix with influencing his 
shift toward a more rock-edged sound. 
</P>
<P>
James Marshall Hendrix was born in Seattle on Nov. 27, 1942. Before bursting on 
the pop scene as a headliner in 1967, he worked the chitlin circuit as a 
sideman. Between 1963 and 1965, he toured with and/or performed session work 
for many R&amp;B stars, including King Curtis, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, the Isley 
Brothers, Jackie Wilson, James Brown, Solomon Burke and Little Richard. 
</P>
<P>
Little Richard remembers Hendrix as a consummate showman who strongly resented 
the racism he encountered in the music industry: "Jimi helped open up rock 'n' 
roll to black music. He broke down the doors and burned up all the wood. He was 
one big package." 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix moved to England when he was 23 and began pioneering new musical genres 
like metal and fusion before they even had names. Within a year of linking up 
with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding to form the Jimi Hendrix 
Experience, Hendrix was cutting gold albums and selling out international 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
After that integrated power trio folded in 1969, Hendrix created the Band of 
Gypsies with black musicians Buddy Miles (drums) and Billy Cox (bass) and began 
to publicly support the political struggles of blacks, American Indians and 
Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
During his life, Hendrix's playing not only dazzled his fans and and peers, but 
it also impressed many of the artists whose styles he emulated. During the 
course of his career, he jammed with pioneers like Roland Kirk, B.B. King and 
Muddy Waters. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Mayfield, whose influence on Hendrix is evident in compositions like 
"Little Wing" and "Electric Ladyland," says that even though he had the 
opportunity to play with Hendrix, he still stands in awe of the late 
guitarist's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimi's approach to music transcends racial barriers. His imagination spoke to 
people on a deeper level than that," Mayfield said. "With the psychedelics and 
what have you, he was almost like a scientist, studying the effects." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hendrix released only five albums during his brief career, his legacy 
lives on. In the 19 years since his death, six official compilations and more 
than 400 bootleg records have appeared on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Merlis, head of publicity at Warner Bros. Records, says Hendrix is still 
the label's most consistent seller. His original five albums have all reached 
the 3 million sales mark. Nine albums have been digitally remastered and 
reissued as CDs on Warner Bros./Reprise. "Smash Hits," a best-of collection 
first released in 1969 and containing such classic Hendrix numbers as "Foxy 
Lady" and "Purple Haze," was re-released early this month in CD, and comes 
complete with a new high-tech graphics track that allows fans who own JVC's new 
CD-plus-graphics unit to view synchronized psychedelic imagery while listening. 
</P>
<P>
For serious fans, a musical transcription series called the Jimi Hendrix 
Reference Library is also available in album-and-book packages from Hal Leonard 
Publishing. The latest addition to the catalogue is called "Variations on a 
Theme: 'Red House' -- Evolution of the Blues," featuring narration and singing 
by blues legend and Hendrix fanatic John Lee Hooker. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other prominent music figures of the 1960s' anti-Establishment drug 
culture, Hendrix seems to have little difficulty competing in today's 
techno-synth market. Producer Alan Douglas, who runs Are You Experienced, the 
Hollywood company that merchandises all official Hendrix estate music and 
memorabilia, estimates that 75% of Hendrix's current audience is between 12 and 
20 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimi is no nostalgia figure," Douglas said. "He is still a relevant force in 
rock. Kids today relate to his music as if he was still alive."

<P>
JAMES TURRELL IS WORKING TO TURN AN EXTINCT VOLCANO INTO AN ART PIECE THAT 
FUNCTIONS AS A VERY SPECIAL OBSERVATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I like sites that have no function and are only inhabited by consciousness," 
says James Turrell, the California artist who has spent more than a decade at 
work on a massive environmental artwork that may stand as the ultimate 
cathedral of consciousness upon completion in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Transforming Rodan Crater, the cinder cone of an extinct volcano at the edge of 
Arizona's Painted Desert, so that it functions as a natural observatory and 
all-purpose "focusing device," Turrell is creating an artwork of unprecedented 
scale and subtlety. And though his name rarely appears in the popular press, 
this driven visionary and his beloved volcano are legendary within the art 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is about making people aware that light isn't something that reveals, 
so much as it itself is the revelation," says Turrell, a 46-year-old artist who 
first made a name for himself in the late '60s with installations employing 
light to explore perceptual phenomena. Enhancing one's awareness of space and 
time is the essential function of the crater Turrell purchased in 1977 for 
$64,000, and even with the bulk of the construction yet to be done, visitors 
can have that experience now simply by laying down in its bowl and gazing up at 
the sky. When it's completed, however, Rodan Crater will offer several exotic 
variations on this theme. 
</P>
<P>
Those who make the pilgrimage to the crater, which is 50 miles northeast of 
Flagstaff, Ariz., will park their cars three miles from the 500,000-year-old 
volcano, then follow a curved footpath leading to the mountain that houses the 
crater itself. When the project is completed, no more than four people will 
inhabit the site at a given time, and visitors will be encouraged to stay for 
no less than 24 hours in order to witness at least one cycle of celestial 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will travel through a 1,035-foot tunnel leading from the outside base 
of the crater to its bowl, which has been shaped to accentuate celestial 
vaulting (a phenomenon that makes the sky appear to form a domed ceiling 
overhead). They will visit several carved-out chambers built into the banked 
walls of the volcano that will be attuned to specific astronomical occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
The "Eastern Space," for instance, will be geared toward sunrises, while the 
"Southern Space" will be shot with sun in the afternoons. Other enclosures will 
function like pinhole cameras, causing images of planetary alignments to appear 
on the walls, or will focus on specific atmospheric conditions. Once every 18.6 
years, the moon will be in perfect alignment with the opening of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
With visitors encouraged to spend at least 24 hours at the site, Rodan Crater 
must feature living quarters, and the project also includes plans for an 
airplane hangar, a planetarium, a museum to house other works by Turrell and a 
visitors' center with a library. 
</P>
<P>
The price tag for this dauntingly ambitious art center is a surprisingly modest 
$3.2 million. Thus far, Turrell has raised all the funds himself, with $204,000 
coming in the form of a MacArthur Grant in 1984, which ran out last year. The 
Skystone Foundation, an organization he formed in 1983 to administrate the 
crater, received $75,000. Money from the DIA Foundation, the National Endowment 
for the Arts and a Guggenheim grant have also been devoured by the crater. 
</P>
<P>
Turrell and a crew largely composed of volunteers have spent the past 10 years 
on research, surveying, fund-raising and sculpting the crater bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I'd like to lose myself in actually just working on the piece, I 
constantly have to be thinking about generating more funds. We're gearing up 
for the big push now," says the artist, bouncing down the long stretch of 
unpaved road leading to the crater. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently not the least bit fazed by the enormity of the undertaking, he adds: 
"I've never once regreted taking this project on, nor have I ever felt 
discouraged because I paced myself for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
A graceful, soft-spoken man with a surprisingly wacky sense of humor and the 
seductive voice of a deejay, Turrell is simultaneously a highly original and 
sensitive thinker and a little boy enchanted with his arsenal of gigantic toys. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the equipment used on the crater was bought at sales of used military 
goods, and Turrell lovingly restores every piece to perfection. Supporting 
himself on and off for years by restoring vintage planes, Turrell has also 
worked as an air cartographer and pilot, and his approach to art making has 
been largely shaped by endless hours spent poking around the heavens in 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in using light as a way to mark perception," he 
recalls. "I can remember being acutely aware of light as a kid and lying on my 
bed staring at the plays of light on the ceiling. As a child I was also 
impressed by the writings of St. Exupery. He was a pilot and his books opened 
up a whole world to me." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Pasadena, Turrell is the son of an aeronautical engineer. After 
graduating from Pomona College in 1965 with a degree in perceptual psychology, 
he studied art at UC Irvine, then graduated with a master's degree in art from 
Claremont in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Coming of age amid the spiritual idealism of the '60s, Turrell has centered his 
work on the themes of light, perception and self-knowledge. Credited as being 
one of the pioneers of California light and space art, he had his first one-man 
show in Los Angeles in 1967 at the age of 24, then didn't have another major 
show here for 18 years. (One of Turrell's light pieces from 1970, "Stuck," is 
currently on view at the Ace Gallery.) 
</P>
<P>
Though Rodan Crater seems a rather far-flung idea, it makes perfect sense in 
light of Turrell's history, and is an ambitious outgrowth of everything he has 
done. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in painting, but I'm not interested in being a painter because 
the way I see it, there are enough antiques," says Turrell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather set up an experience than tell you a story because a direct 
experience is always more powerful than a secondhand recounting of one. We're 
just crustaceans who live in shells called cars and buildings, and I'm 
interested in the idea of shells that open meaningfully onto the spaces outside 
rather than just having a window cut for a view. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose my work does have certain affinities with Eastern philosophy," adds 
Turrell, who likens Rodan Crater to a Japanese garden in that he intends that 
it merge into nature rather than appear man-made. "But I am an American artist, 
and this piece is about spaces and colors that don't exist anywhere but in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really beautiful out here," says Turrell, gazing appreciately at the late 
afternoon landscape. "I was flying across here at just this time of day when I 
first saw the crater, and it really stood out to me as the one." 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, Rodan Crater comes into view. Turrell spent every day for seven 
months (and the money from a Guggenheim grant on aviation fuel) flying from 
Canada to Mexico and from the western slopes of the Rockies to the Pacific 
Coast in search of the proper site for his piece, and it's easy to see why he 
settled on Rodan Crater. 
</P>
<P>
One of 273 craters in the San Francisco Volcanic Field (extinct since the late 
Pleistocene Era), Rodan Crater stands out as a remarkably sensual and 
compelling geologic formation. With the Painted Desert's muted symphony of 
yellow and pink forming a backdrop on the remote horizon, Rodan Crater appears 
at this distance to be a soft, perfectly formed mound colored in deep shades of 
burgundy, brown and black. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw this from the sky I was struck by its position off by itself, 
its form, and the fact that it's much more colorful than the surrounding 
craters," Turrell explains. "It was love at first sight I guess." 
</P>
<P>
With 20 more minutes of driving and two locked gates behind us, we arrive at 
the crater and begin to trudge up its side. As is Turrell's intention, there's 
no evidence that this is an artwork in progress; after he reshaped the crater, 
its natural vegetation was carefully restored. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a staff of six, but most of the work is done with contractors," he 
explains. "We do the plumbing ourselves, but all the earth moving is done with 
contractors except for the restorative work, which we do. Some of the work is 
done by students from two local universities and the surveying is mostly done 
by our crew and student volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
Having to hire heavy construction crews, Turrell encounters a fair amount of 
skepticism as to the feasibility of his undertaking, but he takes the naysayers 
in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a space with a perfectly symmetrical rim that would shape 
the sky, and though this crater came close to doing that, it didn't do it 
completely," he recalls. "So, I contracted a crew to finish shaping the rim and 
we wound up having to move over 200,000 cubic yards of earth before the effect 
I was after began to happen. When I first hired this heavy equipment crew -- 
and believe me, these guys are not exactly operagoers -- I told them they might 
think they were moving earth but in fact they were shaping the sky. They said, 
'Yeah, sure, just tell us where you want the dirt moved.' A few days go by and 
at that point I'm into $18,000 worth of earthwork and nothing was happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to wonder what I was doing out here and self-doubt was really 
beginning to creep in -- then finally, it began to happen. . . . You could see 
the difference in the shape of the sky. It was a pretty terrific moment when 
these guys got down off their Cats and first looked up and saw it." 
</P>
<P>
Cresting the rim of the crater, we walk to the center of the bowl, lay down and 
look up -- and yes, it does work. Gazing up from this symmetrical bowl joining 
earth and sky, one's depth perception is altered, and the sky takes on the 
appearance of a perfectly curved dome; you experience a strong sense of being 
"in" something, even though you're surrounded by open, empty space. Turrell 
probably has had this experience more than a thousand times, yet he seems 
utterly enchanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Our cities put out so much light at night for protection that we've overlit 
the atmosphere to the point that we can't see the stars or the universe," he 
muses as he stares into the sky. "Even though light pollution isn't high on the 
list of ecology problems, I think it has an enormous impact because it warps 
our perception of the universe we feel ourselves a part of." 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening over dinner, Turrell and a pilot friend of his, Rod Hill, 
swap stories about particularly crazy pilots they have known and talk a bit 
about a project they're working on. Turrell is currently collaborating with 
Hill in an attempt to take a glider higher than it has ever been taken before 
-- a complex undertaking requiring endless preparation. Clearly, there's more 
to life than Rodan Crater for Turrell, who maintains an active exhibition 
schedule in the United States and Europe (the Europeans are wild about Turrell 
and his crater). Rodan Crater has been the consuming passion of Turrell's life 
thus far, but he envisions a day when he will part ways with his magic 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually we want to place it with an institution, but a lot of places don't 
want a white elephant they'll have to put money into," Turrell says of his 
long-range plans for the piece. "How many people it will accommodate has been a 
bone of contention in our attempts to get funding, and that may be a problem 
when we attempt to place it. Personally, I'd like it to be a fairly one-on-one 
experience, and though I want it to be available to anyone who's interested, I 
also want to preserve the experience -- because this isn't about looking at a 
sculptural work, it's something that requires a bit of time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also not interested in hanging around and hosting it for the rest of my 
life. My job is done at the opening and it might be a relief to walk away from 
it at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to summarize what Rodan Crater means for him, he slowly replies: "I'm not 
interested in optical phenomena or the technical aspects of the piece. The work 
I do isn't about that -- my work is about looking at the world. I don't presume 
to tell you how to look at the world, but artists do offer tips and give you a 
vantage on the world. Rodan Crater is a vantage."

<P>
You've got your helicopters, jet planes, Code-A-Phones and saxophones and 
jackhammers poundin' on the concrete city streets, 
</P>
<P>
 Gigolos and stereos and televised scenarios of fire alarms, burglar alarms, 
... 
</P>
<P>
 Who's gonna understand? ... the whispering man. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Whispering Man" by Steve Goodman 
</P>
<P>
What word would you use to describe the world we live in? Hectic? Wondrous? 
Scary? Crowded? Mysterious? Confusing? Absurd? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever word comes to mind, one adjective that applies all too often is noisy. 
We reside in a noisy world. Or, at least, in one particularly raucous corner of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's those who suffer under the flight path of John Wayne Airport, live 
below TV junkies who crank up Cal Worthington at midnight, or merely work next 
to high-volume ad salesmen, most of us have to contend daily with the quest for 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
But people seem to get particularly upset when the offending decibels come in 
the form of sharps and flats. Music. And especially rock 'n' roll music. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit has been bouncing around Orange County Superior Court for years, 
chock-full of Costa Mesa residents' complaints about the sound levels emanating 
from rock concerts at the Pacific Amphitheatre. Although there are only two 
plaintiffs to the suit, an individual and Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa 
Inc., the litigation beat goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Down in San Juan Capistrano, a petition is circulating trying to get more 
action from the Sheriff's Department in citing drivers whose car stereos seem 
in danger of triggering the Newport-Inglewood Fault line. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's a sign of incipient middle-age, but I'm feeling more sympathetic 
these days toward the folks who are doing the complaining, notwithstanding my 
biases toward rock 'n' roll and against excessive governmental regulation (and 
the curmudgeons who spur legislators on). 
</P>
<P>
The turning point came one Sunday, while I was working in my cozy, tomb-like 
office (somebody's gotta put the Monday paper out), when a mini-truck drove by 
with the stereo cranked up so loud it shook the windows. 
</P>
<P>
My desk, for the record, is in a room that is set back at least 200 feet from 
the street. On the second floor. I would say someone had his or her music up a 
tad loud. It gave me the shudders to imagine that when all the data is in, 
scientists will find that the steadily increasing number of whales that have 
beached themselves in recent years were only attempting to come face to face 
with the source of these subterranean shock waves and tell them -- in whale -- 
to "Can it, Bub." 
</P>
<P>
These kids -- mostly male teens -- cruise down the street in vans equipped with 
speakers the size of Oldsmobiles, enough wattage to energize a moon probe and 
volume knob cranked up high enough to melt quartz. The tape hiss from these 
systems, some of which cost up to $50,000, produces more volume than our 
piddling little 50- or 100-watt car units playing Led Zeppelin or whatever did 
back in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
It's a mystery, or a miracle, that their ears, much less their brains, haven't 
been reduced to cornmeal. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe they have, which is precisely the problem. After a couple of times 
around the block with the dB meter riding somewhere between "elephant gun" and 
"active volcano," their pummeled eardrums may not register anything short of 
the Apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
So what's to do? Is it an infringement on First Amendment guarantees to limit 
how loudly individuals may exercise their right of free speech? 
</P>
<P>
Ever since a new California Vehicle Code law went into effect last January, 
police have the authority to ticket vehicles playing amplified music at 
excessive levels. "Most agencies in central Orange County are issuing 
citations," said Lt. Robert Helton, press information officer for the Santa Ana 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, booming cart and mini-truck stereos is part of "a cruising 
problem we have been trying to address. . . . We get complaints not only from 
people who are just driving their cars, but from commercial business owners and 
residents." So officers have been writing lots of tickets, at about $60 a pop. 
("I don't have exact numbers of citations issued," Helton said.) 
</P>
<P>
The problem I have in raising my voice against the noise polluters is that so 
much of the enforcement generally is directed at sources that involve rock 
music, whether from cars and mini-trucks to concert clubs and open-air events. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard not to get the impression that outrage ends where commerce begins. 
</P>
<P>
Take my neighborhood. I live near downtown Santa Ana, and I frequently find 
myself driving next to cars whose stereos overpower my own. So I can empathize 
with anyone whose house might face a popular cruising boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But for the last month, I've been awakened every morning at 7 a.m. (except 
Sundays, thank Heavens) by the BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! of pile drivers slamming 
concrete posts into what used to be the parking lot at Santa Ana Stadium. It's 
gone on eight to 10 hours a day, all in the creation of what, presumably, will 
be a bigger and even splashier parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Where were all the protesters then? 
</P>
<P>
This irritant is no less offensive than blaring rap music from a Toyota 
mini-truck or the dull thud of a nearby concert. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, concerts are periodically held in the stadium and, given a choice, I 
would take the sound of amplified mariachis or marching bands over the 
mechanical thudding of the construction crews. 
</P>

I'm sure if someone went out testing sound-pressure levels, the construction 
work would exceed local noise limits at well more than 50 feet. (The first day 
the pounding began, I thought someone had set up a drilling derrick on my front 
lawn, not, as it turned out, several hundred yards down the road and across the 
street.)

<P>
Effective Jan. 1, an addendum to the California Vehicle Code will make the laws 
governing car stereo abusers even more specific, spelling out exactly how loud 
and how far away from the vehicle the music can be heard. In the best of all 
possible worlds, I'd like to see basic courtesy win out over yet another piece 
of legislation to remind us what's right and what's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The sad fact, however, is that with about 2.2 million people (and counting) in 
Orange County, I expect that our little corner of Paradise will get louder 
before it gets quieter. 
</P>
<P>
All of which will eventually boil down to this chilling choice: earplugs or

They have survived war, prison, famine, terrifying voyages across 
pirate-infested seas and long stints in refugee camps. Now, in the land of 
their dreams, thousands of Vietnamese immigrants spend long days hunched over 
sewing machines in suburban sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
Some earn as little as $1 an hour. Most are glad to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Beside them toil Latino immigrants who have fled impoverished homelands for 
prosperous Southern California, only to land Third World-style jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by this influx, at least 400 sewing shops have sprung up in and around 
Orange County's Little Saigon that employ upwards of 5,000 immigrants. In fact, 
the majority of these shop owners are themselves former boat people who have 
been in this country less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
But these tiny businesses are not jewels in a vibrant immigrant economy. 
Federal and state authorities say many are sweatshops where abusive and illegal 
labor practices are rampant. 
</P>
<P>
These suburban sweatshops are tucked into clean new industrial buildings, just 
out of sight of their affluent neighbors, and out of mind of the consumers who 
buy their products in some of the nation's priciest department stores. Seeing 
"Made in U.S.A." labels, most shoppers are utterly unaware that some of these 
garments have been made by immigrants and refugees -- sometimes children -- 
working long hours for a fraction of the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
One of those children was a 7-year-old Santa Ana boy who spent hundreds of 
hours helping his mother sew designer clothing in their home for wages that 
averaged about $1.45 an hour, according to labor investigators. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just money but a certain resignation to hardship that keeps these 
immigrants at their sewing machines. Take 46-year-old seamstress Ngoc Pha 
Nguyen. She worked at several sewing shops that cheated and underpaid her. Now 
she earns $4.25 an hour, the California minimum wage. She is deeply, almost 
pathetically, grateful. 
</P>
<P>
It took Nguyen four attempts to escape from Vietnam. Two of her daughters and 
14 other family members didn't make it. "I'm very sad, so when I get to work, I 
forget about it for a while," she said through an interpreter. "If I stay home, 
I look at the family shrine and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen bends over to stitch the flounces on party dresses -- a tedious task 
performed over and over again under hot lights in a crowded, airless garage. 
The truth is, she hates to sew. But, she says, she is old and can't find a 
better job. 
</P>
<P>
The shop where Nguyen works is paid $6.75 for each dress she stitches. 
Identical dresses of the same label were selling at a South Coast Plaza 
department store for $64 each. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are really making the big money are the retailers and the 
financiers of the retailers, and some of the manufacturers," said Edna 
Bonacich, a UC Riverside sociology professor studying Asians in the California 
garment industry. "The workers are totally exploited." 
</P>
<P>
Once a backwater in the $6-billion-a-year Los Angeles garment industry, Orange 
County now produces everything from junior knits to inexpensive evening wear. 
But it is a transformation that comes with a price tag of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities warn that these new suburban sweatshop workers -- particularly in 
Orange County, but also in immigrant strongholds throughout Southern California 
-- are becoming the latest victims of an industry that has been nourished by 
cheap immigrant labor for nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
Far from the downtown Los Angeles garment district where enforcement officials 
know the turf, offenders are hard to catch. And federal and state labor 
officials say that when they do find them, enforcement is often stymied by the 
same dynamics that have kept sweatshops in business for over a century. Owners 
insist they'll go bankrupt if they pay the minimum wage. Workers won't complain 
no matter how bad their treatment because they are undocumented aliens, are 
receiving public assistance or are simply too afraid. And manufacturers have 
few incentives to investigate the conditions under which their products are 
made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Sweatshops 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, Orange County sweatshops bear little resemblance to the ones 
found in dilapidated buildings in teeming garment districts in downtown Los 
Angeles, San Francisco's Chinatown and New York's old Lower East Side. 
</P>
<P>
Most are in brand-new complexes of light industrial buildings, invisible from 
the street. They tend to be located just behind the restaurants and mini-malls 
that line the thoroughfares connecting Garden Grove, Westminster and Santa Ana, 
where about 100,000 Vietnamese immigrants have settled since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweatshops flourish wherever you have pockets of immigrants," said Allen J. 
Scott, professor of urban and economic geography at UCLA. "It's not just 
happening in Orange County, it's happening in the San Fernando Valley and in 
Long Beach. . . . And there's a big new Korean community growing up around Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"What has been happening recently is a decentralization in all directions out 
from the garment district, not only to tap immigrant populations, but also to 
take advantage of the cheaper land," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Scott did a study of garment subcontractors and found that nearly all 
were located in downtown Los Angeles. He found only two in Orange County. Last 
spring, Bonacich analyzed the ethnic makeup of the state's 4,589 registered 
garment contractors, and found 172 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of 102 of them were Vietnamese; one was Chinese, 11 Latino, and 10 
Korean; 24 were owned by other Asians whose national origin was unclear; and 
the rest were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Including the 20% to 30% of shops that are unregistered and the scores of 
mini-sweatshops hidden inside single-family homes and garages, Bonacich 
estimates the county now has at least 400 sewing shops. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't run into a single Vietnamese who's been in business here for more 
than two years, so this seems like a brand-new business for Orange County," 
said Rolene Otero, director of enforcement for the U.S. Department of Labor's 
Wage and Hour Division in Santa Ana. "In the last two years, it's just 
exploded." 
</P>
<P>
But while wages and working conditions in Los Angeles have improved, thanks to 
heavy enforcement, labor abuses in Orange County are widespread, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent crackdown spearheaded by Otero found 18 Orange County sweatshops that 
had been violating minimum wage, overtime and child labor laws -- including the 
shops that employed Juana Valladares and Ngoc Pha Nguyen, according to 
documents obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act. So far, 
the shops have been ordered to pay more than $180,000 to at least 220 workers, 
and some cases are still pending, Otero said. 
</P>
<P>
"The extremely low wages across the board in Orange County are not the case in 
Los Angeles," Otero said. "In L.A. you will find $10-an-hour employees. In 
Orange County, we have yet to find a single employee paid any more than the 
minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
The suburbanization of sweatshops is an outgrowth of the changes that are 
reshaping the garment industry, scholars and officials said. First, foreign 
competition has driven down prices in the domestic sewing industry. Yet, at the 
same time, manufacturers need flexible production capability, because rush 
orders for more of a hot-selling item cannot be filled fast enough overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The solution -- especially in inexpensive clothing, women's and junior wear, 
where fashions change overnight and quality is often second to price and timing 
-- is to subcontract the sewing. This enables manufacturers to quickly shift 
their designs and output to ride out the treacherous market tides -- while 
largely escaping legal responsibility for any labor abuses committed by the 
companies that sew for them, officials and garment industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've created a Third World labor force here to match the Third World labor 
force with which they're competing abroad," Bonacich said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all need work, and we take anything we can get," said one Vietnamese shop 
owner, adding that she cannot possibly pay her workers the minimum wage because 
the price she gets for finished garments is so low. 
</P>
<P>
Another owner, a former South Vietnamese soldier who had spent years in a 
Communist prison, says he hires workers only part-time since he and his 
relatives do most of the sewing themselves. On a recent afternoon, they were 
stitching elaborate evening jackets and full-length, lined skirts, which he 
said took well over an hour to sew. He said the manufacturer pays about $5 for 
the set. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't do this, some other contractor will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that labor police have never succeeded in crushing sweatshops in the 
past and are unlikely to do so now, because the market demands them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you really tried to enforce immigration and other laws about working 
conditions, in both the garment industry and the electronics industry in 
Southern California, the effect on the economy would be disastrous," Scott 
said. "So the enforcement is symbolic more than it is systematic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illegal Economy 
</P>
<P>
On the inside, the suburban sweatshops are little more than garages attached to 
tiny offices. In a typical shop, fluorescent lights beat down on rows of sewing 
machines. Heaps of pre-cut fabric spill out of plastic bags onto cement floors 
littered with scraps of cloth, threads and cigarette butts. Remnants of meals 
linger in odd corners, and the air smells sour. 
</P>
<P>
In many shops owned by Asians, the office decor includes a red-and-gold 
lacquered shrine with an incense holder and a porcelain statue of Than Tai, the 
Vietnamese god of money. Perhaps no less symbolic are the time clocks and 
posters nearby that detail, in English, the California minimum wage and 
overtime laws. They pacify the authorities, but few of the workers can read, 
write or speak English. And the time cards are rarely used to determine wages, 
since most workers are paid by the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Labor abuses persist in part because both shop owners and the workers 
themselves are participants in a vast underground economy. Authorities say the 
sweatshops prey on two particularly vulnerable groups: illegal Latino aliens 
and Southeast Asian refugees who work illegally and collect welfare at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"They abuse these people, and they know they can get away with it, because 
they're illegal," Otero said. 
</P>
<P>
"My former boss used to pay us 10 cents a piece for ironing," said Maria Del 
Pilar Solano, 23, a sweatshop worker who has since applied for immigration 
amnesty and is not receiving public assistance. "We would work from 7 a.m. to 8 
p.m. We got $8 or $9 a day, sometimes $4 or $5. At the end of the week we would 
add it up and we would get only $50 a week. The owner used to say it was a lot 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
And to Solano, it was a lot of money. In her native Mexico, where she worked as 
a knitter, she earned $12 every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Federal inspectors raided the shop where Solano worked and found that it had 
been paying less than the minimum wage and had illegally employed 12 home 
workers, federal documents show. The garments Solano and her colleagues made 
were sold to Macy's and Bloomingdale's departments stores, documents show. 
(Solano said the shop has since changed hands and is now paying $4.25 an hour.) 
Even some of the immigrants who have working papers accept between $1 and $3 an 
hour because they have no skills, speak no English, and are often desperate to 
earn money to send back home, authorities and Vietnamese community leaders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam, for $10, one person can live for a month," said Ly (Louis) Cao of 
Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. in Santa Ana, which provides 
retraining for scores of refugees who are in the garment industry but want 
better jobs. "Ninety-nine percent send money home." 
</P>
<P>
Some of these new Americans are also willing to stay in the sweatshops or 
stitch at home in secret for a fraction of the minimum wage because they are 
collecting welfare, housing subsidies or food stamps, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of sweatshops, where wages are paid in cash, and records, where 
they exist, are sketchy, it's tricky to identify the true victims, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietor of one foundering shop in the Euclid Business Center in Garden 
Grove, $3,000 behind on his rent, stunned his landlord by coming in to pay the 
entire sum in cash -- in $5 bills. And state welfare fraud inspectors tell of 
refugees who, by putting every family member to work, continuing to collect 
benefits, living three families to a house and scrimping for years, have 
managed to buy $200,000 homes or businesses of their own -- again, all 
purchased in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"The illegals (Latinos) are the ones who are most exploited," said Van Nguyen, 
a welfare fraud investigator for the Orange County district attorney's office. 
"These people make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
But such cash-only operations take a toll. Workers cheated out of their meager 
wages have nowhere to turn. Their bosses are easy marks. "We estimate we're 
probably getting only 10% of the sewing shop robberies reported, because they 
know they're using illegal aliens and they don't want the trouble," said 
Westminster Police Detective Marcus Frank. "I'd say 95% of them are using 
illegal labor in one form or other." 
</P>
<P>
The sight of Anglos asking questions sends owners into panic and workers 
scurrying out the back door. By the time visitors reach the shop door, half of 
the sewing machines are suddenly silent. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one block on Harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana that has a lot of shops," 
said state Deputy Labor Commissioner Craig Cubberly. "We went into one and it 
was like a fire drill. Everybody in all the shops all the way down the block 
started bailing out." 
</P>
<P>
Juana Valladares, who worked in one of those sweatshops, said her bosses would 
say that immigration officials were coming when in fact it was the labor 
inspectors. Once, after she had secured her green card, she told them she no 
longer needed to flee. "They said, 'If you want to keep working here, leave!"' 
</P>
<P>
The Cambodians who run one of the sweatshops in the same complex have been so 
terrorized since the federal labor investigations began that they have locked 
themselves and their workers inside the shop, Maria Solano said. 
</P>
<P>
"The labor inspectors don't know they're in there," Solano reported. "It's hot, 
but it's locked. They go to lunch and they lock the door. They come back in and 
they lock the door." 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke, she gestured over to the parking lot, where several people were 
quickly getting into their cars and leaving. "They saw you," she said. "See, 
there they go." 
</P>
<P>
In that shop, workers earn 10 to 15 cents a piece for sewing, 3 cents for 
trimming the loose threads from a garment, and 5 cents for each garment they 
iron, Solano said. 
</P>
<P>
"An uncle of mine works there," she said. "He makes $10 a day. . . . He's 
looking for a place where he can make more money." 
</P>
<P>
Beds and Bassinets 
</P>
<P>
Even deeper in the shadows are the uncounted workers who assemble garments 
illegally in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will not even guess at how many there are, but the practice of home 
sewing, both by families and by sweatshop workers who take work home with them 
after hours, is certainly widespread. Nine of the 18 sweatshops cited by Otero 
were employing such illegal home workers. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Lam, who runs a sewing machine shop in Garden Grove, estimates that he 
sells about 20 industrial machines a month to Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, 
Korean and Mexican families who tell him they plan to sew at home. And Lam has 
three competitors in Orange County alone. 
</P>
<P>
The first authorities to notice the burgeoning home sewing industry were Orange 
County welfare fraud inspectors sent to check out tips that some of the 
county's 22,000 refugees who receive public assistance were working on the sly. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go to (their) houses to do welfare fraud investigations, 70 to 80% of 
the time we find sewing machines," said investigator Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
State inspector Cubberly began accompanying investigator Nguyen and her partner 
on their monthly rounds to search out labor violations. From June, 1987, 
through September, 1989, they raided 66 businesses and 21 homes where welfare 
violations were suspected. Cubberly issued 85 labor citations, assessing nearly 
$45,000 in fines -- including 13 child labor violations involving children aged 
13 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
The secret home sewing machines were found not just in Garden Grove, 
Westminster and Santa Ana, but also in prosperous Anaheim and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors found sewing machines in bedrooms, sewing machines jammed in between 
mattresses and bassinets, and sewing machines crammed into airless garages that 
are stuffed with flammable garments and mattresses. Most of the garages are 
padlocked from the outside to protect their contents from prying neighbors and 
fire and zoning inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
At one home in Westminster, they confiscated 757 knit cardigan sweaters, in 
various stages of completion -- enough to fill six large plastic trash bags, 
Nguyen said. The homeowner, who was collecting welfare, "says he's the only one 
working, making $120 a month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All told, state officials seized 5,022 garments, which were donated to charity, 
Cubberly said. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women who sew in such homes -- and their children -- risk inhaling dust 
and fibers from the heaps of cut fabric in poorly ventilated spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we're going to see tuberculosis, respiratory problems," Otero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the garments seized in homes or found in factories paying less than the 
minimum wage bear the label of major manufacturers. When called for comment, 
several manufacturers said they had given cut pieces to reputable, 
state-registered contractors to be sewn. Each one vehemently denied any direct 
or indirect knowledge of the sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Chorus Line Inc., a large Los Angeles junior sportswear maker, 
said when they learned one of their contractors was found to have violated 
overtime laws, they even offered to help the government by withholding payments 
to the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times the shops get themselves into trouble and we don't know about 
it," said Chorus Line President Mark Steinman. 
</P>
<P>
J.P. Wolk, controller of Oops of California, a women's and children's dress 
manufacturer with annual sales of $20 million, said he had no idea that his 
goods had been confiscated by state inspectors after they were discovered in a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of that. They never talked to me," Wolk said. "As far as I know 
we only deal with reputable contractors. What the contractors do, I have no 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
Wolk said quality control inspectors do keep an eye on the contractors to make 
sure the goods are being sewn properly. 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "I don't have a police force here. It'd be pretty hard to do 
business." 
</P>
<P>
When such operations are discovered, illegal aliens are reported to 
immigration, and welfare frauds are passed along to the district attorney's 
office for prosecution, officials said. The sweatshop owners are fined for each 
state labor violation, and usually are forced to pay the manufacturer back for 
the cost of the confiscated garments. But, state officials said, manufacturers 
are almost never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to catch the manufacturer in the house with the garments and the 
machines," said John B. Carter, senior deputy labor commissioner for the state 
Division of Labor Enforcement in Santa Ana. "It's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LABOR LAWS 
</P>
<P>
 These are the state and federal labor laws that apply to garment workers: 
</P>
<P>
 Minimum Wage: President Bush recently signed legislation to raise the federal 
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by 1991, but that move will not affect 
California, where the state-mandated minimum wage is already $4.25 per hour. 
Trainees with no experience may be paid $3.60 an hour for up to 160 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Overtime: Garment workers, like other non-salaried employees, must be paid 
time-and-a-half if they work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Home Sewing: Sewing commercially at home is a misdemeanor under California law. 
The state law supersedes federal law, which allows some types of home work but 
prohibits sewing women's garments at home. 
</P>
<P>
Registration: Under the Montoya Act, all garment contractors must register with 
the state and pass a licensing exam that covers all applicable laws. The 1981 
law also requires shops to keep wage and hour records. 
</P>
<P>
Child Labor: Children under 12 may not work. Children ages 12 to 14 may not 
work on school days. All those under 18 must have a permit from their school 
districts, and in any case may not work more than 36 hours per week.

ORANGE COUNTY DEMOCRATS FIND NO LIFE IN THE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things are always tough for Democrats in Republican-rich Orange County. But 
these days, they've gotten tougher. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, party leaders announced at a meeting in a Santa Ana union hall that 
they were flat broke. Actually, they were about $4,000 in the red. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the party's executive director had to quit recently because the party 
didn't have enough money to pay his salary. 
</P>
<P>
A new $100-per-month club called the Truman Forum brought in just one donation 
last month -- $100. And that came from party chairman Michael Balmages, who 
started the program last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The party is in the same precarious situation it has been in for years and 
years and years," Balmages said. "It's a concern and it's something that's 
typical. Does it make it right because it's typical? No." 
</P>
<P>
Money is not the only problem. There has been in-fighting among the leadership. 
Balmages said he has been busy with his law practice and unable to dedicate the 
time he should to the party. And now, with no money in the bank, the party 
still has no plans for fund-raisers or strategies to strengthen itself. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some party officials say they are concerned about the deterioration. 
But many said the situation is typical -- a fact of life for Democrats in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual to be very lean at this time of year and just barely making 
it," said John Hanna, former county Democratic chairman. "If it's April of 1990 
and there's no staff, then I think it's something to be concerned about. . . . 
That's a party in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' problems appear even more severe when compared to the power of 
the Republican Party in Orange County. The GOP's influence can hardly be 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, there are about 560,000 registered Republicans compared to about 
365,000 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the fact that Republican candidates hold all of the area's 23 
county, state and federal elected offices except one, an Assembly district that 
straddles the Los Angeles County line. Of the 146 city council seats in Orange 
County, Democrats hold only 37. 
</P>
<P>
And financially, even in their best year ever, Democrats were soundly beaten by 
the Republicans. During the 1988 presidential race, Democrats raised about 
$212,000 while the county Republican Party raised $462,000. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Haskin, executive director of the local Republican Party, said Orange 
County's GOP has the "largest county operation in the country." It has a 
full-time staff of three with up to 15 part-time employees, including an 
accountant and a crew of operators for a phone bank. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dismal facts, Democratic leaders see the framework of a strong 
opposition in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 400,000 Democrats live here, more than in 16 states. The number is the 
fourth highest among all of California's counties. And, party leaders reason, 
the pool of Democrats in this affluent county probably represents untapped 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
The task, however, is to organize that power. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said he wants to cultivate modest donations from the county's 
Democrats, forming a donor base that could then be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way we are going to permanently get out of this hand-to-mouth 
situation and develop an ongoing source of funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a lot of math to figure that if we got a penny each month from 
the 400,000 Democrats, that would be enough to fund the basic operation right 
there," Balmages said. "If you got a dollar a year from 400,000 Democrats, 
you've got a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
But so far, Balmages said, there hasn't been any work done to get such a 
fund-raising program under way. And there has not been any discussion about how 
to pay for the start-up cost of a donor program or for the hiring of a new 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The money raised by the party is important because it pays for the foundation 
of the power of local as well as state and federal officials. The political 
parties sponsor voter registration drives, coordinate appearances for outside 
politicians, seek out and encourage candidates to run for office, donate to 
campaigns and rally their forces during elections. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said he was hoping to get some money from the state Democratic Party 
because it passed a resolution in February pledging support for Orange County's 
attack on freshman Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Pringle won the only legislative seat in Orange County that has a 
Democratic majority in a close race that was marred by the Republican Party's 
hiring of security guards at 20 Santa Ana polling places. 
</P>
<P>
But Cathy Calfo, executive director of the state party, said last week that the 
"resolution is not a binding order allocating money" to Orange County. And, she 
said, the party has since adopted an annual budget that does not include 
financial help for county Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"That's bad news," Balmages said. 
</P>
<P>
Also troubling the party's financial effort, say party insiders, is a rift 
between Balmages and Audrey Redfearn, chairwoman of the Democratic Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is a club with about 100 Democrats who pay $1,000 each year to 
be members. The group is host to appearances by leading state and national 
Democrats and contributes to Democratic candidates inside and outside Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said he was concerned that the foundation is draining money from the 
party organization and he disagrees with Redfearn about how much the foundation 
should pay to support the county party. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt any rift," said Redfearn. "The rift was created by Mike Balmages 
insisting he get whatever money he wanted. He was quite demanding." 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said he would like to see the relationship between the foundation and 
the party changed, but he hasn't talked to Redfearn about it. He suggested that 
the foundation has been attractive to members because it hosts famous 
Democrats. "We can do that too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democratic leaders said they were not surprised that the party is short 
of money during the holidays in an off-election year. It has happened several 
times before. 
</P>
<P>
None criticized Balmages' leadership either, but they encouraged him to begin a 
fund-raising program to replenish the party coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Garza, the former executive director who left recently, said: "We need to 
do some ongoing fund-raising; we need to get much more serious about it. My 
leaving is just one of those slumps you hit now and then. I do feel very 
positive about the party's prospects." 
</P>
<P>
James Toledano, chairman of the Orange County Democratic Associates, said: 
"Right now we are in the coalescing stage. We have a lot of unstructured 
capabilities; we are just looking for the chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
Redfearn said: "We just need something for people to become excited about. I 
don't see anything alarming about the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Yudelson, a Democrat who has already announced his challenge to Pringle, 
said, "You've got to remember the dictum of Will Rogers: 'I belong to no 
organized political party; I'm a Democrat.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

THE MONEY MAN BEHIND REV. SHELDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without the backing of a man sometimes called "Mr. Anaheim," the Rev. Louis P. 
Sheldon agrees that his influence as a religious lobbyist would be considerably 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon acknowledges that the support he has received from Herbert B. Leo, a 
retired Anaheim businessman and longtime civic booster, has been critical. 
</P>
<P>
Leo has given Sheldon's two organizations more than $250,000 over the past five 
years, about a third of what both groups have drawn in contributions. Leo 
serves as chairman of the board of the Traditional Values Coalition and the 
American Liberties Institute, and is in almost daily contact with the 
controversial campaigner against homosexual rights and abortions. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime member of Anaheim's Community Redevelopment Commission and the 
city's Visitor and Convention Bureau, Leo served as president of the Chamber of 
Commerce, which is where he first met and worked with Sheldon. After a prayer 
breakfast one day, Sheldon went to Leo's home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed with his knowledge of the Bible and his ability to answer 
questions," Leo recalls. The two men say they developed several slide shows -- 
one attacking the concept of separation of church and state -- and out of this 
relationship, they say, came Sheldon's two organizations. Leo takes credit for 
more than just bankrolling Sheldon's moral crusade: 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it was really my idea," Leo says. "My feeling was that I wanted to 
be on the cutting edge, talking to agnostics and those who weren't Christians. 
It was really an outreach program. . . . Our goal is to get Christians involved 
in what's going on in everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon agrees, saying it was Leo who "opened my eyes to the body politic in 
Anaheim and, because of that opening, it then went to the county and the state 
and now to the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Leo, a 72-year-old Baptist who gave up a seat on the Redevelopment Commission 
rather than turn in the lifetime pass he had been given to Disneyland, was a 
top executive of MCP Foods Inc., which makes citrus products, including frozen 
juices. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from his opposition to homosexuality, abortion and the teaching of 
evolution, Leo shares another strong belief with Sheldon: that religion and 
commerce do not always make a profitable marriage. Over the last decade, 
Sheldon has lost money in financial ventures with Leo and others in the 
religious community. 
</P>
<P>
A rehabilitation project aimed at renovating run-down houses in the South 
Central Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, physically moving them to other lots 
and reselling them, went bust. "We lost our shirt on that baby," Sheldon said, 
estimating that he lost more than $40,000 in a partnership that included David 
Balsiger, a Costa Mesa publisher of Christian literature. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon also invested in the New City Bank of Orange, a so-called "Christian 
bank" organized in 1983 in part to make land and construction loans to church 
congregations. Leo was chairman of the board and one of three major investors. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace D. Linn, who was president and chief executive officer of New City -- 
named for the "new city of Jerusalem" -- joined Leo on the board of Sheldon's 
American Liberties Institute in 1985, serving as chief financial officer, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
New City's loans to religious organizations -- including $10,000 given to 
American Liberties Institute to finance a direct-mail fund-raising campaign -- 
were all repaid, Leo and Sheldon say. 
</P>
<P>
However, the bank's commercial loans did not fare so well. A Buena Park travel 
agency went bankrupt, owing New City $250,000. The partners of a San Diego 
firm, which promoted a plan to manufacture "space-age wood" from South American 
weeds on Pat Robertson's "700 Club" program, also received a credit line from 
the bank. They were subsequently convicted in federal court of conspiracy to 
defraud New City of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to save the bank, Leo and two of his partners invested an 
additional $1.5 million into its capital base, but New City was closed by state 
regulators in 1987 and some of its accounts sold to Colonial Bank N.A., in 
Orange. In all, Leo estimates that the endeavor cost him $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gerry Findley, a Brea-based financial institutions consultant who 
engineered the sale to Colonial, New City "operated like a charity more than a 
bank. It seemed like they had a strong tendency toward giving things away." 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson we learned," Leo says, "is that you need loan officers making loans 
and not missionaries." 
</P>
<P>
Leo says Sheldon lost $25,000 in the New City Bank failure. Sheldon would not 
confirm the extent of his loss, except to say that it was "not of the same 
magnitude as Herb's." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon says he has taken his painful investment experiences to heart. "A 
minister who lives by the Gospel must earn his money by the Gospel," he says. 
"I am to depend on God and the Gospel by faith for living and substance."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: PATH TO AIRPORT SITE CONSENSUS WAS BUMPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die," veteran urban 
planner Al Bell said in greeting about 125 Orange County residents attending 
the final meeting of the Airport Site Coalition recently at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody don't want an airport, but everybody wants to fly," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members had toiled for 20 months, examining more than 30 sites in 
hopes of forging a public consensus on at least one location for a new regional 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to jails, dumps, hazardous-waste treatment plants or shelters for 
the homeless, reaching consensus on a site is tough. Finding a home for a new 
airport is no different. 
</P>
<P>
A consensus of sorts was reached. But critics will argue for months about 
whether the rules were fair, the technical data on individual sites was 
accurate and whether some of the choices reflected the political realities of 
congressional, U.S. Forest Service and Pentagon opposition. 
</P>
<P>
When the coalition's final report is filed in a few weeks, these sites are 
likely to be on it: Potrero Los Pinos, a plateau east of San Juan Capistrano in 
Cleveland National Forest; Cristianitos Canyon east of San Clemente; South Camp 
Pendleton in San Diego County; March Air Force Base in Riverside County, and 
Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Norton was a sort of sentimental choice for most of those attending the final 
assembly because it's already available. The military is shutting it down. But 
the coalition's final report may rank others higher. 
</P>
<P>
Yet how the coalition even got this far is a bit of a mystery unless you 
watched it perform these past 20 months. After all, the Board of Supervisors 
declared six years ago that there is no "practical" site for a new airport 
within Orange County's borders. 
</P>
<P>
In this latest effort in a decades-long search for a new regional airport site, 
San Clemente residents sought to protect their decidedly non-urban environs and 
lobbied strongly against Cristianitos Canyon, a location preferred by some 
technical experts. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente's apparently unsuccessful opposition was a major test of the 
coalition's unorthodox attempt to build a consensus. The experimental strategy 
was aimed at preventing residents of any one city from dictating the outcome of 
the search, which has been authorized by the Board of Supervisors, the Federal 
Aviation Administration and the Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The key elements were: 
</P>
<P>
* Anyone could attend coalition meetings, but the agenda was controlled by a 
"refinement" committee and urban planner Bell's consulting firm, the Planning 
Center. Each meeting was aimed at resolving particular issues. Also, a point 
system emerged that gave most weight to sites that would adversely affect the 
fewest number of people. 
</P>
<P>
* At meetings, participants were divided into about 20 small groups that met 
individually for about an hour, each trying to resolve specific technical 
issues on a given day's agenda. One person from each table summarized the 
discussion orally for the larger assembly. 
</P>
<P>
* After each meeting, the coalition staff and the refinement committee reviewed 
the results and prepared for the next round of evaluations, which would narrow 
further the list of sites. 
</P>
<P>
More than a few folks were unhappy. Advocates of civilian or joint use of El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station were upset when El Toro was eliminated at the 
coalition's July meeting. Others stopped attending after North County sites 
such as Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center fell by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente folks were relieved when Cristianitos Canyon was relegated to a 
backup list last July. Later, the coalition staff and the refinement committee 
members took it upon themselves to add it to the list of top sites. They also 
removed Norton from the top list, ostensibly to avoid duplicating airport 
studies that San Bernardino County officials recently initiated. 
</P>
<P>
It was on Saturday, Nov. 18, that about 125 people gathered in the faculty 
dining room at the University Club to have a final say. Critics of both the 
Potrero Los Pinos and Cristianitos Canyon sites accused Bell and his staff of 
using flawed data. Some spoke of preserving such open space for future 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
The caucus reports came in. One disgruntled group asked that Bell's consulting 
firm not be retained for any follow-up effort. 
</P>
<P>
Despite significant dissent, Cristianitos Canyon appeared to stay on the final 
list, as did Potrero Los Pinos. And Norton appeared to be headed back onto 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Some San Clemente residents thought that they had been railroaded by the staff 
intervention to resurrect the Cristianitos Canyon site. Others were eager to 
proceed, including coalition member Doyle Selden of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 20 years of inaction, so now let's close the loop and move on," 
Seldon told fellow members. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is for final report to be submitted to the Board of Supervisors 
and various agencies. They will be asked to act on a proposal to create a 
joint, public-private consortium to seek specific airport construction 
proposals for various sites, and all necessary governmental permits. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome, some say the coalition has made progress. 
</P>
<P>
Said Barbara Lichman, director of the grass-roots Airport Working Group and an 
Airport Site Coalition refinement committee member, "If nothing else, this 
process came up with two brand-new Orange County sites that had never been 
studied before."

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT YOUTHS FACE AMERICAN NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
ALIENS: ORANGE COUNTY OFFICIALS TRY DESPERATELY TO DOCUMENT CHILDREN WHO FALL 
VICTIM TO IMMIGRATION LAW. BUT THOSE WITHOUT A 'PAPER TRAIL' ARE LIKELY TO BE 
EXPLOITED. 
</P>

<P>
Mike, 17, believes he was born somewhere in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
His earliest memory is about crying into a white stuffed bear that his father 
kept in a brown paper bag because they were always on the move. Held out of 
public schools by his father, Mike had no proof of where he spent his 
childhood, and he had no birth certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Mike doesn't remember his mother. His father, now in prison and considered 
insane by authorities, is too incoherent to be of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials, unable to verify his background, assumed Mike was born 
in Mexico, although he speaks nothing but English. In the eyes of the law, they 
said, this lack of proof made the teen-ager an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
Mike, whose last name has been ordered withheld by the courts, became a ward of 
the Orange County courts after his father's arrest four years ago. A diligent 
caseworker was able to track down a scrap of paper that proved the boy once 
lived in a remote Arizona town. Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 
1986, that scrap was enough to make Mike a legal resident. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Southern California children in court custody 
haven't been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"They did not knowingly, or willingly, enter the country illegally," said John 
Oppenheim, deputy director of social services in Santa Clara County, who 
recently addressed a congressional committee on the subject. "They did not want 
to be abused or neglected, and most certainly they do not deserve to grow up 
without the legal right to remain, prosper and serve in their homeland." 
</P>
<P>
The very law that has made legal residents out of thousands of adult aliens has 
put these children into a new class of illegal immigrants who are coming of age 
and who face a lifetime void of legitimate work or stable home life, said 
Carlos Grado, coordinator of the Orange County foster care program for 
immigrant children. He estimates there are hundreds of these children in Orange 
County besides the 40 in court custody. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the kids that fell through the cracks," said Neena Erickson, an 
Orange County amnesty social worker. "They're real scared. It's very likely 
they'll be exploited, underpaid and overworked." 
</P>
<P>
The children who fall through the cracks are: 
</P>
<P>
* Those born in other countries after 1982 and brought into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
* Those born before 1982 who have lived in the United States most of their 
lives but whose families may have returned briefly to another country. 
</P>
<P>
* Those who lack the documentation to prove legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
After the federal law took effect in 1987, Orange County Children's Services 
sought legal residency status for 74 children placed in the county's care 
because they had been abused, abandoned, neglected or orphaned. Only about half 
qualified; the rest will remain in the county's care until they become adults. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, there are 285 such children under county care, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Orange County's 50% success rate in gaining legal residency for these 
children may seem low, the statistic is considered impressive by officials in 
other California counties. Los Angeles County has since copied Orange County's 
system for tracing the pasts of these children, a system that amounts to 
grasping "anything we could find," said Robynn Y. Vowell, who headed the effort 
for Orange County Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
The trail included report cards, medical records and statements from neighbors 
who remembered the child. 
</P>
<P>
"It took some sleuthing," Vowell said. "Sometimes kids couldn't remember what 
school they went to but they could remember the street. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are those children whose residency could not be established. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, several of them are approaching adulthood and are either soon 
to graduate or recently graduated from area public high schools, according to 
county social workers. 
</P>
<P>
They may rely on a growing underground network of community groups and churches 
that will help them find work. But they are likely only to obtain menial and 
low-paying jobs, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, these children are being cared for at county taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials project that the cost of caring for illegal immigrant 
children in county foster care could climb to $2 million annually over the next 
few years. The county now cares for about 40 undocumented children at costs 
ranging from $200 a month to $3,000, depending on the child's needs, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
That does not include the administrative costs of the program. Moreover, while 
federal child welfare laws require localities to care for such children, the 
immigration law prevents them from paying for it with federal aid, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a lot of sympathy for these children in Congress," 
social worker Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it is unlikely these young adults will return to what federal 
authorities consider their country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
"They speak English like you or me," said Grado, the coordinator of the 
county's foster care program for immigrant children. "They may or may not speak 
Spanish. They wouldn't fit in. They're Americanized." 
</P>
<P>
As for Mike, he has been attending school since the courts placed him in foster 
care. 
</P>
<P>
When county officials sought to establish legal residency for him, there was 
almost no paper trail to follow. His father, a fugitive from several states, 
shunned all contact with the world. 
</P>
<P>
County officials sent inquiries to dozens of agencies in several states who 
might have encountered Mike somewhere along the way. Finally they heard from a 
social service agency in a remote Arizona town. In 1981, someone had reported 
him as a possible victim of child exploitation. The case had not been pursued 
and had been closed years earlier but it provided some desperately needed 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a county office last week with his social workers, Mike fit the part 
of the archetypal Southern California teen-ager as he downed a double 
cheeseburger and talked about his hopes of getting an internship in film 
direction at UCLA, which he plans to attend after junior college. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of hassles before . . . ," Mike said. A wiry youth with braces and 
a light dusting of freckles, he looks younger than 17 but sometimes sounds 
older. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a little while to learn about society and how to interact with 
people my age."

MEDICINE: THE PINK PANTHER DANCED HIS WAY INTO THE HEARTS OF PATIENTS AT HOAG 
HOSPITAL. OFFICIALS SAID HIS VISIT IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF AN AMBITIOUS 
LAUGHTER THERAPY PROGRAM.

<P>
When a life-size version of the Pink Panther cartoon came to Hoag Hospital, 
ailing children laughed and clasped his fuzzy paws with delight. 
</P>
<P>
But the Panther, a gangling but dapper beast with bright pink fur and a 
spangled black vest, got his most enthusiastic response on the oncology ward -- 
from adults. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer patients looked startled as the Panther danced a jig from room to room 
but they cheered quickly, greeting him with laughs and broad smiles. "He's all 
right!" cried Jan Hakinson, 52. A visit from a cartoon figure may seem 
childish, she said, but "what else can you do to cheer yourself up? If you lose 
your mood, your ability to laugh, it's an uphill struggle to get well." 
</P>
<P>
The Panther's recent visit was mainly a publicity bid by MGM to celebrate the 
film's 25th anniversary. Hoag seized the moment to showcase the hospital's new 
laughter therapy program. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at Hoag's cancer center base the program on recent theories that 
laughter releases tension and grief -- as well as powerful brain chemicals 
called endorphins that promote healing. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of medical researchers report that laughter interrupts normal 
breathing rhythms, promoting relaxation and lowering blood pressure. 
"Ho-ho-holistic medicine," some proponents have called it. And in "Anatomy of 
an Illness," writer Norman Cousins espouses his conviction that 20 minutes of 
hearty laughter each day cured him of a crippling spinal disease. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag officials don't agree with Cousins that continuous laughter can cure 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
"To cure it is too strong," said oncology nurse Sharon MacDonald, 
administrative director of Hoag's cancer center. "But your outlook will impact 
your response to the illness. Just as a chemotherapy agent impacts your whole 
being, anything that increases endorphins will impact your wholeness. . . . And 
there is evidence to suggest that those with a positive outlook have a longer 
disease-free period." 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, a handful of hospitals have begun laughter programs in the 
last five years. Locally, St. Joseph Hospital in Orange includes laughter in 
its support groups -- humor becomes a way to cope with the disease. Cancer 
patients there, for example, will joke about losing their hair. "They see the 
humor in this terrible thing that's happening to them," said clinical social 
worker Donna Baker. 
</P>
<P>
But Hoag appears to be the only hospital in the county with a full-fledged 
laughter program. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald became interested in the idea several years ago as she attended 
oncology workshops and conferences. At one symposium, she watched with 
amazement as the speaker persuaded 350 oncologists "to stand on their chairs, 
turn in circles and flap their wings like turkeys." Afterward, as the meeting 
continued, she noted the participants' tone was upbeat; they seemed to have 
found new energy. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald hopes Hoag's cancer patients will react the same way. At the moment, 
the program's offerings are a bit thin. The oncology floor has a "laughter 
board" -- a bulletin board of cartoons to which patients and their families are 
encouraged to add items. 
</P>
<P>
She is also building a comedy library. So far she has several dozen books, two 
portable videotape recorders and 25 video selections -- a mix of "I Love Lucy" 
and "Laurel and Hardy" reruns, some Eddie Murphy movies and a half dozen Pink 
Panther shorts. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald has ambitious plans. She has persuaded Corona del Mar animator Chuck 
Jones to lend some of his Bugs Bunny, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote cartoons 
to decorate the cancer ward in December. And Jones is expected to meet with 
cancer patients. What's more, when Hoag's 65,000-square-foot cancer center 
building opens in May or June, one conference room will be dedicated to 
laughter therapy. MacDonald is convinced patients and their families need it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think these people undergo so much aggressive treatment, they need to 
do something to feel better" about themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
So the visit from the Pink Panther and the Panther's creator, producer and 
animator Friz Freling, is just a beginning, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Panther's bright mood also befell hospital staff. The head nurse prepared 
for the visit by cutting out large Pink Panther paw prints and posting them on 
the walls. Other nurses selected patients who were well enough to meet with the 
Panther and pose for pictures with him and Freling. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Panther danced through the ward, cancer patients shook his paw and 
beamed. One, 75-year old Mary Forrester, effused: "Thank you. Thank you. What a 
beautiful Panther. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
As the Panther finished his rounds, MacDonald proclaimed the visit a success. 
"This wasn't a children's thing," she stressed. "They will feel good up there 
all day."

<P>
Police are seeking the public's help in finding a hit-and-run driver who 
collided with a motorcyclist Wednesday at 5:45 p.m. at the corner of Harbor 
Boulevard and Mesa Verde Drive East. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, described by witnesses as a 20- to 25-year-old woman with blond 
hair, was driving a late 1970s blue Toyota Celica hatchback, said traffic 
investigator Steve Rautus. The woman reportedly made an unsafe lane change in 
front of a motorcycle, causing it to rear-end the car, lose control and crash. 
The victim, Rick Muller, 31 of Santa Ana, remains in stable condition at United 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the driver stopped a half block from the accident, observed the 
scene and then fled. Witnesses said the numbers of the license plate are 378 
and the letters resemble HPN. Rautus said there might have been rear-end damage 
to the car. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the driver should call Rautus or investigator 
Floyd Waldon at (714) 754-5367.

INDIANA FALLS SO FREEDOM GETS FLORIDA

<P>
The Freedom Bowl lost Anthony Thompson when Indiana lost a bowl bid by losing 
to Purdue Saturday, but the game will have a marquee player after all in 
Florida's Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana needed only to beat Purdue to secure the bid, but a 15-14 loss to the 
3-8 Boilermakers left the Hoosiers with a 5-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Bowl officials instead extended a bid to Florida, which will play 
Washington Dec. 30 at Anaheim Stadium, said Tom Starr, executive director of 
the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"We had decided that we wanted a marquee name -- we're a very star-rated 
society where we live -- with Anthony Thompson and Indiana," Starr said. "We're 
happy that we still have a marquee running back in Emmitt Smith. Smith and 
Thompson are both All-American backs, so we're happy to have one of them. We 
wanted to get a star." 
</P>
<P>
Florida, under interim coach Gary Darnell, is 7-3 and will play fifth-ranked 
Florida State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's been signed (with Florida), but verbally there is a commitment," 
Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
In trading Indiana for Florida, the Freedom Bowl traded the No. 1 rusher in the 
country for the third. Smith, a junior, is ranked third in Division I-A rushing 
with an average of 144.6 yards. Thompson leads the nation, and Cal State 
Fullerton's Mike Pringle is second. 
</P>
<P>
"Florida had been on our list, but we didn't think we could get a team out of 
the Deep South," Starr said. "We were fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to match up against a California team, but UCLA, California and 
Stanford all had losing records, and USC is, of course, going to the Rose Bowl. 
So we have a regional team in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, who beat Colorado in the 1985 Freedom Bowl, will make their second 
appearance in the game. Washington will be going to its 10th bowl in the past 
11 seasons and its 11th bowl in Coach Don James' 15 years in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Washington finished 7-4 this year, winning five of its last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Florida will be making its third straight bowl appearance and the 18th in its 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Each school will earn $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana needed to win at least one of its final two games to earn the bowl bid, 
but instead lost both. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers led Purdue, 14-3, after three quarters, but let the Boilermakers 
come back in a game in which Thompson was held to 97 yards on 28 carries.

COMMENTARY;

FREE AGENTS, FREE ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to the pursuit of the free-agent ballplayer, Mike Port, the 
thesaurus-thumping vice president of the Angels, has always been a small-print 
kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
In the winter of 1987, the uptown Dodgers made bold headlines by signing 
free-agent outfielder Kirk Gibson and, soon, the Dodgers owned new rings, 
Gibson owned a National League MVP trophy and Bill Mazeroski no longer owned 
the most dramatic home run in World Series history. 
</P>
<P>
Port signed Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In the winter of 1988, upon instructions from Angel owner Gene Autry, Port 
threw millions at Nolan Ryan and Bruce Hurst -- and the free-agent pitchers 
threw them back, Ryan opting to stay in Texas and Hurst opting to play for 
someone other than Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
Port signed Claudell Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is late 1989 and the free agents are out there again, bigger and better 
than ever. For the going rate of $3 million a year, the Angels could buy 
themselves the best leadoff man in baseball . . . or the American League's most 
valuable player . . . or the left-handed Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
Could the Angels use any of these? 
</P>
<P>
You judge. 
</P>
<P>
Free agent: Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Angel alternative: Devon White, the slugger in his own mind who hates to bat 
leadoff yet struck only 12 home runs this year; the leadoff man who hates to 
walk; the free swinger who still thinks a pitchout is a good pitch to pull. 
</P>
<P>
Free agent: Robin Yount. 
</P>
<P>
Angel alternative: Claudell Washington, the right fielder who appeared in only 
110 games and drove in 42 runs -- or 61 less than Yount. MVP material? 
Washington took himself out of a key late-season game in Kansas City because he 
"wasn't feeling well" and bailed on the team during its killer 4-11 trip to 
return home in early September. 
</P>
<P>
Free agent: Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
Angel alternative: Mike Witt. From 18-10 and 2.84 in 1986 to 9-15 and 5.47 in 
1989, Witt has steadily declined in each of his past four seasons. Last year, 
he led Angel pitchers only in home runs allowed (26), earned runs allowed (111) 
and exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
Could the Angels use any of these? Does Autry have $9 million handy? 
</P>
<P>
Angel hopes, however, should be tempered. As always. In this game, there's a 
very real chance the Angels could take the collar. 
</P>
<P>
We already know how they feel about Henderson, who, back in June, was 
considered too moody and too Rickey-oriented for proper team chemistry. So the 
Angels let him slip away to Oakland and the chemistry there wins a World 
Series. Rickey figures to stay an A. 
</P>
<P>
Yount has agreed in principle to the money being offered him in Milwaukee; he's 
waiting to see what personnel improvements the Brewers are willing to make. 
</P>
<P>
And Langston, deep down, wants to be a Dodger. He has eyes on L.A. and designs 
on remaining in the National League. But if not the Dodgers, there are always 
the Padres and the Yankees willing to up the ante into the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It could be small-print time again in Anaheim. Is it any wonder that Port, 
after broadcasting last year's Ryan negotiations to anyone who would listen, 
won't even publicly acknowledge he's talking to Yount and Langston? Safer that 
way. Less risk of the public-relations trashing the Angels received last 
December after coming back with no Ryan and no Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in the event of an Angel 0 for 3, we offer a low-risk, low-rent, 
low-maintenance suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Mookie Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
For about $2 million a year less than Henderson, Wilson will bat leadoff for 
you and give you a .290 batting average and 20 steals. He'll also play the 
outfield better than Davis or Washington -- OK, no big deal -- but he'll also 
play with enthusiasm and play to win. Both those commodities were in short 
supply in Anaheim after Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
In his past four seasons, Wilson has been to the playoffs three times and the 
World Series once. He batted .289 -- and hit the ground ball of Bill Buckner's 
nightmares -- for the '86 World Series champion New York Mets. He batted .296 
for the '88 NL East champion Mets. And he batted .298 in 54 games with the '89 
AL East champion Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, Wilson turns 34 in February, tends to fatigue from everyday 
use and doesn't have a strong arm. Then again, neither does Davis. And at 34, 
Wilson will still be younger than Washington and certainly more durable (Wilson 
appeared in 134 games in 1989). Wilson's addition to the Angels would enable 
Washington to shift back to fourth outfielder, the role he filled so ably with 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Wilson is the perfect Mike Port free agent -- relatively inexpensive, 
slightly past his prime and still reasonably productive. 
</P>
<P>
He'd also represent another step forward in Doug Rader's program to de-ice the 
Angel clubhouse. He might not be Robin Yount, but he lends many of the same 
intangibles -- a veteran presence, a winning presence, a positive example for 
the younger players. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels already have tried a Cookie. 
</P>
<P>
How about a Mookie?

Let's knock off the imperceptive glorifying of that pompous grandstander 
Everett Koop (View, Nov. 19).

He spent most of his time in office inveighing against smoking and other 
secondary problems, when he should have been doing something about the 
scandalous lack of a comprehensive national health care system.

That has killed more people than all the diseases Koop could name.

READING THE REAL RESULTS OF EXIT POLLS

<TEXT>
<P>
Kudos and hip-hip-hurray to Roger Simon for his views on the exit poll (View, 
Nov. 19). The recent TV journalistic embarrassment in New York City and 
Virginia is cause for sanctity of the secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Simon is correct in saying that people are sick of pollsters and that the 
practice of lying to them is a healthy sign.
