THE JOB WAS POISON, SAYS WOMAN SUING COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marjorie Grisak wonders if a job she took to help the environment was slowly 
poisoning her. 
</P>
<P>
She sold gopher and squirrel poison for the county, and thinks that over a 
year, she sniffed so much of the stuff that her body rebelled in ways that 
might play in a Stephen King novel. 
</P>
<P>
She had excruciating headaches. She was nauseated. She had trouble staying 
awake at her desk. Others said they saw her drooling. 
</P>
<P>
She's on the mend now, but "I'm still undergoing psychological therapy," she 
said of her slow recovery. "I wanted to work for an agency that was helping the 
environment, and they were poisoning the environment themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Grisak contends that while working as a secretary for the Ramona-Julian 
Resource Conservation District, she was exposed to poisonous phosphine gas 
emitted by the poison she was selling on behalf of the county Department of 
Agriculture. At least three doctors agree. 
</P>
<P>
And at least two other persons working in the adjoining county Department of 
Social Services office in Ramona complained that they, too, were made ill by 
exposure to phosphine gas. 
</P>
<P>
Those workers were granted sick days to recuperate from their maladies, but 
Grisak filed a personal injury lawsuit against the county and filed for 
disability payments with the state's Workers Compensation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
County officials publicly insist there is no substance to Grisak's complaint, 
and are fighting her in court. Her former employer, the conservation district, 
opposes her disability request. 
</P>
<P>
But county memorandums and other internal reports obtained by The Times show 
some county officials harshly criticizing the Department of Agriculture for 
storing the pesticide improperly and for failing to train Grisak in how to 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
County employees who bag the poison wear protective clothing, according to 
county officials. But Grisak, who sometimes handled spilled bait directly, was 
given no protective clothing, no training and, she said, no warnings. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak did not even work for the county, whose poison she was selling. The 
conservation district is a small state-funded agency whose main purpose is to 
offer advice on plantings and soil for farmers and homeowners. But because the 
district used space in the county branch office, it agreed to have its 
secretary sell the Department of Agriculture's bait. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide -- packaged, distributed and sold by the county -- is grain bait 
tainted with zinc phosphide. When triggered by moisture -- typically after it 
is ingested by rodents -- the bait emits enough phosphine gas to kill small 
animals. The pesticide was sold by Grisak in 5-pound paper bags, over the 
counter in her Ramona office, for $1.89 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
While proximity to packaged, dry zinc phosphide is not in and of itself 
dangerous, inhalation of the dust, or of the phosphine gas after the poison is 
touched with water, can lead to varying degrees of headache, fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, coughing, diarrhea and shortness of breath, according to authorities 
and technical papers. Too much exposure can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
In a Social Services Department investigation of what had happened to its own 
sickened employees, the resulting report complained that "the Dept. of 
Agriculture improperly stored, for several months, a toxic pesticide. The 
matter was stored in an unvented closet with cement flooring. The secretary 
(Grisak) was not trained or authorized in the handling of this material. The 
cement floor, when even moderately moist, will cause the pesticide to exude 
toxic fumes into the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Where the form asks what contributed to the problem, the report says, "The 
apparent or alleged disregard of Dept. of Agriculture personnel in seeing to it 
that this pesticide was more appropriately stored with properly trained 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Our employees were not aware of this potentially dangerous situation until so 
informed by (Grisak)," the report continued. "At this point . . . (Cal/OSHA) is 
involved. Their representatives informed our workers of the potential danger 
and special care required in handling these materials." 
</P>
<P>
Such precautions generally include keeping the chemicals dry and avoiding 
inhaling any fumes or handling the bait with bare hands. 
</P>
<P>
In another interoffice memo within the Department of Social Services, it was 
noted that Grisak "was observed to occasionally be drooling and suffering from 
headaches." 
</P>
<P>
At least two employees in the Social Services Department got time off for their 
illnesses. One of them, Naomi Dummitt -- who no longer works for the county -- 
was diagnosed by her doctor with "exposure to phosphine." 
</P>
<P>
But Grisak's case was by far the worst. Three doctors examined her and 
concurred she showed signs of exposure to zinc phosphide, including "severe, 
incapacitating headaches," lethargy, fatigue, nausea and depression, according 
to files on record at the Workers Compensation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James G. Dahlgren, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at UCLA, and 
an internal specialist who examined Grisak, said she also might have sustained 
damage to her peripheral and central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Grisak, 39, believes she is on the mend -- but worries about chromosomal 
damage, which is addressed in technical literature as a possible result of 
exposure to phosphine. She and her husband, Mike, had been thinking about 
having children, and now they're in doubt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She wants disability income, and she wants the county to own up to what she 
said it did to her. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have made life so much simpler if the county would have just said, 
'Gee, we made a mistake.' But they won't." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, county officials dismiss Grisak's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The county employees who bag the poison wear protective clothing, said Bill 
Snodgrass, the assistant county agricultural commissioner, in defending how 
carefully the county handles the poison. 
</P>
<P>
"The health department reviewed our procedures in handling it, and they did air 
samples in the Ramona office, and they haven't found any problem with the air 
in there," Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
The county no longer distributes the poison through its branch offices, 
Snodgrass said. The practice was eliminated about a year ago -- not, Snodgrass 
said, because of the Grisak incident but because requests for it were dwindling 
and because the poison is available "through private vendors." 
</P>
<P>
In its formal response to Grisak's lawsuit, the county counsel's office said 
any risk she might have faced was "insignificant." The county's defense added 
that Grisak "herself acted unreasonably, carelessly and negligently (because 
she) did not exercise ordinary care, caution or prudence for her own safety or 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
Still, various county workers, in their reports to supervisors, acknowledged 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Connelly, a pesticide enforcement officer for the county, wrote that the 
county's "General Services (Department) had some concern about materials on 
floor (due to leaky nature of the building) and hazards resulting from the 
smell of zinc phosphide." 
</P>
<P>
And a supervisor in the Department of Social Services' child protective 
services office wrote in a memo clarifying the request by her two employees for 
worker's compensation: 
</P>
<P>
"At this time I verified that both workers had indeed been exposed to phosphine 
gas. The gas was a byproduct of inappropriate handling/storage by the county 
Department of Agriculture," wrote Betsy Terrazas, the supervisor whose two 
employees work in the same office as Grisak. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak was hired as the sole staff person for the Ramona-Julian Resource 
Conservation District in February, 1988. (The agency has since merged with its 
sister Palomar Resource Conservation District, based in Escondido.) 
</P>
<P>
The zinc phosphide poison began arriving at her office in May or June of 1988 
-- after the county, following an Environmental Protection Agency ruling, 
stopped providing strychnine as rodent poison. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next year or so, according to office records, Grisak handled more than 
400 pounds of the poison, which often was delivered in 50-pound bags holding 
individual 5-pound bags. Saying she had no advice from the county on how to 
handle the material, she put the poison on the cement floor and on the shelves 
inside the small closet -- which was just 10 feet or so from her desk. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, she said, she noticed a distinctive odor, which later was linked 
to the poison, and is described as similar to either dead fish or garlic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting headaches, lethargic, sick," she said. "Others in the office 
were noticing it, too. I was handing out Nuprin like it was candy because of 
all the headaches we were getting, and we'd make extra-strong coffee to try to 
stay awake. I'd find myself going into a stupor." 
</P>
<P>
Dummitt, one of the two employees mentioned in Terrazas' memo, but who has 
since moved to Oregon, remembered the smell too. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked under the same roof, but down the hallway," she said. "It was stinky. 
You'd always notice the odor when you got to work in the morning, but then 
you'd get use to it. In fact, what I most remember were the few days when I 
didn't smell it." 
</P>
<P>
But, Dummitt said, she didn't figure the odor suggested something dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"We assumed the county wouldn't put something in there that was physically 
dangerous," she said, "because the county is always so conscious about 
protecting itself." 
</P>
<P>
Dummitt said she remembered Grisak bringing the poison in from the back service 
door on a large cart, and how some bags were broken as they were unloaded in 
Ramona. "I'd see her sweeping the loose poison up into a dust pan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And Grisak herself said she would sometimes simply use her hands to pick up 
fallen poison bait, pour it back into a broken bag and tape it shut. Nobody had 
warned her not to, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was she told to keep it dry, Grisak said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, her office typically was filled with plants and small trees donated by 
local nurseries for distribution as anti-erosion controls, and nightly she 
would water them. It wasn't unusual, she said, for the water to drip through 
the containers and wet the floor -- in and around the closet -- before she got 
a chance to mop it up. 
</P>
<P>
The building also had a leaky roof, people familiar with the structure said. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day in May of 1989 -- after almost a year of handling the stuff -- 
two people complained about the smell, she said. One was a passer-by who walked 
into the office to look for someone. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I walked into the front door of the building, I was overwhelmed by 
a chemical-kind of fume. It smelled like something you didn't want to be around 
or work in," the passer-by, Lawrence Peabody, told The Times recently. 
</P>
<P>
That day, Grisak said, a county maintenance worker, now deceased, noticed the 
smell too. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'What do you got in there?' When I opened the door to the closet, he 
said, 'You can't store that in there!' He said the county was breaking every 
regulation on the books." 
</P>
<P>
Within days, a county pesticide inspector was called to the office, put pallets 
on the floor to elevate the poison, and installed a small ventilation fan. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Grisak's nausea and headaches didn't diminish, and in early June she saw 
a doctor. He started her on a series of referrals that ultimately put her with 
Dahlgren, in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she wrote a letter to her bosses -- the board of directors of 
the conservation district -- alerting them that she would not be able to return 
to work for a month. In fact, she decided to quit altogether. 
</P>
<P>
And she complained to the state Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 
or Cal/OSHA, fearing that her workplace was contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak said the Cal/OSHA inspector was astounded by what he saw, but that he 
could do nothing about it. That inspector could not be reached by The Times. 
Both times he was called, his supervisor -- regional Cal/OSHA manager Don Amos 
-- returned the call. 
</P>
<P>
His office didn't pursue the Ramona complaint, Amos said, because of an 
agreement with the county for its own Department of Agriculture to investigate 
complaints involving the use of pesticide -- even if those complaints focus on 
the Department of Agriculture itself. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Agriculture sent a pesticide enforcement officer to 
Ramona, but according to a spokesman for that agency, nothing amiss was found. 
</P>
<P>
While the agency was miffed that it was called in to investigate "because we 
don't regulate storage or if workers are accidentally exposed to it," an 
investigation was nonetheless conducted, said Veda Federighi. 
</P>
<P>
"We could find no apparent exposure to zinc, and no evidence that phosphide had 
leaked out of the bags," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak and Dummitt said they were not surprised because, they contend, the 
poisons were removed -- and the closet walls and floor washed down -- by a 
county worker before the inspection. There simply was nothing left to detect. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was a major focus of conversation among the county employees in 
Ramona, according to one worker at the time. "One of our supervisors told us to 
keep this quiet, to keep our dirty laundry to ourselves," the worker said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the directors of the resource conservation district seemed to turn against 
her, Grisak said. "They turned into a company of strangers," she said of the 
volunteer board. "And when they heard that Cal/OSHA had lost jurisdiction on 
the case because of the agreement with the county, they looked like the cat 
that ate the canary." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Foster, president of the board, did not return phone calls put to his 
office for this story. 
</P>
<P>
For several weeks in June and July of 1989, the office was closed for the 
investigation. The closure was a "safety precaution," a spokeswoman for the 
Department of Social Services told the Ramona Sentinel newspaper at the time. 
"Some of the workers came down with headaches, but they may have been because 
the building had been sprayed for ants or it might have been psychological 
because someone was alleged to have gotten sick," the paper quoted Yolanda 
Thomas as explaining at the time. 
</P>
<P>
And in another county memo to his Ramona staff workers, Bill Bransford, a 
district chief for the Department of Social Services, announced that the 
building would be reopened because "no contamination was found. No symptoms nor 
illnesses that can be attributed to the chemicals stored were found. One 
person, who became very ill, may be suffering from lead poisoning not 
associated with the building." 
</P>
<P>
But Dahlgren, Grisak's doctor, strongly disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say the symptoms she had are unique to phosphine, but it was clear 
she did not have symptoms compatible with lead poisoning," he said 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, there are no laboratory tests to identify phosphine 
poisoning, so doctors must rely on the symptoms, coupled with the environment 
where the person worked and got sick. 
</P>
<P>
"Her's was a kind of clean case -- she was an office worker with an exposure to 
just one chemical. The only credible explanation that would explain her 
symptoms" was exposure to phosphine, Dahlgren said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ATTENTION, HUSBANDS: MATRIMONIAL ADVICE FROM A 39-YEAR 
VETERAN

<P>
Gloria Steinem and Molly Yard may want to leave the room. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Keliher, a new resident of Rancho Bernardo, has just written "For Men 
Only: How to Survive Marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Probably at bookstores by January or February, published by CCC Productions in 
Los Angeles (known for the classic "Hormones From Hell"). 
</P>
<P>
Keliher, 59, a retired school administrator, wants to give men a fighting 
chance to maintain their sanity and self-respect. Here are his rules from 
Chapter 3: "Early Danger Signs." 
</P>
<P>
* Women are basically all alike; the apparent differences are illusory. 
</P>
<P>
* Suspect her motives from the first date and look for signs of deception. 
</P>
<P>
* Beware of so-called romantic marriages; it's more important to know her 
credit rating and work history. 
</P>
<P>
He recommends bachelorhood and prenuptial agreements ("chock-full of 
obfuscating flyspecks and legalese"). Here's his section on in-laws: 
</P>
<P>
"Get half-loaded on the old man's best Scotch on every visit. Turn on the 
football game and don't take your eyes off the screen all afternoon. Insist on 
eating from a TV table so you won't miss any of the game." 
</P>
<P>
So why did Keliher, married these past 39 years, write "For Men . . ."? 
</P>
<P>
"Partly for humanitarian reasons," he explains. "Married men need all the help 
they can get. Also, I want fame and fortune. I want to drive a Porsche." 
</P>
<P>
His chapter on wifely nagging traces nagging back to the late Cretaceous period 
and notes that one of the all-time nags was Socrates' spouse, Xanthippe. 
Hemlock was a pleasure by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Keliher presumes -- hopes, actually -- that his book will be controversial. If 
so, he's been there before. 
</P>
<P>
When he was working at an inner-city school in Detroit, he published the 
satiric "New Africa High: A Low Comedy." 
</P>
<P>
He sold 20,000 copies and adapted the story for a low-budget film called "Rebel 
High." He also received numerous death threats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Our Sewers Are Your Sewers 
</P>
<P>
Seen and heard. 
</P>
<P>
* Your government at work. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council today will honor the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
for including anti-drug messages in their lip-synced songs. 
</P>
<P>
The turtles, who start a five-day run at the Sports Arena on Wednesday, will 
receive a gold-colored key to the San Diego sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
* Jeannette Roache, wife of sheriff-elect Jim Roache, has resigned as vice 
president and political operative for the Building Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of a shake-up due to the uniting of the political efforts of the 
BIA, Construction Industry Federation and Assn. of General Contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The new effort will be headed by Frank Panarisi, former assistant chief 
administrative officer for the county government. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego Catholic News Notes, the new newsletter for conservative Catholics, 
is the handiwork of Jim Holman, anti-abortion activist and editor-owner of The 
Reader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Santa for the Dogs 
</P>
<P>
News from the north. 
</P>
<P>
* Ho, ho, herpetology. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in having his pet pose with Santa Claus is invited to the 
Village Fair Shopping Center in Carlsbad from Dec. 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
For $5, you get a color Polaroid. An announcement says it's a fund-raiser for 
the North County Humane Society and SPCA, Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
All pets are welcome. To prove it, the organizers included a picture of Santa 
with a 10-foot Burmese python wrapped around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
* North County bumper sticker: "Life Is Good. Deal With It." 
</P>
<P>
* Someone stole a Bible from the purse of a 68-year-old Cardiff woman sitting 
on a bench in Del Mar. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
* Headline in the Fallbrook Enterprise: "Do You Still Call It An RV When Its 
Owners Spend Their Time Volunteering for Hard Work Instead of Enjoying 
Recreation?" 
</P>
<P>
From the country-Western song of the same title, presumably.

WILL SCHOOLS' NEW SYSTEM PASS OR FAIL?; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE COMMON-CORE CURRICULUM THAT PUSHES ALL SAN DIEGO STUDENTS TO 
ACHIEVE AT HIGH LEVELS CONTINUES AS A TOPIC OF VIGOROUS DEBATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Mira Mesa High School, veteran biology teacher Naida Groff says that new 
graduation standards requiring all students -- even those with little or no 
academic ambition -- to take tougher courses have caused an unprecedented 50% 
failure rate in her classes. 
</P>
<P>
Her math colleague Jerry Sandlin says that while he loves teaching geometry, "a 
lot of technical and service jobs will never require that sort of thing and 
it's a mistake trying to make everyone learn it." 
</P>
<P>
But at Kearny High, math teacher David Watson believes that the requirement for 
all students to take algebra and biology is a good idea because in past years 
too many students were allowed to "skate" through easy classes such as "career 
math" and "business math" that are now being eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
And in experiments at Bell and Kroc middle schools, students who normally would 
have repeated a grade because of poor performance have been promoted to the 
next grade but given more individual attention from teachers to help them 
succeed in more difficult classes. 
</P>
<P>
From secondary school to secondary school, across the sprawling San Diego city 
schools district, an intense debate over the wisdom of the "common-core" 
curriculum continues apace, more than 3 1/2 years after it was first proposed 
and well into its second year of full-scale implementation. 
</P>
<P>
Its value occupied much of the give-and-take between school board candidates in 
this fall's election for two open seats on the five-member board of trustees, 
and it remains a topic of high interest at educational gatherings across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Retired teacher John de Beck, the winner in District C, openly questions the 
philosophy of trying to educate all students at a rigorous academic level. The 
District B winner, Sue Braun, supports the idea but criticizes the lack of 
preparation afforded teachers who are suddenly faced with students less 
motivated than the typical student taking college-prep classes. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents, led by a majority of trustees and Supt. Tom Payzant, argue that all 
students need a minimum level of math, science, English and social studies in 
order to survive in an increasingly complex world -- whether they go on to 
college immediately or enter the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant, who originally labeled common core the "college-prep" curriculum, now 
prefers to call it a "minimum" graduation program. He cites new research from 
employers nationally -- from corporations to small businesses -- that shows an 
increasing demand for the same scholastic preparation from high school 
graduates required by college-admissions officers. In particular, Payzant 
believes that expectations for black and Latino students must be raised if the 
district is to improve those students chances of becoming successfully employed 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Jim Roache, who first proposed the new curriculum along with Dorothy 
Smith in May, 1987, said no one "ever believed it was going to convert a 
failing student automatically or be a quick fix to turn the whole educational 
system around. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet it is a fair idea, and it has and will continue to improve the quality of 
education for all kids by ensuring that they receive the bedrock academic 
foundation everyone is entitled to," said Roache, who was elected county 
Sheriff this month and will be replaced on the board by Braun. 
</P>
<P>
But strong skeptics remain throughout the district, the nation's eighth-largest 
urban system with an enrollment of 122,000 students, 63% of them black, Latino 
or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
"We're implementing it, we have cut out all of the (low-level) classes we were 
told to do, and we've got every kid taking algebra, geometry and biology with 
the result that our failure rate has increased tremendously, our kids are 
floundering and our teachers are frustrated," Jim Vlassis, principal at Mira 
Mesa High, the city's largest high school with 2,400 students, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got after-school tutoring, but you can't force the students to come; 
we've got programs to pull students out of class (for extra help) but too many 
kids are just unprepared for these harder classes; we have no money for smaller 
class sizes which might help; and you can't expect miracles when they have no 
study or reading skills." 
</P>
<P>
Vlassis reflected the views of many teachers in saying that the program should 
have been implemented first at the elementary level so that a greater number of 
students will be reading at grade level by the time they reach common-core 
subject courses in junior high or middle school. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, teachers in vocational and fine arts areas continue to complain 
that the additional "hard academic" requirements have eliminated chances for 
many students to take courses in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Even at Kearny High, which features the district's high-powered industrial arts 
magnet program, an experiment to combine common core with vocational classes, 
such as putting English and media technology together, has been implemented 
only in the ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
An evaluation of common core from last school year reveals no clear pattern as 
to whether student achievement is being helped or hurt, according to a district 
report being circulated among secondary school principals but not yet sent to 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
While evaluation department administrators found all schools putting the common 
core into practice, "the achievement and grade indicators of students 
participating are too inconsistent (as yet) to allow judgement," the report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
In taking a middle ground in the debate, outgoing board president Kay Davis 
said "the verdict is still out" on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper it sounds great, that philosophically all kids need to be stretched 
intellectually to take hard courses, even if they are going to be gas station 
attendants, but on a practical sense, I still wonder whether it is doable" 
given teacher attitudes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kermeen Fristrom, who oversees the common core as district director of 
basic education, takes heart because fewer teachers tell him today that the 
idea "can't work" but instead ask, "How can it be made to work?" 
</P>
<P>
Fristrom bemoans the lack of money available to train teachers in new ways of 
presenting their material to "reach" more students, a point made by many people 
throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I think that many veteran teachers can learn that they haven't lost all 
of their professional skills, that they can get results out of some youngsters 
(the type of which) some years ago they could not get any work out of," 
Fristrom said. "But we are still a long way from getting all of them the help 
they need." 
</P>
<P>
Vlassis agreed that not enough secondary teachers have changed their methods to 
deal with having three or four levels of student preparation in a single class. 
</P>
<P>
"But after 20 years of teaching, it's not enough for a teacher to go to a 
workshop or two and hear somebody speak on a new idea, and then be able to go 
back to the class and implement it," he said. "It just doesn't work that 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay High principal Maruta Gardner, new at the school after six years at 
Mann Middle School, finds that many students are struggling with the tougher 
classes. But she says that the students can't be blamed totally for the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of high school teachers pride themselves by saying they teach subject 
matter, not kids, and that's terrible," she said. "They have to adopt more of 
the middle-level school philosophy of showing that they care for children" and 
understand their problems, social as well as academic. "They haven't been 
trained for it." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner said that she told a teacher who had given 78% of his students failing 
grades "that he couldn't just tell me that it's all the fault of the kids . . . 
there's something wrong with the teaching at that point." 
</P>
<P>
At Kroc Middle School, principal Isabelle Skidmore took two of her best 
teachers this fall and paired them with an experimental class of 15 
eighth-graders who normally would have been held back in seventh grade because 
of poor achievement. Skidmore said that past experience has shown that such 
students fail to improve significantly after repeating a grade, so she decided 
that less-traditional teachers might be able to have better results, even with 
a higher-level curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult, it's frustrating so far, but there are some small successes," 
said David Pelton, who is teaching science and math to the students while 
colleague Barbara Rejebian tackles history and English. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying a lot of different ways to reach these kids, playing it 
day-by-day," said Pelton. Rejebian spent much of the summer thinking of new 
ideas to make history and English more exciting to the class, yet threw out 
much of her initial preparation the first week when she realized it wasn't 
working. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids have never been taught how to study," Pelton said. "They 
don't do the homework, they just sit in class with no participation, and since 
they've seen themselves as F students for so long, they are easily satisfied 
with improvement to a D minus while I want them to get a C or higher. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet I realize that when the entire class walks in with no homework, I've blown 
it as a teacher and have to find another approach. 
</P>
<P>
"One parent told me that she thought her child is happier about being in school 
this year, yet I worry that next year, they'll go on to high school and go back 
into a larger class when the teacher will have no time for them as an 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
While Payzant concedes that more money for retraining and smaller classes would 
help spur the willingness of more teachers to change, he argues that teachers 
must change "regardless of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the district's on-going restructuring effort to give teachers and 
principals more responsibility to design and carry out their own ideas will win 
over more people to the common-core philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"But I know the dollars to do this are insufficient and that makes it more 
difficult to get people to alter their styles, to more easily accept the 
common-core (idea)."

NEW 'PUMP HOUSE' GENERATION STILL BATTLES THE OUTSIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The boys are stoked. The six young surfers kneel on the green grass at Calumet 
Park in La Jolla, excitedly waxing down their short boards, mesmerized by the 
ocean waves below, which slap the Pacific shoreline like the stern hand of 
almighty God. 
</P>
<P>
"Epic," says 17-year-old Tyler Hellingson, whose shoulder-length blond hair has 
a simple beauty that rivals the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"On fire," says his best friend, Warren Sharkey. 
</P>
<P>
The boys, these young lords of the waves, are so intent on their ocean action 
that they ignore the three older couples who brush past to admire the silent 
sunset. 
</P>
<P>
They don't acknowledge the old woman with the metal walker, whose painfully 
slow progress is like a series of still photographs. And they don't give a 
second thought to the gray-haired couple with the cheap straw hats like their 
grandmother might wear -- standing hand-in-hand, looking lovingly at the orange 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
For these boys, nothing ever comes between them and the "Holy Water," the 
fountain of youth where they play out their sport on endless sets of ocean 
waves. Each day, every day. 
</P>
<P>
But, moments before they embark down the rocky trail to one of their regular 
surfing haunts, a spot called Sewer Line, the spell of the pounding surf is 
suddenly broken. The boys spot a surfer they've never seen before. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy bugs me," says Sharkey, whom the boys call the Shark Man. "He doesn't 
surf here. He's a stranger." 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, they watch as two older men carrying boogie boards stroll towards 
the water. The Shark Man's eyes narrow thinner than a house cat's. 
</P>
<P>
"Kooks," he mutters, loud enough for the men to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"Total barnies," adds Jack Daniels Diruscio, named by his father for his 
favorite whiskey. "No boogie-boarders. No barney-boarders." 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Tyler Hellingson told his mother that he felt like a 
second-generation member of the pump house gang. His mom, Jackie Haddad 
Hellingson, was a feature character in Tom Wolfe's "The Pump House Gang," a 
story about the youthful social rebellion the author saw taking place on the 
Southern California shores during the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tale about a handful of territorial La Jolla teens who hung around the 
old salmon-colored pump house at Windansea Beach, chasing away Outsiders, the 
mommy-daddy tourists with wax paper-wrapped sandwiches and portable grills. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years after Wolfe researched his pump house story, most of his 
teen-age characters have left the beach -- and their war against The Outsiders 
-- to a new generation of youth. 
</P>
<P>
But, for Tyler and the boys, the battle is being waged against a different 
breed of stranger. Unlike their predecessors, this beach gang no longer singles 
out the older generation for its wrath. 
</P>
<P>
For them, older women are often seen respectfully as Soul Grandmas. And many of 
the older male beach-goers are local surfers who were shredding these same 
Pacific waves when the boys wore swaddling clothes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the social beach rebellion taking place on the La Jolla shores is 
something of a Civil War, a battle based not so much on age but on just being 
different. The arrogant young versus the young. 
</P>
<P>
These days, The Outsider has become the strange young surfer from the next 
county up shore. Or the boogie-boarder who lies prone on stubby sheets of 
hard-packed polyurethane, engaging in a hybrid sort of wave riding. That really 
raises the ire of a young surfing crowd that considers its time in the water 
more a passionate calling than a kill-some-time sport. 
</P>
<P>
The Shark Man, for example, says the boogie boards look like Styrofoam ice 
chests, not the much cooler water chariots they themselves ride. "I tell them, 
'Put a lid on that soda cooler.' Because that's all they are. 
</P>
<P>
"These barnies don't belong in the water with the surfers," he said, using the 
term that has become the biggest insult for non-surfers. "Any epileptic or guy 
with one leg can boogie-board. It's just not a sport." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to turf wars, the difference between then and now is that today's 
skirmishes have moved offshore into the chilly blue water, observes Jackie 
Haddad Hellingson. 
</P>
<P>
The war is waged with insults, comments made to Outsiders meant to provoke. 
There have been fistfights at some surfing spots. Once, Tyler used his 
surfboard wax to scrawl an epitaph on the car window of an Outsider who had 
tried to move in on his spot. 
</P>
<P>
"For these kids, the water is their protected turf," Jackie Hellingson said. 
"For us, the world consisted of the beach. But they don't care about what goes 
on there. Just don't take it into the water." 
</P>
<P>
There are other differences. Hellingson's gang returned day after day to the 
same spot, the old concrete pump house on Nautilus Avenue because, back then, 
most teens in their crowd didn't have cars. 
</P>
<P>
These modern boys have got wheels galore. Tyler drives a sleek black BMW 320i 
his parents bought him. The Shark Man lays tracks with a fiery red Toyota 
four-wheel-drive truck. 
</P>
<P>
But they've got more than just the rubber. They've got the road. 
</P>
<P>
These boys have got eight lanes of freeway to take them up and down the San 
Diego County coastline and into Mexico -- freeways that weren't there back in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
So their protected turf has expanded. They're mobilized for a shifting 
battlefront. One day, Point Loma. The next, it's La Jolla. But, in their eyes, 
the waves are all theirs. 
</P>
<P>
And, although they still occasionally surf Windansea Beach, the boys usually 
stay clear of the old pump house. Tyler says it smells like low tide there. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are laying claim to the whole county shoreline," his mother says. 
"They're more concerned with how the waves are than we were." 
</P>
<P>
Times have also changed. There's no Vietnam War. Richard Nixon is just a memory 
now. And inner-city Los Angeles isn't the inferno it was during the Watts Riots 
of 1965, when Tyler's mother and her gang ruled Windansea Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler clearly sees the difference between himself and his parents as 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"People were more together back then," he says, guiding his BMW the three 
blocks from his house to Sewer Line, named for an old sewer line that juts out 
into the water from shore. "They had causes. People just don't care as much 
now. Their concerns are so small." 
</P>
<P>
He includes himself in that group. Tyler never wants to turn 21, an age he 
knows brings adult responsibilities. And time away from the water, less time to 
answer the surfing call. 
</P>
<P>
"Not even," he says, doing a sort of surfers' dance to squeeze into his 
tight-fitting wet suit. "Right now though, we don't worry about that. Our 
concerns are girls and being popular and having friends. And the waves." 
</P>
<P>
And his boys. Fifteen La Jolla-area kids, any one of whom could show up at 
Tyler's house after school for the daily pre-surf ritual: eating bagels with 
cream cheese and drinking Pepsi while scanning the daily surf reports. 
</P>
<P>
To get really stoked, they watch surf movies and listen to heavy metal music. 
But, even in the music, there are connections with the past. The Shark Man 
prefers a rip-snorting song by Jimi Hendrix called "Crosstown Traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The boys are a close-knit bunch. There's Tyler -- whom the others call 
Meathead. And the Shark Man. And Jack Daniels. And Steve Lynn. And Brian 
Villani. And Sacha Ferrandi. They're the older guys, the group's Elder 
Statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some younger tykes as well. Rug-rat surfers who have just entered 
their teens. They have braces and shorter "undergraduate hair," not the 
long-flowing blond locks of the upperclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
These youngsters are studying the etiquette of surfer cool, lessons that start 
each afternoon in Tyler Hellingson's living room. Little Ari Davis and Uncle 
Walshy -- Jason Walsh. And Naiche Kennedy, the star student of the younger 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, whom the older boys call Nacho, has his Nacho styles. Part Indian, he 
wears a T-shirt over his head like a desert turban. At 13, he already has the 
inside line on both tearing up the waves and with the girls -- the bettys -- 
back on shore. 
</P>
<P>
He's got the lingo down. And the look. That distant, almost smirking gaze he 
throws at you to suggest he's riding an epic wave somewhere far off in his 
mind, that he's floating through the world and the world can't touch him. The 
girls go crazy over it. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he's 17, that gaze and the face that throws it will become honed to 
sun-tanned perfection. Already, the boys say, Nacho is the coolest kid in his 
ninth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken him under our wing," the Shark Man says. "We talk about the 
hazards of drinking and about birth control. We won't let him smoke. Because 
we've got to set a good example for these younger guys." 
</P>
<P>
Each afternoon, when the time is just right, the boys rev their cars and trucks 
and head for their favorite surf spots. It could be anywhere from Point Loma to 
Trestles, up near the Orange County line. 
</P>
<P>
Those without cars are called leeches. But that's not as bad as being a gump -- 
a follower, a wanna-be. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, however, is to become a troll. 
</P>
<P>
"They're older guys who have these make-believe jobs in Burger King or Jack in 
the Box," The Shark Man explains. "They work shorter hours so they can spend 
their time surfing." 
</P>
<P>
When surfers graduate from high school, they also unofficially graduate from 
the group, the boys say. 
</P>
<P>
When you turn 19, the party's over. You no longer cruise the streets with the 
boys, getting chased by the cops for throwing water balloons at cars with 
out-of-state plates and boogie boards on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
You no longer cut holes in the smiling faces of enlarged photographs of old 
girlfriends and stick your own tongue out through the open mouth. And you no 
longer tell your mother never to mention girls' first names when they call. 
Because she might get confused and blurt out the wrong name. 
</P>
<P>
You don't goof on the overweight girls at the beach, by yelling "No fat 
chicks!" or "Lose weight or lose us!" Or pull stunts like the night they yanked 
Nacho's pants off in public. 
</P>
<P>
Because, when you turn 19, the boys just sort of turn their backs on you. 
They're still in high school, and you're not. They're in, and you're out. 
Later, dude. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get older, it's just not happening to stick around any more," Tyler 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Lounging on the grass at Calumet Park, near the beach path that bears the sign 
"Locals Only," The Shark Man describes the importance of being local, the 
surfer's version of a home boy. 
</P>
<P>
He explains why the boys have used stick-on deodorant to scrawl nasty epithets 
on the windows of cars belonging to foreign surfers. "We don't so much hate 
these guys," he says. "I mean, if we saw them in a different place, we might 
even be friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like, when you were a little kid and you had your place on the swing set. 
You don't want that new kid to come along." 
</P>
<P>
But Tyler and Warren and the rest of boys don't want to become trolls. Soon, 
their full-time life on the beach will come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Warren talks about rooming with Tyler at Mesa College after they graduate from 
high school next year. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, both he and Tyler are worried about making a statement today. 
The Shark Man has complemented his beachy good looks with an earring. And 
lately, he's started to smoke, letting the cigarettes dangle from his lips in a 
rebellious kind of way. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler's not so sure about what statement he wants to make. He's thinking about 
getting a tattoo because none of his boys have one of those. He's even 
considered getting a Mac Meda tattoo on his arm to match his father. 
</P>
<P>
The tattoo stands for the Mac Meda Destruction Co., an underground society his 
parents once belonged to as teen-agers, an excuse to throw beer parties at the 
beach and slap themselves on the back of the head to remind themselves that 
they were still young. 
</P>
<P>
But, for these Young Turks, Mac Meda is just a fading image of yesterday, of 
the days when his mother, Jackie Haddad Hellingson, and her gang hung around 
the old pump house steps and chased away anyone who even resembled the Older 
Generation. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a long time ago," The Shark Man says. "We're young. Twenty-five years 
ago was like the beginning of time for us."

The owner of a restaurant was bound and gagged Sunday as a gunman robbed the 
restaurant's safe, taking cash and personal jewelry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Primavera Ristorante was about to leave at 12:45 p.m. after 
putting up holiday decorations when a man approached him asking about a job, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man then drew a small caliber handgun from a bag he was carrying, forced 
the owner to the restaurant's safe and ordered him to open it, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then led the owner to an adjacent room where he bound and gagged the 
owner, police said. After taking an unspecified amount of cash from the safe, 
the robber returned to the owner and removed his jewelry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, a Hispanic male in his early- to mid-30s wearing a baseball cap, 
long-sleeve shirt and blue jeans, then fled the restaurant, police said.

RABBI KAHANE'S CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is symptomatic of the leftist detractors of the Jewish people, many of whose 
vociferous exponents are unfortunately themselves Jewish, that they 
misunderstand the phenomenon of Rabbi Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinzak's assessment of Kahane's popular support is absolutely wrong. 
</P>
<P>
We know that this is true due to the fear of the so-called "right-wing" party 
and its collaboration with the leftists to attempt to liquidate Rabbi Kahane 
through parliamentary maneuvering. It is this "right-wing" that had the most to 
fear of the rabbi: a substantial loss of financial support and portfolios in 
government. His prophetic prediction of an emasculated Likud government, 
financially subservient to the largess of U.S., has been proven correct. This 
poses as a real danger to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The truth that the leftists and their Arab supporters fail to see is that there 
cannot, nor will there be, any peaceful coexistence between Arabs and Jews in 
our land. 
</P>
<P>
The leftists and Jewish apologists refuse and abhor the concept of the 
revelation of Mt. Sinai, decreeing the exclusivity of the land of Israel to the 
Jewish people. What they mistakenly mistake for "neo-religious ideas about 
redemption" and the "indivisibility of the land of Israel" as undesirable are 
nothing more than a genuine, healthy Jewish reawakening of their identity as a 
people, a reacceptance of the yoke of G-d's kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
For those of us whose tears are not yet dried, the painful loss of Rabbi Kahane 
will only mean a redoubling of our efforts in the causes he dedicated his life 
for.

MAYOR BRADLEY'S APPOINTEES AND FUND-RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Send Your Donations to City Hall" (Nov. 14) pins the blame on 
the wrong people. Mayor Bradley is the man in charge and he is the one who 
should be in the hot seat. 
</P>
<P>
He ran three separate campaigns from City Hall and each time his lackeys pulled 
the same stunts. While he may feign ignorance of the intimate details of his 
aides' illegal activities, he cannot deny that he knew something was going on. 
</P>
<P>
You recommend that city employees who did work on Bradley's campaign on city 
time reimburse the city. Why should an appointee or an office clerk who was 
directed to work on a Bradley campaign be fined for misuse of city funds? The 
unusually high number of anonymous tipsters The Times has quoted in the two 
prior stories on this matter should leave little doubt that intimidation and 
coercion were used to get city workers to cooperate. City employees, afraid of 
losing their jobs, should not be required to pay Bradley's campaign tab. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone is to blame in this matter, it is clearly the man at the top. Bradley 
is where it belongs logically, legally and morally. The facts The Times has 
uncovered are enough to demand an end to Tom Bradley's corrupt regime. Do us 
all a favor and "just do it."

MAYOR BRADLEY'S APPOINTEES AND FUND-RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, there is a scandal brewing in Mayor Bradley's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
What will the good mayor do this time? Will there be another person who has to 
resign his position because he was unduly influenced by the good mayor and 
should have known better? 
</P>
<P>
Will there be another new "ethics" law introduced for the city by the good 
mayor? 
</P>
<P>
Will he show us that politics is really a sleazy profession and ask for the 
public's understanding? 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that Bradley can ask for anything but my vote. That is one thing 
that he will never get again.

EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DEAL WITH MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT BUSH NEEDS TO BE AS AGGRESSIVE AS VISIONARY PRESIDENT SALINAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will hold their 
sixth summit meeting this week in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey. 
That's more than a little symbolic. While Mexico City is far bigger, most 
Mexicans regard Monterrey as their nation's business capital. And the business 
of business has come to dominate the Bush-Salinas agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are expected to move closer to launching negotiations on a 
free-trade agreement between the United States and Mexico similar to the trade 
pact this country signed with Canada in 1988. Formal talks may begin next 
spring -- a lot sooner than many observers had expected, but nowhere near soon 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
The world is moving into an era in which economic clout is every bit as 
important as military might, and superpower status belongs not just to 
underdeveloped giants like the Soviet Union and China, but to financially 
strong nations like Japan and economic blocs like the European Community. Most 
economists agree that if the United States is to remain a world leader in this 
new economic order, it will do so only if it remains a major trading nation 
that exports as much as it imports. And when it comes to U.S. trade, and the 
economic growth that comes with it, there is literally no country more 
important to us than Mexico. It's our third-largest trading partner, behind 
only Japan and Canada. But those two countries don't send us millions of 
unemployed workers as migrants. And the United States is just as important to 
Mexico, buying 69% of its exports in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable thing about these little-known statistics is that such a 
significant level of economic interdependence has come about despite formidable 
obstacles. We have been futilely trying to expel illegal migrants from Mexico 
for generations. And until recently, Mexico was one of the world's most closed 
economies, with most key industries controlled by the state and those in 
private hands protected from outside competition. If so much was achieved with 
little encouragement from Washington or Mexico City, imagine the economic 
potential if both governments started knocking down trade barriers rather than 
erecting them. For years, farsighted Mexican and U.S. political leaders could 
only dream because the concept was not politically feasible. All of that has 
changed under Salinas, who is making over his country almost as radically as 
Mikhail Gorbachev is altering the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE ECONOMIC INSTINCT: 
</P>
<P>
Salinas did not come into office two years ago intending to launch a second 
Mexican revolution. After taking over from Miguel de la Madrid, Salinas' main 
problem was trying to resuscitate a Mexican economy that was stagnant after 
almost seven years of recession. A trained economist (who studied at Harvard, 
among other places), Salinas knew the only way to get Mexico back to financial 
health was to repay the country's massive debt and stimulate new investment by 
foreigners and the many Mexicans who hid their money abroad when the economy 
took a nose dive. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Salinas focused on traditional economic remedies for Mexico's 
troubles -- he cut government spending, curbed inflation and sold off 
state-owned companies. It was a painful austerity program but it did reverse 
the downward trends of Mexico's economic indicators. It also helped Salinas 
renegotiate Mexico's foreign debt and get more favorable terms from its 
creditors. That boosted business confidence in Mexico somewhat, but not enough 
to bring in all the new investment Salinas wanted. 
</P>
<P>
During a trip Salinas took earlier this year to generate more European 
investment in Mexico, he was jarred to learn that the newly freed nations in 
Eastern Europe were drawing investment dollars away from his country. He 
realized Mexico would have to find economic help closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE WORTHY RISK: 
</P>
<P>
When he campaigned for Mexico's presidency, Salinas shared the view most other 
Mexican political leaders still hold -- that the disparity between the two 
economies is so great that Mexico would inevitably get the short end of any 
free trade agreement with the United States. He now is convinced this is a risk 
worth taking in exchange for all the benefits a free trading system will 
produce in North America. Still, when Salinas sent representatives to 
Washington to broach the idea of a free trade pact earlier this year, it was an 
act of genuine political courage. 
</P>
<P>
That's why it was not just surprising, but disappointing, that his pitch got 
such a cool reception from the Bush Administration. U.S. trade officials said 
publicly that the process of getting a signed free trade pact with Mexico could 
take much longer than the four years of negotiations it took with wealthier 
Canada. They reminded the Mexicans about the many economic U.S. interest groups 
that would likely raise objections to it, among them industries that compete 
with Mexican imports, like steel and textiles, farmers who compete with Mexican 
winter crops and labor unions that worry about manufacturing jobs moving south 
of the border. 
</P>
<P>
There was irony in a Republican Administration sympathetic to business -- and 
dominated by Texans -- suddenly being reluctant to press forward with a free 
trade proposal made by Mexico. But as time has passed, it is becoming clear 
that unless the opportunity to draw up such an agreement is seized now, the 
dream of free trade across the borders of North America could be stillborn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE POLITICAL STORM: 
</P>
<P>
Already the free trade proposal is an issue for Salinas' political opponents in 
Mexico, who are hoping to weaken his hold on the federal government in 
congressional elections next year. And the longer the idea of a free trade pact 
is debated in this country, the easier it will be for interest groups to 
nit-pick it to death. This is not to say that none of the objections to the 
free trade pact have merit -- only that the potential long-term benefits of 
free trade far outweigh the problems. 
</P>
<P>
So, despite the political and diplomatic complications involved, it is possible 
to get the trade pact talks moving quickly, and that's where Bush and Salinas 
should focus their efforts. To begin with, they should agree to put off the 
most sensitive issues -- oil and migration -- for later. Oil is symbolically 
important to Mexicans, representing what they consider their national 
patrimony. And the idea of a free flow of Mexican workers into this country 
drives labor unions crazy. Both are non-starters. And to meet the objections 
that the two economies are so different, negotiators should agree to phase in 
reduced trade barriers faster in the United States than in Mexico. Even in its 
present uneasy condition, the U.S. economy is larger and stronger than Mexico's 
and more capable of flexibility on such issues. 
</P>
<P>
As always happens in U.S.-Mexican relations, extraneous issues will manage to 
get in the way of trade negotiations -- from drug trafficking to border 
incidents to controversies over water rights. People with reasons to scuttle 
the trade talks will have lots of opportunities. So it will be up to Bush and 
Salinas to stay above the petty frays and remind people on both sides of the 
border of the long-term potential of a free trade pact, and why it's so 
important. The Canadians certainly share this vision. They have been so pleased 
with the free trade pact they signed with the United States that they are 
talking about a three-way pact to cover all of North America. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian proposal raises one troubling philosophical question for those who 
believe in free trade. What is to keep a U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact from 
becoming an economic bloc? Sort of a Fortress America to compete against rival 
blocs in Europe and East Asia, undermining all the work that is being done to 
broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That is a danger. But we 
are among those, like former U.S.Trade Representative William Brock, who 
believe a U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would enhance GATT. It would serve 
as a model to the entire world of how well different nations cooperate when 
trade barriers fall. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the time for Bush to go along with Salinas' initiative is now, while 
the Mexican president still has time to get it through his increasingly 
contentious political system. If not, it may be another generation before a 
Mexican political leader shows the vision and courage Salinas has. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Greek Film Flap: The Greek government vowed Friday to help the country's 
leading film director fight an Orthodox bishop who has threatened to burn the 
film set and excommunicate locals if they help on his latest film. Bishop 
Augoustinos Kandiotis of Florina claims the film, directed by Theodore 
Angelopoulos, is unpatriotic in calling for the abolition of national borders 
and that the script for "The Suspended of the Stork" contains erotic scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"The government unreservedly supports Theodore Angelopoulos and the shooting of 
his film," Culture Minister Tzannis Tzannetakis said. Angelopoulos, the winner 
of awards at the Cannes, Venice and Berlin film festivals, will start filming 
in Athens on Dec. 3 and in Florina on Dec. 17. Marcello Mastroianni will star 
in the $3.3-million production. Among Angelopoulos' prize-winning films are 
"Landscapes in the Mist," which opened Oct. 31 in Los Angeles. CLAUDIA PUIG

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'MOVIE CRAZY': HAROLD LLOYD'S TOP TALKIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
True discoveries in American movies are rare anymore. But the UCLA Film Archive 
comes up with something special Thursday: the restored version of "Movie 
Crazy," an excellent Harold Lloyd sound comedy, complete with 14 minutes 
missing since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Even in its shorter version, "Movie Crazy" is widely regarded as Lloyd's top 
talkie, despite competition from films by Leo McCarey and Preston Sturges. 
</P>
<P>
While Lloyd's thin voice and modest oratorical gifts didn't doom his career, 
they took it several notches down from his silent-movie glory days. But "Movie 
Crazy," full of inventive slapstick gags, equals some of his best previous 
work. 
</P>
<P>
It gives Lloyd his usual role: the bespectacled small-town go-getter, 
accident-prone but resilient, and in this case so enamored of The Movies that 
he persists in improbable attempts to become a matinee idol despite endless 
mishaps and rebuffs. His co-star, playing his cinematic ladylove, is Constance 
Cummings, the ghostly wife in the 1945 Noel Coward-David Lean "Blithe Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Fascinatingly, "Movie Crazy" reveals a filmmaker largely overlooked, even 
though he co-directed an undisputed comic masterpiece, "The General." Clyde 
Bruckman, "Movie Crazy's" director, was Buster Keaton's collaborator through 
the '20s, co-writing, among others, "Sherlock, Jr." and "The Navigator." 
</P>
<P>
His directorial career lasted only a decade, but he also made superb Laurel 
&amp; Hardy shorts ("The Battle of the Century") and two W. C. Fields classics 
("The Fatal Glass of Beer," "The Man on the Flying Trapeze"). According to 
Katz's Encyclopedia, a destitute Bruckman killed himself in 1955 with Keaton's 
pistol after eating a last restaurant meal he could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
"Movie Crazy" owes much to Lloyd's special genius; he was a co-writer. But 
Bruckman's hand is just as apparent. It's a film with unusual "backstage" 
atmosphere, impeccable timing, incredibly mobile camera work and highly 
distinctive and intricately choreographed long takes. Rediscovering Bruckman 
may be unnecessary; his movies have been giving us pleasure for years, even if 
we tend to ascribe them almost wholly to their comedian stars. But the complete 
"Movie Crazy" is a find to cherish. 
</P>
<P>
On the same program: "Hollywood Rhythm," a bizarre "backstage" look at 
songwriters Gordon and Revel, some 1932 Hearst Metrotone newsreels and an 
unusually lewd 1932 "Flip the Frog" cartoon by Walt Disney's ex-"Mickey Mouse" 
collaborator Ub Iwerks. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 206-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq has far eclipsed it in public consciousness, the civil war in El 
Salvador rages on as Monola Wali and Pam Cohen's brave documentary, "Maria's 
Story," demonstrates. Screening Tuesday at Melnitz, it's an obviously 
sympathetic, but invaluable, inside look at the Salvadoran guerrilla movement, 
shot with small-format video mostly in rebel territory. It centers on a 
campesina, Maria Serrano, whose sad, uprooted life offers a cogent portrait of 
the rebellion's history. 
</P>
<P>
Melnitz's week is rounded out with two beautifully photographed but irritating 
New Zealand films. Sam Pillsbury's 1982 "The Scarecrow" suggests the kind of 
movie Steven Spielberg might make if his mind were more off-color. Set in the 
1950s, it's a disturbingly whimsical tale of two young boys whose high jinks 
are counterpointed with the peregrinations of a local sex murderer, played with 
stubbled, magnetic scabrousness by 76-year-old John Carradine. 
</P>
<P>
Even more richly photographed, by Alec Locke in gorgeously rocky, mountain 
territory, is Leon Narbey's 1987 "Illustrious Energy." Otherwise, it's a 
lugubrious tale of three Chinese immigrants, who have struggled for decades to 
accumulate enough gold dust to emigrate home. Speech is sparse and slow; events 
few and symbolic.

Menudo Members Ousted on Pot Charges: Two singers with the pop teen band Menudo 
were arrested in Miami for possession of marijuana, then ousted from the group, 
which cultivates a clean-cut image. Police at Miami International Airport 
confiscated 45 grams of marijuana from Sergio Gonzalez, 18, and 38 grams from 
Ruben Gomez, 16, Thursday night as the group stopped in Miami en route to 
Venezuela from Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Both are free on bail after being charged with marijuana possession. The group, 
which has been active in anti-drug campaigns aimed at young teens, maintains 
its youthful appeal by rotating boys out of the group when they reach 16. 
Officials with Sonotone Music Corp., which distributes Menudo's albums, could 
not explain why 18-year-old Gonzalez was still in the group. CLAUDIA PUIG

real singers on Milli Vanilli's "Girl You Know It's True" album because he 
thinks the group's visual impact swayed voters. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (and 
formerly, albeit briefly, an L.A. chapter board of governors member), while 
certainly not speaking for the organization, I know I reflect the thoughts of 
many members by unequivocally stating that my vote last year for Milli Vanilli 
had absolutely nothing to do with the act's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Quite honestly, and to this day, I don't know if I've ever given more than a 
passing glance to any of their videos. I do know that I thought their album and 
the singles from it were terrific. In comparison to the competition and based 
solely upon what I heard in each case, I cast my vote for the artists who 
performed on the Milli Vanilli album. 
</P>
<P>
And for Hilburn to suggest that academy members vote for sales rather than for 
art is also off the mark. As hard as some members may try to hear as many 
records as possible, they can only relate to what they've heard. Certainly 
they're subject to the added input of radio, and possibly they can be 
influenced by repetition, whether intended or desirable. This seems unique to 
NARAS members due to the pervasiveness of music on radio -- as opposed, for 
instance, to the product stimuli to which motion picture academy members are 
subjected. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here, I believe, is an almost universal failure -- the academy 
included -- to recognize that in many fields of music, most recording involves 
the creation of an illusion. It needn't be a deception, but it is an illusion 
-- from the editing and splicing of "takes" in a classical performance to the 
multi-tracked, effects-laden efforts that constitute a pop record. 
</P>
<P>
Although recording is indeed an art and a science, it's not generally about 
capturing a perfect reproduction of a performance and hasn't been for many 
years. In fact, making a record is analogous in many ways to making a motion 
picture, but the magical elements of recording aren't recognized as such. 
Wasn't the Beatles' awareness of this a strong factor in their decision to stop 
touring? Didn't they realize both the futility and the foolishness of 
continuing to perform their records on stage? To my mind and ears, such 
realizations didn't diminish their studio accomplishments one whit. 
</P>
<P>
I think this skewed perception relates to the ways in which records are 
marketed. Audiences need heroes and sex symbols, so the record companies gladly 
provide them. Critics need art and artists (as opposed to entertainment and 
entertainers), so record companies try to provide these as well. If the 
illusion were "exposed" for what it is, this revelation might be damaging to 
the sale of records. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, record producers George Martin (Beatles) and Phil Spector 
(Ronettes, Righteous Brothers, Ike &amp; Tina Turner) might be regarded by the 
public with the same degree of respect and adulation generally afforded such 
film directors as Steve Spielberg and George Lucas. Moreover, the art and craft 
of songwriting might again be restored to its rightful prominence once the myth 
of its being the exclusive domain of performers is also exposed. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that phony credits have any proper relationship to the 
record-making illusion. Such misrepresentation stinks (but if you carefully 
examine the history of the record business, you'll find many cases where the 
people on stage or in front of the cameras weren't the ones in the recording 
studios). 
</P>
<P>
As a person who loves records, I suggest to everyone who cares -- including the 
academy, whose glitzy TV presentations do little to illuminate the craft -- 
that the art and science be identified and recognized for what they are. Of 
course, we'll have a different set of heroes. But absent much of the showy 
nonsense that currently prevails, perhaps we'll also have a lot more terrific 
records.

COUNTERPUNCH: RECORD FIRMS DON'T BACK DECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE SMITH, Smith is president and chief executive officer of Capitol-EMI 
Music Inc. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milli Vanilli isn't going to be soon forgotten. It's a catchword that will 
always be good for a laugh -- like the Edsel. And, unhappily, this synonym for 
"phony" will forever be associated with the record business. 
</P>
<P>
But Milli Vanilli is an aberration, a symbol of vaunting ambition gone awry. 
Those of us in the business of finding and dealing with creative artists, 
packaging and selling their records don't knowingly deal with deception, nor do 
we encourage it from any quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we are an industry that is expected to earn a profit, and that simple 
mandate can lead to excesses when the profit can't be attained in a normal 
manner -- and there are lots of temptations being handed to us by technology. 
</P>
<P>
It's now possible to put together a record with no musicians, no voices, no 
anything. But why would we want to? It's not what we do. There are so many 
legitimate, talented artists out there who can produce good music and offer 
exciting performances that we would be fools if we deliberately set out to make 
fraudulent records. 
</P>
<P>
If I were a record producer today, I would make sure that I selected singers 
who could sing; if I were going to take nobodies and make them somebodies, I 
would be sure they were nobodies who could sing. 
</P>
<P>
The Milli Vanilli affair spotlights the kind of technology it now takes to 
produce records and the kind of image it, unfortunately, takes to sell some of 
them. Record companies have no way of policing every studio and recording 
session to make sure that the people credited with making an album are in fact 
the ones performing on it. We assume they are. 
</P>
<P>
But the technology of making records has taken us long past the days when a 
Frank Sinatra could cut a record simply by coming into a studio and singing 
while a live orchestra backed him. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, making a record is like putting together an elaborate and complicated 
jigsaw puzzle -- with only the producer having any idea of the whole picture, 
with record-company executives unable to even see any work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a rhythm track laid down first, then horns or other instruments 
added; next, a vocal layer, then perhaps a back-up vocal. The various pieces 
may be "sweetened" and modified in other ways long before the lead vocalist or 
vocalists ever get there. 
</P>
<P>
All along the way, there are opportunities to substitute other people for those 
who are said to be there. We don't have someone in every recording studio 
taking fingerprints. True, technology enables us to add augmentation in the 
studio to various singers and instruments -- that happens all the time -- but 
that doesn't mean there's widespread deception occurring. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary music is made by talented writers and performers who avail 
themselves of technology to create the best audio experience possible -- 
synthesizers, 64-track recording facilities, drum machines are all now 
available and make for wonderful listening experiences. Motion pictures and 
television have been dubbing and using special effects forever. Where is it 
written that we have to make music with a single microphone overhead and 
include every mistake? 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Milli Vanilli matter is a left-field intrusion. Even if the 
record company was aware of the circumstances, even if Arista messed this one 
up and made a mistake, it's not what the company's about. Arista is a company 
that records and sells talented musicians -- Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin, 
Whitney Houston, Hall &amp; Oates and many others. It doesn't need to resort to 
deceptive practices to make money. I don't think any major player in this 
industry is unethical in what it presents to the public. 
</P>
<P>
But we are an industry that pays off big when you make it. That attracts a 
certain amount of hustlers and opportunists. Milli Vanilli sold 7 million 
albums in the United States alone, an additional 3 million in Europe. With 
publishing, performing, video and subsequent personal appearances, this puts at 
least $20 million to $30 million in play. 
</P>
<P>
Video, of course, is the magic force behind a lot of the smoke and mirrors that 
made up Milli Vanilli. Without video -- MTV, music videos, video advertising -- 
audio wouldn't sell as well these days. Music critics in today's media wish 
that MTV weren't so. Maybe a lot of us in the music business wish that it 
weren't so, that we weren't subject to brief video bites. But it is what it is. 
</P>
<P>
We are dealing with a video generation that has grown up with MTV for the last 
decade. Now, as the head of a recording company I have to make decisions that 
take that into consideration, and so does every other recording company 
executive. Because of the high stakes involved, it will be possible to pull off 
another Milli Vanilli, but not because we in this business want it. 
</P>
<P>
This situation will cause us all to check a little closer, but I assure you 
that no checking will have to be done with artists of the stature of Paul 
Simon, Bonnie Raitt, Stevie Wonder, Phil Collins, Quincy Jones or any of the 
hundreds of other great creative men and women who make up the enormous body of 
American contemporary popular music that's been the standard to which every 
young musician around the world has aspired for decades.

SUPPORT FOR 'AFRICA NOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Horowitz's Counterpunch article "The Left Is Crying Wolf Over 'South 
Africa Now' (Nov. 19) was a tiresome string of '50s McCarthyite and '80s 
right-wing think-tank cliches directed against the PBS series, its producers 
and those who urge KCET to continue broadcasting it. 
</P>
<P>
There are two major works that have put the myth of liberal domination in U.S. 
media to rest: Mark Haagstad's highly acclaimed book "On Bended Knee: The Media 
During the Reagan Years" and the in-depth study "Fairness and Accuracy in 
Reporting on 'MacNeil/Lehrer' and 'Nightline.' " 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz's Committee on Media Integrity accuses PBS of creeping leftist 
domination, but it is soundly contradicted by facts: The "alternative" U.S. 
guests on "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" were more than 90% white males and most 
of them were right-wing or conservative. 
</P>
<P>
The great majority of talk shows such as "Firing Line," "The Capitol Gang" and 
"The McLaughlin Group" have made a practice of having center liberals 
exclusively representing the left, usually in a setting controlled by 
right-wing spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, corporate sponsorship has been the cornerstone of these shows 
and of the proliferation on PBS of business news programs (not of a leftist 
perspective). 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, television's "The Kwinty Report," hosted by Jonathan Kwinty, 
author and former Wall Street Journal reporter -- which provided a more diverse 
list of guests and more substantive and wide-ranging discussion -- was taken 
off the air due to lack of renewed corporate and foundation support. 
</P>
<P>
I'm still trying to figure out Horowitz's warped logic of calling those that 
support the airing of "South Africa Now" "vigilantes" and those (such as the 
Horowitz group) who ask for its cancellation proponents of "balance in public 
television." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz tells us that the opponents of the series were "civilized" in making 
their cancellation request and didn't even use a letter-writing campaign to 
achieve their end. That's very kind of his organization -- in that the '80s, 
like the McCarthyite '50s, was a period of well-financed right-wing 
organizations that worked as media hit squads, with chilling effects on freedom 
of speech. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz tries to accuse the left of the practices that the right wing has 
perfected in its attacks against media. It's like accusing the victim of the 
crime -- or Hitler burning the Reichstag to blame it on the communists.

INSTALLATIONS BY PELLEGRIN: ALCHEMIST OF INCIDENTALS;

<P>
ITALIAN ARTIST PRESERVES A SENSE OF INNOCENCE AND INGENUOUSNESS IN HIS WORK.

<TEXT>
<P>
When a child empties his pockets and lines up his treasures -- a key, a gum 
ball, a rabbit's foot, a coin, a stamp -- there's something magical to the act. 
He arranges and rearranges them in rows and sequences, relishes the memories 
that each object embodies, and imbues them in his mind with mysterious powers. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian artist Maurizio Pellegrin, a 33-year-old native of Venice who now 
lives in Rome, has preserved this same sense of innocence and ingenuousness in 
his work. He is a collector of incidentals -- a rifle bag, a golf ball, a 
button, a scrap from a broken picture frame, a torn photograph. He is an 
alchemist who turns these valueless treasures into art simply by spreading them 
out, arranging them and installing them on gallery walls in patterns that are, 
in the end, very beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Pellegrin is well-known in Europe; his work has been exhibited widely there and 
was included in 1988 Venice Biennale, but a selection of six large 
installations on view at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla 
make up his first museum show in the United States. The exhibition (to Feb. 10) 
was organized by Lynda Forsha, the museum's curator. 
</P>
<P>
It is a memorable and evocative first taste. Pellegrin appears to be one of 
those artists who have such an intrinsic sense of design and an ingenuous 
delight in the simple object that his uncluttered arrangements all are hard to 
resist. 
</P>
<P>
In the works here he includes as few as one or two objects and as many as 189. 
Each element has a history, although we don't know where they came from or 
whether the artist has owned them for long. All of the parts look old and 
somewhat worn. Often Pellegrin alters the objects by painting black bands on 
their surfaces to add sobriety, like armbands that signify mourning. And he 
numbers everything with stencilled numerals, in no particular order, adding 
some spice though the inexplicable magic of numerology. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a very personal mix; each individual element of the installations 
has a history, collectively they create unusual harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
As you enter the museum, you are confronted first with a wall-sized 
installation titled "Angolature Selettive (Selective Corners), 1989." This 
collection of 73 elements line the wall in an arrangement that lacks any 
obvious order, yet the work has its own sense of balance and interplay, an 
intrinsic stability that is evident in all of Pellegrin's work. 
</P>
<P>
The components of the piece are commonplace enough: most are pieces from a 
variety of dressmakers' patterns, blueprints for women's clothing parts. There 
are also a couple of spools of thread, a long-sleeved green knit dress, several 
wooden hangers and a fabric-covered oval form that is dotted with black 
buttons. Amid all this is a framed photograph, its image obscured by a collage 
that includes a white glove, a button and a scrap of linen fabric. 
</P>
<P>
And always there's the artist's imprint: Every object is stamped with a numeral 
-- again with no order. Sometimes two or even three numbers decorate a single 
object. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this stuff looks like what you might find in a junk shop. Or at an 
estate sale. The materials are attractive in and of themselves -- natural 
materials, good design. 
</P>
<P>
Pellegrin gives no explanations, but none are needed. The objects all are 
familiar, and yet foreign, the numbers are meaningless, but easy to project 
meaning into. This looks like an archeologist's find -- but it's stuff that has 
been found before any significant amount of time has lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by the artist suggests that he assigns meaning to his numbers: "I 
was born on the 21st day of the month," he once said in an interview. "The 
number 21 stands for the universe, embodying the karmic reward, the success and 
elevation which come after a long battle." Perhaps in Pellegrin's mind there is 
significance to every element, but he tells us nothing. And it doesn't matter. 
We can take pleasure in how the objects look. And we can add our own 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
Where "Selective Corners" represents a feminine side of the artist's work -- 
women's clothing -- "Disideri Lontani Oltre il Giardino (Distant Desire Beyond 
the Garden)," 1988, is the sporting side, perhaps the masculine side. Among the 
35 objects hung artfully for this latter work are three rifle bags, two golf 
balls, a leather glove and a selection of boards covered with fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Another work includes numerous score-keeping paddles for billiards, and another 
is made up mostly of broken fragments from 18th- and 19th-Century wooden 
frames. 
</P>
<P>
There is a seductiveness to this show that is very convincing, and yet, despite 
the beauty, there is a certain consistency and sameness to all of the works. 
The six works here are very satisfying, but one has to wonder what it might be 
like to see more. Would all this mystery degenerate into pretentiousness? Would 
all this history begin to seem empty? Thankfully, the museum had the good sense 
to leave us guessing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Pellegrin show, a second far more disappointing one-person 
show also opened at the La Jolla museum recently (also to Feb. 10). The New 
York-based conceptual artist John Knight (born in 1945) made a mockery of the 
opportunity to share his work with the public. 
</P>
<P>
Using the museum's windows -- with their splendid ocean views -- as his ground, 
he frosted the glass with fragments of the word bienvenido (Spanish for 
"welcome"), obscuring the views. Looking out from the museum's Glass Gallery, 
you see only shapes -- frosted windows and small areas of translucent glass 
operate like an Ellsworth Kelly abstract painting. 
</P>
<P>
But the method here is not arbitrary. The message, which is totally illegible, 
is meant to be three stories high, and if the frosting were visible from the 
exterior of the museum -- which it is not -- then that is the only place where 
you could see the relationship between the fragments, the only hint of what it 
is supposed to say. Walls separate windows, and nothing is inscribed on them; 
all that there is, is fragments. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the work, which since it is unintelligible amounts just to decorative 
window frosting, takes place in the museum offices, all of which are 
inaccessible to the public except by appointment, and in the museum's basement, 
which is also inaccessible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, there is nothing to see, and little that you could see even if you 
wanted to.

'AIDS QUARTERLY' PROBES DEPTH OF POLAND'S HEALTH DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the most nettlesome aspects of the global spread of AIDS are its 
glacial pace and how it hits hardest those poor countries whose health care 
systems are least able to contend with it. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner has the confetti settled from European celebrations of a unified, 
liberated Continent than we see such reports as the latest edition of "The AIDS 
Quarterly," tonight at 8 on Channel 15 and at 10 on Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
The edition's main segment (followed by a brief one on HIV-infected author 
Edmund White) examines why Poland has become a nightmarishly perfect host for 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the elements that make Poland a virtual AIDS sponge. Its deep Catholic 
traditions frown on the talk or use of condoms, and frown even more on gay men 
coming out of the closet. A cheap, homemade type of heroin called Kompot has 
caused a 400% increase in addicts in a decade, with numbers now reaching some 
600,000 Poles. Since needles are scarce and usually shared, most Kompot users 
are now HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
The final insult is Poland's health-care apparatus: Warsaw's only 
infectious-diseases hospital can handle no more than eight AIDS patients at 
once -- and they are treated with medicine past its expiration date. As Dr. 
Andrej Horban states: "This is the dilemma of the poor man." 
</P>
<P>
The depth of the dilemma, though, is somewhat blunted by the report's rather 
numb approach, broken by moments of chilling displays of intolerance (a woman 
berates a homeless drug addict on the street) or hopelessness (a young couple, 
both infected, wait to die). ROBERT KOEHLER

A COMEDY WHOSE TIME HAS PASSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Working Trash," starring George Carlin and Ben Stiller as a pair of Wall 
Street janitors turned crafty inside traders, is a dubiously timed comedy about 
the stock market, airing at 8 tonight, Channels 11 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Broadcasting Co.'s first original TV movie, launching "Fox Night at the 
Movies," is a feckless romance about love and money and the little guys 
outwitting the big guys. 
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of a decade of scandals on Wall Street, the gaudy spree 
depicted in this story looks quaintly dated. 
</P>
<P>
This is a comedy for the greedy '80s that has the ill-gotten luck to come out 
in the '90s. Real-life events have robbed the movie of its bite. There is one 
timely image, though, of a pair of crooked brokers (the dastardly Jack Blessing 
and Dan Castellaneta) pushing brooms in a jail. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Ebsen's corporate snoozer, Leslie Hope's vivid broker and Michael J. 
Pollard's quirky shoeshine man (a performance that veers on the comatose) lend 
support. Carlin (who is testament to a theory which holds that older men look 
silly in ponytails) and especially Spiller are affable. 
</P>
<P>
But the pleasant discovery, a character who stands out and steals the show even 
though she's only on camera for a few scenes, is the nervous, loopy, tall 
brunette (Lisa Montgomery) who plays Ebsen's secretary. She's delicious, the 
quintessential not-so-airy airhead. RAY LOYND

EAST L.A. FANTASY PARADE TAKES ON POLITICAL LUSTER

<TEXT>
<P>
They call it the East Los Angeles Christmas Fantasy Parade. 
</P>
<P>
For the politically aware among the crowd who watched the high school bands, 
floats, drill teams and mariachis tool down Whittier Boulevard on Sunday, the 
fantasy theme took on a new luster this year. 
</P>
<P>
Just five days before filing will close for the election of a new Los Angeles 
County supervisor in the 1st District, the four major candidates for the 
powerful post are all Latinos who grew up not far from the parade route. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone 115 years without a Hispanic on the Board of Supervisors," said 
Benjamin Herrera, one parade spectator elated at the political choice awaiting 
the community. "This means a lot. It's about time. We are almost 3 million now 
in the county. We deserve to be represented." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) and Sarah Flores, a former aide to retiring County Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum, received a warm welcome from a crowd estimated at 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) was the only prominent politician 
running to replace Schabarum in a special election Jan. 22 who did not ride in 
the parade. Gonzalo Molina, a schoolteacher who is a perennial candidate, is 
also in the race and did not take part in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the heavily Latino crowd spoke with pride of the opportunity "to vote 
for one of our own" and elect the first Latino to the board in modern history. 
While some described old allegiances to one of the candidates, most said they 
are waiting before they make their choice. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), the patriarch of East Los Angeles' 
Latino political community, struck the only cautionary note of the day, saying 
the Latino grip on the 1st District seat is still far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
"The filing is not closed yet," Roybal said before getting in his car near the 
head of the parade. "We don't know what is going to happen yet. I am just 
waiting for the other shoe to drop." 
</P>
<P>
Roybal speculated that Schabarum or another candidate could still enter the 
race and pose a threat to the Latino entrants. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal recalls the 1958 supervisorial election, when he appeared on his way to 
victory, until 12,000 votes were mysteriously discovered in a recount several 
days after the election. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too soon to celebrate," Roybal said. "We will have a lot more answers on 
Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Roybal's 32-year-old loss played a role in the U.S. District Court ruling last 
June that Latino voting strength had been diluted in the county by unfair 
boundaries for the five-member board. Judge David V. Kenyon approved boundaries 
for a new district, stretching from East Los Angeles into the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For candidates Torres and Molina, Sunday's parade was part of an annual 
tradition -- a homecoming that gave them a chance to solidify their base of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Both had spent the morning walking precincts in Pico Rivera. Molina supporters 
had covered the parade route with yellow and green "Molina for Supervisor" 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
Torres took a more vigorous approach, jumping from his car to work the crowd: 
pumping hands, greeting friends and shouting the old Chicano-power slogan: 
"Viva la raza!" 
</P>
<P>
For Flores, who grew up near downtown and now lives in the San Gabriel Valley 
community of Glendora, the parade was a "coming out party." She had watched the 
parade from the curb many times, but this year was her first as a participant, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores arrived 2 1/2 hours before the other candidates to meet the business 
people and community leaders who sponsor the parade. Said one man: "Are you one 
of our candidates? Good luck to you." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Arguello, who helped organize East Los Angeles Christmas parades in the 
mid-1970s, said the event has always measured the spirit of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years ago, the first parade was a triumph, because it showed the 
outside world that a community that had been torn by riots and crime could 
recover and celebrate itself, Arguello said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know if we could get the businesses to come out or if the 
celebrities would participate," Arguello said. "We didn't even know if it would 
be a permanent thing. Now it's an institution." 
</P>
<P>
The parade of home-grown politicians Sunday represented another victory, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, we are already excited," said Arguello, "because today the victory is 
that we already know we will have one of our own."

An American computer scientist just back from the Soviet Union reports that a 
group of supercomputers under construction there could put the Soviets closer 
than ever to the United States and Japan in building the world's most powerful 
computers. One of the Soviet machines, called El 'brus-3-1, is nearing 
completion and could be tested within six months, according to Peter Wolcott of 
the University of Arizona's management information systems department. 
</P>
<P>
Wolcott said the Soviets told him that the machine will have a peak processing 
rate of about 560 million mathematical operations a second, comparable to the 
performance of some mid-range U.S. and Japanese supercomputers. Another 
machine, El 'brus-3, may attain a peak rate of 11 billion operations per 
second; however, the prototype of that machine will not be ready before 1992, 
Wolcott said. Both computers are being built at the Institute of Precision 
Mechanics and Computer Technology near Moscow, by teams led by Boris Babayan, 
one of the country's top computer designers.

LYME DISEASE SYMPTOMS LINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some victims of Lyme disease may suffer memory loss, mood changes, tingling 
sensations, shooting pains and other signs of nerve damage that strike years 
after the initial tick bite, scientists have found. 
</P>
<P>
Antibiotic therapy can often relieve these lingering symptoms, although 
recovery is seldom complete. 
</P>
<P>
"This is similar to syphilis," said Dr. Allen C. Steere. "Although the 
neurological symptoms and consequences are different, in both diseases there 
are long periods of latent infection in the brain followed by a variety of 
neurological disorders." The doctors cautioned that only a few Lyme patients 
suffer this lingering nerve disorder, and most can be cured with antibiotics 
given early during their infections. 
</P>
<P>
Steere, who first recognized the disease in Old Lyme, Conn., about 15 years 
ago, was senior author of the latest report, written with two colleagues at New 
England Medical Center in Boston. It was published in last week's New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by tiny ticks that are 
usually carried by deer and mice. It is common throughout the Northeast, 
Midwest and California. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the first sign of Lyme disease is a red circular rash around the tick 
bite. It is often accompanied by fever, fatigue, aches and other flu-like 
miseries. In more advanced stages, the disease can cause arthritis and 
neurological problems.

INFORMATION LAPSE SLOWS WORD ON AIDS TREATMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Steinbrook, a physician, is a Times medical writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsors a 
substantial proportion of U.S. AIDS research, has an annual budget of more than 
$900 million, including about $950,000 for its communications office. 
</P>
<P>
But not one cent is specifically allocated to inform physicians about treatment 
advances against AIDS or other deadly diseases. 
</P>
<P>
This startling fact came to light earlier this month as the federal institute 
responded to a newspaper story stating that it had delayed publicizing its 
recommendations for the use of a potentially life-saving treatment advance 
against a common AIDS-related pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
The story, which appeared in the New York Times, turned out to be overstated. 
But it did focus attention on the real problems, including budgets, that plague 
the NIAID's efforts to keep physicians informed of state-of-the-art therapies. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have funds budgeted for this sort of information dissemination" to 
physicians, said Elaine Baldwin, chief of information projects in NIAID's 
office of communications. "We recognize that we don't have a good system." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said the institute has "relied on drug companies who have had an 
interest in getting information out on a particular (AIDS) study" to send 
letters, at the drug company's expense, to physicians who are on their mailing 
lists. Such mailings typically reach only a small percentage of physicians. 
That method also raises questions about the propriety of the federal 
government's reliance on pharmaceutical manufacturers who profit from increased 
sales of their products. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, physicians and patients should be fully informed about new treatments 
for serious illnesses as soon as they are proved effective. While instantaneous 
access to valid medical information is not realistic, many believe that the 
federal government could do a far better job in getting the word out. 
</P>
<P>
The new federal recommendations for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia were written by a panel of 17 AIDS experts, including nine from 
California. After reviewing five clinical trials, the experts called for the 
use of the steroid drug prednisone in addition to standard antibiotics to treat 
moderate to severe cases of the pneumonia. Pneumocystis infection is one of the 
most common causes of death in AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
The news that steroids were a promising addition to the standard pneumonia 
treatment is nothing new. It has been publicized frequently in recent months -- 
for example, in a presentation by a UC San Diego physician at the international 
AIDS conference in June, which was reported in the Los Angeles Times, and in an 
article and an editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine in July. 
</P>
<P>
However, the federal government's endorsement of the use of steroids has 
received relatively little attention until this month. Authoritative government 
recommendations, on diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease to AIDS, can 
be crucial in encouraging physicians to change the way they practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The federal AIDS treatment recommendations were made final in August and 
discussed at AIDS meetings and on cable television shows aimed at physicians. 
The report was not made public until last week, when it was published, along 
with two of the five studies reviewed by the expert panel, in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
During the intervening three months, some physicians may have failed to 
prescribe steroids for AIDS patients who needed them because they were unaware 
of the expert panel's conclusions. Baldwin and Dr. Henry Masur, the National 
Institutes of Health official who chaired the panel, acknowledged in interviews 
that little was done to directly inform physicians or the public of the 
recommendations, despite the permission the government received from the New 
England Journal of Medicine in September to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The NIAID communications office had prepared a three-page "note to physicians" 
summarizing the "important information on the clinical benefit" of steroids. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 10, the summary was sent by LyphoMed/Fujisawa, which manufactures a 
drug used to treat pneumocystis, to 2,500 physicians on its mailing list. This 
is fewer than 0.5% of the approximately 600,000 physicians in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Some newsletters specializing in AIDS treatments also were notified, as was a 
U.S. Public Health Service toll-free number that provides AIDS information. 
</P>
<P>
NIAID never released its own statement to the public, the news media, hospital 
intensive care unit directors or leading medical organizations, such as the 
American Medical Assn., so that they might have notified their members. 
</P>
<P>
In the Public Health Service, "no one takes responsibility for unusual 
circumstances such as this," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe of the Washington-based 
Health Research Group, which has repeatedly called for federal health officials 
to establish a mechanism to swiftly inform physicians of major therapeutic 
advances in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
"In the future, we may come up with a multi-pronged plan of action," said 
Baldwin, of the NIAID. "I think it would be a very good idea."

GIANTS ALSO FAIL TO STAY UNDEFEATED

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randall Cunningham and the Philadelphia Eagles did Sunday what they have done 
so well the past few years -- spoil the party for the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
With Cunningham throwing for 222 yards and two touchdowns and running for 66 
yards and another score, the Eagles beat the Giants, 31-13. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Eagles' fifth consecutive victory and New York's first loss in 11 
games this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we could beat them," Cunningham said. "They knew we could beat them, 
we just didn't know how." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan said, "No question, it was a super game for us, 
the kind of a game you really dream about." 
</P>
<P>
Against a team that prides itself on ball control, Philadelphia had the ball 
for 38:39, including touchdown drives that took 9:22 and 8:48. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles had 405 offensive yards, by far the most against the Giants this 
season. Only Washington, which had 328 against them, had gone over 300 yards 
against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Randall was superb," said running back Keith Byars, who had eight catches for 
128 yards. "He told us they weren't doing anything to stop us. We were stopping 
ourselves. He was a leader all afternoon. He kept us pumped up in the huddle." 
</P>
<P>
They forced the Giants, who had run the ball 60% of the time coming in, to 
throw 40 passes and run only 14 times. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Simms threw two interceptions, equaling his total for the first 10 games. 
One was a tip by Seth Joyner that went to Byron Evans, who returned it 22 yards 
for a touchdown just 22 seconds after Cunningham had thrown a six-yard scoring 
pass to Calvin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't run against us," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Giants' passing was by choice. They came out throwing and continued 
to pass even in a close game. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had a 7-0 lead, trailed only 14-13 at halftime and 17-13 at the end 
of three before those two quick touchdowns put them away. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense controlled the game so much they didn't have a chance to get 
anything going," Joyner said. "All year long they've established the running 
game. They've jumped out early on teams. Simms has been so conservative all 
year long they would get good momentum and then mix up their running and 
passing. We put a sense of urgency on them today." 
</P>
<P>
For Philadelphia, it was their fifth win in their last six games against the 
Giants, who beat them, 27-20, on opening night at the Meadowlands. It also 
ended a streak of 13 regular season victories by the Giants -- typically, their 
last loss was 24-17 to the Eagles at the Meadowlands last Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
New York scored first on Simms' 15-yard pass to Mark Ingram one play after 
Myron Guyton recovered a fumble by Byars at the Eagle 18. But the Eagles took 
just three plays to come back on Cunningham's 49-yard bomb to Fred Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Eagles drove 80 yards in 16 plays, all but one on the ground, to take 
a 14-7 lead on Cunningham's one-yard sneak on a fourth-down play. The 73 yards 
Philadelphia gained on the ground during that drive was four fewer than the 
Giants had allowed per game coming in. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Ruzek's 39-yard field goal made it 17-13 midway through the third 
quarter, then Cunningham drove the Eagles 84 yards in 15 plays, controlling the 
ball for another 8:48. The touchdown came 1:48 into the fourth quarter on the 
six-yard pass to Williams, which was tipped by New York's Greg Jackson.

MORNING BRIEFING: RADIO CAREER WAS A (LONG) SNAP DECISION 
</P>

<P>
Adam Lingner is the Buffalo Bills' long snapper -- the guy who hikes the ball 
for punts, extra points and field goals. 
</P>
<P>
He's also the only long snapper in the NFL with his own radio show. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the show's appeal, he told John F. Bonfatti of Associated Press, is 
that listeners can get a sense of what life is like in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, Lingner described an episode from the Bills' game with 
Phoenix: 
</P>
<P>
"I came up to the line of scrimmage, and I'd met Bill Lewis, their starting 
center, before. He was rushing me on field goals and I said, 'Bill, are you any 
good at this?' 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't really say anything. He just chuckled under his breath. And ran me 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"At least the snap was good." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Before Doug Drabek (22-6) did it this season, who was the last 
Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher to lead the National League in victories? 
</P>
<P>
Jack Who?: In their book, "The Pro Football Chronicle," Dan Daly and Bob 
O'Donnell include an excerpt from a Pittsburgh Press story that appeared Sept. 
6, 1955, reporting that the Steelers had cut a halfback named Burrell Shields. 
</P>
<P>
The story went on: "Others leaving with (Shields) are halfbacks Bill 
Staudenmaier of Chattanooga and Ed Smith of Southwest Texas, quarterback Jack 
Unitas of Louisville, guard Vince Werl of Dayton and tackle Joe Cimini of 
Mississippi State." 
</P>
<P>
None of his business: Dodger scout Jose Pena said the magic word. 
</P>
<P>
Osvaldo Luis Gil Bosch, president of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, wasn't 
about to let it go. 
</P>
<P>
During a baseball game at the Central American and Caribbean Games in 
Monterrey, Mexico Thursday night, Pena asked Gil for information about Puerto 
Rican players. 
</P>
<P>
When Gil told him he had no information, Pena persisted. 
</P>
<P>
Said the 58-year-old Gil: "The man . . . directed extremely offensive words at 
me and my mother and I punched him on the chin. Then I gave him more punches 
while he was on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Add punch-out: According to AP, Pena suffered only bruises, but Gil broke bones 
in both hands. 
</P>
<P>
Alonso Perez, president of the Mexican Federation of Amateur Baseball, said: 
"(Gil) has been in baseball 20 years and maybe he got bothered because they 
have always stolen his players and taken them to the professional leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Beavers damned: The spotted owl isn't the only endangered species in Oregon's 
Willamette Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The recent firing of Oregon State football coach Dave Kragthorpe ended the 
third reign of misery during the past 15 years. From 1976-79, Craig Fertig 
guided the Beavers to a 9-35-1 record. From 1980-84, Joe Avezzano's teams were 
6-47-2. And Kragthorpe's six-year record at Corvallis was 17-48-2. 
</P>
<P>
That's a combined record of 32-130-5, or 2.13 victories per season. 
</P>
<P>
Second opinion: Oslo University medical student Alf Thorvald Tysvaer, in his 
recently published doctoral thesis, wrote that "heading" balls had caused minor 
brain damage in 30% of the 43 retired Norwegian national soccer team members he 
interviewed, and that 3% of the 69 active Norwegian division players he studied 
also showed symptoms of brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
But Willy Simonssen, assistant head of Norway's Soccer Federation, said: "I 
have not noticed it in my meetings with players." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bob Friend, who was 22-14 in 1958.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
It's official now. Los Angeles has another quarterback controversy. The Raiders 
have lost four of their last six -- and confidence in Jay Schroeder. . . . Here 
is a team clearly in need of a lift and Steve Beuerlein might be able to supply 
it if Al Davis ever decides to bury the hatchet and dress Beuerlein in silver 
and black instead of civilian clothes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vince Evans was a quick fix against Kansas City in the fourth quarter after 
Schroeder went down, but he's 35 and until Sunday had played in just one NFL 
game since 1987. . . . 
</P>
<P>
L.A. fans showed they can be as tasteless as any when some of them cheered 
Schroeder's injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's most consistent weapon was the long snap count. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that San Francisco and the New York Giants are no longer unbeaten, their 
game next Monday night should be marked down to Super Bowl XXIV 1/4 . . . . 
</P>
<P>
When teams play with the passion the Rams showed in Candlestick Park, they can 
do remarkable things. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And so much for the notion that the Rams would be looking past the 49ers to 
Cleveland next week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What has gotten into the Indianapolis Colts and Minnesota Vikings? . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC-Notre Dame had something USC-UCLA lacked -- defense. Maybe that's why, in 
comparison, Saturday's game was boring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans threw 39 passes, but their play calling seemed too conservative. 
Not enough bombs to Gary Wellman or Johnnie Morton and no passes on first or 
second down after they reached the Notre Dame nine-yard line on the opening 
drive that ended in a field goal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The score wasn't the only similarity between the 1990 and 1940 games. Neither 
team had names on the back of its jerseys and both wore black shoes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A close contest is one in which each team has 17 first downs and Notre Dame has 
one more scrimmage play than USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former President Reagan, who conducted the coin flip Saturday, said he was 
neutral and urged the Irish and Trojans to "win one for the Flipper." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nice touch before the start of the second half was Todd Marinovich stopping on 
his way to the bench to shake hands with Rocket Ismail, who was awaiting the 
kickoff. . . . 
</P>
<P>
TV replays indicated that the correct call was made when USC receiver Gary 
Wellman was stopped short of a first down late in the game, but that pass 
interference should have been called against the Trojans on Notre Dame's 
incomplete pass on fourth down from the one in the last quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The most attractive bowl games are Notre Dame-Colorado in the Orange, 
Texas-Miami in the Cotton, Penn State-Florida State in the Blockbuster and 
BYU-Texas A&amp;M in the Holiday. . . .

<P>
Outside Iowa City and Seattle, apathy toward the Rose Bowl is running rampant.

<P>
Oklahoma might live to regret kicking that field goal in the final seconds 
against Nebraska with a 42-10 lead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I hope the Associated Press will be able to find a place in the top 10 now for 
Penn State, which has the longest winning streak in the nation. . . .

Most boring record in college football: The 136 consecutive extra points kicked

For the first time, the Clippers sold out the Sports Arena before the Lakers 
sold out the Forum. Well, at least, Michael Jordan sold out the Arena Friday. .

I'm not sure which was more surprising, the New Jersey Nets' 34-game road 
losing streak or two-game road winning streak. . . .

Pictured on the cover of the Pittsburgh Pirate media guide before the 1990

Latest example of the durability of the biggest little men in sports, jockeys, 
was Gary Stevens winning a race at Hollywood Park Saturday only 10 days after 
suffering a broken elbow in a spill. . . .

Tomas Sandstrom is on a goal-scoring tear, but the deal that sent Bernie 
Nicholls to the New York Rangers for Sandstrom and Tony Granato has helped the 
Kings' defense more than the offense. . . .

Few coaches ever made more of a difference in hockey than Fred Shero. . . . Lou

STRANGE GETS OFF THE ROCKS TO SKIN FIELD;

<P>
There was no way that Curtis Strange was going to take a chance and get injured 
trying to hit a golf ball off some slippery rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Not on November 25th. Not when his game is coming back. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I took off my shoes and socks so my spikes wouldn't slip," Strange 
said. "Besides, I thought it (the hole) was over." 
</P>
<P>
The hole was the par-four, 414-yard 10th hole on the TPC Stadium Course at PGA 
West, the first of a sudden-death playoff in the Skins Game. After hitting his 
drive into the rocks, Strange, barefoot, straddled the boulders and hit a wedge 
125 yards over the water. The ball hit the green, kicked off the mound to the 
right and rolled to six feet from the pin. He made the putt for birdie to tie 
the hole with Nick Faldo and secure his second consecutive Skins title. 
</P>
<P>
"I could give you a 15-minute dissertation on why I hit it the way I did, but 
the truth is I got lucky," Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
Strange's luck and skill held up through four sudden-death playoff holes, when 
he tapped in a two-foot putt to come away with $220,000 and another Skins 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It got a little more intense out there than I thought it would be, but I think 
we all had a good time," said Strange, who won two skins worth $155,000 Sunday. 
He made eight birdies in 22 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, who was blanked Sunday after winning two skins worth $70,000 on 
Saturday, didn't seem to have that good of time until the playoff holes, where 
he made his only two birdies of the day. Fighting flu, he spent most of the day 
in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Fancy lies for the rich and famous," he quipped halfway through the round, as 
he straddled a sidehill lie. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he went the distance in the playoff but came away empty when he hooked 
his approach shot into the water on the fourth hole and took a drop. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets down to two of you, it's either one or the other," Faldo said. 
"It was a long playoff for this event but I didn't think it was intense." 
</P>
<P>
Said Strange: "That's because you didn't finish 53rd on the money list." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman was in the hunt until the first playoff hole, when he and Jack 
Nicklaus missed par and were eliminated. Norman won two skins and $60,000 
Sunday for a total of three skins and $90,000 for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, blanked Saturday, played better on Sunday, but only well enough to 
win one hole worth $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I played better today than yesterday, but that's not saying much," Nicklaus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus won his skin on No. 14, when he two-putted for birdie. His next chance 
came on No. 17, when he had the only chance for birdie. Staring over a 
five-foot putt, he was about ready to hit, then stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an ant on top of the ball, then he climbed underneath," Nicklaus 
said. "I thought he was gone, but then I would get ready to hit and he would be 
back again." 
</P>
<P>
Didn't he just want to kill it? 
</P>
<P>
"He's on the endangered species list in California," Nicklaus said. "If they 
knew he was out there, they wouldn't have built this golf course." 
</P>
<P>
Then he missed the putt. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept thinking that this was the same putt that Arnold (Palmer) missed here," 
Nicklaus said. "I knew the ball would break a quick right. So I kept thinking, 
'Don't knock it through the line.' And that's what I did. You can't putt 
thinking what you're not supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
That made the final hole worth $70,000, leaving only Norman and Strange in 
contention for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
With a tie on No. 18, the foursome began the playoff. Strange drove into the 
rocks, but made his recovery for a birdie to tie Faldo. Nicklaus and Norman 
were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo and Strange headed for No. 18. Each reached the green with a drive and a 
six-iron. Faldo made his putt from eight feet, and Strange matched him from 
four feet. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think Curtis, should we split it up?" Faldo asked. Instead, they 
both parred No. 10 then went back to No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo hooked his second shot into the water and took a drop. He hit his fourth 
shot about 10 feet from the pin. Strange sat on the green about 90 feet away 
from the pin, facing the same putt he had in regulation. He hit to two feet 
from the pin. Faldo sank his putt for bogey. But Strange made his for par and 
$70,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I played well," Strange said. "My goal was to be in on every hole. I 
made some key putts, two in the playoff, and some along the way. I look forward 
to returning next year."

TRAIL BLAZERS NOT JUST HOT, THEY'RE ON FIRE, 117-103

The Portland Trail Blazers, the only unbeaten NBA team, scored 49 points in the 
first quarter Sunday night at Portland and coasted to a 117-103 victory over 
the San Antonio Spurs to run their record to 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
After building a 31-point lead in the first 12 minutes, the Blazers became 
careless. But when the Spurs pulled to within seven in the third quarter, the 
Blazers roared away again. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler was seven of eight and the Trail Blazers were 22 of 25 from the 
field in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs, leaders of the Midwest Division, fell to 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks the Trail Blazers have scored one-sided victories over most of 
the elite teams. Their victories over Detroit, Chicago and New York were 
clinched before the third period was over. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, however, almost lost their first three games. In their 
opener at home, they trailed Houston by 15 points in the third quarter and won 
by a point at the buzzer. The next night they trailed in overtime at 
Sacramento, winning when Jerome Kersey made four free throws in the last seven 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 6 at the Forum, they fell behind the Lakers by six points in overtime. 
They pulled that out by scoring the last eight points, but they also felt the 
wrath of Coach Rick Adelman. He thought they could play better. 
</P>
<P>
How right he was. In their last seven games the Trail Blazers have been 
blazing. They have averaged 137 points and a winning margin of 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman thinks it's too soon to get excited. "We are developing nicely," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 105, Sacramento 92 -- The Kings began this trip East auspiciously, 
beating Washington for their first victory after seven losses and playing 
Philadelphia to a virtual standstill. 
</P>
<P>
In their last two, they couldn't provide a warm-up for Boston or Detroit. In 
this game at Auburn Hills, Mich., the Pistons (10-2) were in total command. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 107, Minnesota 91 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 27 points and 20 rebounds at 
Minneapolis and the Rockets shut down the Timberwolves' top scorer, Tony 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, one of 10 from the field, had only three points. It was the first 
time in 94 games with Minnesota in which Campbell failed to reach double 
figures. DAN HAFNER

Andrew Cassels scored in a wild scramble halfway through the third period at 
Montreal Sunday night and the Canadiens avoided consecutive defeats at home. 
</P>
<P>
Although outplaying the Winnipeg Jets most of the game, the Canadiens, losers 
Saturday night to the Kings, were tied. 
</P>
<P>
But Cassels, a rookie center, picked up a loose puck and shot through a maze of 
bodies past goaltender Bob Essena to give the Canadiens a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens outshot the Jets, 44-26. Stephen Lebeau had two goals and Guy 
Carbonneau had the other for the Canadiens, who had 14 shots in the first 
period and scored on Lebeau's power-play shot. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Jets 14 points behind the Kings in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, New York Islanders 1 -- The Islanders were playing tough 
defense at Philadelphia, holding the Flyers to two shots on goal in the first 
11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a catch. The shots, by Gord Murphy at 1:28 and rookie Mike Ricci 
at 10:40, eluded goaltender Jeff Hackett and the Flyers had a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Flyer goalie Pete Peeters stopped 25 shots and improved to 6-3-1. DAN HAFNER

YARD SCULPTURE BEATS DROUGHT -- AND GROWS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: LOCATED ACROSS FROM VENTURA CITY HALL, THE ECLECTIC ART HAS 
ATTRACTED ADMIRERS WHILE ADDING SOME COLOR TO THE DRIED-OUT GREENERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the city of Ventura enacted a mandatory water conservation ordinance in 
March, residents with big lawns have been looking for ways to cut down on 
irrigation without seeing their yards turn ugly and dry. 
</P>
<P>
Some people have replaced lush green grass with drought-resistant plants. 
Others have opted to cover their yards with gravel. 
</P>
<P>
Musician Walter Stowe, 31, has come up with a more creative -- and inexpensive 
-- solution: He has replaced the greenery in his front yard with an 
eye-catching sculpture garden. 
</P>
<P>
"With the drought and the water cuts, we weren't being able to keep the yard as 
green as we like it, so we decided to make it beautiful in another way," said 
Stowe, who makes a living singing with a local rock band. 
</P>
<P>
The sculpture garden, which was started two months ago, is a work in progress. 
It features an eclectic collection of scrap materials, most of them put 
together by Stowe, his sculptor girlfriend, Elisabeth Montague, and neighbors 
from adjoining apartments who share the yard with Stowe. 
</P>
<P>
Every week, it seems, an object is added to the collection -- sometimes by 
anonymous donors who drop off their contributions late at night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a collective effort," Stowe said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
There's a dead tree branch covered with plaster, with plaster leaves hanging 
from its sides. There's a papier-mache child standing under a papier-mache 
donkey. A worthless television set with a rock on top of it. A chicken wire 
"hill" held up by wooden props, and a door frame at the garden's entrance with 
a yellow croquet ball on top of it. 
</P>
<P>
Located across the street from Ventura City Hall, the sculpture garden has 
attracted its fair share of admirers, Stowe said. "All the time we see cars 
stopping and people taking pictures," he said. "It's been a big success." 
</P>
<P>
One admirer is Community Development Director Everett Millais, whose office 
overlooks Stowe's yard. While the sculpture pieces are not exactly his idea of 
fine art, Millais said the garden is an asset to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy it," he said. "It adds interest to downtown. While they're not my 
favorite pieces of art, they're whimsical and fun." 
</P>
<P>
Stowe, a self-proclaimed public art fanatic, hopes his garden will bring more 
attention to local artists and inspire the city to invest more funds in public 
art. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the biggest beneficiary of this window of opportunity for local artists 
has been Montague, who is responsible for about two-thirds of the objects in 
the yard. "I wasn't showing anywhere," she said, referring to her lack of 
success in convincing art galleries to exhibit her work. "This is the perfect 
way to show." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Stowe is no stranger to using art to make public statements. In 
June, he used trash collected at San Buenaventura State Beach to put together a 
series of odd-looking sculptures along the promenade between the Ventura Pier 
and Surfers Point. 
</P>
<P>
The sculptures -- made from empty cigarette packs, beer and cat food cans, soda 
bottles, broken glass and twisted metal -- did not last long before city 
workers razed them. 
</P>
<P>
But by then, Stowe said, he had accomplished his objective. "The city got the 
point," he said. "If you go to that part of the beach now, it's squeaky clean." 
</P>
<P>
The sculpture garden, Stowe said, isn't trying to make a statement, but he 
hopes that it will promote creative recycling of scrap materials and water 
conservation in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's anything you want it to be," he said. "The yard was getting ugly, 
and we decided to give it some color."

CONFUSION GOES WITH THE TERRITORY FOR 2 WESTLAKES; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY LINES: LOS ANGELES HAS THE 'VILLAGE' AND VENTURA DOESN'T. ONE COUNCILMAN 
SAYS RESIDENTS WANT THE BOUNDARIES TO TUMBLE LIKE THE BERLIN WALL.

Jim Pauley has only to go in his front yard to plant a foot in Thousand Oaks 
and another in Westlake Village. He is used to borrowing sugar from Los Angeles 
County neighbors and milk from those in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
And it's all because his house in Westlake sits on the county line. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sit in Los Angeles County and read something in Ventura," said Pauley, 
60. "If I open a window in Ventura County, I can poke a finger into L.A. Not 
many people can do that." 
</P>
<P>
If Pauley's bi-county reach has become something of a household joke, some of 
his neighbors are sometimes frustrated by the confusing jurisdictional problems 
that plague this community divided between two counties. 
</P>
<P>
For example, students living in the same block often attend different high 
schools. Those who live in Ventura County attend Westlake High School. Only a 
few doors away, other students are bused five miles to Agoura High School in 
Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of this community are served by two separate fire departments, two 
separate sheriff's departments and two different telephone area codes -- 818 
and 805. 
</P>
<P>
When streets crossing the county line need repair, the job requires 
coordination of two municipal public works crews. Even La Venta Drive, the name 
coined as the marriage of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, complicates repair 
work because it was designed by engineers from two counties. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the political lines, most Westlake residents consider themselves 
members of one community. Given the choice, Westlake Village Councilman Ken 
Rufener says area residents would have the political boundary tumble like the 
Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"People would like to have one city here," Rufener said. "I think that if it 
came to a vote that you would form a larger city of Westlake Village." 
</P>
<P>
For most of its 23-year history, Westlake has been a tale of two counties. 
</P>
<P>
On the Los Angeles County side is the incorporated city of Westlake Village, a 
5.4-square-mile area stretching from Decker Canyon Road to the south and 
Lindero Canyon Road to the north. The city counts about 11,400 people as its 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, Westlake is actually a portion of the city of Thousand Oaks. 
It is bordered by Kanan Road and Lake Sherwood. Roughly 22,000 people live in 
this area and consider themselves Westlake residents. 
</P>
<P>
The call for unifying Ventura County's Westlake and Los Angeles County's 
Westlake Village is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
History shows that the city's original developer envisioned building a united 
community out of what was once a cluster of sheep ranches. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Daniel K. Ludwig's American-Hawaiian Steamship Co. began developing 
12,500 acres of ranchland into one of the nation's first instant cities. 
</P>
<P>
Architects of the master-planned city mapped a community of 70,000 people 
stretching from Triunfo Canyon Road in Los Angeles County to what is now Kanan 
Road in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as "The City in the Country," Westlake Village was portrayed in a 1970 
Time magazine article as the centerpiece of Ludwig's $1-billion empire. 
</P>
<P>
The community was designed to appeal to Los Angeles residents who sought escape 
from the big city but wanted to keep their urban amenities. Under Ludwig's 
vision, the city got the nation's first golf course lighted for nighttime play 
and the first man-made lake. 
</P>
<P>
Ludwig's strategy was that the future city lie entirely in one county. And for 
a while, Ventura County political leaders toyed with the thought. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, for instance, a local newspaper quoted an official with the Ventura 
County Local Agency Formation Commission outlining a "logical" exchange of land 
between the two counties so that Westlake Village could be located entirely in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Los Angeles County nor Ventura County would give up any territory. 
Thousand Oaks eventually annexed parts of the Westlake Village community in 
1967 and 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of unification was resurrected four years ago, when a group of 
Westlake Village citizens proposed carving a piece out of Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties and creating a new county that would extend from Calabasas to 
the Conejo Grade, north to Simi Valley and south to the Santa Monica Mountains, 
Westlake Village Councilwoman Berniece Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
But that effort also failed because it would have involved state legislation, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for incorporating on Dec. 11, 1981, was to retain the 
community's upscale image. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were becoming a city, people were afraid that we would lose the name 
Westlake Village on the Ventura side. The name itself helps maintain property 
values," Bennett said. "People did perceive Westlake to be on the snooty side." 
</P>
<P>
In turn, some Thousand Oaks residents considered Westlake Village residents 
snobby, said Larry Horner, the only Thousand Oaks councilman who claims 
Westlake as his home. "There was a lot of jealousy between the two communities. 
They felt people in the Westlake area were snobbish," Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for casting votes, most residents have forgotten that the official line 
exists, said Crosby E. Fentress, 65, a former president of the Westlake Joint 
Board of Homeowners Assns., which represents 45 homeowner groups in both 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The community does indeed think of itself as a monolithic community," he said. 
"There really is no difference between the two sides." 
</P>
<P>
If political boundaries divide the city, the upscale business community works 
in favor of unifying it. 
</P>
<P>
The community's major shopping centers and employers lining Westlake Boulevard 
use Westlake Village in their address and advertisements, despite being in 
Thousand Oaks' city limits. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is the upscale Sedona Restaurant, which uses its Westlake Village 
address to attract locals, said owner and attorney John Hollis, a 14-year 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had used Thousand Oaks, nobody would have known where we were," he said.

<P>
Ventura City Atty. Peter D. Bulens has told the City Council that he found a 
significant number of lawsuits against KNM Development Co., which has proposed 
building a 147-unit development in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
But Bulens said it is not unusual to find litigation against developers. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there are complaints on file in and of itself is not surprising, 
since development, the construction industry and the business of architecture 
almost always engenders litigation," Bulens wrote in his memo to council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was unable to find any significant cases involving KNM or its major 
stockholder, Ernest T. Mansi of Oxnard, that have resulted in a verdict by 
either a jury or a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Bulens said some of the cases have not yet been decided, while others "seem to 
have been dismissed through the settlement process without ever reaching a 
neutral decision maker." 
</P>
<P>
Mansi could not be reached for comment Friday. But earlier he had submitted a 
letter to the city explaining his role in 11 lawsuits and denying any financial 
irresponsibility or negligence in past construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
The council had asked Bulens to look into litigation against KNM after Mayor 
Richard Francis said he planned to drop his support for the affordable housing 
project because of the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
But Bulens said in his memo that he could not give an opinion regarding the 
lawsuits' merit. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is expected to be discussed tonight at the City Council meeting. TINA 
DAUNT

SURFBOARDS SHAPE UP AS A SECOND JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL BRAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a real estate agent sells a house, it is common practice for the agent to 
give a small gift to the buyer. For Dave Wallace, an agent with Don L. Carlton 
Realtors in Ventura, the gift is often one of his hand-crafted surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
Each week Wallace shapes 15 surfboards that are sold in area surf shops. Under 
the brand name Vector Vehicles, the surfboards are popular locally, said Vince 
Felix, a salesman at Waveline Ventura, one of the shops that carries the line 
of boards. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically have two full-time jobs," Wallace said. "I can go in and shape 
surfboards in the morning, be done by 12 p.m. and be in the real estate office 
by 1 p.m. It works out well." 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Ventura resident has been shaping surfboards since 1967. "I 
think the first one I shaped was for my sister, then I shaped one for myself 
and pretty soon I just started shaping boards for all my friends," Wallace 
said. "It took off from there." 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, a Ventura surf shop hired Wallace, then a 16-year-old high school 
student, to make surfboards. He has been crafting boards ever since, about 
10,000 or so to date. His short boards, popular among younger surfers, sell for 
about $300. His long-board designs retail at about $400. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Wallace sold his surfboards from a surf shop he owned in 
Oxnard, but he tired of running a retail store. Five years ago, he decided to 
take up real estate to supplement his income from Vector Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of the two jobs has worked out well for Wallace. For instance, 
he recently received an increase in surfboard orders that partially offsets the 
slump in real-estate sales. More than just a moneymaker, board-making is 
Wallace's passion. 
</P>
<P>
"Real estate is going to be a lot more financially rewarding than shaping surf 
boards is ever going to be, but shaping is therapeutic," he said. JOEL BRAND

2-STORY 'BULLDOG' WATCHES MOVIE SET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood movie companies continue to turn rural Ventura County into their back 
lot, this time by constructing a 24-foot-tall bulldog crouching beside a road 
near Piru. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Pictures has re-created a 1930s eatery -- complete with bulldog 
clenching a barrel pipe in its jaws and a sign that says, "Bulldog Cafe -- 
Eats." 
</P>
<P>
The building at Newhall Ranch is a set for "The Rocketeer," a movie about a 
young aviator. The picture, starring Bill Campbell, is scheduled to be released 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Production designer Jim Bissell said the studio came to Piru because it lacked 
space on its lot. The ranch's vegetation made it a perfect location for the 
set, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bissell said the set re-creates a street scene in the San Fernando Valley 
during the 1930s, and the cafe is a replica of one once located at 1153 W. 
Washington Blvd. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very much in keeping with the kind of nuttiness that was L.A. in the 
'30s," Bissell said. 
</P>
<P>
The recently completed structure is composed of a durable foam material formed 
over chicken wire and plywood. KATHLEEN WILLIAMS

POLICE SAY ANGER AT VANDALISM LED TO SHOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: THE SUSPECT, UPSET ABOUT REPEATED ATTACKS ON HIS PROPERTY, ALLEGEDLY 
KILLED A BOY, 17, RIDING BY IN A PICKUP TRUCK. 
</P>

<P>
For months, Angel Orona Rodriguez Sr. tolerated rocks and bottles being thrown 
at his Geronimo Drive house by gang members, Oxnard police and neighbors say. 
On Saturday, police said, his anger erupted into a fatal fury. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez is accused of killing a 17-year-old boy in apparent retaliation for 
the unrelenting attacks on his home provoked by his son's gang affiliation, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Sgt. Denny Phillips said Sunday that a flurry of beer bottles hurled 
at his house just before midnight Friday prompted Rodriguez to grab his 
.22-caliber rifle and fire upon a passing pickup truck that he thought was 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly think he didn't know he hit anybody, that's the tragedy of the 
whole thing," Phillips said. "He was the kind of father who stayed up waiting 
for his children to come home." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Louis Rodriguez Jr., unrelated to the suspect, was riding in the back 
of the pickup being driven by his father. He was struck twice in the chest at 
12:01 a.m. Saturday and died half an hour later at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad Tories, who was in the bed of the pickup with the victim, said he heard 
what sounded like three firecrackers, followed by moans from his friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was shot, and I thought he was just playing with me," said Tories, 
18, of Oxnard. "Then he started crying and bent over in pain. I felt the blood 
on his shirt when I hugged him. When he started bleeding from his nose and 
mouth, I knew he was shot bad." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe that Tories, the victim, his father Richard Rodriguez 
Sr. and his uncle Steven Rayas were driving through the Lemonwood neighborhood 
near the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Channel Islands Boulevard 
seeking revenge for an earlier act of vandalism outside the victim's home in 
the Loma Flats neighborhood of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police said Saturday's homicide appeared to have been sparked not only 
by tension between rival gangs in Lemonwood and Loma Flats, but also by a 
broken teen-age romance between the suspect's daughter and a Loma Flats gang 
member. Police said some of the vandalism may have been directed at the 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and witnesses, the chain of events leading to the shooting 
death began shortly after 11 p.m. Friday on East Birch Street, where the victim 
lived with his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Rodriguez Jr., a high school dropout who frequently worked as a deejay, 
was in the back yard when a bottle thrown over the rear fence shattered on his 
arm, cutting his forearm and finger, said Wilma Ruelas, his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
After throwing the bottle, his assailants smashed the windshield and broke the 
antenna on a 1991 white pickup truck owned by the victim's father, Tories said. 
</P>
<P>
The combined affronts led the victim and the three others to set out in the 
white pickup to find the assailants, who were in a red pickup truck, said 
Rayas. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Rodriguez Sr., meanwhile, had endured numerous acts of vandalism on his 
home for months when the latest round occurred late Friday night, said Raul 
Acosta, who shares the house with the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta said unknown gang members slashed four tires and broke a window on his 
1976 Pontiac Ventura, an act Acosta said was directed at the suspect's son, 
Angel Rodriguez Jr., a 19-year-old member of the Lemonwood Chiques. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta said Angel Rodriguez Sr. became particularly upset after hearing that 
someone had hurled a rock at his son in the front yard while young children 
were playing around him. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, occupants of a passing vehicle threw several beer bottles 
at the house next door to the suspect's house. Police said the suspect knew 
upon hearing the shattering glass that the assailants had missed his house and 
would be coming around again. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not know who was responsible for the vandalism at either 
of the houses, but their investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who is being held in Ventura County Jail on $250,000 bail, 
allegedly lay in wait and fired upon the pickup as it passed his house. One 
bullet struck the tailgate, and the other two entered the victim's chest, one 
going first through his arm, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect said he was not aiming at anybody, and by all appearances, he 
wasn't," said Phillips. He said that the shots were fired at such close range 
that Angel Rodriguez Sr. could easily have killed both boys, and that there 
were still bullets left in the gun. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested at his home around 8 a.m. Saturday and surrendered the 
rifle he allegedly used, Phillips said.

COLLEGE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT TO RETIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald P. McArthur, a founder of Thomas Aquinas College near Santa Paula and 
the school's first president, will retire in January after 20 years at the 
college. Thomas E. Dillon, currently dean of the college, has been selected by 
the college's board of governors to replace McArthur as president. 
</P>
<P>
McArthur is a proponent of higher education through the study of the great 
books of Western civilization, such as the writings of Aristotle and Plato in 
the field of philosophy, St. Thomas Aquinas in theology and Euclid in 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
During McArthur's tenure, the school has grown from 33 students in 1971 to 196 
students. 
</P>
<P>
McArthur said the college is "growing and developing apace, and by keeping true 
to its best instincts, it will continue to fulfill its purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon, who holds a doctoral degree in philosophy from the University of Notre 
Dame, said he would "maintain the college as the unique and excellent 
institution of Catholic liberal learning that it is." GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

3 LAWMAKERS CALLED POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS TO WILSON IN SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reps. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) and David 
Dreier (R-La Verne) -- whose congressional districts converge in the high 
desert of the Antelope Valley -- have suddenly found themselves sharing heady 
political turf as well. 
</P>
<P>
Each has appeared on various pundits' lists of potential candidates for the 
U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Gov.-elect Pete Wilson, who will appoint his 
successor. The Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post and 
the Christian Science Monitor, among others, have speculated on the trio's 
possible upward mobility since the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, apparently not wanting to appear to be campaigning for the 
appointment, have been as tight-lipped about the matter as Wilson. Each, 
however, is believed to be interested. 
</P>
<P>
Among the assets that Thomas, Lewis and Dreier share are home bases in 
vote-rich Southern California, a working knowledge of Congress and track 
records as proven campaigners. At the same time, all have shortcomings that 
could eliminate them from serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"All three have a common weakness," said Allan Hoffenblum, a California 
Republican political consultant. "They're certainly not household names, and 
they all happen to be white Anglo males. Some people think Pete might be more 
bold." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenblum is among a number of GOP activists who maintain that Wilson should 
seek to broaden the party's appeal by appointing a woman or minority successor. 
State Sen. Rebecca Q. Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills), a Wilson friend, and Gaddi 
Vasquez, a popular Orange County supervisor, each would fit such a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Carla A. Hills, President Bush's trade representative, has also been mentioned 
prominently, but she intends to remain in her present post, spokesman Timothy 
O'Leary said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and activists agree that no big-name Republican looms as an obvious 
selection. This reflects, in part, a dearth of statewide GOP officeholders, the 
party's longtime minority status in the state Legislature and its numerical 
disadvantage in California's congressional delegation, in which Democrats hold 
27 of 45 seats. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, the prospective senator must be able to raise huge sums of 
money and wage an effective, television-saturated statewide campaign. The 
appointee will have to run in 1992 to complete Wilson's term and, if 
successful, seek reelection two years later for a full six-year term. Each 
campaign is expected to cost as much as $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wilson has said he intends to appoint someone who concurs with his 
views, particularly his support for some abortion rights, capital punishment 
and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
The explosive abortion issue alone could disqualify Dreier and Lewis. Each has 
a consistently anti-abortion record. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, like Wilson, maintains that government should not outlaw abortion. Both 
lawmakers have supported public funding of abortions only in cases of rape or 
incest or when the mother's life is in danger. In addition, Wilson has said he 
would support federal payments for abortions if there were no other source of 
funding for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a problem that Pete Wilson faces, which is that the vast majority of 
elected Republicans in the state are anti-choice," said Robin Schneider, 
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League for Southern 
California. "That does dwindle his prospects if he wants to appoint someone who 
is pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a longtime Wilson associate who is serving on the 
governor-elect's transition team said the pragmatic Lewis, 56, has a certain 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete likes Jerry," said the Wilson adviser, who offered his assessment of the 
three Southern California lawmakers' chances on condition that he not be 
identified. "They've cooperated with each other over the years. They are 
simpatico. And Jerry can raise money." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the adviser said he wondered whether Lewis has "the staying 
power to do two back-to-back, $20-million campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Lewis must first overcome an expected -- and potentially bruising 
-- challenge next month as House Republican Conference chairman, the 
third-ranking leadership post. The six-term lawmaker, whose 35th District 
includes half of Palmdale, is under fire from the GOP's right-wing for 
supporting Bush's original deficit-reduction package, which Congress rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 48, is a bright, outspoken 12-year veteran who has been deeply immersed 
in such tactical political issues as redistricting, campaign finance reform, 
and California Republican Party appointments and platforms. In the process, he 
has antagonized conservative Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La 
Habra); Johnson's predecessor, Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), and Reps. 
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
"He has made more than his share of serious opponents and enemies," the Wilson 
associate said of Thomas. "He's way too involved in the minutiae of the 
Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, whose 20th District includes Lancaster, points out that he has often 
been allied with Wilson in internecine struggles. They have included opposing 
conservative efforts to drum a gay GOP group out of the party and to adopt an 
anti-abortion plank in the state platform. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Wilson and I tend to see the world the same way on issues, and we've 
always wound up in the same position," particularly on the question of "whether 
the party will be open to everyone," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier, 38, a five-term lawmaker whose 33rd District includes Littlerock, 
Pearblossom and a sliver of Palmdale, has demonstrated an ability to win tough 
races as well as raise large sums of money. He defeated Democratic Rep. Jim 
Lloyd in his second try in 1980 and then, after reapportionment, defeated 
Republican Rep. Wayne Grisham in a primary two years later. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier is often cited for his fund-raising acumen. He had garnered $515,997 
during the present two-year legislative cycle and had stockpiled $1.6 million 
as of Oct. 17. Thomas, meanwhile, has raised $374,322 since Jan. 1, 1989, and 
has $222,291 on hand; Lewis has raised $418,946 and has $340,090 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the Wilson associate said that even though the senator and Dreier are "good 
friends," Dreier is "much more conservative" than the governor-elect. 
Legislatively, Dreier has waged unsuccessful campaigns to eliminate the Small 
Business Administration, the Export-Import Bank and federal subsidies for 
Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Wilson decides to appoint someone else, Lewis, Thomas or Dreier could 
still seek the seat held by Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, who has announced 
that he will not run for reelection when his term expires in 1992. Both party 
primaries for this open spot are expected to be intensely contested. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Wilson confidante suggested that the governor-elect's successor 
may turn out to be someone who is less well-known than those routinely 
mentioned as contenders. For example, he mentioned Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Palo 
Alto), an articulate moderate who supports abortion rights and has a track 
record for winning election in a competitive district. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the decision, among the most momentous that Wilson faces, is 
certain to be a difficult one. "I'm sure glad Pete has to make that decision 
and not me," state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) said.

In response to Julie Fine of Reseda's letter about the injuries and deaths that 
have occurred since the July start-up of the Blue Line light-rail system, I am 
appalled to learn that anyone as fuzzy-brained as she could have been on a 
panel for transportation solutions. 
</P>
<P>
She mentioned a Canadian rail consultant's projection that during the first 
year of operation, a light-rail line would experience no deaths, just injuries, 
and tries to take the consultant to task for what has happened along the 
BlueLine tracks. 
</P>
<P>
What she, and the consultant, fail to take into consideration is that in 
Southern California there have been bred persons so brainless they don't 
realize that a moving train can hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
Don't parents teach their children anymore that there is a reason not to play 
on the train tracks? Or that there is a purpose for fencingoff tracks and 
having signals and crossing arms? 
</P>
<P>
I object to the latest effort to throw money at a problem by allotting $5.1 
million to educate and over-protect an idiot element of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Let them get the message on their own that when one of the crossings is 
indicating an imminent dangerous situation they are to obey, and that a moving 
train is not to be fooled with.

CONFUSION GOES WITH 2 WESTLAKES' TERRITORY; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY LINES: LOS ANGELES HAS THE 'VILLAGE' AND VENTURA DOESN'T. ONE COUNCILMAN 
SAYS RESIDENTS WANT THE BOUNDARIES TO TUMBLE LIKE THE BERLIN WALL.

<P>
Jim Pauley has only to go in his front yard to plant a foot in Thousand Oaks 
and another in Westlake Village. He is used to borrowing sugar from Los Angeles 
County neighbors and milk from those in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
And it's all because his house in Westlake sits on the county line. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sit in Los Angeles County and read something in Ventura," said Pauley, 
60. "If I open a window in Ventura County, I can poke a finger into L. A. Not 
many people can do that." 
</P>
<P>
If Pauley's bi-county reach has become something of a household joke, some of 
his neighbors are sometimes frustrated by the confusing jurisdictional problems 
that plague this community divided between two counties. 
</P>
<P>
For example, students living in the same block often attend different high 
schools. Those who live in Ventura County attend Westlake High School. Only a 
few doors away, other students are bused five miles to Agoura High School in 
Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of this community are served by two separate fire departments, two 
separate sheriff's departments and two different telephone area codes -- 818 
and 805. 
</P>
<P>
When streets crossing the county line need repair, the job requires 
coordination of two municipal public works crews. Even La Venta Drive, the name 
coined as the marriage of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, complicates repair 
work because it was designed by engineers from two counties. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the political lines, most Westlake residents consider themselves 
members of one community. Given the choice, Westlake Village Councilman Ken 
Rufener says area residents would have the political boundary tumble like the 
Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
On the Los Angeles County side is the incorporated city of Westlake Village, a 
5.4-square-mile area stretching from Decker Canyon Road to the south and 
Lindero Canyon Road to the north. The city counts about 11,400 residents. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, Westlake is actually a portion of the city of Thousand Oaks. 
It is bordered by Kanan Road and Lake Sherwood. Roughly 22,000 people live in 
this area and consider themselves Westlake residents. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Daniel K. Ludwig's American-Hawaiian Steamship Co. began developing 
12,500 acres of ranch land into one of the nation's first instant cities. 
</P>
<P>
Architects of the master-planned city mapped a community of 70,000 people 
stretching from Triunfo Canyon Road in Los Angeles County to what is now Kanan 
Road in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Ludwig's strategy was that the future city lie entirely in one county. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Los Angeles County nor Ventura County would give up any territory. 
Thousand Oaks eventually annexed parts of the Westlake Village community. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of unification was resurrected four years ago when a group of 
Westlake Village residents proposed carving a piece out of Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties and creating a new county that would extend from Calabasas to 
the Conejo Grade, north to Simi Valley and south to the Santa Monica Mountains, 
Westlake Village Councilwoman Berniece Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
But that effort also failed because it would have involved state legislation, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for incorporating on Dec. 11, 1981, was to retain the 
community's upscale image. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were becoming a city, people were afraid that we would lose the name 
Westlake Village on the Ventura side. The name itself helps maintain property 
values," Bennett said. "People did perceive Westlake to be on the snooty side." 
</P>
<P>
In turn, some Thousand Oaks residents considered Westlake Village residents 
snobby, said Larry Horner, the only Thousand Oaks councilman who claims 
Westlake as his home. "There was a lot of jealousy between the two communities. 
They felt people in the Westlake area were snobbish," Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for casting votes, most residents have forgotten that the official line 
exists, said Crosby E. Fentress, 65, a former president of the Westlake Joint 
Board of Homeowners Assns., which represents 45 homeowner groups in both 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The community does indeed think of itself as a monolithic community," he said. 
"There really is no difference between the two sides."

PARKING SIGNS FORGOTTEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a long series of very trying efforts, hearings were held to make an area 
of Sherman Oaks and Studio City a preferential parking-by-permit zone. The area 
was to range from Hazeltine Avenue on the west to Longridge Avenue on the east, 
and one block north and south of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The primary reasons were the all-day parkers who worked at various points along 
Ventura Boulevard and the "park and ride" people who would park on a 
residential street, walk to Ventura to catch a bus downtown, and retrieve their 
cars on the way home in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
As they left, the revelers would take their place, using our streets to avoid 
valet parking. They were off to eat, drink and be merry at the establishments 
along the boulevard, leaving their auto alarms on. The neighborhood would 
awaken to screeching sirens and honking horns numerous times nightly, as well 
as loud talking as they dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
We were notified that as of Oct. 1, 1990, signs would be posted, making it a 
two-hour daytime zone, and "No parking except by permit from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
We, the residents, are sitting here six weeks past that deadline, wondering 
what happened. Was it forgotten? 
</P>
<P>
More likely, just another case of an overloaded bureaucracy at City Hall being 
its usual inefficient self.

QUADRIPLEGIC FINDS HIS DESIRE TO WORK MAY BE A HINDRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Berry is a man who wants to work. 
</P>
<P>
In a nation with a deeply imbued work ethic, that should be an admirable 
aspiration. But in Berry's case, it has proved to be a hindrance. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, 40, is a quadriplegic who must use a wheelchair. With the help of Social 
Security Supplemental Security Income benefits, he was able to earn a Ph.D. in 
comparative literature from UCLA in 1986. With his degree in hand, he felt he 
would soon be able to support himself and went off the SSI rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he found his field to have few openings, and he has been looking for a 
full-time job for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Berry's parents were able to supplement the money he earned as an 
occasional consultant for the RAND Corp. to help pay his expenses, which 
include a $200-a-month personal attendant. But Berry's father is now retired 
and no longer able to provide him with financial support. 
</P>
<P>
So in May, Berry applied for SSI benefits again so that he could continue to 
live independently while searching for a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, who was considered disabled while he attended school, is still awaiting 
a final determination on whether he is now disabled according to government 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the consultant work he has performed at RAND may have affected 
his eligibility for SSI benefits. 
</P>
<P>
People who work with disabled people say Berry's dilemma is not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically an all-or-nothing proposition for disabled people who are 
already working," said Douglas Martin, chairman of the National Council on 
Independent Living and a special assistant to UCLA Chancellor Charles Young. 
"If he stops working, he can get on all these programs for the rest of his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
According to Martin, Berry would have been better off if he had never gone off 
SSI. 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of someone such as Berry -- applying for benefits while working 
-- he must reduce his income to $500 per month to qualify for benefits, even if 
his monthly expenses exceed that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security spokesman Virgil Kocher could not comment specifically on 
Berry's case, but he confirmed that the government had a strict definition of 
disability. SSI benefits will be granted to a person only if the disability is 
so severe that the person cannot work. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, someone who receives benefits cannot possess resources or assets 
in excess of $2,000. Any money received from another source is subtracted from 
the standard SSI payment of $630 per month. Half of any income earned from work 
is subtracted from the entitlement. Last year, Berry earned about $650 from 
RAND. This year, he earned $394. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a job at a university or a community college would solve Berry's 
problems. But despite being called for numerous interviews, he has not yet 
received an offer. 
</P>
<P>
Berry is not optimistic that the Social Security system can make a reasonable 
assessment of what he needs to live independently. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that this is indicative of the fact that the Social Security 
Administration doesn't have a realistic view of how people should be allowed to 
work and earn an income and receive help simultaneously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Berry is getting frustrated and fears that his attempts to live on 
his own will ultimately fail.

IRAQ MAY HAVE A-BOMB IN YEAR, CHENEY WARNS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait 
would not solve the Persian Gulf crisis because it is "only a matter of time" 
before Iraq acquires the ability to threaten the world with both nuclear and 
biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that Iraq may be less than a year away from manufacturing a "very 
crude" nuclear device, Cheney said that "aggressive" sanctions will have to be 
maintained against the regime of President Saddam Hussein even after the 
question of Kuwait is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Hussein) were to come into compliance and withdraw from Kuwait, you are 
still going to have to worry about the problem of his acquisition of 
sophisticated weapons," Cheney said in an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to require a far more aggressive set of sanctions than we've seen 
up till now," the secretary added. "That means the sanctions won't go totally 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the new emphasis that the Bush Administration is placing on Iraq's 
attempts to acquire nuclear weapons, Cheney and National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft both suggested in separate interviews Sunday that time may be working 
against the coalition opposing Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear whose side time is on," Cheney said, adding that economic and 
political pressures could begin to affect the anti-Iraqi resolve of financially 
hard-pressed coalition partners such as Egypt, Turkey and the governments of 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody's eager for military action, but neither are they eager 
to have this drawn out over an indefinite period of time," Scowcroft said on 
ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." "There's a common feeling . . . that it 
needs to be brought to an end." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is going to the United Nations later this 
week to seek Security Council approval for a resolution authorizing the use of 
force to compel Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh warned that the resolution would 
be "a very dangerous development that would threaten the entire region," the 
Washington Post reported. Yemen assumes the council's rotating presidency 
Saturday, putting it in a position to use parliamentary maneuvers to stall 
consideration of the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Also this week, hearings on the Administration's gulf policy will be held on 
Capitol Hill, where Democrats have voiced growing concern at what appears to be 
President Bush's increasing impatience with sanctions and his willingness to 
consider using force to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on the same program with Cheney, Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) said he is alarmed by the "attitude of inevitability" that 
appears to be spreading through Washington concerning the possibility of war 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that more time is needed "to determine whether or not the sanctions 
will have their desired effect," Mitchell said that "the best course is to stay 
the course" originally set out by Bush when the United States organized the 
world community behind sanctions after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft, however, argued that Iraq's attempt to acquire nuclear weapons poses 
too great a risk for the world to wait the one or two years that most experts 
say will be required for sanctions to really work. Letting sanctions "run a 
year or two years or whatever raises the possibility that we could face an Iraq 
armed with nuclear weapons, which would dramatically change the character of 
any conflict," Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said intelligence reports indicate that Hussein is working "very hard" 
to become a nuclear power, and that "it's only a matter of time until he 
acquires nuclear weapons and the capability to deliver them." That has to be 
"an element of concern as we decide how to deal with the problem," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts estimate that Iraq is anywhere between two and 10 years away from 
developing a nuclear device. Cheney conceded that experts disagree in their 
estimates of how long it will take Iraq to develop a bomb, but he said 
"worst-case" intelligence assessments indicate that Iraq could be less than a 
year away from developing a "crude" nuclear device. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be anything you could deliver from an airplane. It wouldn't be 
anything that would be weaponized in the sense that we think of a nuclear 
weapon. But it would be capable of doing some damage, of producing some kind of 
a yield," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush first raised the specter of Iraq posing a nuclear threat when he visited 
U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia over Thanksgiving. Since then, 
Administration officials, stung by criticism that they have not been doing a 
very good job of articulating the reasons for the troop buildup or of 
convincing the American public of the need to confront Iraq, have been 
stressing the more ominous threat that Iraq could pose if it is allowed to 
obtain nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, however, noted that the United States has long known of Iraq's 
nuclear weapons program but always looked the other way because of Iraq's value 
as a counterweight to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The majority leader, who in recent days has emerged as one of the leading 
Democrats urging restraint in the crisis, also criticized Bush for meeting with 
Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clearly a mistake . . . a serious misjudgment by the President," 
Mitchell said of the meeting with Assad.

<P>
They hope the results will force the republic, formerly known as Moldavia, to 
compromise on ethnic minority rights and keep the area part of the Soviet 
Union. Leaders of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic have said that, if 
their demands are not met, they will form their own separate republic within 
the Soviet Union. The Moldovan Parliament has declared the separate Dniester

RAMS REVIVE SPIRIT OF '89 DURING DRIVE TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams, those masters of the late collapse, were all set up for yet another 
pratfall from grace. And waiting on the Candlestick Park sideline to pick up 
the pieces and perform his patented last-minute magic stood Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Rams had the ball and a 21-17 lead with 13:08 left in the game, but 
who out there among the rain-soaked 62,633 in the stadium and the millions 
watching on television believed they could win? Who wouldn't be willing to bet 
that this one would end up with San Francisco posting victory No. 11 and the 
Rams face down in the mud? 
</P>
<P>
The Rams swear that they never lost faith, but even tight end Pete Holohan 
acknowledged that "we were just trying to get out of there and get some field 
position and, if nothing else, just give our punter the opportunity to get the 
ball down the field." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, they did more than that. Somehow, they accomplished something that 
almost became part of the game plan last season when the fourth-quarter rally 
was their forte. Somehow -- with a bit of luck, a dash of scheming, and a good 
portion of pride and execution -- they drove 90 yards in 17 time-consuming 
plays for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And, maybe most important, they took 10:37 and whittled the 49ers' chances to 
remain the only unbeaten team in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed that," Coach John Robinson said after the Rams' 28-17 victory, "but 
the most gratifying thing was that fourth-quarter drive. We took an awful lot 
of time off the clock and that pretty much won the football game." 
</P>
<P>
After a third quarter during which the Ram offense managed a net gain of 15 
yards, this drive certainly came out of the blue. And, even after the Rams had 
gone 89 yards, victory was in doubt. On third-and-goal from the one, Cleveland 
Gary did an impromptu Magic Johnson imitation, dribbling and bobbling the ball 
before going into the end zone untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Gary dropped the pitchout from quarterback Jim Everett but the ball bounced 
back into his hands. He couldn't get control right away, but kept running 
toward the hole and finally got control as he crossed the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Gary, who fumbled near the goal line in the fourth quarter during last week's 
24-21 loss to Dallas, was asked what went through his mind when the ball 
slipped from his grasp. "Holy Cow!" he said. "I just wanted to continue to go 
forward. Then nobody touched me and that was the sweet part of it. Yeah, it was 
a bizarre play in a lot of ways." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was a fitting finale to a drive that began with a pitchout to 
Gary. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were penalized five yards for a false start before the drive even 
started and so Gary's two-yard gain put them at their seven-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
As he approached the line of scrimmage on second down, Everett called a 
timeout. "We had a misalignment with some of our young guys," Everett 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
He came back from the sidelines and hooked up with Holohan for 15 yards and a 
first down. "That pass to Pete was a change-up we went to at halftime," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Everett rolled out to the right and passed to Flipper Anderson for another 
15-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
"After we made a couple of plays we started going, 'Yeah, yeah, let's get a 
touchdown and get out of here,' " Holohan said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary picked up a yard on the next play and then Anderson made a catch in a 
crowd that Holohan said was the key play on the drive. Linebacker Bill 
Romanowski drilled Anderson as he made the catch, slamming his helmet into the 
Ram receiver's chest, but Anderson hung on and the Rams had a first down at the 
50-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Gary picked up nine yards on the next two downs before Everett called yet 
another timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to run that play against that defense," Everett said. "It was a 
critical point. I didn't care about the clock, what I cared about was that we 
had the most efficient run or pass against the right defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams went to Gary again and he got the one yard they needed for the fourth 
first down of the drive. A short pass to Pat Carter, a five-yard face-mask 
penalty against the 49ers' Michael Carter and a three-yard run by Buford McGee 
gave the Rams a first down at the San Francisco 28. 
</P>
<P>
Everett went back to Anderson on the right side for a nine-yard gain. After 
that, McGee and Gary took turns pounding away at the heart of the 49er defense. 
McGee had runs of eight and three yards. And Gary had runs of seven, minus-one, 
one and, of course, the big one. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we rediscovered ourselves out there," veteran center Doug Smith said. 
"That's the way we played all the time last year. We had a lot of close games 
and when it came down to the end and we needed the drive, we got the drive 
done. It hadn't happened this year for us, but that's us." 
</P>
<P>
For some of the younger players, Gary said, it was more like a coming of age. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we matured today," he said. "I think the younger guys matured. I know 
I did. We had some unfortunate things happen to us early, but we just had to 
slow it down. We were ahead and I started thinking, 'Slow it down. Drive the 
ball. Run the clock out. Play John Robinson football and if we do that, the 
results will be a foregone conclusion.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hardly, especially if you want to stop-action the final play of the drive with 
the ball on the ground and the 49ers less than a last-minute touchdown from 
victory. But this was the Rams' day and the ball finally bounced their way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only one drive in one game, but for us this season, that drive against a 
team like the 49ers means a lot," Holohan said. "I think it's something we can 
build on in a season when we haven't had much to build on." 
</P>
<P>
Everett agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it's been a damned long time."

VUKOVICH, 27, IS KILLED IN CRASH AT BAKERSFIELD; 
</P>
<P>
MOTOR RACING: THREE-TIME INDY 500 STARTER AND THE ONLY THIRD-GENERATION INDY 
500 DRIVER DIES WHILE WARMING UP CAR BEFORE CRA EVENT.

<P>
Bill Vukovich III, grandson of a two-time winner of the Indianapolis 500 and 
himself the only third-generation Indy 500 driver, was killed Sunday while 
practicing for a California Racing Assn. sprint car race at Mesa Marin Raceway 
in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Vukovich, 27, was warming up the car before time trials when he crashed in the 
third turn of the high-banked half-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared that when he hit the brakes, the car went straight into the wall," 
said Frank Lewis, CRA president. "He hit the wall head on. The car was damaged 
so badly we may never know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Vukovich, who lived in Coarsegold, Calif., near Fresno, was not a regular CRA 
driver, but he had entered the Mesa Marin race because it was a track on which 
he had won several races. 
</P>
<P>
He drove in the last three Indy 500s. In 1988, he finished 14th and was named 
rookie of the year, an honor his father, Bill Jr., won in 1968. Bill Vukovich 
III finished 12th in 1989 and 24th last May. 
</P>
<P>
His grandfather, Bill, won the 1953 and 1954 Indy 500s and was leading in 1955 
when he was killed in a multi-car accident. Last Thursday night at Ascot Park, 
Bill Vukovich III accepted a plaque honoring his grandfather as a new inductee 
in the Midget Racing Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew my grandfather. I was born eight years after he was killed, but I 
am proud to be mentioned with him," he said at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Vukovich Jr. drove in 12 Indianapolis 500s before retiring in 1980. He 
finished second in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Vukovich III won the United States Auto Club supermodified championship 
when he won 12 of 17 races. He had one string of seven consecutive victories to 
equal a longtime USAC record held by A. J. Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
Vukovich began his racing career in 1982 when he was 18, after graduating from 
Yosemite High in Oakhurst. He drove midgets and sprint cars and was named 
rookie of the year in the Valley Midget Racing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad never wanted me to race. Neither did my mom," he said in a 1984 
interview. "My dad told me my chances of going to Indy were a million to one." 
</P>
<P>
Winning the USAC supermodified championship caught the eye of the Gohr racing 
team of Indianapolis, and Vukovich was offered a ride in the 1988 Indy 500 and 
three other Indy car races. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather have seen Billy get into some other line of work, but as long 
as he's here, I'll do whatever I can to help him," his father said in 1988. 
"But every time I see him on the track it gives me goose bumps." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Vukovich Jr. and his wife, Joyce, live in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gordon, who won the USAC midget racing championship with a fourth-place 
finish Saturday night at Imperial Raceway in El Centro, won the CRA race at 
Mesa Marin. Jimmy Sills was second, followed by Rip Williams and Ron Shuman. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first fatality involving a driver at Mesa Marin since the track 
opened in 1977, according to Marion Collins, the track owner. A crewman was 
killed in a pit accident in 1978.

VIKINGS SACK BEARS FOR 41-13 VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: MINNESOTA ALSO CONTROLS THE NFL'S BEST RUSHING ATTACK AND STRENGTHENS ITS 
BID FOR A PLAYOFF SPOT BY DOMINATING IN ITS FOURTH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY.

<P>
The Minnesota Vikings continue to turn their season around. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings won for the fourth consecutive time Sunday by recording seven sacks 
and stifling the NFL's best rushing attack in a 41-13 romp over the Chicago 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings (5-6), who are trying to make the playoffs for the fourth 
consecutive year, have not been beaten since they ended a five-game losing 
streak that began with a 19-16 loss to the Bears (9-2). 
</P>
<P>
"The Bears are the No. 1 team in our division," Viking Coach Jerry Burns said. 
"I've said all along that we've been getting better. I just hope it's not too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears -- who rushed for 215 yards in their first game against the Vikings 
on Sept. 23 and had been averaging 170 rushing yards a game -- were limited to 
107 yards, most of which were gained after Minnesota had the game well in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be tough from here on out," said Bear Coach Mike Ditka, whose team 
will have to wait at least another week to clinch its sixth NFC Central title 
in seven years. "We gave them a lot of confidence, and I'll be surprised if 
they are not in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota looked like the team that led the league in defense in 1988 and 1989. 
The Vikings held Anderson, who entered the game as the NFL's sixth-leading 
rusher with 758 yards, to 48 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I had the ball," said Anderson, "there were quite a few of them 
around me." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Mike Merriweather led the Vikings with 12 tackles, 1 1/2 sacks and a 
fumble return for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody just did their jobs," said Merriweather, who gave the Vikings a 41-3 
third-quarter lead when he stripped the ball from Anderson and ran 33 yards for 
a touchdown. "I don't want to tell on myself, but I was trying to do too much 
last time. This week, it was emphasized that everyone should concentrate on 
their own assignments." 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings also played extremely well on offense, scoring on all six 
first-half possessions en route to their most decisive victory over the Bears 
since winning, 35-7, in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rich Gannon completed 12 of 19 passes for 146 yards and three 
touchdowns. All three scoring plays in the first half came during a streak in 
which Gannon connected on nine consecutive attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Gannon's performance helped him keep the job that he inherited when Wade Wilson 
was injured in the first game against the Bears. Wilson was reactivated Sunday 
but didn't play until 4:12 remained. 
</P>
<P>
"Gannon is our quarterback," said Burns, who had said earlier in the week that 
Wilson didn't deserve to lose his job because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilson: "Rich is playing outstanding and we're winning. He should stay in 
the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Gannon agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm playing well. We're winning," said Gannon, who had no passes 
intercepted for the second consecutive game. "I'm not going to worry about 
Burnsie yanking me. I can't play like that. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can do about a quarterback controversy is go out and play 
well. I'm not going out there against Green Bay next week looking over my 
shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Gannon didn't play well early, completing only one of his first five passes and 
the Vikings settled for field goals by Fuad Reveiz of 41 and 45 yards on their 
first two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
But Gannon got hot and connected on touchdown pass plays of 17 yards to 
Herschel Walker, five yards to Hassan Jones and 22 yards to Anthony Carter. 
Gannon's clutch passing also kept several drives alive as the Vikings surged to 
a 34-3 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who helped key last week's victory over the Seattle, gained 58 yards in 
16 carries and scored on a two-yard run that gave the Vikings a 13-0 
first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Walker also returned three kickoffs for 101 yards, including a 64-yarder on the 
opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
"The opening kickoff return by Herschel set the tone," Wilson said. "It was the 
most complete victory we've had this season and our most dominating in awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's only points in the first half came on a 40-yard field goal by Kevin 
Butler after the Vikings already led, 27-0. The Bears, the NFL's fifth-ranked 
defensive team, did not force a punt until six minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago, which had won six consecutive games, scored its only touchdown on a 
10-yard touchdown pass play from Jim Harbaugh to Mark Green that made it 41-10 
with 2:27 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Harbaugh completed 17 of 26 passes for 157 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the truck hit me, I did not bother getting up," Ditka said of the 
blowout. "I just laid there and watched."

WHAT LEAGUE THAT HAS EVERYTHING NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Football League is a fat, arrogant cash cow that is convinced 
nothing can go wrong -- not unlike Rome before the fall. The NFL certainly 
isn't going to fall any time soon, if ever. But it could stand to stop 
strutting and crowing and take stock. There are more than a few problems inside 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
Outward appearances are all sweet peaches and buttermilk. The demand for 
tickets has never been greater. Television ratings shame those for other 
sports. Cities, such as ours, are down on their knees clamoring for teams. Many 
games are thrilling spectacles. There really is no reason for the league not to 
be fat and arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
When I look at the NFL, though, I see major problems, a product in need of 
overhaul. I root with all my fruit and fiber for an expansion team to land in 
my home town, Baltimore, and bring life to the fall and winter there -- I hear 
one more Mickey Tettleton rumor, and I'm wearing earplugs -- but, at the same 
time, I wonder how long the NFL can ignore its problems without losing fans. 
</P>
<P>
When I look at the NFL, for instance, I see mediocrity running rampant. Only 10 
of 28 teams have winning records right now. That's shameful. Except for the San 
Francisco 49ers, New York Giants and maybe Chicago Bears, everyone is about the 
same -- not too good, decent at best. The Washington Redskins are the Dallas 
Cowboys are the New York Jets are the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rozelle wanted to achieve parity with graded scheduling and the draft, and 
the system has worked except for those couple of teams that rose above it. The 
result is that three-fourths of the games are between average teams hoping only 
to make the playoffs, understanding that they can't reach the Super Bowl. The 
fans don't seem to care right now. But how long will they buy it? 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise, though. When I look at the NFL, I see a league that cares 
little about its fans. A league that cared would not schedule night games that 
routinely run past midnight. A league that cared would not use a schedule that 
has top division rivals playing twice in three weeks in October, draining much 
of the drama from the pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
A league that cared would not take advantage of its customers by rendering its 
regular season meaningless. It didn't used to be that way, but now, as the size 
of the playoff field has increased from eight to 10 to 12 teams this year, you 
can lose half your games and still make the postseason. Games such as Sunday's 
Giants-Philadelphia Eagles are terrific on the tube, but they don't mean much. 
Both will make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
When I look at the NFL, I see loyal fans in many cities being ruined by bad 
management. We know about Bill Bidwill and Bob Irsay. Art Modell is ruining a 
good thing in Cleveland. Vic Kiam doesn't exactly have the New England Patriots 
going for the gold. The Detroit Lions, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Atlanta 
Falcons and the San Diego Chargers change directions every few years without 
getting better. There oughta be a law. 
</P>
<P>
But think about it. When I look at the NFL, I see a league in which, at the 
bottom line, there is no incentive to win. Each team gets 1-28th of the 
television revenue no matter if it goes 16-0 or 0-16. Truly, it is more 
economical for a team not to make the Super Bowl. Saves expenses. You can't 
help but wonder how many owners really care about winning if it doesn't fatten 
their wallets. You can't prove a thing, of course. But you wonder. 
</P>
<P>
When I look at the NFL, I see a league in which players are becoming 
increasingly anonymous. Coaches substitute six and seven players on some downs, 
depending on situations, and the result is you have no idea who is on the field 
much of the time. It is almost impossible to follow a hot matchup. Identity is 
the way to build fans, and the NFL is failing. Substitutions should be limited. 
</P>
<P>
As well, there is legislation against end-zone dances, as if they harmed a fly. 
Why the league would be against this absolutely escapes me, except that 
individuality clearly is out. Uniform regulations are more strict than those in 
the military, and, worse, coaches and owners have been told in harsh terms not 
to criticize referees and each other. In other words: no genuine emotion, 
please. No personal statements. Just canned stuff. 
</P>
<P>
When I look at the NFL, I see a league that needs new blood pumping through it. 
It needs new teams; look at how expansion pumped up the National Basketball 
Association. It needs to go back to some basics, get rid of instant replay, 
in-the-grasp and other rules that break the natural flow of a game. It needs to 
realign along geographical lines, giving fans games they want. There is no 
reason, for instance, why Dallas and Houston don't play twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
When I look at the NFL, I see a league with a great game that needs tinkering, 
a league that can make a profit without trying, a league that is stagnant, slow 
to move, homogenous, mediocre, autocratic. I also see a league I desperately 
want in my backyard. And I wonder why they're arrogant.

<P>
Executives from government-owned Kenya Airways emerged from a secret meeting in 
Johannesburg several months ago with a big prize -- a ground-breaking agreement 
to resume reciprocal flights between Nairobi and Johannesburg by the flagship 
carriers of both countries, after a gap of 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
But on the way home the officials had to stop first in Gaborone, the capital of 
Botswana, to have their passports stamped with a Botswana visa. The reason: It 
is illegal under Kenya law to fly directly to Nairobi from South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
It still is illegal, and that bureaucratic complication well reflects the 
complexities and pitfalls facing South Africa and its black-ruled neighbors as 
they begin to look ahead to new diplomatic and economic relations in a 
post-apartheid era. 
</P>
<P>
The change has already begun. Since he became South Africa's president in 
September, 1989, and began dismantling institutional apartheid, Frederik W. de 
Klerk has received red-carpet treatment on visits to six sub-Saharan African 
countries: Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Madagascar, Senegal and Ivory Coast. 
South Africa has opened new trade offices in Togo and Zaire to supplement those 
it already had in Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling party of Ivory Coast at its annual congress last summer approved 
opening diplomatic relations sometime in the next few months. And Madagascar 
President Didier Ratsiraka, who as a young seaman was barred on racial grounds 
from coming ashore at a South African port in 1962, has agreed to reciprocal 
air flights and liberalized trade links with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
These events all mark an astonishing evolution in the atmosphere prevailing 
until last year.

In the period of black independence, the only African government that 
maintained consistent diplomatic relations with South Africa is Malawi, whose 
autocratic and contrary President H. Kamuzu Banda has always contended that 
despite their political differences with the white regime, African countries 
are better off talking with Pretoria than ignoring it. 
</P>
<P>
That's a viewpoint that may derive from Malawi's vulnerability to the policy 
whims of neighboring South Africa, which financed the construction of a new 
Malawi capital but also caused it losses of $50 million a year when Malawi's 
rail access through Mozambique to Indian Ocean ports was destroyed in a civil 
war between that country's government and South African-backed guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
But if top-level diplomatic relations with most black-ruled countries are still 
far off, already the air seems to be seeping out of the anti-South Africa 
balloon in many places. 
</P>
<P>
In August, for instance, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, a stalwart foe of 
apartheid whose country was home to leaders of the African National Congress 
during their long years of exile from South Africa, lifted a decades-old ban on 
Zambia's using South African ports for imports and exports. At the same time 
Zambia moved to alleviate its critical fuel shortage by importing South African 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of what is now happening in South Africa, we have gained greater 
respectability," says Neil van Heerden, South Africa's director general of 
foreign affairs. The scene is set, he adds, "for us to take up our role as an 
important African country." 
</P>
<P>
There are potential benefits on both sides. South Africa stands to profit from 
supplying goods and services to a market until now closed to it, except 
informally. 
</P>
<P>
Black African countries have less to sell to their southern neighbor, but they 
could gain development aid and technical assistance to replace what may 
disappear as Western donors turn more attention to Eastern Europe. They might 
also gain something that has proven elusive for 30 years -- substantial outside 
investment in their economies, this time from South African businesses looking 
for new investment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
South Africans, for example, are among the bidders for one bank currently up 
for sale in Madagascar. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects of integrating Africa's largest and most powerful economy into a 
region that otherwise accounts for less than 2% of all world trade has many 
businessmen in Africa salivating over the prospects of getting lucrative agency 
licenses to sell South African goods in their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential is enormous," says Edward V. K. Jaycox, the World Bank's 
regional vice president for Africa. "If this part of the world became 
acceptable partners, it would be a real economic event, important on the world 
scale." 
</P>
<P>
A commercial officer in a European embassy here opined, "Any (African) 
businessman worth his salt will look at it as worth his while to get down 
there" to line up distribution and joint-venture deals with South African 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Many African businessmen have already braved travel restrictions and official 
disapproval to visit South Africa. Among them is the head of Kenya Breweries, 
who reportedly returned from his visit wide-eyed at the prospect of importing 
South African brewing technology into his Tusker Beer plants. 
</P>
<P>
With an economy that grows and manufactures many European-grade products, South 
Africa could conceivably replace Europe and America as the chief source of 
industrial and consumer items, according to many businessmen working in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole of this area will stop looking to London and start looking to 
Johannesburg" for imported goods, says one East African businessman. 
</P>
<P>
These include anything from military hardware, necessarily an industrial 
specialty of sanction-beset South Africa, to automobile assembly kits for 
plants in Zimbabwe and Kenya and fruits and vegetables that grow better in 
South Africa's temperate climate than in the tropical zone girdling the rest of 
the continent. South African wines, barred by trade sanctions from European and 
American shops, are world-class. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things that Ivoirians consider indispensable to their lives, like 
scrunchy apples, salad greens that don't grow here and wine, are cheaper coming 
from South Africa than from France," says one diplomat in Abidjan, the capital 
of affluent Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, planning in many countries for post-apartheid relations with South 
Africa has been going on for far longer than their governments admit. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways's preparation for flights to Johannesburg began as long as a year 
ago, sources say. The airline's purchase of three Boeing 757 aircraft, to be 
delivered in January, was predicated partly on its ability to use two of them 
to service the new Johannesburg route. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's Jaycox says that not only the group of so-called front-line 
states in southern Africa, but also the African National Congress and the 
Pan-African Congress, have asked his institution to draw up economic forecasts 
based on a new relationship between black-ruled Africa and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But whether South Africa will be able to export prosperity to its neighbors is 
open to question. Although some analysts suggest that South African 
manufacturers might open satellite plants in neighboring countries to take 
advantage of their cheaper labor, others note that these businesses will be 
under pressure to first raise black South Africa's standard of living by 
creating more jobs at home, not abroad. 
</P>
<P>
So South African industry might view black Africa largely as an untapped market 
for its exports. The net result of increased South African involvement in 
Africa's economy could be harmful competition from its better-equipped and more 
efficient manufacturers and growers. 
</P>
<P>
A major victim could be Zimbabwe, whose once-impressive industrial structure, 
built during its own period of isolated white-minority rule in the 1960s and 
1970s -- is falling apart from old age and the total absence of outside 
investment during its 10 years of black-ruled independence. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing in Zimbabwe will crash," says one businessman with extensive 
experience in Africa, "because they can't compete with the efficiencies down 
south." 
</P>
<P>
For all that, South Africa's apparent interest in reuniting with the rest of 
its continent is based on more than just economics. One of the enduring 
self-images of the Afrikaners of South Africa is that they are a white African 
"tribe," a view that underscores the group's discomfort at being so politically 
isolated. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am an African," De Klerk said last month during his state visit to 
Senegal. "My family fought in the first war in Africa against colonialism (the 
Boer War), and I don't want to go anywhere else in my life." 
</P>
<P>
But the road to genuine political and economic cooperation will be marked by 
large potholes; most business leaders and politicians knowledgeable about 
improving ties choose to speak off the record, for political animosity to the 
South African regime remains potent in black-ruled Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of exploration going on now, but lots of countries are 
constrained because they want their policies and actions to remain in harmony 
with black South Africans," says Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a prominent African 
banker. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone seeking a hint of the pitfalls still confronting South Africa's desire 
to become a regional player needs look no farther than the Kenya-South Africa 
airline agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was announced in Nairobi on Oct. 4, with twice-weekly flights 
set to begin Saturday. Travel agents began booking South African tourists into 
Kenyan lodges, and seats on the first flights from South Africa quickly filled 
up. Then African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela passed through 
Nairobi's airport Oct. 14 in transit. He called an airport press conference to 
blast the Kenyan government for what amounted to prematurely lifting sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven days later, Kenya President Daniel Arap Moi, presumably cognizant that 
the ANC could be ruling South Africa some day soon, unilaterally suspended the 
airline deal until South Africa "dismantles" apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways officials privately acknowledge that they or the government 
should have informed the ANC well in advance of the impending deal, in the 
hopes of defusing any opposition. Business leaders and others in Nairobi now 
regard the affair as a damaging lost opportunity to secure South African 
goodwill and trade concessions. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be good to be first into South Africa," says one leading East African 
businessman. "You certainly don't want to be last." 
</P>
<P>
The Weekly Review, Kenya's most authoritative news publication, estimated the 
potential lost revenue for Kenya Airways at nearly $23 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the sector with the most to lose is tourism. Kenyan travel agents 
estimated that easing travel restrictions could bring as many as 200,000 South 
Africans annually to Kenyan game parks and, even more inviting, its beach 
resorts. That would make South Africa the biggest source of tourists in Kenya 
and increase total visits, which in 1988 came to 680,000 and brought $400 
million into the country, by nearly 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for reinstating the flight agreement are unclear right now -- the 
suspension has still not been publicly acknowledged in Johannesburg -- but 
Kenyan travel professionals say the important thing is to establish the flights 
in time to attract beachgoers during the South African winter, beginning in 
April or May. 
</P>
<P>
Across Africa, open links with South Africa will bring to the surface plenty of 
activity that has been going on quietly for as long as South Africa has been a 
political pariah. 
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa's covert trade with South Africa has always been the 
continent's worst-kept secret. In even the remotest up-country shops in Ivory 
Coast, for instance, it is possible to buy a can of Coca-Cola with the legend 
"Keep South Africa Tidy" embossed on the top. The labels of some consumer goods 
found on the shelves in Zimbabwe supermarkets are written in Afrikaans. 
</P>
<P>
Other ties are more subtle. Every Friday, a new, generally full Zambia Airways 
plane takes off from Johannesburg for Lusaka, Zambia, and then continues to New 
York. Few passengers ever get on or off the flight in Lusaka, and it is 
considered largely a Zambia-assisted subterfuge allowing South Africans to 
evade an American ban on direct flights to the United States from Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 countries in the so-called Southern African Development Coordination 
Conference (SADCC), a band of staunch anti-apartheid South African neighbors, 
only two -- Tanzania and Angola -- officially bar all South African goods. 
About 30% of the SADCC countries' total imports came from South Africa in 1986, 
the latest year for which statistics are available. The share of SADCC exports 
going to South Africa, 7%, exceeds the 4% that represents trade among the 
conference members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
About 32% of all South Africa's manufacture exports go north to black-ruled 
Africa, says Kent Durr, the South African minister of trade and industry, and 
the figure is growing. The South African government contends that of the 51 
member nations of the Organization of African Unity, only one, Libya, has no 
economic link with South Africa whatsoever. But only 13 of those countries 
acknowledge having any ties. 
</P>
<P>
Ivory Coast is perhaps one of the best examples of how a country can maintain 
informal partnerships with South Africa. The country's main airport at Abidjan 
has for years been one of the few permitted refueling stops for South African 
Airways planes on the way to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Ivory Coast might be one of South Africa's most important diplomatic catches 
because President Felix Houphouet-Boigny is considered the doyen of African 
leaders, particularly in the set of former French colonies in West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Houphouet has never been a strict observer of political and economic sanctions 
against the apartheid regime. For instance, South African Foreign Minister 
Roelof F. (Pik) Botha was among the honored guests in September at the 
consecration of Houphouet's massive new Roman Catholic basilica by Pope John 
Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and other political observers believe that Houphouet's opening of 
official ties with South Africa will be a signal to other African leaders that 
it is safe to move ahead on trade and diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Houphouet's done it," says a diplomatic observer in Abidjan, "quite a few 
others will come scurrying in his wake."

GUNMAN FROM EGYPT KILLS 4 IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
A uniformed gunman from Egypt shot and killed three Israeli soldiers and a bus 
driver in far southern Israel on Sunday, the bloodiest incident during a 
weekend of raids on the country's troops and frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were hit while riding in jeeps, and 23 civilian defense workers 
were wounded on the bus whose driver was slain. Eighteen of the wounded were 
released from hospitals shortly after the incident. The attack took place at 
dawn near Eilat, an Israeli resort on the Gulf of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Moshe Arens indirectly blamed Egypt for lax control of the 
frontier. "Israel expects that Egypt will take all the necessary steps to 
retain the peace along its border with Israel and to prevent murderers coming 
from its territory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad, a Muslim extremist group, claimed responsibility for the attack 
in a statement issued in Jordan. In February, the same group, an affiliate of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization, claimed responsibility for killing nine 
Israeli tourists in a machine-gun and grenade attack on a tourist bus inside 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, one of our units operating in Egypt dealt a blow to a Zionist 
bus at the crossing point between Palestine and Egypt," Sunday's Islamic Jihad 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian reports said the gunman was arrested and that Egypt will investigate. 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon later in the day, a teen-age girl carrying a bag of explosives blew 
herself up when she tried to attack a group of Israeli soldiers inside the 
Israeli-controlled buffer zone that hugs Israel's northern frontier. The blast 
killed the girl and inflicted slight injuries on two Israeli soldiers and a 
Lebanese bystander, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's attacks came on the heels of an attempted beach landing in Israel by 
guerrillas from Lebanon. Four guerrillas died Saturday and a fifth swam to 
shore near Sidon in Lebanon after their boat was shot out of the water by an 
Israeli naval patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli military officials were reluctant to link the raids. "There is no 
evidence of coordination at this point," army spokesman Moshe Fogel said. 
</P>
<P>
As is customary after cross-border incidents, the army chief of staff, Gen. Dan 
Shomron, visited the Eilat site after the shooting. His visit took place just a 
few hours before the government announced that he would be replaced in April by 
his deputy, Ehud Barak. Shomron will be completing his fourth year in the top 
army post, a normal term of duty. 
</P>
<P>
For the past several weeks, it had been Israel's frontier with Jordan that had 
produced bloodshed. Several attempts at infiltration were thwarted by Israeli 
troops, the most recent on Nov. 8, when a group of Jordanian militiamen were 
intercepted by Israeli soldiers. One Israeli and one Jordanian were killed 
during the shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials attributed the increase in attacks from Jordan to rising 
Islamic fervor and an impassioned response to the October police killings of 
Palestinians at Jerusalem's Temple Mount. 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, meanwhile, Syria's assertion of control over Beirut and the 
expulsion of Lebanese militias from the capital toward the south have raised 
concern that attacks against Israel from the north will increase. A 
Lebanese-based group called the Syrian National Social Party took 
responsibility for Sunday's suicide attack by the teen-ager. The attempted 
bombing was meant to commemorate the 58th anniversary of the pro-Damascus 
group's founding, according to reports from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's attempted sea attack was also made in commemoration of an 
anniversary -- the third year after a hang-glider attack from Lebanon into 
Israel in which a Palestinian guerrilla killed six Israeli soldiers. The 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, headed by the 
Syrian-backed terrorist Ahmed Jibril, claimed responsibility for the aborted 
sea raid. 
</P>
<P>
The killings near Eilat highlighted the relatively relaxed vigilance along the 
border with Egypt, the only Arab country to have signed a peace treaty with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Along parts of the border, the countries are separated only by easily traversed 
wire fence, in contrast to the heavily patrolled and mined border with Jordan 
and the closely watched frontier with Lebanon. The Lebanon border is protected 
by a militarized buffer zone up to 10 miles wide that is patrolled by the 
Israeli-backed, Christian-led South Lebanon Army. 
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian border is at peace, and we act differently there than we do along 
our other borders," Israeli spokesman Fogel said. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Egypt, the gunman lay down in a ditch beside a road 
six miles northwest of Eilat. When the jeeps and bus, which were heading to a 
military base, passed at different intervals, he rose and fired a Soviet-made 
AK-47 rifle. An alerted Israeli army patrol appeared and began shooting as did 
a passenger from the bus. The gunman fled on foot toward Egypt, 300 yards away. 
He was wounded but escaped, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the gunman was a border guard. Cairo's Middle East News 
Agency reported that an army conscript was arrested in Egypt on suspicion of 
"opening fire on a number of Israeli vehicles carrying Israeli soldiers and 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very regrettable incident, and we are certainly against such kinds of 
acts, and we shall investigate this affair in detail," said Egypt's foreign 
minister, Esmat Abdel Meguid.

MCA BOARD APPROVES KEY TERMS OF BUYOUT; 
</P>
<P>
STUDIO: AGREEMENT ON PURCHASE OF UP TO $6.85 BILLION BY JAPAN'S MATSUSHITA 
ELECTRIC MAY COME TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
MCA Inc.'s board of directors Sunday night approved the key terms of a buyout 
offer from Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. An agreement to purchase the 
Hollywood studio for up to $6.85 billion is expected to be announced as early 
as today. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations in the deal, which would be the largest purchase of an American 
company by a Japanese firm, remained cloaked in secrecy. But sources familiar 
with the talks said MCA's board approved a price acceptable to Matsushita's 
bargaining team. MCA also is said to have accepted an offer mostly in cash, 
rather than in stock. MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman had long sought a stock 
merger to avoid heavy tax payments for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The approval of terms by MCA's board was reached during a marathon meeting that 
began early Sunday morning in New York and ran late into the night. The 
11-member board wasn't presentedwith a tentative agreement, but was apparently 
asked instead to consider specific terms that were still being weighed as 
bargaining continued between the companies. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on their talks. 
</P>
<P>
Osaka-based Matsushita's acquisition of MCA's Universal film and television 
units would put a fourth major film studio in foreign hands. Columbia Pictures, 
MGM/UA Communications Co. and 20th Century Fox are already owned by 
foreign-based corporations. 
</P>
<P>
One person close to MCA put the price at $72 a share, or $6.58 billion. Several 
sources have said the offer would pay MCA shareholders between $70 and $75 for 
each of the company's 91.3 million shares. About $5 of the per-share price 
would be paid in stock of a spinoff company that will own MCA's New York-area 
television station, WWOR-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals familiar with the weeks of difficult bargaining over MCA's sale 
have said that Wasserman, who is 77 years old, initially expected to get 
between $75 and $90 a share, or as much as $8.2 billion for MCA. But Matsushita 
offered less, and it became clear that softening world financial markets 
weren't likely to support a richer offer. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman and MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg would remain in place with 
long-term employment contracts under the agreement. One person said Sheinberg 
would be specifically designated MCA's next chief executive officer, but that 
Wasserman would choose the appointment's timing. Individuals close to Creative 
Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, Matsushita's chief U.S. consultant, have 
consistently said he was unlikely to take any position at MCA, despite 
widespread speculation in Hollywood that Ovitz would use the deal to make 
himself Wasserman's eventual successor. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to the talks said the key issue of management was resolved 
months ago. "Matsushita's goal was the same as MCA's goal -- stability, 
continuity and independence," said a knowledgeable person. 
</P>
<P>
For Wasserman, the transaction would finally end persistent market pressure to 
find a corporate parent or merger partner for MCA, which has discussed possible 
combinations with Sony Corp., Paramount Communications Co., Walt Disney Co., 
RCA Corp. and others over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman, who controls 15.3% of MCA Inc. stock directly and through various 
trusts, is said to have feared that no successor could hold MCA together. He 
also believes that media companies will need vast financial resources to 
survive in the future. 
</P>
<P>
For Matsushita, which has been rebounding from a slowdown in the sales growth 
of its mainstay videocassette recorders, the MCA acquisition would provide a 
prime ticket into the entertainment business. MCA is Hollywood's most 
diversified entertainment company, with interests in film and TV production, 
records, theaters, books, theme parks and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The MCA-Matsushita combination would create a corporate behemoth with 1990 
sales in excess of $51 billion, according to estimates compiled by the Value 
Line investment service. In terms of sales, that's nearly as large as all the 
other major studios and their corporate parents combined, and nearly twice as 
big as Sony Corp. and its Columbia Pictures unit, which will post total 1990 
sales of about $27 billion, according to Value Line. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner Inc., the biggest American-owned studio conglomerate, will have 
1990 sales in the area of $11 billion, according to Value Line, while Walt 
Disney Co. is expected to have sales of about $5.7 billion. Among American 
industrial concerns, only General Motors, Ford, Exxon, International Business 
Machines and General Electric had 1989 sales of more than $50 billion, 
according to figures compiled by Fortune magazine. 
</P>
<P>
People close to the talks said Wasserman went into the board session with some 
reservations, but formed a clear position in favor of the deal during the 
meeting. Another source said the two sides were "wrapping up the final details" 
late Sunday. As talks wound down, tensions reportedly had eased considerably 
from last Wednesday, when the deal nearly collapsed because of a disagreement 
over price. "MCA got premium price for the company and Matsushita got a great 
deal," said one source. "So both sides won." 
</P>
<P>
A longtime student of Japanese culture and managerial techniques, Ovitz had 
helped Sony in its $3.5-billion purchase last year of Columbia Pictures -- the 
biggest previous purchase by a Japanese company of an American firm -- and 
spent more than a year advising Matsushita in its search for a Hollywood 
partner. MCA, meanwhile, had scoured the globe for years, largely under the 
auspices of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. Lazard Freres' partner Felix Rohatyn is on 
MCA's board, and has been a key adviser to Wasserman for years. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz first brought the plan for a Matsushita purchase to MCA last August, and 
word of contact between the companies surfaced in an American press report on 
Sept. 25, after weeks of rumors in Hollywood and on Wall Street of a pending 
marriage between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman, Sheinberg, and Masahiko Hirata -- Matsushita's executive vice 
president and chief negotiator -- met in Los Angeles in early October, then 
began serious negotiations with dinner in New York eight days ago. Hirata's 
advisers included Keiya Toyonaga Sr., a managing director and member of 
Matsushita's board, Ovitz and investment banker Herbert Allen Jr. Wasserman 
relied heavily on Sheinberg, executive vice president Charles (Skip) Paul, and 
attorneys Martin Lipton and Robert S. Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
The talks became severely strained at times, as the two sides positioned over 
price and bickered about press leaks. Discussions were nearly terminated late 
Wednesday night, before last minute changes in bargaining positions allowed 
them to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman's bargaining position was clearly hurt by the severe weakness of MCA 
stock, which traded as low as $34.125 before the acquisition was announced, but 
quickly rose to over $60 a share. The stock dropped $3.125 last Friday to close 
at $65.375, as investors realized that any buyout would be at a price well 
below MCA's original expectations. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest winners in the deal would apparently be David Geffen, the 
music mogul who sold his record company to MCA earlier this year for the 
equivalent of about 10 million MCA shares, then valued at $54.50 each. Geffen 
is likely to show a profit of some $180 million if the sale is completed. 
</P>
<P>
By spinning off WWOR-TV into a separate company, Matsushita can avoid 
government regulations that prohibit foreign companies from owning more than 
20% of a broadcast license. MCA paid $387 million for WWOR-TV in 1986, and 
could almost certainly have found a ready buyer for the station, but wanted to 
avoid the lengthy license transfer process that would accompany a sale. Despite 
a soft TV station market, VHF outlets in major cities become available 
infrequently and are still coveted media properties. 
</P>
<P>
Another MCA holding, Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., was not expected to be part 
of the sale to Matsushita, sources close to the negotiations said. The Curry 
Co. operates tourist facilities at Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
If the purchase price for MCA dropped in the last year, it was partly because 
the company suffered disappointments both in its Florida theme park, which has 
been plagued by severe problems in key attractions, and in its powerhouse TV 
operation.

MCA AND MATSUSHITA

MCA Inc. and Matsushita would combine to form one of the world's largest media 
conglomerates. Here is a look at the two companies:

PRIME MINISTER. A SHOWDOWN VOTE WILL BE HELD DEC. 9.

<P>
An outsider in the Polish presidential sweepstakes jolted the political 
leadership here Sunday by outpolling the prime minister to finish in second 
place and throw the election into a second round Dec. 9, exit polls indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Dark-horse candidate Stanislaw Tyminski, a 42-year-old self-made millionaire 
who left Poland in 1970, living most of that time in Canada, had a projected 
23.2% of the vote. His total was well behind that of Solidarity leader Lech 
Walesa, the favorite in the race, who won 39.3% -- well short of the 50% total 
required to win the office outright in the first round of voting. 
</P>
<P>
In the first free presidential election in 45 years, Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki's total was projected at 19.9% of the vote, a sharp rejection for 
the dogged, gloomy-faced intellectual who has guided the Polish government 
since August, 1989, setting the country on a difficult course of economic 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial projections, announced on Polish television moments after the 
polls closed, were made by the government polling agency working with a German 
polling firm with wide experience in European elections. 
</P>
<P>
The results were quickly read by political operatives as an indication of the 
disenchantment of the electorate, which expects even more economic uncertainty 
in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyminski means for me a no-confidence vote for political parties," said one 
election night analyst on television. "It is a vote for a man who is a 
professional, but not a professional politician." 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski is an enigma in Polish politics. He left Poland nearly 21 years ago 
for Canada and spent nine years in Peru. A businessman who made his fortune in 
computer and electronics equipment, Tyminski recently returned to Warsaw with 
his Peruvian wife and attracted Poles with his promise of quick profits for 
those who work hard despite the depressed economy. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement was general that Walesa would beat Tyminski handily in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a notable lack of jubilation at Walesa headquarters in Gdansk, 
where aides of the fiery Solidarity leader had expected an outright, 
first-round victory despite pre-election samplings suggesting that Tyminski was 
running in second place ahead of Mazowiecki. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people will come to their senses," said one Polish journalist. "In the 
end, Poland is not going to elect someone no one has ever heard of for its 
president." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a crisis of trust, a crisis of authority . . . that is so deep that 
the public is ready to vote for someone who comes from nowhere," said Krzystof 
Krol, a manager for one of the minor parties in the election, whose strongly 
nationalistic candidate won only 2% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski campaigned actively in the election, arguing that his business acumen 
equipped him to tackle the economic problems faced by the country. He brashly 
attacked Mazowiecki as a "traitor" to Poland because of economic policies that, 
he said, were leading the country into chaos and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
He also capitalized on his image as an outsider who was free from past 
entanglements either with the Communists or with Solidarity, whose noisy split 
appeared to have left many voters disenchanted. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa and Mazowiecki, old allies under Solidarity, divided the Solidarity rank 
and file between them, often bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa charged that the Mazowiecki government was moving too slowly to 
privatize the economy and to remove the old Communist holdovers from positions 
in government and industry. He argued that the public had begun to feel, as 
they had under the Communists, a "them-versus-us" division between the people 
and the government. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki countered that Walesa was a "destabilizing" force and that change 
must come carefully. Mazowiecki's backers accused Walesa of acting purely out 
of his ambition to win the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The exit polls Sunday indicated that Tyminski did especially well among voters 
between the ages of 18 and 25, attracting nearly 30% of the votes of that 
sector. Only Walesa, with 32%, did better among the youngest voters. 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski also did well in the countryside and in towns under 10,000 population, 
scoring about 27% of the vote in those areas. He did poorest in the large 
cities -- Warsaw, Gdansk, Krakow and Lodz -- where he drew less than 10% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion drawn by many political observers was that Tyminski did well 
among the least-sophisticated voters in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, whose government's agricultural policy has been under bitter attack 
from farmers, was virtually deserted by voters in the rural areas, carrying 
only 4% there. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, leader of the Solidarity movement that toppled communism last year and 
a national hero, made no election night appearance. An aide, Jacek Merkel, said 
that Walesa "is very serious about the second round of the election and will 
not make any premature comments about his opponent." He said the results of the 
vote point up Walesa's strong standing in Polish politics. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki turned up briefly at his Warsaw headquarters but said he would wait 
for the official results to make a statement. "These first results," he added, 
"are a sign of the sense of crisis in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski, appearing at his headquarters to thank his campaign workers, said he 
hopes to have a chance to debate Walesa before next month's runoff election. "I 
have asked for this before," he said, "but no one was interested." 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, a Polish consular official said Sunday that Walesa drew 60% of 
about 30,000 votes cast by Poles in North America on Saturday. Polish emigres 
were invited to vote in several U.S. and Canadian cities, including Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki got 33% of the North American vote, with the remainder scattered 
among the other candidates.

POT FARMS SHOW DRUG TRAFFICKERS GOING HIGH-TECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was like stumbling onto the master villain's secret hide-out in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
At a solitary ranch house in the high desert 10 days ago, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies and federal drug agents found an incredible sight: thousands 
of marijuana plants lining a huge, high-tech subterranean bunker beneath an 
outdoor basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
The underground farm near Lancaster was one of three in California and two in 
Arizona discovered over the past three weeks that investigators say are linked 
to a multimillion-dollar marijuana production ring, a major and previously 
unknown supplier of marijuana in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
One Drug Enforcement Administration agent called the combined haul from the 
farms "the largest indoor seizure in the history of DEA." 
</P>
<P>
In the latest find, narcotics investigators announced Friday that they had 
discovered a marijuana farm under construction near Barstow that is believed to 
be part of the Antelope Valley and Arizona operations. No drugs were found at 
that farm, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
These cases provide dramatic evidence of a recent geographic and technological 
shift in marijuana production, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
A slowdown in outdoor pot production caused by aggressive law enforcement 
activity and other factors has literally driven many growers underground, 
experts say. Growers are relocating indoors, some of them moving to isolated 
desert areas such as the Antelope Valley, and to the San Gabriel Valley, said 
Capt. Larry Waldie, commander of the Sheriff's Department narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
But adversity has bred prosperity: sophisticated cultivation equipment makes 
indoor growing much more lucrative than outdoor growing, producing a 
top-potency drug and four harvests a year as opposed to one, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, law enforcement agencies have raided 1,923 growing sites 
statewide, 243 of them indoors, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Charles 
Stowell said. Although the indoor raids are just a fraction of the total, 
authorities say they reflect a continuing increase. There were fewer than 100 
indoor busts during roughly the same period just four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We have created this monster called 'the indoor grow,' " said Stowell, 
coordinator of anti-marijuana efforts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve people have been arrested in the Antelope Valley-Arizona case, including 
a Lancaster contractor alleged to have run the tightly organized network with 
corporate efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the investigation, authorities have confiscated 23,000 
marijuana plants worth $77 million. 
</P>
<P>
They estimate the potential yield of the four functioning farms at a staggering 
46 tons a year, all of it destined for the Southern California market, Stowell 
said. He said about 87 tons had been seized so far this year in California. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged ringleaders escaped detection for two years by setting up shop in 
sparsely populated, remote desert areas, the longtime haven for criminal gangs 
that manufacture methamphetamine and PCP in clandestine labs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The farm near Lancaster, which cost about $1 million to build and was capable 
of producing at least $75 million a year in profits, was designed for maximum 
secrecy. It had a surveillance camera, bales of hay positioned to mask the 
aroma of the drug and a thick concrete roof designed to foil infrared 
surveillance devices that detect heat from plant lights. 
</P>
<P>
Until the late 1980s, marijuana farming was largely the province of Northern 
California producers, authorities said. While some growers stayed in Northern 
California, moving their operations indoors, others headed south. 
</P>
<P>
The largest previous indoor seizure took place in June, 1989, when 8,000 plants 
were found at a farm near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Until last week, Southern California was never perceived as a major growing 
area," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley, head of the district 
attorney's Lancaster office. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Lancaster farm owned by 28-year-old Richard F. Yerger, 
investigators raided a smaller, newer farm 20 miles away in the tiny foothill 
community of Llano. The second house was owned by Yerger's father, 60-year-old 
contractor Richard E. Yerger, and appeared built exclusively to conceal the 
underground plantation. The unfinished farm outside Barstow was about 80 miles 
northeast of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Yerger surrendered to authorities along with Frank Gegax, a 
48-year-old contractor described by Cooley as the "brains" and financier of the 
operation. Both are charged with possession, cultivation for sale and 
maintaining a place for production of marijuana. Two alleged "caretakers" are 
also charged with possession and cultivation. All four are to be arraigned 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Yerger said he believes his client is innocent. Neither Gegax, who 
is in federal custody, nor his attorney could be reached for comment. Yerger 
and the other two suspects are being held at the Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are seeking additional suspects, including the elder Yerger. 
</P>
<P>
They are also piecing together a picture of an enterprise one deputy described 
as a "marijuana empire." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Arizona farms, the Lancaster farm operated for at least two years, 
with the younger Yerger acting as front man for Gegax, authorities said. Gegax 
and the Yergers had the means and ability to build the clandestine sites, 
Cooley said, and they selected an area populated chiefly by Joshua trees and 
junk heaps. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost had to have a four-wheel vehicle to get down the dirt road to the 
house" on Avenue E, Capt. Waldie said. 
</P>
<P>
All of the farms involved used water tanks, wells, and diesel generators 
intended to keep down electric bills that could draw suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
Enormous amounts of power were needed for hundreds of grow lights valued at 
$500 each. The Arizona farms used 10,000 kilowatts of electricity a month each, 
compared to 900 per month used by the average home, Stowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Gegax allegedly had separate "managers" who designed and oversaw each 
operation, Stowell said. The Llano and Arizona farms used hydroponic growing 
equipment and a fully automated irrigation system that only required checking 
every couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
"You get the right mixture of chemicals and then you can go out and play golf," 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald Smalstig. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the caretakers at the Avenue E farm had to water plants kept 
in black plastic planters and regulate lighting daily. After harvesting, the 
growers used hooks on the ceiling of the garage-sized building over the bunker 
to hang bales of drying marijuana. The last harvest took place about a month 
before the raid, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The finished product was machine-packaged in one-pound plastic freezer bags and 
placed in cartons. Two people could do the bulk of the work from start to 
finish, Waldie said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are focusing on how the ring distributed to wholesalers around 
the county and on the background of the suspects, who maintained the appearance 
of legitimate businessmen and did not appear to be violent. The alleged 
profiles of Gegax and the others show that criminals of all types -- from 
"Mom-and-Pop outfits to cartels," one agent said -- are involved in marijuana 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"These were smart businessman types as opposed to violent street types," said 
DEA Group Supervisor John Albano. "High-level drug entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances describe Gegax as a well-dressed plumbing contractor with a 
confidence bordering on cockiness. Federal authorities say he had a previous 
brush with the law, an arrest in 1973 in the San Diego area for smuggling 
marijuana by airplane, but they have not yet determined how the case was 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
They said neither Gegax nor the Yergers -- who worked together in the elder 
Yerger's construction business -- were well-known in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Gegax worked with the Yergers, according to authorities and competitors, on a 
240-unit senior citizen housing complex in a Lancaster redevelopment area. A 
$4-million fire destroyed the unfinished complex in November, 1987. Arson 
investigators suspect that the fire was intentionally set, but have made no 
arrests. The investigation may resume as a result of the marijuana bust, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire and ensuing litigation hurt the Yergers financially, according to 
Richard F. Yerger's brother-in-law, Alfred Brand. 
</P>
<P>
"They were essentially shut down," Brand said. "They didn't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
The drug case has generated excitement in the Antelope Valley, where drug 
trafficking is usually associated with scruffy bikers or street gangs from 
"down below," as locals refer to the rest of Los Angeles County. More raids, 
arrests and plot twists are expected. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in town is talking about it," said Lancaster Councilman Arnie Rodio, 
who said he met Gegax once at a political fund-raiser. "They're making a lot of 
jokes about basements." 
</P>

WOMAN SUES SAN DIEGO COUNTY OVER PESTICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marjorie Grisak wonders if a job she took to help the environment was slowly 
poisoning her. 
</P>
<P>
She sold gopher and squirrel poison for the county and thinks that over a year, 
she sniffed so much of the stuff she became ill. 
</P>
<P>
She had excruciating headaches. She was nauseated. She had trouble staying 
awake at her desk. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak contends that while working as a secretary for the Ramona-Julian 
Resource Conservation District she was exposed to poisonous phosphine gas 
emitted by the pesticide she was selling on behalf of the county Department of 
Agriculture. At least three doctors agree. 
</P>
<P>
And at least two other people working in the adjoining county Department of 
Social Services office in Ramona complained that they too were made ill by 
exposure to phosphine gas. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak filed a personal injury lawsuit against the county and filed for 
disability payments with the state Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
County officials publicly insist there is no basis for Grisak's complaint and 
are fighting her in court. Her former employer, the conservation district, 
opposes her disability request. 
</P>
<P>
But county memorandums and other internal reports obtained by The Times show 
some county officials harshly criticized the Department of Agriculture for 
storing the pesticide improperly and for failing to show Grisak how to handle 
it. 
</P>
<P>
County employees who bag the poison wear protective clothing, according to 
county officials. But Grisak, who sometimes handled the spilled substance 
directly, was given no protective clothing, no training and, she said, no 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
The conservation district is a small state-funded agency whose main purpose is 
to offer advice on plantings and soil for farmers and homeowners. Because the 
district used space in the county branch office, it agreed to have its 
secretary sell the Department of Agriculture's bait. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide -- packaged, distributed and sold by the county -- is grain bait 
tainted with zinc phosphide. When triggered by moisture -- typically after it 
is ingested by rodents -- the bait emits enough phosphine gas to kill small 
animals. Grisak sold the pesticide over the counter in five-pound bags. 
</P>
<P>
While proximity to packaged, dry zinc phosphide is not necessarily dangerous, 
inhalation of the dust or of the phosphine gas after the poison is touched with 
water can lead to headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, coughing, diarrhea and 
shortness of breath, according to authorities and technical papers. Too much 
exposure can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Services Department complained in a written report as part of its 
investigation into its own employees becoming sick that "the Department of 
Agriculture improperly stored, for several months, a toxic pesticide. The 
matter was stored in an unvented closet with cement flooring. The secretary 
(Grisak) was not trained or authorized in the handling of this material. The 
cement floor, when even moderately moist, will cause the pesticide to exude 
toxic fumes." 
</P>
<P>
Where the form asks what contributed to the problem, the report says: "The 
apparent or alleged disregard of Department of Agriculture personnel in seeing 
to it that this pesticide was more appropriately stored with properly trained 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Our employees were not aware of this potentially dangerous situation until so 
informed by (Grisak)," the report continued. 
</P>
<P>
Another Department of Social Services memo noted that Grisak "was observed to 
occasionally be drooling and suffering from headaches." 
</P>
<P>
At least two employees in the Social Services Department got time off for their 
illnesses. One of them, Naomi Dummitt -- who no longer works for the county -- 
was diagnosed by her doctor with "exposure to phosphine." 
</P>
<P>
But Grisak's case appears to be the worst. Three doctors examined her and 
agreed that she showed signs of exposure to zinc phosphide, including "severe, 
incapacitating headaches," lethargy, fatigue, nausea and depression, according 
to files on record at the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak, 39, believes she is on the mend -- but worries about chromosomal 
damage, which is addressed in technical literature as a possible result of 
exposure to phosphine. She and her husband, Mike, had been thinking about 
having children, but now those plans are in doubt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She wants disability income from the job she quit 17 months ago, and she wants 
the county to own up to what she said it did to her. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak was hired as the sole staff person for the conservation district in 
February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to office records, Grisak handled more than 400 pounds of the poison, 
which often was delivered in 50-pound bags holding individual five-pound bags. 
She put the poison on the cement floor and inside a small closet just 10 feet 
from her desk. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak said she would sometimes use her hands to pick up fallen bait, pour it 
back into a broken bag and tape it shut. Nobody had warned her not to, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The county stopped distributing the poison through its branch offices about a 
year ago, said Bill Snodgrass, assistant county agricultural commissioner -- 
not because of the Grisak incident, but because requests for it were dwindling 
and the poison is available "through private vendors." 
</P>
<P>
In its formal response to Grisak's lawsuit, the county counsel's office said 
any risk she might have faced was "insignificant." The county's defense added 
that Grisak "acted unreasonably, carelessly and negligently (because she) did 
not exercise ordinary care, caution or prudence for her own safety or 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
Still, various county workers, in their reports to supervisors, acknowledged 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Connelly, a pesticide enforcement officer for the county, wrote that the 
county's "General Services (Department) had some concern about materials on 
floor (due to leaky nature of the building) and hazards resulting from the 
smell of zinc phosphide." 
</P>
<P>
And a supervisor in the Department of Social Services' child protective 
services office wrote in a memo clarifying the request by her two employees for 
workers' compensation: 
</P>
<P>
"At this time I verified that both workers had indeed been exposed to phosphine 
gas. The gas was a byproduct of inappropriate handling/storage by the county 
Department of Agriculture," wrote Betsy Terrazas, the supervisor whose two 
employees work in the same office as Grisak.

An ambitious effort to map the universe 100 times more thoroughly than ever 
before will be announced today by astronomers from a consortium of 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
The project will use a new telescope to be built atop Apache Peak in New 
Mexico. The goal of the 10-year venture is to produce a three-dimensional map 
of 1 million galaxies and other celestial targets that will give scientists 
their best opportunity yet to understand the large-scale structure of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional image of the sky is two dimensional: a flat portrait that does 
not reveal the depth and positioning of stars, which is essential to 
understanding how some galaxies form giant structures. In recent years, for 
example, scientists have discovered collections of stars and galaxies that form 
a wall millions of light years long. Other astronomers have discovered that the 
universe appears to be made up of giant bubbles with stars and galaxies 
surrounding great voids. 
</P>
<P>
Since the universe presumably began with the Big Bang, which should have 
distributed matter uniformly throughout space, scientists are struggling to 
explain why matter eventually evolved into the great structures now being 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The new survey also will include 100,000 quasars, mysterious objects about the 
size of the solar system but that shine more brightly than entire galaxies, and 
numerous gas clouds that could be either the remnants of exploding stars or 
future stars in the process of forming. The result should be a portrait of the 
universe that reveals the interrelationship and true form of various great 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, expected to cost $14 million, "is the cosmic equivalent of a U.S. 
Geological Survey map," said Richard Kron, professor of astronomy and 
astrophysics at the University of Chicago and director of the Yerkes 
Observatory in Wisconsin. "It will show details of galaxy and quasar 
distribution as well as the large scale 'geography' of the universe." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has ever made such an elegant and detailed map of the sky," said Bruce 
Margon, chairman of astronomy at the University of Washington and chairman of 
the Astrophysical Research Consortium, which is sponsoring the project. The 
survey will be conducted by scientists from the University of Chicago, the 
Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the consortium are New Mexico State University, Washington 
State University and the University of Washington. In addition, the Fermi 
National Accelerator Laboratory is expected to provide computers and programs 
that will make it possible for scientists to collect and analyze 10 million 
megabytes of information. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the project is a new, wide-field, 2.5 meter telescope that 
will be operational by 1995. Most modern telescopes use light-sensitive 
computer chips called "charge-coupled devices" that count the photons of light 
hitting the mirror, thus greatly increasing their sensitivity. This new camera 
will have 30 such sensors and will be able to record 120 million points of 
light at one time. 
</P>
<P>
The astronomers hope to complete the survey in about five to seven years after 
the project begins.

U.N.'S BIG FIVE OKS PLAN TO END CAMBODIA'S 12-YEAR CIVIL WAR

<P>
The five permanent members of the U.N Security Council agreed Sunday on the 
final draft of a peace settlement to end 12 years of war in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United 
States adopted a 12-page document that outlines a U.N-sponsored peace plan for 
the country, Western diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, first proposed in January, calls for U.N. administrators and 
peacemakers to virtually run Cambodia during a transitional period leading to 
free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work is over," a Western official close to the talks said before the 
19-hour session ended at 1:15 this morning. In three days of negotiations, 
officials talked for about 40 hours with little sleep or food. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word about the fate of a final communique they wrestled 
to write after reaching agreement on the peace draft. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. plan is to succeed, Cambodia's four warring factions must first 
bury their differences and agree to set up a Supreme National Council, which is 
a cornerstone of the draft settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Exiled Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who flew to Paris last week, 
urged Phnom Penh Premier Hun Sen and his own two allies in a guerrilla 
coalition fighting the government to join him in the French capital as soon as 
possible for an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Full adherence to the plan by the four would allow France and Indonesia to 
convene the 19-nation Paris peace talks on Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris conference, which could be held this year or in early 1991, would be 
asked to give official approval to the U.N. plan. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the five permanent members backed different factions. China has long 
supported the notorious Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla group, and the 
Soviet Union backed Cambodia's pro-Vietnam government. 
</P>
<P>
China last week announced that it was ending military aid to the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union appeared determined to gain a final draft settlement 
in the seventh peace talks held this year, it raised the stickiest points, 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"They apparently had the greatest problems with their allies in bringing them 
to the peace table," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Problems surfaced over a cease-fire and dismantling some of Phnom Penh's 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the contrast between Hun Sen's regular troops and the guerrilla 
forces, the plan provides for a phased process of disarmament and a return of 
people in uniform to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the government, the plan allows the United Nations to directly 
supervise functions of key ministries such as foreign affairs, defense, 
finance, security and information to ensure "a neutral political environment" 
before elections. 
</P>
<P>
No figures on the size or cost of the U.N. role were available. Officials in 
the past have spoken of up to 20,000 people, half civilian, half military, and 
a budget of $3 billion to $5 billion over two years. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources said the document contains: 
</P>
<P>
* A description of a mandate for the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia, 
including a civilian and military component, organization of elections and 
verification of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
* Detailed provisions for a cease-fire and withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
* Election plans. 
</P>
<P>
* Repatriation of Cambodian refugees and displaced people. 
</P>
<P>
* Principles for a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The draft is accompanied by an agreement covering neutrality and sovereignty 
issues and a declaration on rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the key events in the Cambodian conflict: 
</P>
<P>

Cambodian leader by U.S.-backed Lon Nol. 
</P>
<P>
April 17, 1975 -- Khmer Rouge faction seizes Phnom Penh. Khmer Rouge leader Pol 
Pot's revolution results, according to Western governments, in more than one 
million deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 25, 1978 -- Vietnam invades Cambodia, occupies Phnom Penh on Jan. 7, 1979, 
and drives Khmer Rouge to western frontier with Thailand. People's Republic of 
Kampuchea formed under former Khmer Rouge officer Heng Samrin. 
</P>
<P>
June 22, 1982 -- Under pressure from China and other backers, three factions 
form rebel coalition with Sihanouk as president, recognized by U.N. as 
Cambodia's government.

his forces and pursues own peace initiative. He later returns to coalition 
under Chinese pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 2, 1987 -- Premier Hun Sen and Sihanouk hold talks in France, their first 
direct contact.

A new genetic study shows most of the 30 to 50 endangered panthers in the 
Everglades are not purebred Florida panthers at all, but hybrids that may not 
be entitled to protection under the Endangered Species Act. Scientists compared 
the panthers' cells and found two distinct families. One was apparently 
descended from South American pumas set free in the 1950s.

Four storage tanks holding more than 2 million gallons of jet fuel caught fire 
Sunday near Stapleton International Airport, snarling comings and goings at the 
terminal as holiday travelers headed home after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
A fire at a holding pond that had collected some of the spilled fuel was 
extinguished with foam, but authorities feared it might reignite and spread to 
another nearby 2-million-gallon fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters had been trying to cool two 800,000-gallon tanks containing jet 
fuel throughout the day, spraying them with strong jets of water, but they 
caught fire about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt to snuff that part of the fire with foam failed. 
</P>
<P>
Three firefighters were treated at Denver General Hospital for dehydration and 
heat exhaustion and two others were treated for smoke inhalation at the scene, 
but the fire caused no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke from the blaze cast a pall over metropolitan Denver and caused visibility 
problems on nearby Interstate 70, which remained open. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Avery, a Stapleton spokesman, said the airport was open, but United 
Airlines was forced to delay, cancel and divert flights because of a fuel 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines reported flight delays of up to four hours out of Denver, 
affecting connecting flights at other major hubs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There also were traffic jams outside the airport on one of the its busiest 
days, when travelers were returning from the Thanksgiving holiday. Stapleton is 
the nation's fourth-busiest U.S. airport as measured by numbers of passengers 
traveling through it. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 9:30 a.m. at the fuel tank farm about a half-mile 
north of the Stapleton terminal and just south of I-70. 
</P>
<P>
Also threatened were two tanks about 100 yards from the blaze that held 1.5 
million gallons of jet fuel each, said Mike McNeill, a Denver Fire Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The fire torched nearby utility poles and generated so much heat that 
firefighters worked in 30-minute shifts near the flames.

SEVERE STORMS IN WASHINGTON SINK SECTIONS OF FLOATING BRIDGE

Sections of a closed interstate highway bridge across Lake Washington sank 
Sunday after a round of stormy weather, and engineers said the rest could 
collapse at any time. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the 1 1/2-mile-long floating bridge across the lake sank, 
another piece sank about five hours later, and other sections appeared to be 
breaking loose, witnesses said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The four-lane bridge, which parallels the new Interstate 90 bridge that opened 
last year, was being rebuilt to serve as eastbound lanes for the roadway across 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
State transportation engineers and police closed the new seven-lane bridge, 
which carries an average of about 110,000 vehicles a day, out of concern loose 
pieces of the old bridge could damage it. 
</P>
<P>
The new bridge's anchoring cables, which stretch under the old span, were 
damaged by the collapse, a state Transportation Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The old bridge floats on the water like a ship anchored in place and has 
flotation chambers that can be pumped out. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge was not the only casualty of Washington's rough weather. 
</P>
<P>
Record rains, high winds and rampaging floodwaters on major Washington rivers 
chased more than 2,000 people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
One man was feared drowned when he drove past a barricade and into the 
floodwaters of the Snoqualmie River near Duvall, about 15 miles east of 
Seattle, police said. The man's wife and daughter were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
At least 2,125 people were evacuated in six counties, Red Cross and local 
officials said. The Red Cross had 20 emergency shelters in operation, 
spokeswoman Hope Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
"My state is falling apart on me," Gov. Booth Gardner lamented after a 
helicopter tour of the region. Gardner added a dozen counties to five others 
for which he had sought federal disaster aid to recoup from severe floods two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The most severe flooding appeared to be about 40 miles northeast of Seattle, 
east of Monroe in Snohomish County, where some houses were completely under 
water from the Skykomish River. 
</P>
<P>
Water poured through a 150-foot break in a dike at 16-square-mile Fir Island, 
which was about three-quarters under water.

A cold front that swept into Montana brought two huge range fires to a 
smoldering standstill. The fires were the largest of a swarm that swept over an 
estimated 38,000 acres Friday night and Saturday. In Colorado, firefighters 
took advantage of a break in the wind to lay down a fire line around a 
7,000-acre fire that destroyed 10 homes northwest of Boulder.

Soviet grandmasters Gary Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov recorded the sixth 
successive draw in their world title chess match Sunday, remaining tied with 
one win each and 11 draws. 
</P>
<P>
The players, instead of resuming play Sunday, agreed to end their 13th game 
after 42 moves. The game was adjourned Saturday night after 41 moves in five 
hours of play with a draw inevitable, according to the experts. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov, playing white, would have opened Sunday's play with Kxd3. The 42nd 
move, sealed Saturday night in an envelope, was disclosed with the draw 
announcement Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Each draw brings Kasparov closer to his third successful title defense against 
Karpov, whom he dethroned in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov needs only a 12-12 result in the 24-game, three-month contest to 
retain the crown. The match score now stands tied at 6 1/2 points each. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov, who held the title for a decade before being toppled by Kasparov, was 
thwarted by a drawn match in their previous encounter in Seville, Spain, in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The next game is scheduled for today with Kasparov having the advantage of the 
first move. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides are reported to be supremely confident of their chances in the 
match, which has a $3-million purse, with $1.7 million going to the winner.

<P>
Voters cast ballots in the country's first multi-party parliamentary election 
Sunday amid opposition charges of intimidation and fraud by the party that has 
ruled unchallenged for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Early results are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
Reports indicated that turnout was low as President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's 
ruling Democratic Party headed for an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Abidjan, voter turnout was as low as 30%, and reports from 
the interior of the cocoa-growing West African country confirmed the scant 
enthusiasm for the first popularity test for fledgling opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
About 4.4 million people registered to choose 175 lawmakers from among the 490 
candidates representing 19 parties. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats are assured of 40 seats that are unchallenged. They are expected 
to easily win a majority, reinforcing Houphouet-Boigny's huge victory last 
month in the nation's first contested presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
His sole challenger, Popular Front leader Laurent Gbagbo, accused the ruling 
party of rigging that election, in which the 85-year-old Houphouet-Boigny 
received 81.67% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday, about 200 armed soldiers surrounded Gbagbo's constituency of 
Ouragahio, 170 miles northwest of Abidjan. A spokesman for the opposition 
leader said the local government there had announced that people could vote 
without producing identity or voter registration cards. 
</P>
<P>
In the central town of Bouake, Popular Front officials said their 
representatives were refused entry into polling stations to monitor voting. All 
parties fielding candidates are supposed to be able to watch the voting. 
</P>
<P>
The run-up to the elections had been quiet, with the first violence reported 
Saturday in Abidjan's suburb of Yopougon. 
</P>
<P>
Several people remained hospitalized after a clash there between supporters of 
the conservative Democratic Party and the left-leaning Popular Front.

Second-year water polo Coach Steve Heaston knew success, having spent eight 
seasons as an assistant at California, the last two with national champions. 
But when he replaced highly regarded Pete Cutino as head coach last season, he 
saw Cal blow a one-goal lead in the last quarter of the NCAA championship game 
and lose to UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 final against Stanford Sunday night at the Belmont Plaza Pool in 
Long Beach, Heaston said he thought history was going to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
But three saves by part-time goalie Jim Wagner in the final 90 seconds enabled 
Cal to stave off a furious comeback try by Stanford and preserve an 8-7 
victory. Cal won its ninth national title. 
</P>
<P>
"When the fourth quarter started I had a big lump in my throat," Heaston said. 
"(My assistant coach) and I looked at each other and said, 'this can't happen 
again.' " 
</P>
<P>
It might have, without Wagner. Stanford, employing a defense that forced the 
Golden Bears to shoot from outside, had begun to build momentum after Cal took 
a 7-3 lead with 5:36 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Greg Morris scored 1:14 into the final period to cut Cal's lead to 
8-7. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:32 left, Wagner blocked a shot by Stanford's J.T. Matarangas. Eight 
seconds later, Wagner knocked a shot by Colin Keely away from the net, and with 
1:05 to go, he blocked another shot from the hole by Matarangas. Rick McNair of 
Stanford rebounded and fired a shot off the post of the cage. Greg Olson of 
Stanford grabbed the ball, but Wagner knocked it out of his hand and Cal 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's Chris Humbert, voted the tournament's most valuable player said: 
"Overall, the game was sloppy. It was nothing to be proud of, but we got out of 
it with a win and that's all that counts." 
</P>
<P>
The teams committed 17 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Horrible," Heaston said. "We had a couple of big misses -- you know, the 
excitement -- and we got tight. But, maybe after all we have been through, 
maybe a little luck doesn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth victory by Cal (29-1) over Stanford (26-6) this year. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches: 
</P>
<P>
UCLA raced to an 8-3 lead and defeated UC Santa Barbara, 15-8, to take third 
place. The victory was the final for Bruin Coach Bob Horn, who announced his 
retirement Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine's Eric Wood and Steve Long scored four goals apiece to lead the 
Waves over Air Force, 16-13, for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
Navy broke a 5-5 tie with two goals in the final quarter and then held off 
Brown, 7-6, for seventh place.

FIRST PERSON: SHARKS: IN SEARCH OF THE BIG ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Monica.

<P>
I agreed to go shark fishing in the same way people agree to have lunch with 
someone they never expect to see again. Saying "yes" is sometimes an easier and 
consequently more final form of saying "no." 
</P>
<P>
We arrived at the 30-foot California Dawn out of Balboa Harbor at sunrise. 
There were 12 of us, in twos, threes and fours, all in various stages of 
expectation. The camaraderie among fishermen begins with thoughts of the strike 
and the severity of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
We had heard the stories. There were big ones out there: 20 to 25 feet, 800 to 
900 pounds, a six-hour fight only to lose it at the end. These stories were 
repeated at the dock with increasing anticipation. I had been fairly silent 
until that point, my silence I'm sure taken for confidence, before I decided to 
venture a few questions. What if you lose your pole? Who takes out the hook? I 
could establish myself in the group as easily as the others. 
</P>
<P>
Some seafaring preconceptions were dispelled the moment we boarded the boat. 
Lee, the seasoned captain of these dangerous missions, judging from his visage 
and homework, was a history major at an advanced high school. 
</P>
<P>
Jim, his equally young deckhand, could have passed for a choirboy's younger 
brother. Jim's looks were deceiving. It would turn out that he liked to wrestle 
a shark to submission, mano-a-fin, before taking a baseball bat to its head. 
</P>
<P>
The first order of ship's business, for those of us who didn't have our own 
gear, was to outfit the rod and reel. Everything about the equipment appeared 
mean, serious, angry. The rod was thick, maybe 6 feet tall, with the 
flexibility of pipe. The reel was the size of a grapefruit, with 1,000 feet of 
40-pound line. 
</P>
<P>
And the hook was frightening. It was 4 inches of steel, the barb half an inch 
long, with a steel wire leader. We were given two each because sharks have been 
known to strip the hook or bite through the leader. I was relieved to learn 
that most of the fishermen didn't know how to tie the line to the leader, and 
was assured when Jim performed this duty with patience and humor. If there was 
risk in this adventure, at least it would be well-managed and ultimately 
deferred. 
</P>
<P>
As the boat headed out of the harbor, we searched for our sea legs and our 
favorite spots about the boat from which to cast our lines. Mine was where the 
railing was highest -- thigh-high -- to provide the greatest barrier to being 
pulled overboard. 
</P>
<P>
If the Big One could smell fear, I would have the catch of the day. Our 
objective was a bank some 16 miles out to sea. The engine churned through the 
waves. The air had a penetrating briskness. To add to our sense of oneness 
against the elements, a sudden squall brought all, except Jim, into the tiny 
galley. Along one wall were photographs of prized shark catches. Over the 
photos, a .22-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety minutes out to sea, far beyond the distance I knew I could swim if the 
boat were attacked and sank, Jim began sopping chum from a 50-gallon drum into 
the ocean. Chum is a sort of bouillabaisse of fish parts and organic debris 
which is supposed to send flesh-eating sharks into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Jim dumped chum in the boat's wake for a mile before Lee cut the motor and told 
us to cast our lines. We then drifted back along the chum line, waiting for 
whatever terror we had stirred from the deep. That was the procedure. Lay a 
chum line and drift against it. Lay a chum line, drift against it. 
</P>
<P>
"Loll" turned out to be the active verb of the day. And it became a beautiful 
day. The sun shone brightly. The water in the middle of the channel was a 
magnificently clear aquamarine. We sat and talked and lolled, drifting, reeling 
in, laying chum. We laid enough chum to qualify as an oil spill, and drifted 
for half the day before I hooked the first of two sharks caught on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
I was reeling in, thinking of England, when -- as the hook was about to reach 
the water surface -- a six-foot mako came from under the boat and took the 
bait. The reel let out its characteristic whine. Jim instantly appeared and in 
one smooth movement grabbed the rod, saw the shark beneath us, snatched a gaff, 
and hauled the fish on board. 
</P>
<P>
This is what we had waited for, had paid our money for: the catch, the fight of 
a man-eating shark. But not on the boat at ankle level. Chomping at the air 
with long, jagged teeth, the shark's swimming motion enabled it to scurry about 
the deck. In the boat's confines, that meant one direction -- toward us. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been the first case of people jumping into the ocean to escape a 
shark attack. People were scrambling to get to the other side of the boat, and 
I was first among them. Unfortunately, I was still attached to the other end of 
the line. I don't know how many people I entangled with my line and impaled 
with my pole as I squeezed to the front of the crowd. Grace under pressure. 
Wide-eyed apologies between clenched teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Jim grabbed the shark behind its pectoral fins to divert its direction. This 
was part sport for him, part show, and entirely crazy. A false step or reach 
would have meant his hand. But it was the ritual necessary, I think, to supply 
the adrenaline for what was to follow. 
</P>
<P>
If a shark has a psyche, it doesn't include being attacked. The whomp of the 
baseball bat on its head evinced only a look of surprise on the shark's face. 
It took several hits to stun it before Jim could unsheath his knife and 
eviscerate it. I had what I had hoped for: my own man-eating shark, my own 
shark story. 
</P>
<P>
There is a questionable morality about hunting when one's life and livelihood 
don't depend on it. At the point one acknowledges being an omnivore, guidelines 
arise. 
</P>
<P>
We had been advised before we set out that a shark would be killed only if it 
was to be eaten, and only the mako and the Great White were good eating. The 
others would be thrown back. 
</P>
<P>
I was going to eat my catch, however eerie it would be to squeeze lemon on 
something that would just as soon eat me. And these were not baby seals. Even 
eviscerated, the shark continued its motions of attack. (Indeed, skinned and 
filleted, the steaks twitched when touched.) Nonetheless, a pall descended over 
us after witnessing the savage physicality of the shark's subjection. 
</P>
<P>
We quietly set about our business of drifting and casting with a sober respect 
for the enterprise. One other mako was caught that day, its fin snagged as the 
line was being reeled. Two hours later, we headed back to port. 
</P>
<P>
Would I shark fish again? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. It's good sport and decent eating, like halibut with too much oregano. I 
no longer believe I would be pulled overboard if I caught the Big One. Before I 
lost the pole, I would release the drag on the reel. 
</P>
<P>
Would I do anything differently? I'd bring a book, a beach chair and a bat.

HUNGARY: RELUCTANT REFUGE FOR HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
MANY OF THE EAST BLOC'S WANDERING POOR HAVE LANDED IN BUDAPEST. BUT THE NATION 
HAS ITS OWN ECONOMIC VICTIMS. 
</P>

BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a few dollars begged from an old acquaintance and a half-baked plan for 
reaching the West, Ilona Petrescu huddled with her two children on a sooty 
platform of Keleti station to await the late-night train to southern Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Keleti, a catch basin for East European drifters, had been her home off and on 
for months. But spurred on by Budapest's waning hospitality for foreign 
homeless and fear of deportation back to Romania, Petrescu and her family had 
decided to change course. 
</P>
<P>
"My son is ill. He is almost blind," said Petrescu, showing 4-year-old Dan's 
scarred eyes, accidentally splashed with a caustic solution by incompetent 
nurses in their native city of Cluj. "There is a hospital in Switzerland where 
I'm sure they can cure him. We want to go there, but now we can't get through 
Austria because we haven't got 500 schillings (about $50) to cross the border." 
</P>
<P>
Petrescu and her husband, Gheorghe, fled Romania in late summer with Dan and 
6-year-old Ana Maria and a long-nurtured dream of escaping a lifetime of 
poverty and deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was to travel to Switzerland, but the Romanians didn't know they 
needed visas to get beyond Hungary. As a hedge against poverty-stricken asylum 
seekers who have flooded Austrian camps over the past year, Vienna now requires 
Romanian travelers to show they have the wherewithal to move on. 
</P>
<P>
The Petrescus are one of thousands of wandering families bottled up in Hungary 
in hopes of eventually emigrating to what they see as the promised land of the 
West. Now, with their travel plans uncertain, they survive on bread earned by 
begging, sharing grimy blankets with alcoholics and paroled convicts, and 
trying to stay one step ahead of immigration officials who can set their 
westward journey back by weeks. 
</P>
<P>
So many of Eastern Europe's wandering poor have been sheltering at Budapest's 
three main train stations that railroad workers have gone on strike to protest 
the squalor and occasional robbery or assault. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate there are as many as 40,000 homeless living in Hungary, 
the majority of them foreigners fleeing economic chaos in Romania, Bulgaria and 
the Soviet Union. Most are in Budapest, a city of 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But as inflation climbs and jobs disappear, Hungarian victims of capitalist 
revolution are emerging to join them, creating a new class of poor that could 
grow to hundreds of thousands as failing factories are forced to close. In the 
past few months alone, the problem has become much more visible, just as it has 
recently in many American cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bound to get a lot worse before it gets better," predicts Salvation Army 
Maj. Victor Doughty, who this month reopened the Christian charity's Budapest 
services after a 41-year absence dictated by the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Red Cross and the Maltese Aid Society also have shored up their 
volunteer operations, and Budapest's new liberal city government has designated 
aid for the homeless as its No. 1 priority this winter. The national Ministry 
for Health and Welfare has allotted $500,000 to a newly created Crisis 
Resolution Task Force charged with setting up soup kitchens and emergency 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Although those efforts are applauded by humanitarians, they are likely to fall 
short of needs as unemployment rises throughout Eastern Europe, driving more 
residents of the region abroad in search of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Petrescus, many of the wanderers see Hungary as their best immediate 
hope -- a way station of relative prosperity at which they can wait for their 
chance to move on. 
</P>
<P>
But Budapest's emergence as the regional poorhouse has angered many Hungarian 
workers, who fear they have too little wealth to share. 
</P>
<P>
Budapest on the cusp of winter seems an inhospitable refuge, blatantly 
discriminatory toward Gypsies and Romanians and resentful of foreign workers 
posing competition for jobs and homes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, subsidized food, fuel and housing hold out a slim chance of a better 
life than elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and unemployment remains well below 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has proudly touted its open borders, taking a bow for giving passage to 
East German refugees a year ago, which helped lead to the fall of hard-line 
Communist regimes throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But neighboring Czechoslovakia and Austria have invoked new visa restrictions 
in recent months, forcing the migrants to hole up in Hungary to rethink their 
sojourns to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian police have made a few attempts at a crackdown on foreigners living 
illegally in Hungary. But little can be done to get rid of those who have been 
in the country for less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that while we are lifting visa requirements in one 
direction, we may have to impose them in another," says Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky, referring to Hungary's recent decision to let in Americans and West 
Europeans visa-free. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have promised to issue passports to their citizens soon, which 
European countries expect to set off a major wave of what is known as "economic 
migration." 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly have to make a distinction between economic and political 
emigration," Jeszenszky said. "We are not obliged to accept economic refugees." 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian homeless crowding Keleti and other haunts of the indigent are 
predominantly ex-prisoners and longtime jobless whose very existence was denied 
during the Communist era. 
</P>
<P>
"When the former regime was in power, they didn't have this problem because 
they carted them all away," says Doughty of the Salvation Army. "There were no 
vagrants on the street because they put them in prison." 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide amnesty for minor offenders was declared by the new government 
last spring, which has turned thousands of unemployed ex-convicts onto the 
streets along with migrating poor. 
</P>
<P>
"This government made a very big mistake in giving amnesty to so many 
prisoners," says Mary Borsos, a Red Cross volunteer ladling out noodles and a 
pinkish sauce at a soup kitchen on Dobozi Street, near Keleti. "The 
difficulties weren't so noticeable in summer, when they could sleep outside. 
But now they are trying to move in with families and pensioners, and they just 
don't mix." 
</P>
<P>
The Dobozi shelter was euphemistically referred to as a workers' dormitory 
during the 40 years of Communist rule, although the enterprise it was tied to 
long ago ceased to exist. The cell-like rooms are unheated by day, and rain 
dripping from the cracked roof puddles on oilcloth coverlets over the rusting 
iron cots. 
</P>
<P>
Similar slums are being closed elsewhere in the city, as properties belonging 
to defunct factories are sold to investors for conversion to commercial use. 
That has aggravated the problem of homelessness and made those still squatting 
in such shelters fearful of being turned out. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no place else to go," says Ferenc Kovacs, a 56-year-old disabled 
stonemason, noisily scraping the last drops of soupy chowder from a dented 
metal pan in the Dobozi kitchen. He was evicted from his family apartment after 
a divorce 12 years ago, and he has neither a job nor relatives who will take 
him in. 
</P>
<P>
New shelters with heated rooms and clean linens have been opened this fall to 
take in nearly 1,500 transients. But hard-core homeless like Kovacs know they 
wouldn't be able to stay for long. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners trying to evade immigration authorities also are fearful of a 
respite in the warm lodgings, unsure if they will be turned in and sent back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Vagrants have likewise refused to take shelter at a converted army barracks in 
the eastern suburb of Ujpest, where showers are the price of entrance and 
drinking on the premises is forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
The refusals to move to charity quarters has further eroded public sympathy for 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Lajos Novak, a machine-shop worker at Keleti, or "eastern," train station, says 
he is fed up with official hand-wringing over how to deal with the unruly 
indigents. 
</P>
<P>
"They should be working. Most of them are young and strong," Novak says, 
gesturing derisively toward grubby youths slumped over their bundles, making 
pillows out of giant loaves of bread. "The railroad offered some of them jobs 
and space in a workers' dormitory, but they refused to take it. The police 
should come in here and arrest them." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign homeless are seldom offered jobs, as employment bureaucracy built up 
during the socialist era requires a permanent address before a worker can be 
legally hired. 
</P>
<P>
That dims the prospects for families like the Petrescus, driving them from one 
cold refuge to the next, searching for odd jobs and the slimmest of reasons to 
cling to hope of ever reaching the West.

HEALTH: USC RESEARCHER MARIBEL TAUSSIG HELPS IDENTIFY AND TRACK THE DISEASE IN 
THE LATINO COMMUNITY. SHE ALSO CONDUCTS WORKSHOPS FOR CARE-GIVERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ysaura Perez is rearranging the food on her plate, unsure of what to do with 
the peas she scoops onto a fork. Her husband, Mario, tells her to eat, but 
Ysaura, found to have Alzheimer's disease 10 years ago at age 70, doesn't know 
when to stop chewing and swallow. As with every meal, Mario reminds her. 
</P>
<P>
From the Perezes' living room sofa, Maribel Taussig, director of the 
Spanish-Speaking Alzheimer's Disease Research Program at USC, takes in every 
comment, every move made by the couple. With the cooperation of 86 Latino 
families, she has been entrenched in research that many health care experts 
call "groundbreaking" and "a model project for the country." 
</P>
<P>
What Taussig is doing is asking questions. A lot of questions. In Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Her aim is to educate the Latino and medical communities about Alzheimer's -- a 
progressive, degenerative disease that attacks the brain and results in 
impaired memory, thinking and behavior -- among the Spanish-speaking. Unlike 
other illnesses -- heart disease, diabetes, hypertension -- "Alzheimer's in the 
Latino community does not get the kind of attention it deserves," Taussig says. 
</P>
<P>
Because of language and cultural barriers, the disease is sometimes 
misdiagnosed by professionals -- or ignored by family members, she says. Some 
of the families seek out a curandero, or healer, who is not medically trained, 
find inadequate remedies at a botanica, or herbal shop, or make trips to the 
border for "a miracle drug to cure something they know nothing about and which 
should involve a thorough diagnosis." 
</P>
<P>
One of Taussig's first goals was the creation of Spanish-language tests to help 
in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. The tests are designed to gauge memory, 
concentration, attention span, vocabulary, language and reading. 
</P>
<P>
Subjects are asked to copy figures, to remember items pulled out of a bag, to 
name things that begin with a certain letter for one minute and to carry out 
such tasks as folding a sheet of paper in half and placing it on the floor. The 
battery of 10 tests takes from 40 minutes to three hours to complete, depending 
on a patient's level of memory impairment. 
</P>
<P>
Taussig's tests are the first in the country to target the elderly Latino 
population (65 years and older), currently estimated at more than 1 million. 
Sixty percent of that total do not speak English, which explains, she says, why 
many older Latinos shut themselves in at home or don't know where to find help. 
The elderly Latino population is expected to quadruple by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
Taussig, who was born in Spain, became interested in gerontological research 
among the Spanish-speaking after working in the late 1970s as a registered 
nurse in Arizona, where she saw the difficulty elderly Latino patients had in 
communicating their medical needs to an English-speaking staff. 
</P>
<P>
She received a master's degree in nursing from the University of Arizona, and 
later, a doctorate in clinical psychology from the Professional School of 
Psychological Studies in San Diego. She is a state-licensed clinical 
psychologist and USC faculty member. 
</P>
<P>
After completing a post-doctorate fellowship at USC's Alzheimer's Disease 
Research Center in 1987, Taussig began her own Alzheimer's program for Latinos 
with a grant from the National Institute on Aging. Last year Taussig also 
started studying the role of Latino care-givers. She concluded that most 
care-givers know very little about the disease, so she wrote a 123-page 
Spanish-language book on the subject -- also funded by the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Taussig spends several nights a week and many weekends speaking to social 
service agencies and community groups about the plight of older Latinos. She 
has made presentations to such organizations as the Gerontology Society of 
America. Last month she was the featured speaker at an international conference 
on Alzheimer's in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she began conducting workshops citywide for Latino care-givers 
referred by social service agencies, hospitals and a Latino support group for 
families of Alzheimer's patients. And her tests for Latinos who may suffer from 
Alzheimer's are slowly being adopted in various Latino communities nationwide, 
in addition to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, 
based at Duke University Hospital in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
But Taussig believes her work is far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latinos who undergo diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's face yet another 
problem when physicians and health care experts are not Spanish-speaking. 
Often, those health professionals must rely on interpreters. Taussig reports 
that more than half of the patients in her program have been attended by 
non-Spanish-speaking doctors who relied on interpreters. And frequently, 
Taussig says, that interpreter was a family member or an individual "not 
equipped to handle the complexity of the translation" involved in diagnosing 
Alzheimer's. She says inadequate translation can lead to such misdiagnoses as 
depression and arteriosclerosis "when the symptoms clearly are Alzheimer's." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hector Flores, president of the Chicano/Latino Medical Assn. of California, 
which has 500 members, says room for misdiagnosis exists "when a physician 
settles for second best with a translator." 
</P>
<P>
"Even with a family member translating, you don't get accurate and straight 
information. A family member may editorialize and censor. There are cultural 
issues at hand with the way a patient regards health and illness, and unless 
one is tuned into that sensitivity, one will miss important data to make a 
correct diagnosis," Flores says. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for physicians who are linguistically, culturally and 
experientially connected to the Latino community," he says. "As providers we 
need to heighten our awareness of the prevalence and existence of diseases such 
as Alzheimer's so we can detect it early and access the appropriate types of 
treatment needed." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Daniel Dunkelman, president of the 40-year-old California Hispanic-American 
Medical Assn., estimates there are at least 1,000 bilingual physicians 
countywide to serve an estimated 3 million Latinos, the majority of whom do not 
speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem we face is in how to reach the Hispanic community," says 
Dunkelman, an Argentine. He points to Spanish-language TV and radio 
announcements as a possibility and to health fairs at such locations as the 
plaza at Olvera Street, where more than 7,000 Latinos earlier this month were 
checked for high blood pressure, hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes and given 
information on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Alzheimer's is very important, also," he says, "but it has the same type of 
problem as other diseases. Culturally, Hispanics will wait and go to the doctor 
when they are very sick, instead of going at the onset of an illness." 
</P>
<P>
Taussig says her research indicates that Latinos whose illnesses are diagnosed 
as Alzheimer's have had the disease for at least five years before getting 
help, compared to less than three years for Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Chicago-based National Alzheimer's Assn., the disease is the 
fourth leading cause of death among all adults in the United States. An 
estimated 4 million Americans, including 10% of those 65 years and older, are 
afflicted with the disease. Annually, 100,000 lives are lost to Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
"The sooner we know more about Alzheimer's in Latinos -- such as do they get 
the disease earlier or later (than other groups) and do they manifest the 
symptoms in the same manner -- the better off the medical and Hispanic 
communities will be," she says, adding that in medicine, "Everything that is 
done in English should be done in Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
Taussig's work, says Dr. Victor Henderson, the clinical corps director of USC's 
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, "has become a standard across the country 
for Hispanic populations. She is sensitive to the fact that one cannot 
extrapolate from the typical Anglo population to know what the problems would 
be for Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Valle, a national committee member of the National Alzheimer's Assn. who 
teaches social work at San Diego State University, also believes that "the 
professional community is not aware of the time bomb that is ticking away in 
the elderly Hispanic population." 
</P>
<P>
He and others point to Taussig's work -- as well as the efforts of a handful of 
other health care professionals -- in bringing the needs of Latinos to the 
forefront. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Taussig says her work alone is not enough. And often she doesn't know if 
her program will continue because funding depends on the constant grind of 
grant-writing and proposal-making at a time when money for research has become 
increasingly scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"The Alzheimer Latino patient is an invisible patient," Taussig says, adding, 
"That's why I don't give up. When the families come to see me, they are 
desperate. You can see it in their eyes, in their faces." 
</P>
<P>
Mario Perez, 68, recalls too well how difficult it was for him and his wife, 
Ysaura, 80, "to understand how Alzheimer's would affect us." Married for 35 
years, the Perezes -- Mexico natives -- have no children. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember how my wife would forget things, even cooking. I would take her to 
the clinic and she would get medicine, but still she would forget," Mario Perez 
says in Spanish. Finally, after many clinic visits and after waiting "for 
months for my wife to get better" the couple went to a Spanish-speaking doctor. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, Perez, a retired upholsterer, says, "We didn't get much of an 
explanation. We just got some more medicine. We weren't prepared for the future 
of this horrible disease." 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, says he manages as best he can. 
Micaela (Mickey) Virgin, a housekeeper who looks after the couple seven days a 
week from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., keeps their East Los Angeles apartment spotless, 
washes and folds their laundry and prepares breakfast. At lunchtime, food is 
delivered by Meals on Wheels. In the evenings, for dinner, Perez always 
prepares a glass of milk and bread for himself and his wife "because it is the 
easiest thing to fix." 
</P>
<P>
Their days are spent watching Spanish-language TV programs. Once a month, 
Virgin escorts the couple, on foot, to the nearby grocery store where Perez 
buys money orders to pay bills. The Perezes make ends meet on a monthly $1,000 
income from Social Security and supplemental welfare assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Says his wife in a slow stammer: "I am happy. I am lucky. I am comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Still, her husband sometimes sinks into depression. 
</P>
<P>
"I see my wife try to write, but she can't remember her name. When she dresses, 
the pants go on backward and the buttons aren't buttoned right. I need to 
remind her to take a bath, to eat, to use the bathroom. And sometimes she 
becomes aggressive. It's gotten worse." 
</P>
<P>
Taussig agrees that Ysaura's condition has deteriorated. She remembers when 
Ysaura could tell the difference between a fork and a spoon, when her 
enthusiasm for eating was healthier, when her speech wasn't quite as impaired. 
</P>
<P>
She is concerned about what would happen to Ysaura if her husband -- because of 
his own ailment -- were to injure himself. Often, Perez -- who manages with the 
aid of a walker -- falls to the floor when his leg muscles become rigid, an 
effect of Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who no longer drives and, like his wife, is a shut-in most of the time, 
says he doesn't know what would become of Ysaura if something happened to him. 
He says he tries not to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be here alive, together, until our bodies don't want us to." 
</P>

A PLAN TO REACH ETHNIC GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Other ethnic groups face language and cultural barriers in getting information 
and treatment for Alzheimer's disease. But the local chapter of the Alzheimer's 
Assn. is hoping a new ethnic-outreach program will change that. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are suffering because there is so little in terms of reaching 
ethnic groups," says Maria P. Aranda, chairperson of the Los Angeles 
Alzheimer's Assn.'s Multicultural Outreach Advisory Board. The board was 
created this year in an effort to educate ethnic groups about Alzheimer's as 
well as to involve the medical community, Aranda says. Nationally, about 15 of 
the 210 Alzheimer's Assn.'s chapters have begun to focus on reaching ethnic 
groups with information. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only Latinos need information, but also the Asian communities -- Japanese 
and Koreans -- Filipinos as well as Native-Americans and African-Americans. All 
these communities have been asking for leadership and technical assistance in 
Alzheimer's disease," Aranda says. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Aranda, a licensed clinical social worker, formed a 
Spanish-speaking Alzheimer's disease support group called Grupo Siempre Viva, 
which meets monthly. 
</P>
<P>
The support group, with the help of Calmecac Educational Services, a mental 
health organization composed of Los Angeles-area Latino professionals, helped 
produce a 40-page fotonovela, or illustrated booklet, and a 50-minute video 
about a Latino family's struggle with Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
"As a Latina, I know what our community's needs are," says Aranda, a 
psychiatric social worker for the Los Angeles County Department of Mental 
Health. She also is a National Hispanic Council on Aging fellow at USC and 
part-time staffer at the San Antonio Mental Health Center in Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"But what the multicultural outreach board is trying to do is develop a plan of 
action with community leaders and representatives to develop expertise in 
multicultural communities regarding Alzheimer's disease and bring more 
information into the homes of these communities," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She adds that the board also will pay close attention to the issue of 
care-givers: "Families need to come to terms with living with someone who has 
memory impairment and other dementias. They need to hear the information 
several times, not just once, because a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is so 
final that the patient and their families need ongoing counseling." MICHAEL 
QUINTANILLA

TOUGH INDUSTRY: The banking business has been a real eye-opener for Richard 
Stenton, chairman of Laguna Bank in Laguna Beach. Stenton has gone through 
three presidents at his bank and now may sell it. . . . "When I got in this 
industry, I thought everybody paid off their loans," he said. But tough times 
means foreclosures, and, for banks, he said, "there's not a lot of rosy

FARM SCHOOL, AN ALTERNATIVE LEARNING CENTER FOR CHILDREN AT UC IRVINE, 
CULTIVATES THINKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Walking sticks in hand, one group of children set off on a recent morning to 
explore the impact of the previous night's rainfall on the hills behind their 
cottage classrooms. They came back covered by mud and thoroughly knowledgeable 
about erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Another cluster of children got real-life lessons in arithmetic and civic and 
environmental responsibility as they sorted and counted a month's worth of 
bottles, soda cans and cat food tins, then calculated how much money each bag 
would net them at the neighborhood recycling center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two 10-year-olds drafted petitions to send to President Bush 
opposing armed conflict in the Persian Gulf as chickens pecked for food near 
the porch outside. For each signer, the children had a paper cup with a peace 
symbol scrawled at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
It was a typical day at the Farm School, UC Irvine's experimental learning 
center, which for two decades has provided an alternative to public elementary 
schools for the children of faculty and graduate students, the community and 
even top Orange County corporate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Started as a counterculture education laboratory by free-thinking UCI academics 
in 1969, its supporters hail it as "one of the '60s experiments that worked." 
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes individual instruction and the development of critical thinking 
skills and seeks to foster a lifelong joy of learning as well as to develop 
humane, globally conscious citizens. There are no report cards, and students, 
who can attend through the equivalent of sixth grade, are grouped only as 
"Littles," "Bigs" and "Uppers." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trade it for any other school in the world," said Safi Qureshey, an 
Irvine computer company president who pulled his son, Uns, out of a public 
school several years ago when he discovered that rigid classroom rules and 
schedules were frustrating the boy. Both Uns, now 11, and his brother, Zeshan, 
9, are longtime Farm School students. 
</P>
<P>
Situated at the edge of a growing University of California campus, Farm School 
students often get a chance to question top scholars about current issues and 
world events. The school, as its name suggests, also offers opportunities to 
learn firsthand about raising animals, how wild creatures forage for food, and 
how nature's forces work on the rolling coastal hills behind them. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Farm School students have been valuable subjects for university 
students who plan careers in teaching or psychology, with the school serving as 
a laboratory to explore teaching methods. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Farm School, one of the few remaining alternative schools in Orange 
County, remains one of the best kept secrets in Orange County education, mainly 
because it cannot accommodate more than 55 students in the three renovated 
farmhand cottages that once formed the heart of the old Irvine Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the experimental school moves into its third decade, the future of this 
brainchild of Michael Butler, UCI's powerful dean of undergraduate studies, is 
unclear. It has not been included in the university's long-term plan. And there 
is as yet no one on the horizon poised to take over the reins from Butler, who 
has been director for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tuition has gone up to $470 a child -- about mid-range for the Irvine-Newport 
Beach-Fountain Valley area -- mainly to improve pay and benefits for Farm 
School's six teachers, who make far less than their counterparts in Orange 
County public schools. Some scholarships are given. 
</P>
<P>
For Lissa Forehan, a UCI graduate student with two sons at Farm School, and 
Bajis M. Dodin, a professor at UC Riverside's graduate school of management 
with two children at the school, it is a once-in-a-lifetime investment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, but education has always been a real priority," said Forehan, 32, 
who is seeking a doctoral degree in psychology and has a part-time job at the 
university. "I'm willing to do without a lot of material things." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dodin, a Palestinian from Jordan: "I don't look at it from the money point 
of view. . . . It's more important to start on the right foot with a strong 
educational background. That gives them greater momentum later on in life." 
</P>
<P>
It all started with a group of social science professors who were dissatisfied 
with the caliber of students taking their university courses in the late 1960s. 
It's not that the students weren't smart, Butler says. But many of them lacked 
intellectual curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"I was teaching statistics, and some students just naturally engaged in the 
systematic exploration of the mathematics involved," Butler said. "For the 
rest, math simply fell out of the sky. . . . (It) was arbitrary, mysterious, 
incoherent and dull -- a set of recipes someone else discovered." 
</P>
<P>
Butler, anthropology professor Nick Colby and others decided to design an 
alternative program in which "students would learn to be smarter, to think 
better, and to be more humane," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Farm School was launched with four students and a half-time teacher in a 
ramshackle cottage that had once been a farmhand's home on the old Irvine 
Ranch. At first, the students were mainly children of UCI faculty or graduate 
students. "But it was always our intention to be more open, and we were very 
soon," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
A key to the curriculum is class size. For example, there are only about half a 
dozen "Bigs" -- children from about 8 to 10 years of age. (Farm School 
instructors are careful not to knock public schools or their teachers, who have 
the daunting task of educating 30 or more children in a classroom.) 
</P>
<P>
Within the groupings, children work individually or in pairs with teachers in 
math, reading, science, geography, art and other traditional subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The way these subjects are taught is hardly traditional. There is no math text, 
only a set of instructions and suggested exercises to get across fundamental 
concepts with blocks, coins, compasses -- virtually any tactile learning tool. 
Children learn at their own pace, and by the time they are "Uppers" -- ages 11 
to 12 -- the pace is pretty fast. 
</P>
<P>
But children who aren't ready to learn are not pushed. In the end, the desire 
to learn like their friends and classmates seems to win out. 
</P>
<P>
"My younger son is very intelligent but he wants to do his own thing," Qureshey 
said. "For a long time, he would not learn his alphabet. Then he needed to get 
some information for a class project. He asked his friend who could read. . . . 
The friend said 'in books.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like a switch that was turned on. He decided to learn the alphabet 
so he could learn how to read. . . . If it was a conventional school, he would 
have been punished." 
</P>
<P>
A key measure of mastery in a subject is if a child can teach it to other 
children. That, in turn, fosters friendships and loyalties that go beyond age, 
ethnic background or economic status. 
</P>
<P>
Even the youngest children are challenged to question and to think, not taught 
what to think, said head teacher Karen Minns, a published poet and writer who 
has taught at the school for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to know the world is not black and white most of the time . . . 
that there is another side to things, and that everything has a bias." 
</P>
<P>
Added longtime Farm School administrator Agnes Mason: "We say, 'Don't take our 
word for it. It could be a lot of baloney.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last year, one group's assignment was to feel -- not just read -- Ernest 
Hemingway's "Old Man and the Sea" at home. Parents were asked to provide a 
picnic lunch and drink, but not to interrupt their child's reading. The aim, 
they were told, was to let the child experience the Old Man's solitude, his 
hunger and thirst, and to feel his endurance strained as he battles the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the teaching technique is to build on what the children themselves 
are interested in. 
</P>
<P>
Farm School students don't get grades and transcripts they can bring with them 
to a new school. About the only yardstick is a standardized test given at all 
California schools. Butler said the Farm School children consistently score at 
or above grade level on those tests. 
</P>
<P>
The proof may be the welcome Farm School graduates are given at area junior 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our most prepared students come from the Farm School," said Mike 
Buettell, a counselor at Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate School, where many of 
the Irvine area graduates enter seventh grade. "I wish we had more of them."

BLUDGEONED WOMAN'S BODY FOUND IN HOME

<P>
Police on Sunday were investigating the death of a woman whose bludgeoned body 
was found at her estranged husband's residence near Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified by police as Donna J. Connaty, 34, was found dead of 
head injuries inside the couple's house in the 7700 block of Jackson Way, Buena 
Park Police Lt. Pat Black said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Richard P. Connaty, 38, spent the weekend in the desert riding 
motorcycles with the couple's three children and was unaware of his wife's 
death until he came home and found police investigating the homicide, neighbors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that the couple had been separated and that Donna Connaty had been 
living with her mother in another house on Jackson Way, about a block from the 
house she still jointly owned with her husband in the older, tree-lined 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators at the scene questioned and released Richard Connaty, who works 
as a diesel mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no known suspects at the time," said Black, who declined to 
elaborate on the investigation and said he did not know if there was evidence 
of forced entry into the house. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Connaty's body was discovered about 11:30 a.m. by her father-in-law, 
Ramsay Connaty, who called police, Black said. Reached at his Buena Park home, 
Ramsay Connaty declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was last seen on Saturday at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, where 
she worked a double shift as a nursing assistant, police said. Hospital 
officials declined comment late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to speculate on why Donna Connaty was at her estranged 
husband's home. An autopsy will be performed to determine the time of death, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors who declined to give their names, Donna Connaty had a 
stormy relationship with her husband. Several months ago, she moved out of the 
couple's house, residents said, but recently was spending more time there, 
leading some to believe that she had moved back with her husband. Neighbors 
said the couple's children were about ages 6, 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
The violent death shocked residents of the normally quiet, residential street 
just four blocks from Knott's Berry Farm. "We've never had anything like this 
ever happen," said one longtime resident of Jackson Way. "This is kind of 
frightening," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident said "it's a great neighborhood" and "everybody is shocked. We 
want to get some details about what happened. There are a lot of kids here and 
we're all pretty worried."

STREET SMART: HOT LINE PROVES THAT WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S IRE

Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
While driving on the Costa Mesa Freeway, I was stuck behind a vehicle that was 
emiting smoke from the tailpipe. Not only was there a large cloud of smoke, but 
the smell was so bad that I had to roll up my windows and change lanes. 
</P>
<P>
I understand that there is a telephone number that you can call to report cars 
that emit excessive amounts of smoke from their tailpipes. Could you please 
print this number and explain how the system works? 
</P>
<P>
David B. Smith, Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
Anyone stuck behind such a stinker can call (800) CUT-SMOG. You'll reach the 
Air Quality Management District, which will attempt to take action against the 
owner of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kelly, an AQMD spokesman, said the program works like this: You report the 
car's license number, its make and description (a gold Mercedes, for instance, 
or a pink VW bug), and the date, time and location at which you observed it. 
The air district taps into the state Department of Motor Vehicle's database to 
determine the owner. 
</P>
<P>
A letter is then dispatched to the owner of the smoking vehicle saying that he 
or she may be in violation of the state's air pollution laws and asking that 
the problem be repaired. It also provides a form to fill out and return to the 
district either verifying that the work was done or stating that a mechanic 
said no repairs were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The program is voluntary, because the district has no enforcement power. 
Nonetheless, it has reaped some results, Kelly said. The CUT-SMOG line receives 
about 15,000 complaints a month from irked Southern California motorists. The 
response rate from suspected polluters who receive letters from the district is 
about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who ignore the district's warning are eventually snagged. The 
California Highway Patrol has eight officers in the Southland assigned 
specifically to squad cars that do nothing but hunt down polluters. And if the 
CHP doesn't get them, the DMV will with its mandatory smog check every other 
year for all cars on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I own a 1979 diesel auto. The cost of diesel fuel relative to regular and 
unleaded gas has me baffled. We travel with our diesel to all parts of the 
United States, and I have wondered why in places like Oklahoma diesel is 20 
cents a gallon less than unleaded, whereas the cost of diesel relative to 
unleaded is higher in California. Are diesel refinery requirements here more 
stringent than elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
Carl Weinert, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry experts say there are several factors that come into play to keep 
diesel costs high in California relative to the price of other types of 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, there are additional refining requirements in California, 
according to Doug Elmets, a spokesman for ARCO. California's air pollution laws 
require that diesel fuel sold in the state contain one-tenth the sulfur in 
diesel sold in other states. This adds additional refining steps and, hence, 
additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
Elmets said supply and demand also occasionally play a role in keeping 
California's diesel prices a bit higher relative to gasoline. There are more 
diesel automobiles in the state than in any other, but the fuel supply doesn't 
always keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
Diesel prices in other states can also rise and fall with the seasons. Diesel 
is a close relative of the fuel that is used to heat homes in many Midwestern 
and Northeast states, according to Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg 
Letter, an authoritative newsletter on the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
During winter months, when the demand for heating oil is great, the supply of 
diesel in those states is less, driving up prices. In the summer, refineries 
shift back to producing more of the diesel, causing prices to slip downward. 
The price of unleaded and regular gasoline, meanwhile, generally is not 
affected as much by seasonal factors.

CITY HALLS CRAMP STYLE OF S. COUNTY EMPLOYEES; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: OFFICIALS OF NEWLY INCORPORATED CITIES WORK IN MAKESHIFT, CROWDED 
CONDITIONS. SOME CITIZENS ARE LEFT WONDERING WHERE TO FIND THEIR PUBLIC 
SERVANTS.

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the counter of his video store, Scott Zody has seen "lots of them" wander 
in, with puzzled, lost looks on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
They are people in search of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I just send them upstairs," said Zody, his index finger pointing to the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
There they will find the Dana Point City Hall, wedged between Dr. Kirk Hobeck's 
dentist office and Dana Point Dermatology, directly above Top Hits Video and 
the Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Laguna Niguel, city officials might have chosen a headquarters in the 
city's grandiose, cavernous, landmark Chet Holifield Federal Building. Instead, 
City Hall, at least part of it, sits in an obscure industrial park next door to 
the Aliso Creek Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel City Manager Tim Casey acknowledges the shortcomings of 
accommodations in his temporary office, but he manages to keep it all in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
All over the South County, an area in which three cities (Mission Viejo, Dana 
Point and Laguna Niguel) can each count their ages on one hand, city halls are 
not the edifices of stability and endurance. Rather, they are makeshift 
headquarters with a landlord's rent due on a monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
The quarters are often cramped, people have trouble finding them, and in all 
three cases, officials long for a more enduring symbol of municipal self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
But until the new cities do get their modern city halls, city employees will 
have to make do. 
</P>
<P>
That can make life interesting, if not exasperating, said Laguna Niguel's 
Casey. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly a makeshift environment here, to say the least," Casey said. 
"I'm in a 4,000-square-foot space with six of my staff. The rest of my people 
are down the parking lot, past a dance academy, past a medical corporate 
facility in what we call the annex. One hundred yards past that, if you enter a 
parking lot and hang a left, you'll find our community development staff." 
</P>
<P>
With this kind of arrangement, forget the luxury of modern communication, Casey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our phone systems are not integrated, so I have to dial a seven-digit number 
to talk to a department head," Casey said. "To make things more interesting, we 
don't have centralized data processing either, so there is no ability to share 
data. If I draft a report to the City Council, 90% of all the hard copy has to 
be retyped." 
</P>
<P>
At the least, the lack of a city hall allows the Laguna Niguel community a 
certain sense of unity, said Mayor Patricia C. Bates. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing you surely won't get an argument about here is City Hall should be 
expanded," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the relatively established city of Mission Viejo, now nearing its third 
birthday, City Hall still sits on the ground floor of a nondescript office 
building on La Alameda, just off Crown Valley Parkway. The Mission Viejo Co. 
managed to spend 20 years master-planning "the California Promise" but provided 
no acreage for its city headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo resident Milt Gerloff remembers his first trip there, armed with 
a Thomas Bros. guide. He soon found out there are no signs on Crown Valley 
Parkway to help visitors out. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be confusing the first time," Gerloff explained. "I got a little mixed 
up when I got off of Crown Valley and turned left instead of right. I knew it 
was around there somewhere but the streets were so new, they weren't even on 
the maps yet. Even when you get to the parking lot, you're still not sure 
you're in the right place because there are no signs until you get to the front 
door." 
</P>
<P>
Its saving grace might be that it's pink, said Norma Graves, a receptionist for 
the building department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only pink building in the area, that's how I explain it to people," 
Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside City Hall, City Manager Fred Sorsabal, who formerly worked in more 
established city halls in Costa Mesa and El Segundo, can now relate to the 
problems of other tenants. City workers have had to fend for themselves during 
a recent infestation of mice and rats. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't seem to get our landlord to get them taken care of," Sorsabal said. 
</P>
<P>
William O. Talley, city manager of Dana Point who served in the same position 
for Mission Viejo, places the blame for the city hall predicament on the 
county, which was until a few years ago the planner for most of South County. 
The problem has been a lack of available land on which to build a city hall, 
Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
"The county made no provisions for any future form of municipal governments in 
these areas while they were unincorporated territory," Talley said. "The newly 
created cities found themselves with no property to house the institutions of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's problem still irks Talley today, despite the fact he has moved 
south. 
</P>
<P>
"In Mission Viejo, there was never any requirement by the county for the 
developer to set aside property, even though it was known for 10 or 12 years 
that it would soon become a city," said Talley. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the company sold the city its old headquarters for $3.1 million, and 
city officials estimate it will spend at least another $1 million renovating 
it, said Assistant City Manager Dan Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
That purchase remains a source of controversy throughout the city, Joseph said. 
Some residents believe that the city needs to to build a new city hall 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
If Mission Viejo is any example, business is done differently these days than 
it was earlier in the county. It used to be that cities got help, Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are things that typically developers have had to pay for," Talley said. 
"What happened in the old-line cities was they would go out and purchase some 
land and either get a donation or extract money from a developer." 
</P>
<P>
A case in point could be Irvine, which back in 1971 was the last county city to 
incorporate before the three new South County cities. Since March, 1989, the 
city has enjoyed a state-of-the-art, $38-million, 200,000-square-foot city hall 
built on 15 acres in the middle of town. The 15 acres were donated by the 
Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine started out with 500 square feet of rented space in an Irvine Co. 
office building in the old Town Center across Campus Drive from UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
That was fine for a city of 13,000 and a staff of fewer than 15 people, said 
Paul O. Brady Jr., the city's current city manager and an original member of 
the Irvine staff. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were smaller and beholden to the county for most of our services, it 
didn't much matter," Brady said. "But as we grew and took on those services 
in-house, we had to keep leasing more space." 
</P>
<P>
From that 500 square feet, Irvine wound up leasing 25,000 square feet, the 
entire second floor of the building near UCI. By 1985, the city had moved to 
its old 40,000-square-foot civic center on Jamboree Road, where it continued 
mushrooming across the street and down the block. 
</P>
<P>
Most city officials agree that leasing space for a city hall is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"A study we did, which was supported by an advisory vote of the people, showed 
that in the long term it's . . . a lot cheaper to own your own building than to 
keep leasing," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
That is doubly true considering the fact that office space generally wasn't 
designed to house a city government. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that it doesn't make good sense to keep on paying 
ever-increasing amounts of rent in a building not designed as a municipal 
building," Talley said. "Municipal facilities have some unique requirements. 
You need areas for the public to congregate, lobbies, for example, for people 
who come and want to research records. Plus you need a lot more storage space 
because governments run on amounts of paper that would dwarf most normal 
businesses. And you have to keep and store all that paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is always the unknown involved anytime one deals with a landlord, or 
two landlords in the case of the spread out configuration of Laguna Niguel City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got two different landlords with two different agendas for the future," 
Casey said. "That kind of makes things interesting."

NEWLY ELECTED LEYES BACKS ARTS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mark Leyes' political ambitions began when he was a Rancho Alamitos High School 
student attending a 1975 Garden Grove Youth in Government Day program in which 
he was able to sit next to then-Mayor Bernard H. Adams at a City Council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"That was when I really got the bug," said Leyes, who will be sworn in Dec. 3 
after finishing first in a field of seven for two seats on the council in the 
Nov. 6 election. Leyes, a 32-year-old environmental impact analyst, will take 
the seat held by Raymond T. Littrell, who chose not to run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
It was Leyes' second campaign for the council. He finished fourth in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel really good," Leyes said, reflecting on his victory. "I feel like the 
voters have accepted me. They've accepted the idea that I've got the experience 
and the ability to help solve the city's problems, and they've accepted the 
idea that my solutions are worth trying." 
</P>
<P>
The message that voters sent in electing him may mean a new direction for 
Garden Grove, Leyes suggested. "It's definitely a call for new leadership. 
Conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican, people realize we can't just 
have business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
One controversial issue likely to be rethought is the city's support for the 
arts. The council majority of J. Tilman Williams, Robert F. Dinsen and Littrell 
agreed to phase out direct contributions to the Grove Shakespeare Festival and 
the Garden Grove Symphony, but that seems likely to change. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever money we invest in the arts comes back many fold," Leyes said. 
"There's an economic multiplier effect, where when someone comes to a play or a 
concert, they spend money in town." 
</P>
<P>
Not only will the new council majority of Mayor W.E. (Walt) Donovan, Francis L. 
Kessler and Leyes become "boosters" of the arts, but "financial support will 
come too," Leyes said. Other changes in the city's direction may be on tap as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to take a look at the Village Green Master Plan, which calls 
for a third building," Leyes said. "The city has built the indoor Gem Theatre 
and open-air Festival Amphitheatre in the downtown Village Green Park, and a 
third, larger enclosed facility seating around 500 was originally planned to 
complete the complex." 
</P>
<P>
Leyes added that he and Donovan are planning to participate in Rancho Santiago 
College's 75th anniversary fund-raising drive and hope that it might lead to a 
resumption of the college's involvement with the Grove Shakespeare Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Other priorities, Leyes said, include "getting our redevelopment back on track. 
We may need to amend the redevelopment areas, take some out, put some in. We 
need to start using those resources (tax revenue raised by the Redevelopment 
Agency) for impacted city services, such as public safety and roads."JIM

LICENSED DRIVERS -- -- 1989

<P>
In the two decades since 1970, the number of licensed drivers in Orange County 
nearly doubled. In 1989, the most recent year for which information is 
available, more than half the 1.7 million drivers (53%) were men. 
</P>
<P>
And nearly a quarter-million of those were between 20 and 29 years old. Only 
about 1% of our drivers were 80 years of older -- and most of those were women. 
Here's a more complete look:

COUNCIL STALLS PLANS FOR HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial housing development has been put on hold by the City Council, 
because it would add a major thoroughfare through a now-isolated neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The 99-acre project of 76 custom homes is proposed by Irvine-based Concorde 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
It has drawn criticism from the nearby neighborhood of Connemara-by-the-Sea 
estate homes, because it calls for linking Camino Las Ramblas with San Juan 
Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
This link would create a major route west to Interstate 5 from eastern San Juan 
Capistrano, through a series of hills. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Connemara estates and an older development of homes atop Valle 
Road enjoy the quiet privacy of being on dead-end streets. 
</P>
<P>
City planners are concerned that if Camino Las Ramblas is extended, the impact 
on current residents would outweigh the benefits of another through street. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to refer the issue to the advisory Traffic and Transportation 
Commission as well as to the Planning Commission for further review. 
</P>
<P>
Concorde Development has offered to pay for building the Camino Las Ramblas 
extension through the 900 acres of hillsides, in exchange for approval of its 
custom-home project. 
</P>
<P>
The road project is estimated to cost at least $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also at issue is whether the road and the custom homes can be built without 
violating the city's ridgeline protection ordinance, which prohibits 
construction within 200 feet of a hilltop. WENDY PAULSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
CITY BIDS FAREWELL TO BLUFF-TOP OIL WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Cook was surprised and dismayed by a state environmental report several 
years ago that called Huntington Beach the "ugliest stretch of coastline in the 
entire state." 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a former public works director, recently recalled that he challenged the 
validity of such criticism but agreed that the dozens of aging oil wells 
dotting the northern strip of beach hardly made for a post-card glimpse of the 
Pacific shore. "I figured it was time we made an attempt to start cleaning that 
up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, almost five years later, Cook is retired from city government. And the 
last of 29 bluff-top oil wells are finally scheduled to be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council last week agreed to pay $100,000 to Shell Western E &amp; P, 
Inc. to remove the last four wells, which Shell owns, along the bluffs between 
Golden West and 17th streets. Shell will contribute $60,000 toward the project, 
said Bill Gibson, the firm's public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
The wells date back to the oil boom of the 1920s, when companies drilled all 
over the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city's agreement with Shell comes only months after Chevron U.S.A. removed 
the last of its 25 beachfront wells. 
</P>
<P>
The council in March agreed to pay $650,000 of Chevron's cost to eliminate the 
low-producing wells. Chevron officials have not disclosed how much they spent 
on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, however, said that during his original negotiations with the firm, 
Chevron had sought $3.5 million from the city for the job. Public Works 
Director Louis Sandoval said he believes that Huntington Beach "got an 
excellent deal" in buying out the wells. 
</P>
<P>
But some council members, including Grace Winchell, have questioned why the 
city has had to pay the oil companies to remove wells that have long since 
passed peak production. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new oil well ordinance the council adopted this year, a company must 
abandon a well when its production drops below a minimum level. City officials, 
however, estimate that the Chevron and Shell wells could continue producing 
above that level for many years. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until this year that the oil companies finally agreed to a price the 
city considered acceptable, Sandoval said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Erskine, who was involved in some of the negotiations, said he 
concluded that "the wells could remain there as long as the companies wanted."

IRVINE'S SHINING EXAMPLE OF A MODERN CITY HALL; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: WHEN THIS SOUTH COUNTY COMMUNITY PLANNED ITS MUNICIPAL BUILDING, IT HAD 
THE COMFORT OF EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC IN MIND.

<P>
When the new cities of South Orange County dream of a city hall to reflect the 
pride of municipal self-rule, they often look no farther than Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
There, a $38-million state-of-the-art edifice has arisen -- home to 600 city 
employees, a 2,500-square-foot gym and engineered to make citizens feel 
comfortable and welcome. 
</P>
<P>
And at least part of the credit for the facility, city officials say, goes to 
Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, who served as mayor of Carmel, struck a chord with Irvine City 
Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. several years ago during Brady's nationwide tour of 
cities that served as his research into Irvine's new city hall, which opened in 
April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood and Brady are fitness fanatics, and both believe that regular workouts 
are stress reducers. So, as in Carmel, Irvine incorporated a workout area into 
its new city hall for the nearly 600 full-time city employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it our wellness center," said Brady, a member of the city staff since 
Irvine incorporated in 1971. "It's heavily used by our employees, which I'm 
pleased to say." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the 2,500-square-foot gym, there are weights, a Lifecycle, Stairmaster, 
all donated to the city, and lockers for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
But city employees don't just take off on their own fitness regimen. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the staff can use the equipment, they are tested and offered personal 
advice on fitness and nutrition by a consultant we have hired," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady was on a committee that spent countless hours of research, including 
travel to various cities, into the designs of city halls. The results of its 
studies were incorporated into the Irvine City Hall plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We used a process that I don't think many cities do or want to do," Brady 
said. "The first thing we did was have consultants sit down with the citizens, 
we called them 'squatter sessions,' and had them tell us what they thought City 
Hall should be like or not be like. I think the people of this city felt like 
they were part of the process, which they were." 
</P>
<P>
The results of those sessions show up in the present facility in a variety of 
incarnations: 
</P>
<P>
* Departments centralized under one roof for "one-stop shopping" for residents, 
especially the Police Department. "I want the police to be part of the city 
family, not locked behind closed doors," said Brady, who is a former policeman. 
</P>
<P>
* Counter access for every department and glass partitions whenever possible. 
"We wanted people to be able to see each other. Bureaucracies are difficult 
enough to deal with, and we did not want City Hall to become a monolith if 
possible," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
* A three-level parking structure over a secured area for the police fleet and 
inspection vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
* A standby automatic diesel generator which will start automatically with any 
interruption of power. It will provide emergency electricity for all of the 
police wing, computer operations, and communications. 
</P>
<P>
* A council chamber that seats 199 plus overflow for 50 to 70 more people. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing about the Irvine City Hall may be its financing, Brady said. 
Thanks to the city's asset-management plan, Brady expects it to be paid for by 
1997, eight years sooner than expected.

RAMS MIX UP DEFENSES AND GIVE 49ERS FITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Rams have spent a good part of the season searching for a successful style 
of defense, and they might have stumbled upon a new approach Sunday during 
their 28-17 victory over the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they could call it the Zombie Defense: It's got a little of this and a 
little of that and eventually leaves you dazed and confused. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said the Rams used every defensive formation they could and 
tried to mix and match them in no particular order. Pass defenses on first 
down, run defenses in passing situations, a hodgepodge that had the desired 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Their defensive fronts gave us a bunch of different looks," quarterback Joe 
Montana said. "We were expecting them to be in their normal 3-4, but they were 
changing up a lot and moving at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
"They were trying to take away our short passing game, so we ended up running 
the ball a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers gained only 66 yards rushing, however. 
</P>
<P>
"They mixed up their defenses wonderfully," 49er Coach George Seifert said. 
"Their game plan caught us off guard." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had a 21-7 halftime lead, but some of the fans might have missed the 
action on the field while keeping their eyes on the skies. 
</P>
<P>
The Fuji blimp was overhead, fighting the swirling wind currents and rain. 
First, its nose would point nearly straight up, then almost straight down. 
Sometimes, it seemed to spin nearly 360 degrees while being buffeted by the 
gusts. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the inclement weather forced the blimp to the ground, and the 49er 
fans could concentrate on a Black Sunday of another kind. 
</P>
<P>
Buford McGee may spend most of his time barreling into linebackers for the 
better health and running conditions of Cleveland Gary, but McGee said the 
22-yard touchdown pass he unleashed to Gary Sunday should come as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, that was like every play we did," said McGee, the former 
Charger. "I was doing that all the time to Gary Anderson." 
</P>
<P>
On the play, which resulted in the Rams' first score, McGee took an inside 
handoff running right, approached the line, then flipped it out to Gary, who 
was looping wide down the sideline. It was designed to be a lateral, but Gary 
was ahead of McGee and it was ruled a pass. McGee didn't care, as long as it 
was ruled six points. 
</P>
<P>
"Cleveland turned it upfield a little fast," McGee said. "But it doesn't 
matter, as long as I'm behind the line of scrimmage." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams tried this play -- named "The Veer" -- earlier this season, although 
Gary and McGee couldn't remember exactly when it occurred, but they remembered 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was against Pittsburgh, and you got one yard," McGee told Gary. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost got my head knocked off," Gary said, "that's all I remember. Don't 
remember who it was against." 
</P>
<P>
McGee, who had rushed only 19 times all season before Sunday, carried the ball 
six times for 36 yards and a touchdown, and was awarded the game ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my first as a Ram, so that's kind of special," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Jim Everett: "If I had a vote, he'd (McGee) be my most 
valuable player of the game. He's just so consistent." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco linebacker Matt Millen couldn't believe the way the ball bounced 
back into the hands of Gary on the Rams' winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The football gods were on their side a couple of times today," he said. "When 
the ball bounces out and comes right back. . . . I thought he was going to put 
it around his back and slam dunk it." 
</P>
<P>
Sheep to Slaughter? Before Sunday's game, two dogs wearing red 49er vests 
herded four sheep in Rams' clothing around the Candlestick Park field. 
</P>
<P>
The lambs, er Rams, were dyed blue with yellow rams' horns, and they marched up 
and down the field just like the Rams did a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson went to great pains to say this was a team victory, not any kind of 
personal vindication in the midst of speculation he might be replaced at the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the team," Robinson said. "That's what all this is about. It's the team. 
I'm part of that team, that's all."

VOLLEYBALL: BATTLES WITH DYSLEXIA AND TOUGH PRACTICE SESSIONS HAVE FORTIFIED

FINAL.

<P>
On the few occasions the Corona del Mar High School girls' volleyball team 
hasn't played well this season, Prentice Perkins knows she's probably going to 
get blamed for it. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, the team's 5-foot-5 setter, expects the criticism. After all, it's the 
nature of her job. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens, it's always my fault," Perkins said. "Whenever 
everything goes wrong, I'm the first person taken out of the game. As the 
setter, you get blamed for the majority of mistakes. If you're not prepared for 
it, it can really work you." 
</P>
<P>
And Perkins has been preparing for 18 years. She knows all about dealing with 
stressful situations. 
</P>
<P>
You want mental toughness? 
</P>
<P>
Try having your second-grade classmates laughing at you as you struggle with 
your daily reading assignment. Try looking at the word CAT and seeing TAC. 
</P>
<P>
What Perkins' classmates didn't understand is that she has dyslexia, an 
impairment of the ability to read that medical authorities say could affect 
between 10% and 15% of the population. To Perkins, many letters of the alphabet 
look alike or are out of order. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was little I got razzed about it a lot," she said. "The kids would say, 
'You can't read.' But I'm a pushy person, and it's hard for me to fail at 
anything. I set goals so high, even if it's impossible for me. I won't let 
myself lose at anything." 
</P>
<P>
That attitude has helped Perkins on the volleyball court and in the classroom. 
She maintains a 3.0 grade-point average, and is being recruited by USC and UC 
Santa Barbara for volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"School is not the easiest thing for me," she said. "I've taken all this step 
by step. I've overcome it (dyslexia) in a way. But it's something I still have. 
</P>
<P>
"I try so hard to beat it. I know I have to work really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins learned more about hard work when she started playing with the Orange 
County Volleyball club teams as a sixth-grader. Former Corona del Mar Coach 
Charlie Brande, who oversees the program, is known for his intense practices. 
Perkins would often go home in tears. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very critical of all my setters," Brande said. "It's like Lou Holtz is 
with his quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the demands, Perkins never let her emotions show. At least not during 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never cry in front of Charlie," Perkins said. "But when I got home, I 
would tell my mom (Michael), 'Oh my God, I have to quit. I can't take it.' I 
would come home crying all the time." 
</P>
<P>
But Perkins always went back. She had been through worse. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids giving me a hard time gave me that toughness," Perkins said. "When 
they made fun of me about reading, I asked myself, 'What's wrong with me, am I 
retarded?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same thing with Charlie pushing me in volleyball. I push back and do 
better. I wanted to prove all of them wrong. I'm just a hard-headed person. And 
I hate to lose more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Those six years of "hell," as Perkins describes the practices, are paying off. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins played one of her best games of the season in Corona del Mar's 
three-game sweep of Mira Costa in the Southern Section 5-A finals Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Brande, who was suspended as the Sea Kings' coach in the wake of an 
investigation into his club teams by the Southern Section office, watched from 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
During the post-match celebration, Perkins and her teammates gave Brande the 
championship plaque. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to look over and see Charlie in the stands," Perkins said. "He put 
us through hell but he has been such a good friend to us, too. That's the 
reason we ran to Charlie after the match." 
</P>
<P>
There is one more championship remaining that Perkins and the Sea Kings want to 
win for their former coach -- the state title. 
</P>

Perkins had eight kills and ran the offense in a five-game victory over Poway 
in the second round of the Southern California Division I regional Saturday 
night. The Sea Kings play San Jose Lynbrook in the regional final Tuesday night 
at Corona del Mar. The winner advances to Saturday's state final. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very determined kid," said Dale Flickinger, who replaced Brande as 
Corona del Mar's coach. "She struggled (against Poway) but when she had to get 
it done, she delivered for us. She can elevate her level of play when she has 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, a three-year starter, runs one of the most complex offenses of any 
high school team. When a back-row player passes her the ball, she has 13 
different options for setting. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very good," Flickinger said. "She runs a more diverse offense than most. 
Sometimes she's not as consistent, but one great attribute is that she's very 
fearless. Some setters get conservative in a close game. She knows this system, 
and she's not afraid to quick set to the middle (blocker) in a close game." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins comes from a family rich in volleyball experience. Her father, Robert, 
played on the beach and her older brother, Jason, was a freshman starter on 
USC's national-championship team last season. 
</P>
<P>
The family regularly plays two-on-two at the beach. So how does Prentice do 
against her brother, who, at 6-4, has an 11-inch height advantage? 
</P>
<P>
"Jason's better, but only because he has the height," Prentice said. "My 
parents messed up and gave the height to the wrong person in our family." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins said her height gives her an advantage. Opponents tend to underestimate 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"They look at me and say, 'Let's hit the ball at her,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents make the same mistake on the soccer field. Perkins was the Sea View 
League's most valuable player last season at sweeper, a defensive position. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it (soccer) because it's physical," Perkins said. "Volleyball is more 
of a thinking sport. Soccer it's whoever is stronger." 
</P>
<P>
And who's tougher . . . physically and mentally.

<P>
For Wall Street, the 1990s are shaping up to be a time of dwindling 
opportunities, lost jobs and meager profits. 
</P>
<P>
But the unfolding decade almost seems special-ordered for Los Angeles-based 
Capital Group, the Southland's biggest private money manager: 
</P>
<P>
* In a troubled investing environment that demands a long-term focus, Capital's 
oldest stock and bond mutual funds boast historical track records that are 
among the industry's best. 
</P>
<P>
* While many firms are just now struggling with their baby boomer employees' 
restless ambitions, for 30 years Capital has had an egalitarian management 
structure that stresses high individual achievement -- and lets junior 
employees run their own shows. 
</P>
<P>
* While financial services companies of all kinds are paying dearly for the 
excesses of the 1980s, Capital's tortoise-like, conservative approach has left 
it in a powerful position to gain from competitors' weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for Capital's monolithic size -- $55.8 billion under management, ranking it 
16th largest of all U.S. money managers -- the firm is a surprisingly quiet 
presence in Los Angeles. "We probably should be better known in our hometown," 
admits Jon Lovelace, the 63-year-old vice chairman of the firm and by most 
accounts its spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
One of Capital's few highly visible executives in recent years has been Robert 
Kirby, chairman of the firm's institutional investing arm, Capital Guardian 
Trust. A member of the so-called Brady Commission that studied the 1987 stock 
market crash, he became a vocal opponent of computerized program trading in the 
late 1980s. In general, however, Capital has rarely sought publicity. Yet its 
investment record has become the envy of many rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a first-class operation," says Budge Collins, head of Collins Associates, 
a Newport Beach firm that tracks investment firm performance. "They hire good 
people and they keep them. They have very low turnover." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an organization of which I've never heard anything negative," adds 
Michael Stolper, a San Diego pension consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Both insiders and outsiders say much of the credit for Capital's success goes 
to the self-effacing Lovelace, a Princeton economics graduate whose father 
founded Capital in the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Lovelace also now represents one of Capital's greatest challenges 
-- that is, the challenge of doing without him as he nears retirement. Though 
Lovelace insists that Capital's management depth is so great that his presence 
wouldn't be missed, insiders say his departure would leave a void. 
</P>
<P>
As the biggest stock mutual fund manager on the West Coast, Capital is the 
antithesis of its giant East Coast rival, Fidelity Investments. 
</P>
<P>
Both firms began to make their names in the 1950s, and both have grown 
dramatically since. But Fidelity offers 124 mutual funds; Capital offers just 
24. Fidelity aggressively jumps on new fund trends and is a magnet for "hot" 
money that jumps from investment to investment; Capital always chooses the slow 
road. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Fidelity's structure is based on what is sometimes called the 
"star system" of portfolio management, as personified by Peter Lynch, who ran 
the firm's Magellan Fund in the 1980s. Each Fidelity fund has one manager 
ultimately calling the shots. 
</P>
<P>
Capital's approach is the polar opposite: All 24 funds are split among three to 
five money managers, each of whom is free to manage his or her slice without 
answering to one fund czar. In that way, no star system can develop because no 
single manager alone can make or break a fund. 
</P>
<P>
The Capital system's results: 
</P>
<P>
* The firm's three biggest stock funds far outgunned the average stock fund and 
the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index in the 10 years ended Sept. 
30. An investor who put $10,000 in Capital's Investment Co. of America fund in 
1980 would have $42,300 now. That same investment in the S&amp;P 500 would be 
worth $37,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Capital's success wasn't just a phenomenon of the 1980s. Its funds, under the 
American Funds name, have produced strong returns since the 1950s. That record 
has landed the firm a long list of accolades -- from Forbes magazine's fund 
honor roll to the top spot in a 1990 report on the best fund families by fund 
tracker Kanon Bloch Carre. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, having three to five people separately managing chunks of a 
single fund -- as bullishly or bearishly as each sees fit -- might seem like an 
invitation to investment anarchy. But Capital has discovered that, regardless 
of short-term conflicts, the results over the long-term somehow come together. 
</P>
<P>
The multiple-manager system was devised by Lovelace in 1958 as just a 
transitional idea after a fund's manager moved up. But as he saw it working, 
Lovelace and his co-managers became convinced that the concept was a smarter 
approach than the one-manager system. 
</P>
<P>
Another Lovelace innovation came in the mid-1960s, when Capital began including 
its research analysts in the multiple-manager system. Traditionally, analysts 
have simply fed ideas to fund managers to accept or reject. 
</P>
<P>
"But some of our younger people in research asked, 'Why not let us manage some 
of the money?' " Lovelace recalls. Nearly 30 years later, Capital says the 
analysts' portfolios have frequently been the best-performing parts of its 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
What's perhaps most striking about Capital's corporate culture is that it 
developed long before it was considered important to listen to -- let alone 
implement -- employees' ideas. One of Lovelace's guiding philosophies, he says, 
is to "to build responsibilities around our people, rather than just put names 
in organizational boxes." 
</P>
<P>
Capital employees say that isn't just talk. Robert Neithart, a 25-year-old 
assistant economist at Capital, believes that the firm is "sort of a unique 
place to work. . . . One of the things they try to get across to younger folks 
here is that they really do take your opinion seriously. They don't put an 
asterisk near your name and say, 'He's only been here for three years.' " 
</P>
<P>
That egalitarianism isn't without cost, though. Employees say the atmosphere is 
collegial, with a lot of give-and-take, hash-it-out discussions over investment 
strategies. But the firm wouldn't win any awards in an expense-control contest, 
Capital's executives admit. "Clearly the way we do a lot of things is not the 
most efficient way," says David Fisher, executive vice president of Capital's 
international operations. 
</P>
<P>
However, because Capital is private -- it's owned by about 75 of its 1,200 
employees -- it faces none of the pressures of public firms to sacrifice 
long-term goals for short-term profit. 
</P>
<P>
Why has Capital been able to thrive under that philosophy, while other money 
managers have been forced to live quarter to quarter? A key reason is that 
Capital essentially demands that its individual investors make a long-term 
commitment up front. 
</P>
<P>
While Fidelity and other mutual fund companies sell their shares directly to 
the public, Capital funds are available only through brokers. To get into a 
Capital fund, an investor must get the pitch from a broker and pay a steep 
sales commission -- 4.75% to 5.75%. 
</P>
<P>
That puts a damper on the idea of trading in and out of Capital funds and thus 
makes it easier for fund managers to devise long-term game plans with the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of selling the funds directly to the public is reviewed 
periodically, Lovelace says. "But when we review it, we always stay with where 
we are," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Why? "Our story is not simple," Lovelace says. The concept of true long-term 
investing under Capital's system takes patient explanation, which only a 
salesman can provide, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key points the broker makes, Lovelace adds, is that Capital will 
never promise good short-term performance. What is promised is steady growth of 
a nest egg over time -- which plays well with investors who are serious about 
retirement planning. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if Capital had failed to deliver over the past 30 years, its 
marketing would be to little avail. But because its investing record has been 
strong, the firm has created what could be a self-perpetuating cycle -- it 
pulls in long-term money, delivers above-average long-term returns, and thereby 
attracts more long-term money. 
</P>
<P>
Some rivals might argue that Capital's reluctance to introduce new funds shows 
a narrowness in investing talent. Indeed, Capital is far better known as a 
stock manager than a bond manager, even though it runs one of the biggest bond 
funds (the $1.8-billion Bond Fund of America). In its rating report earlier 
this year, fund-tracker Kanon Bloch Carre gave Capital an "A" grade for its 
stock funds, but only an average collective grade for its bond funds, many of 
which still are relatively young. 
</P>
<P>
Capital's executives acknowledge that the firm is less recognized for its bond 
talents. But they make no apology for their patient approach toward new fund 
forays. 
</P>
<P>
That stance is supported by the firm's broker network, which views Capital's 
conservatism as a major selling point with clients. "They could have brought 
out 20 new funds over the last few years, and every one would have been a 
winner," says Mike Scafati, who heads mutual fund sales for brokerage A. G. 
Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. "But they pay attention to what's best for the 
client." 
</P>
<P>
For all of the success that Capital has had with its broker network, the system 
also makes the firm vulnerable. Though Capital's list of big institutional 
clients grew rapidly in the 1980s, its mutual fund business still accounts for 
60% of assets, versus 40% for the institutional arm. So the small investor 
still is the firm's bread and butter -- which means that Capital depends on the 
brokers' ability to get the funds' message out. And as hard times hit the 
brokerage industry, and more brokers leave the business, Capital faces the 
prospect of reaching fewer investors. 
</P>
<P>
James K. Dunton, executive vice president of Capital Research, admits that a 
constant challenge "is the maintenance of the sales force, which we don't have 
any real control over. . . . We approach the needs of those (brokers) every day 
like it's the most important thing we have to do -- because it is." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even if the current brokerage shakeout is painful, this is hardly the first 
time Wall Street has gone through a purge. Capital's sales network has survived 
other shakeouts, and the firm's competitors have little doubt that it will 
survive this one too. 
</P>
<P>
A much bigger question mark is how well Capital's lauded management style will 
survive Lovelace's eventual retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Lovelace scoffs at such concerns, noting that he already spends much of his 
time away from the office, working from home in Santa Barbara. "Because of the 
nature of our structure, we're not highly dependent on one person as some 
organizations are," he says flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Capital's senior managers don't hide their reluctance to imagine Capital 
without Lovelace. "There is simply no way to replace a great leader like that," 
Dunton says. "Many of the bold, decisive strokes of this organization have come 
right out of his head."

FOOTNOTES: THE SOUTH RISES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confederate money and weapons were nearly worthless when Sherman attacked 
Atlanta in 1864. But time and TV have been kind to the Confederacy, which is 
now a hot spot in the memorabilia market. 
</P>
<P>
"We won out anyway," affirms Dent Myers, owner of Wildman's Civil War Surplus 
in Kennesaw, Ga., and a descendant of a rebel soldier. "All the Confederate 
stuff is worth more now than Union stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Prompted in part by the Public Broadcasting Service documentary "The Civil 
War," more and more people are out to buy souvenirs, and demand is creating 
ever higher prices for authentic objects. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been an unbelievable increase in sales," said Lori Nash, an employee 
at Stone Mountain Relics. "Everybody says, 'I want a gun like in that movie.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some collectors are paying up to $4,000 for rifles and $2,000 for Confederate 
belt buckles. Musket balls and bullets, however, are still cheapest, sometimes 
going for as little as $2 each. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, John Marcinkowski spent $24,000 for a one-ton piece of history 
that rests in his father's basement. 
</P>
<P>
"It just makes me happy," Marcinkowski, a Vietnam veteran who lives in 
Marietta, Ga., said of his purchase of a Pennsylvania cannon. "A lot of people 
don't know their history." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
A Handbook in Every Pot 
</P>
<P>
Business data freaks unwilling to lay out a fortune subscribing to costly 
information services might consider a new Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
No vacuum, this model is a directory of 541 major enterprises, most of them 
businesses. A big selling point is the price: $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover's Handbook is published by Gary E. Hoover, a lanky Austin, Tex., 
entrepreneur whose last venture was the Bookstop chain of category-killer 
bookstores, which featured low prices and vast selections. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover publishes the 646-page volume himself through his Reference Press Inc., 
the only start-up listed in the guide. (He pays himself $36,000, and the list 
of suppliers includes an Austin pizzeria.) 
</P>
<P>
Handbook entries start with an overview and proceed to who, what, where and 
when. There's no why, but the data ranges from fax numbers to return on equity 
to the chairman's salary. 
</P>
<P>
Not without idiosyncrasy, Hoover's Handbook isn't limited to corporations. 
Included are the Red Cross, the state of California, the Teamsters and the 
United States of America. Unsurprisingly, given its Soviet Realist cover, it 
includes the U.S.S.R.

Big Advertiser Pulls Out: The New York Daily News, its circulation devastated 
by a month-long strike, has lost one of its biggest advertisers, Macy's 
department store, just as the heavy holiday advertising season is getting under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's confirmed that it has dropped its advertising in the Daily News. 
Officials at the striking unions said the A&amp;S department store, another big 
advertiser, has done the same. The newspaper's two tabloid rivals, the New York 
Post and New York Newsday, have reported large advertising and circulation 
gains since the sometimes-violent strike began Oct. 25.

Environmentalists Call for Ban on Some Gifts: In the Christmas season's first 
boycott of merchandise disliked by conservationists, San Francisco-based Rain 
Forest Action Network has asked holiday shoppers to avoid buying products made 
from imported tropical rain forest wood. The group listed the most common 
imports as teak, mahogany and rosewood. 
</P>
<P>
Teak is used in kitchen utensils and salad bowls. Teak, mahogany and rosewood 
veneers are used on home and office furniture. Some pencils, picture frames and 
tool handles are also likely to be made from rain forest wood, said the group. 
Some products were exempted, however. Two furniture makers, Smith &amp; Hawken 
and Herman Miller, replant as much teak and mahogany as they harvest. 
Faber-Castell Corp. escapes the ban by using U.S.-grown cedar for its pencils.

DAVE DISTEL: OVERALL, IT'S A PRIME-TIME EXAMPLE OF LOUSY FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First of all, a highlight . . . as in who did what well. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It did a reasonably nice wave during a fourth-quarter timeout. It is with 
reluctance that we kudo a wave, because such inane revelry went out with 
beehive hairdos. However, this crowd could be excused for seeking ways to amuse 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
These were the Chargers and the Seattle Seahawks playing a nationally 
televised, prime-time football game. What they did was spend the evening 
showing the nation, whatever part of it stayed tuned, that these were not 
prime-time players. 
</P>
<P>
Pass the coffee, and please don't make it decaf. You needed the strong stuff to 
make it through this one. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, San Diego was fortunate this game was blacked out locally. The 2,671 
fans who bought tickets and stayed home were smart, but not as smart as those 
who didn't buy tickets in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
If this game were a painting, it would hang in the garage. It was a date you 
wouldn't take out in public. If it were a play, it wouldn't get out of 
Bridgeport . . . or Bismarck. 
</P>
<P>
And these were teams with playoff aspirations? Spare me. These teams should get 
down on their knees at night a pray they don't get to the playoffs, just like 
folks in Denver are doing. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure anyone actually won this game. I do know it went into overtime and 
I also know why. No one was good enough to win it. They just sparred for 63 
minutes and one second until someone found a way to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle finally won it, 13-10, on an ugly 40-yard field goal by Norm Johnson, a 
butterfly of a kick that didn't end the game as much as it put it out of its 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
To get in position for this game-winning kick, the Seahawks sustained a drive 
of one yard, which lasted two plays. Quarterback Dave Krieg virtually fell down 
on the first play, the amazing thing being that he fell down with the ball. He 
fumbled it four other times. John L. Williams then squeezed for another yard 
before Coach Chuck Knox, having seen enough, called upon his kicker. 
</P>
<P>
The point to be made, of course, was that Seattle was able to start this drive 
from the Charger 23 because Arthur Cox was busily imitating Dave Krieg. On this 
night, putting a football into Cox's hands was a good way to put the football 
in Seattle's hands. He caught a pass and fumbled, just as he had at the Seattle 
21 on the Chargers' last play of regulation time. 
</P>
<P>
Until those two plays, Cox's evening, like the game, was somewhat of a push. 
His personal foul with the Chargers at the Seattle one-yard line forced them to 
settle for a second-quarter field goal, but then he came back and made a nice 
touchdown reception in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, the man probably wished he either was dead or in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
However, Arthur Cox was not alone. The doghouse was rather crowded Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The officials did not even have a good evening. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the biggest gain of the night. This was on a screen pass 
from Krieg to Williams in the third period. The key block was thrown by an 
official, who screened Henry Rolling from making the tackle just past the line 
of scrimmage. Given the gift of an extra 55 yards, what did Seattle do? It ran 
an Oklahoma-style option on the next play, and Krieg fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the officials blew a play dead for some insane reason while Seattle's 
Chris Warren was handling a punt like a wet bar of soap. The Chargers recovered 
this blunder, but Seattle inexplicably was given the ball. It looked like 
Warren and the officials had their eyes shut on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an apparent interception by the Chargers' Donald Frank was ruled an 
incomplete pass in the end zone. The officials probably were conditioned to the 
notion that no one on either team actually could hold onto the football. 
Seattle kicked a field goal on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
No, this was not football at its finest. 
</P>
<P>
The first quarter set the tone for the game. There were five first downs, three 
punts, an interception (yes, thrown by Billy Joe Tolliver) and a missed field 
goal from a modest 36 yards by Johnson. This period took 40 dreary minutes and 
probably wore out remote controls from Key West to Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Billy Joe Tolliver was back in his Second-Year Guy and Playing Like It 
mode. Seattle's first touchdown, which came late in the fourth period, was set 
up when Eugene Robinson intercepted a pass that seemed destined for no Charger 
receiver in that particular zip code. 
</P>
<P>
This was what sent this interminable exercise into that short, but fortunately 
brief, overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, this game was monitored by ABC. It surely will take note and, once 
again, advise the National Football League that it would just as soon not 
include the Chargers on the 1991 Monday night schedule. Thanks, anyway.

SOCKERS PUT UP STRONG DEFENSE, WHIP WICHITA 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It almost appeared the Sockers wanted to be out at the stadium for the Charger 
game Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, they sure were in a hurry to finish their game with the Wichita 
Wings, jumping out to a three-goal lead five minutes into the game en route to 
a victory, 8-2, in front of 4,698 at the Sports Arena, the second smallest 
crowd in six home games this year. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials cited the Chargers game as a reason for the small crowd. 
</P>
<P>
No matter, the few who did come to the Arena knew they weren't watching a 
Charger game -- the home team was completing too many passes. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall we played better tonight than we did against Cleveland (Friday in a 
9-5 victory)," said midfielder Brian Quinn, who scored two goals and assisted 
on another. "Our passing was a lot crisper tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers also got some clutch play from goalkeeper Victor Nogueira, who 
started for the 12th time this season. He leads the Major Soccer League in 
starts and is the only goalkeeper in the league to have started every game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Victor Nogueira had a great game in goal," said Kris Peat, Wings goalkeeper. 
"We had a lot of chances but couldn't finish them because of Victor. That just 
gave the Sockers more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Nogueira came in with a 5.75 goals-against average. He reduced it to 5.44 by 
allowing just two goals, the fewest he has allowed this year. 
</P>
<P>
He also made 18 saves to bring his league-leading total to 153. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't only Nogueira who was doing well. The young defenders in front of 
him, particularly rookies Alex Golovnia and David Banks, suddenly have learned 
to adjust to the more physical indoor game. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we can score goals," Newman said. "We're comfortable with that. But 
we've been uncomfortable with the goals we were giving up." 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Sockers only two minutes and 20 seconds to start connecting. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Waad Hirmez took a pass from Kevin Crow to the left of the penalty 
area, banked it off the corner boards and left-footed the carom high into the 
right side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
With the goal, Hirmez kept two streaks going. He now has scored at least a 
point in 11 of 12 games, including eight consecutive. Hirmez has also netted a 
goal in five consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
More than two minutes later Quinn and Banks hooked up on a corner kick and 
duplicated a goal on which the two combined in Friday's 9-5 victory over 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, as he did Friday, simply sent the corner kick across the goal mouth to 
Banks, who merely let it bounce off his right instep. 
</P>
<P>
With the assist, Quinn moved passed Steve Zungul and into fourth on the Sockers 
all-time scoring list with 254 points. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the sixth consecutive game in which Quinn has scored a point. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 30 seconds later, Wichita goalie Peat was sitting on the carpet again, 
the result of the Sockers' third goal. 
</P>
<P>
This one came on a power play with Rod Castro finishing a pass from Paul 
Dougherty. It was the fourth consecutive power play on which the Sockers have 
scored. They are now nine of 11 on power plays at home. 
</P>
<P>
The goal also marked the first time this year the once-potent Sockers have 
scored three goals in one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Wichita attempted to come back in the third quarter, scoring twice. However the 
Sockers answered both scores with goals. 
</P>
<P>
Chico Moreira took away Nogueira's shutout bid by getting behind the goalie 
five minutes into the period and redirecting a shot from Danny Pena. 
</P>
<P>
Then Quinn went to work, scoring two goals in the span of 19 seconds. The first 
came as he redirected a Dougherty shot. The second came after he lured Peat out 
of the goal by taking a long through pass from Jacques Ladouceur in the penalty 
area, then slipping a soft shot to the right of the sliding goalie. 
</P>
<P>
So it was already 5-1 by the time Dale Ervine, who was booed each time he 
touched the ball, got a shot past Nogueira, thanks in large part to Chico 
Borja, who bowled over the Socker goalie. 
</P>
<P>
It only got worse for Wichita. The Sockers got their sixth goal on a shootout 
(taken by Ben Collins) after Jimmy McGeough was called for holding in the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wes Wade and Jim Gabarra worked a give and go fastbreak to score the 
Sockers first short-handed goal of the year, Gabarra taking the shot after the 
two had passed the ball three times. 
</P>
<P>
Then with less than a minute remaining, Paul Wright went out on a one-man 
fastbreak and beat Wichita's sixth-attacker goalie, Victor Moreland, for the 
final score. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sockers notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers string of power-play goals came to an end midway through the second 
quarter when they failed to score after Danny Pena went off for throwing a hip 
check at Socker goalie Victor Nogueira. . . . With his two goals and assist on 
the night, Quinn moved past Dougherty as the team leader with 17 points.

<P>
If the Chargers still intend to go to the playoffs, it appears they now will 
need tickets. 
</P>
<P>
On a night in which they had talked about starting a five-game winning streak, 
the Chargers went belly up to the Seattle Seahawks, 13-10, in overtime in front 
of an national-television audience and 50,097 fans in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, it will be a game no more costly than the one lost the Chargers 
(5-7) lost in Dallas on a fake punt. But for now, it is their season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an empty feeling," safety Vencie Glenn said. "We've lost some games since 
I've been here, but this one hurts a little more than any other. It's a game we 
had won; a game we shouldn't have lost." 
</P>
<P>
It was all but over. The Chargers were ahead 10-3, had the ball, and had Marion 
Butts, who ran for 128 yards on 28 carries. They were t-h-a-t close to really 
start talking about playoff possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
But on second and nine at the Seattle 49-yard line with just a little more than 
10 minutes to play, quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver threw an interception. He 
was throwing for the sidelines, he explained, but accuracy has not been his 
forte. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to start pointing fingers," he said, "you don't have to point it 
any further than that interception. You can sit here and second guess till hell 
freezes over, but the interception left them back in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Eugene Robinson intercepted Tolliver's pass at the Seattle 30, 
returned it to the San Diego 40, and 10 plays later, Derrick Fenner dived over 
from the one and the game was tied. 
</P>
<P>
And still it was the Chargers' game to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to win it," defensive end Burt Grossman said. "We were 
in field goal range, and then the fumble happened . . . I've never seen 
anything like this game." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had marched back and were on the Seahawks' 32-yard line and in 
position to attempt a game-winning field goal with less than a minute to play. 
All they had to do was inch the ball forward, and more than that, hold onto the 
football. 
</P>
<P>
But after catching a short pass from Tolliver at the 25, tight end Arthur Cox 
fumbled at the 21, and the ball was recovered by Seattle's Jacob Green. On to 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers won the toss in overtime, but were pushed back to their 12 after 
drawing a holding call on the kickoff. Business as usual, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
Then on third and six from his 16, Tolliver went looking for that man Cox 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who already had cost the Chargers a chance at scoring a first-half 
touchdown with a personal foul at the Seattle 1, took a short pass from 
Tolliver and wrapped two hands around the ball before being hit by James 
Jefferson. Two hands, however, were not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for Arthur," offensive tackle Broderick Thompson said. "He just had a 
bad night." 
</P>
<P>
Some players, however, don't make as many mistakes in a career as Cox did in 
one important night. Cox fumbled again, the ball was recovered by Seattle 
linebacker Rufus Porter at the San Diego 23, and three plays later on came 
kicker Norm Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a lot more confident at the end of the game than at the beginning," 
Johnson said. "But it's like Coach Chuck Knox says, 'Luck is the residue of 
design.' " 
</P>
<P>
In other words, let the other team get the ball to Cox, and then force him to 
fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who had hit from 26 yards after a 36-yard miss in the first half, was 
good from 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"That obviously is a tough one to take," Coach Dan Henning said. "We should 
have been the ones letting the clock run down and kicking the field goal at the 
end of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Blame it on Cox. He is the Chargers' resident thug, and on most Sundays the 
team finds his extracurricular push and shoves endearing. 
</P>
<P>
Last week he drew a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness after kicking the 
defender who tackled him. Later, Henning all but defended him, saying Cox's 
indiscretion was no worse than what the Chiefs were doing. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second quarter against the Seahawks, Cox finally went too far even 
by Henning's standards. After Butts had been stopped for no gain at the Seattle 
one-yard line on first and goal, Cox was hit with a 15-yard penalty for a 
personal foul. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were shoved back to the Seattle 16-yard line, and had to 
eventually settle for a 3-0 lead on John Carney's 20-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Cox offered no explanation after the game because, as he has done all season, 
he refused to talk. Asked if he had received an explanation from Cox, Henning 
said, "No matter what happened he shouldn't be flagged for a personal foul. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody gets in his face or taunts him or whatever happened, we can't 
afford that. It puts us back into a position where we have to kick a field goal 
instead of getting a touchdown. I don't need an explanation; what I need is 
people that don't get 15-yard penalties." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks (5-6) took advantage of another Charger gift to tie the game 3-3 
at halftime. Chris Warren fumbled John Kidd's punt in the final minute of the 
second quarter, and Kidd recovered only to fumble the ball right back to the 
Seahawks at the San Diego 47-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle went ahead and cashed the turnover into a Johnson 26-yard field goal 
with five seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have that many turnovers you are going to be in trouble," Henning 
said. "We fought through it and we came back and then we got more turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had come back to break the 3-3 tie in the third quarter with a 
10-play drive covering 82 yards. Tolliver, who finished the game 15 for 22 for 
145 yards, completed four passes in a row on the drive, including an eight-yard 
touchdown strike to Cox on third and six. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys battled back; they've been doing that all year," Knox said. "We 
always try to strip the ball; we just haven't been getting it lately." 
</P>
<P>
They took it from Cox twice, however, and now while the Seahawks contemplate 
their playoff chances, the Chargers can make plans for next year. 
</P>
<P>
"One person doesn't win a game for you, and one person doesn't lose a game for 
you," cornerback Gill Byrd said. "I have faith in these guys. We'll bounce 
back. Coach Henning won't allow us not to bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
Said Butts: "We're not dead." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers stay home to tackle the Jets whom, like the Seahawks, they already 
have beaten this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This game will be a disappointing thing for this team and it's going to take a 
lot for them to muster it up and come back," Henning said. "I told them that 
this is going to be a big test for them. This game meant a lot."

MIAMI TO PROVIDE A MEASURE OF THE AZTECS; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO STATE: HOW FAR HAS PROGRAM COME? RIDING A FOUR-GAME WINNING STREAK, 
AZTECS FIND OUT SATURDAY AGAINST NO. 2 HURRICANES.

Miami is next. 
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked, national-championship contender Miami Hurricanes, that is. 
They're coming to a stadium near you, later this week . . . to play San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs carry a four-game winning streak, last year's memories and this 
year's frustration. Whether that will be enough will be determined Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The coaching already has begun -- a long time ago, according to SDSU Coach Al 
Luginbill. It started in the locker room after last year's 42-6 Miami victory. 
And this is what Luginbill says: The Aztecs will treat Miami no differently 
than Cal State Long Beach, or any other team on their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids will play hard," Luginbill said. "We've already talked to them about 
not getting caught up in who we play, but how we play." 
</P>
<P>
Still, when the No. 2-ranked team is up next, teams are usually pretty excited 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that is the mindset of this program regardless (of who SDSU is 
playing)," Luginbill said. "I think good football teams do that. As you win, 
you look forward to the next opponent even more than the previous game." 
</P>
<P>
With their 58-31 victory Saturday over Texas El Paso, the Aztecs (6-4, 5-2) 
clinched their second consecutive winning season, a feat SDSU has not 
accomplished since 1981-82. But the sense of accomplishment was tinged with 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
The letdown: Colorado State defeated Hawaii late Saturday night, 30-27, which 
means the Aztecs finish third in the Western Athletic Conference. A Hawaii 
victory would have dropped CSU into a tie for second with SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
Now, here comes Miami, in a game moved from an evening kickoff to a 1 p.m. 
start for national television (ESPN). 
</P>
<P>
Despite Luginbill's attempt to downplay the game, both he and SDSU players have 
used the words "bowl game" in conjunction with Miami. Because the Aztecs are 
out of bowl contention, they figure this is their bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill hopes the Aztecs learned their lesson in last year's drubbing at 
Miami. He said the Aztecs weren't able to wipe the awe out of their eyes until 
sometime in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"They jump on teams and say, 'Here, catch up,' " Luginbill said. "We need to be 
in the ballgame early. We have to focus from play one on. Denny (Erickson) does 
a great job of coaching, and they have great athletes who play the game 
extremely hard and with a lot of intensity and enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
With Dan McGwire at quarterback, a formidable offensive line and record-setting 
wide receivers Patrick Rowe and Dennis Arey, the Aztecs have confidence in 
their offense. What they need is a big play or two from their defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's going to come down to can we play defense against them," Luginbill 
said. "We've moved the football on everybody we've played. I don't want to take 
anything away from Miami -- they've got a great defense. But it's still going 
to come down to us playing defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They've proven they can play defense. We're trying our tail off to get to that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Schools such as SDSU insist they need to play a number of marquee-type games to 
improve their program. The Aztecs use the Miami game as a recruiting tool -- 
both to get athletes and to add luster to their program. 
</P>
<P>
"As we recruit, we ask ourselves, 'Can this individual line up and beat the 
University of Miami three years down the line?' " Luginbill said. "They're the 
pinnacle of college football. You don't know where your program stands unless 
you play them. I want to play them. People think I'm nuts . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, he added: "We've gotten kids in the last two years who we 
would not have gotten if Miami wasn't on our schedule. I know that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
With his eighth consecutive 100-yard receiving game, Patrick Rowe tied an NCAA 
record. But there was some bad blood between SDSU and Texas El Paso as 
Saturday's game ended. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, needing six yards to pass the 100-yard mark, took a short pass from Cree 
Morris during a UTEP blitz with 1:41 left and turned it into a 68-yard 
touchdown play. That increased SDSU's lead to 58-23. 
</P>
<P>
A UTEP player stayed down after the play near the 50-yard line and, according 
to SDSU Coach Al Luginbill, UTEP Coach David Lee started "screaming" at 
Luginbill while attending to the player. Apparently, Lee thought SDSU was 
running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hadn't really thought about it at the time," Luginbill said. "I didn't 
think it was anything indecent. Yeah, we scored, but they ran a blitz. What am 
I supposed to do, tell Cree to take a sack? I won't do that. Let's just say we 
won't have any problem getting ready to play them next year. They might have 
done us a favor." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill and Lee had more words after the game. Said Luginbill on Rowe's 
record: "I've never been into statistics, but I feel I owed it to the young 
man. That record may stand for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe needs just 26 yards to break the WAC record of 1,315 yards in a season set 
last year by New Mexico's Terance Mathis. . . . Rowe leads the nation's 
receivers with an average of 129 receiving yards per game. He is seventh in 
receptions, with an average of 6.2 catches a game, and eighth in all purpose 
running, at 157.8 yards a game. . . . Dennis Arey is fifth in the nation in 
receiving yards per game (101.7) and ninth in receptions per game (6.10). 
Quarterback Dan McGwire is third in passing efficiency (152.4) and fourth in 
total offense (334.5). 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the shuffle Saturday was T.C. Wright, who ran for 137 yards and two 
touchdowns on 14 carries. That's a season high for an SDSU running back. . . . 
Larry Maxey had 81 yards on 20 attempts. . . . Andy Trakas has made 11 
consecutive field goals and 13 of his last 15. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Gary Taylor dislocated two fingers and defensive lineman Eric 
Duncan suffered a bruised shoulder and a hip pointer against Texas El Paso, but 
Luginbill said neither should miss any practice time this week.

Philips Halts Picture Tube Plant: A unit of Dutch-based NV Philips, the giant 
consumer electronics firm, has postponed plans for a $116-million picture tube 
plant in Saline, Mich., blaming a sluggish U.S. economy. Philips, which is 
based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, recently announced that it lost $1.3 
billion in the third quarter and would lay off up to 45,000 of its 285,700 
employees worldwide. The company had planned to build the picture tube plant on 
117 acres and employ up to 400 people.

Lumber Lawsuits Reinstated: The state Court of Appeal in San Francisco 
reinstated two suits aimed at barring Pacific Lumber Co. from logging 456 acres 
of old-growth redwoods in Humboldt County. 
</P>
<P>
About half the acreage is within the company's 3,000-acre Headwaters Forest, 
which would have been turned into a state preserve had voters approved 
Propositions 128 and 130 on the November ballot. Both failed. The appellate 
court ruling sends the suits by the Sierra Club and the Environmental 
Protection Information Center back to Superior Court.

JAPAN'S TRADE SURPLUS WITH MOST ASIAN COUNTRIES IS INCREASING; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE: THEY MUST BUY JAPANESE PARTS FOR PRODUCTS THEY MAKE. SOME OF THEIR 
CURRENCIES HAVE GAINED AGAINST THE YEN, HURTING EXPORTS.

TAIPEI, Taiwan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dependence of Taiwan and other Asian countries on Japanese parts used in 
manufacturing hundreds of products has helped raise Japan's trade surpluses 
with almost all of those nations. 
</P>
<P>
Trade imbalances with Japan that declined fleetingly in 1987 and 1988 are once 
again steadily expanding, bringing home with new force Japan's position as 
"factory to the factories of Asia." 
</P>
<P>
The fact of economic life for Taiwan and most of Asia is that "we cannot do 
without the parts and components for our products that come from Japan," said 
Lei Daoyu, director of the Board of Foreign Trade of Taiwan's Ministry of 
Economic Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
For every television set that Taiwan manufactures, it imports a picture tube 
from Japan. For every air conditioner or refrigerator made here, compressors 
must be purchased from Japan. For every numerically controlled lathe, a 
computer control must be procured from Japan. Even bicycle gears must come from 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern is the same for South Korea, where even giant electronics firms do 
not produce all of the key components in their best-selling exports. Samsung 
Electronics, the world's No. 1 manufacturer of microwave ovens, for example, 
imports 15% of its microwave parts from Japan. Similarly, 10% of a Samsung 
color TV set and 29% of a Samsung videocassette recorder are Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, where small firms dominate the economy, the dependency is even 
greater. All but one of the top 100 items imported from Japan are industrial 
components, semi-finished products or raw materials for manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, countries not only depend upon Japan for components. A surge 
in Japanese investment is spurring imports of entire factories, as well, said 
Mikio Hoshino, deputy manager of the Taipei branch of Japan's Daiichi Kangyo 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the No. 1 recipient of Japanese direct investment, is experiencing 
the largest growth in its trade deficit with Japan this year -- more than 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the strength of Japan's manufacturers is the fact that their 
surpluses with both Taiwan and South Korea are growing despite a ban by both 
countries on imports of Japanese passenger cars, which make up more than 40% of 
Tokyo's surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If passenger car imports weren't banned, the surplus (with Taiwan) would be 
incredible," Hoshino said. 
</P>
<P>
When exports to Japan surged 53% in 1987 and 25% the following year, Taiwan 
thought that the days of its perennial red ink in trade with Japan might be 
ending. It was similar in South Korea. Economists started talking about Japan 
emerging as a new "market to the world," supplementing the old one -- the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Currency realignments, however, wiped out much of the price competitiveness 
that spurred the import boom in Japan. The result was that export growth to 
Japan from many of its Asian neighbors was blunted or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Among Asian nations, only Indonesia, from which the Japanese import large 
quantities of oil and other natural resources, enjoys a trade surplus with 
Japan. Malaysia, another major exporter of natural resources, is experiencing a 
slight reduction in its deficit with Tokyo this year. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Asia, deficits with Japan are growing between 15% and 50% -- even 
as Japan's global trade surplus, including its black ink with the United 
States, is declining. 
</P>
<P>
The surplus with Taiwan is heading toward a record $8 billion. With South 
Korea, it is threatening to exceed the 1987 peak of $5.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's deficit with Japan this year will be the equivalent of nearly $400 per 
capita, compared to the U.S. deficit with Japan of $118 per capita. (Japan's 
1990 surplus with the United States is heading toward $40 billion, a one-year 
reduction of $8 billion and a $20-billion decline from the peak in 1987.) 
</P>
<P>
In economic terms, Lei said, Taiwan has had little reason to be concerned about 
its trade deficits with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no disadvantage in importing from Japan," he said. "Our firms import 
components, process and assemble them, and export them, gaining profits from 
the value added in the process. It's been good business." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Taiwan has enjoyed trade surpluses with the United States that have 
paid for deficits with Japan two and three times over. It has accumulated more 
than $70 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves in the process. But now, 
Lei noted, the island's black ink with America is falling to the point that the 
surplus with the United States is in danger of being overtaken by the deficit 
with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
From a peak of $16 billion in 1987, Taiwan's surplus with the United States 
fell to $12 billion last year and is headed toward $9.4 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have promised the United States to reduce our bilateral surplus by 10% a 
year," Lei said. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea faces a far worse outlook. This year, its global trade will fall 
into red ink for the first time since 1985. Its projected $2-billion surplus 
with the United States won't make up for even half its deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
As with South Korea, Chinese memories of Japanese aggression during much of the 
first half of the century make the deficit with Japan a political problem, Lei 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we depend too much on imports from Japan, it upsets the feelings of the 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, that dependence is so great that if Taiwan manufactured key 
components at home, within five years "we could reduce our deficit with Japan 
by $5 billion a year," Lei said. That is precisely what the government intends 
to do, he added. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which four years ago undertook a government-promoted program to 
start manufacturing its own parts, provided the inspiration for that policy, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But if what has happened in South Korea is any indication, the Taiwanese 
program faces an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
Just this month, the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Seoul declared that 
South Korean manufacturers had "localized" 1,601 items the past four years, 
saving $3.5 billion a year in imports. But the ministry admitted that nearly 
1,800 items originally targeted for local manufacture were still being wholly 
or largely imported. It announced a new list of 232 more parts it wants to see 
"localized."

Both South Koreans and Taiwanese say the appreciation of their currencies 
against the Japanese yen has hurt their exports to Japan more than anything 
else. Now that the yen has started gaining value again, they hope that sales to 
Japan will pick up. 
</P>
<P>
But rapidly rising wages in both countries, as well as in many Southeast Asian 
nations, have created a new problem in their trade with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Brand-conscious consumers, who used to focus only on European labels, are 
beginning to turn to Japanese imports, despite high prices. 
</P>
<P>
"A Taiwan-made panty hose costs only 74 cents, while a Japanese product costs 
$3. But the Japanese panty hose doesn't tear and looks better. So women are 
willing to pay four times as much," said Daiichi Kangyo Bank's Hoshino. "Even 
Japanese-made cookies are becoming popular." 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, consumer interest in products from the newly industrializing 
economies evaporated when Japan's neighbors couldn't live up to quality 
expectations and failed to build either a brand image or an adequate service 
network for their products, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold Star videocassette recorders (from South Korea) sold well for awhile 
because the price was cheap. But once consumers discovered that the quality was 
poor and exchange rate adjustments drove up prices, they stopped buying," 
Hoshino said.

DEFUSING A TIME BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market has been taking no prisoners among financial stocks for about 
a year now. The assumption by investors is that every financial company is just 
a time bomb of decayed assets waiting to explode. 
</P>
<P>
In the ranks of alleged bombs that have yet to go off is Broad Inc., the Los 
Angeles-based life insurer and annuity giant. While the stock has been cut down 
to $3.875 a share now from $11.625 early in the year -- a 67% drop -- Broad 
last week reported fourth- quarter net income of 29 cents a share, up 16% from 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the full fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Broad earned $33.4 million, or $1.02 a 
share, compared to $26.1 million, or 80 cents, in its shortened (10-month) 
fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
So at $3.875 a share, Broad stock sells for just four times annual earnings and 
just 39% of stated book value per share -- the theoretical value of its assets 
if all debts were paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street can't argue with Broad's business. Through its nationwide 
SunAmerica subsidiary, Broad continues to do a brisk trade selling 
conservative, tax-deferred annuities, a retirement savings vehicle that's 
caught on big with baby boomer investors. 
</P>
<P>
But that sales success, and the earnings it has produced, continue to take a 
back seat to investors' paramount concern: How healthy is Broad's portfolio of 
investments -- the things it has purchased with its annuity investors' dollars? 
</P>
<P>
Broad argues that 50% of its $9.4-billion portfolio carries little or no credit 
risk. That half is invested mostly in U.S. Treasury securities and securities 
of U.S. government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Another 38% of the portfolio is in investments that Wall Street still considers 
of high quality, including top-rated corporate bonds and mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
The market's worry is about the 9.6% of Broad's portfolio invested in more 
speculative assets, including junk bonds and real estate. If that $911-million 
chunk of the portfolio were to become completely worthless, it would more than 
wipe out Broad's capital, leaving the firm bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
But not even the most pessimistic analysts expect every junk bond and every 
piece of real estate to become worthless. Far more realistic is that some 
percentage of the investments will fail, and that even those failures will pay 
back some of what they owe -- perhaps 30 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
What Broad is trying to show Wall Street is that the firm has been aggressively 
setting aside reserves for potential problems, and that it will continue to do 
so in 1991, to the tune of $40 million. Most significantly, even with those 
reserve set-asides, Chairman Eli Broad promises that his company will show net 
income growth of 20% to 25% in fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Eli Broad believes that he will have reserved enough by the end of 
1991 to fully insulate his portfolio from whatever other problems may develop 
after that. "We do not want to go into 1992 having to provide anything 
additional" to reserves, he says flatly. If he makes that goal, Broad Inc. 
could be well on its way by 1992 toward annual net income of $2 a share or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
At age 57, Eli Broad is no newcomer to the business of balancing risk and 
reward. He has been a savvy player in high finance for decades, and engineered 
the 1989 separation of Broad Inc. from home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad Inc. 
Yet Wall Street obviously doesn't completely trust Eli Broad's instincts, or 
Broad Inc. stock wouldn't be selling for a mere four times earnings per share. 
</P>
<P>
Investors clearly are concerned that Broad Inc.'s assets will deteriorate far 
more than what Eli Broad sees. And certainly, anything could happen if the 
economic slump deepens. Eli Broad says his firm has been "cherry-picking" the 
loan portfolios of troubled banks, buying solid commercial mortgage loans from 
banks in need of money. But a solid mortgage today might turn into a problem a 
year from now. There's no way to be 100% sure. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, many institutional shareholders in Broad Inc., such as 
Strong/Corneliuson Capital in Milwaukee, owner of 600,000 shares, say they've 
looked over the portfolio, and they're on Eli Broad's side. Yet, as Bill 
Corneliuson admits, "You ask yourself, 'Are we missing something, or is the 
market seeing something that all of we mortals don't see?' " 
</P>
<P>
One of Broad Inc.'s biggest problems is simply that it is based in L.A., home 
also to insurers First Capital Holdings and First Executive -- both of which 
were major junk bond investors. Broad "is being painted with the same brush," 
says Carl Lindberg, vice president at Wilmington, Del.-based Brandywine Asset 
Management. Lindberg says Brandywine has stuck with its 1.4 million Broad Inc. 
shares because "we've looked at it every which way" and concluded that the 
market has drastically overreacted. "We've torn our hair out on this," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If the market is right after all, no one will lose more than Eli Broad. He 
holds the bulk of the firm's non-traded Class B shares and this year has bought 
550,000 more shares of the common stock as it has sunk. Says analyst Frederick 
Wise at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York: "I think Eli Broad is a rational 
man. I don't think it would be in his interest to just throw money down the 
toilet." 
</P>
<P>

CLASSICAL INDIAN ART FORM COMES TO IRVINE

<P>
With a self-effacing modesty that is commendable or lamentable, depending on 
one's point of view, Ramya Harishankar, artistic director of the Arpana Dance 
Company, participated minimally in a program of Bharata Natyam, the classical 
dance idiom of southern India, by the company Friday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Essentially a school recital program that, however valuable for 
giving the more than 50 students stage experience, raised troubling questions 
about the propriety of presenting young dancers-in-training in this rich, 
difficult art form to a paying public. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the scope of the program, entitled "Uthsava: A Glorious 
Celebration," a survey of Indian festivals held throughout the calendar year, 
seemed unnecessarily ambitious. It could succeed in offering only a cursory 
view of these religious and social events since many of them are measured by 
days and nights. Even in a program lasting almost three hours, a sense of 
merely sampling the riches proved inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
When Harishankar did participate, she tended to minimize her involvement. In 
the inevitably sketchy presentation of the wondrous "Ramayana," for instance, 
she took the part of King Janaka, father of Sita, rather than the central role 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening prayer and invocation to Ganesha, as the beneficent goddess 
Lakshmi in the festival of lights ("Deepavali"), as the woman bereft of her 
beloved in the carnival of colors (the "Holi" festival) and as the mother of 
Lord Krishna in the birthday celebration of this incarnation of God, 
Harishankar emphasized the expressive aspects of the art form with earnest 
sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
These are elements communicated essentially through gestures, facial 
expressions and body postures, however, and do not involve rapid or complex 
footwork. While Bharata Natyam makes much of these elements, a program is 
usually balanced with more examples of pure dance as well. Harishankar herself 
did not offer such a piece until the "Thillana" at the very end of the program. 
</P>
<P>
As a dancer, she proved more lyric than dramatic, more spongy than crisp and 
explosive in movement, but admirable were her ability to isolate one part of 
the body from another and her effortless lightness in quick, sidestepping 
jumps. It would have been interesting to have seen more of her. 
</P>
<P>
The company of students, ranging from tots to teen-agers to women possibly in 
their early 20s, looked well-trained and disciplined. The unidentified woman 
who portrayed Rama seemed especially promising.

MAYALL PROVIDES A WELCOME DOSE OF AUTHENTICITY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a week of media immersion in Milli Vanilli's fudging, it was a relief to 
hunker down with some certified-honest goods Friday night at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. Real roots. Real guitars. Real harmonica. 
Real singing. Oh yes, and some lip-syncing. 
</P>
<P>
Lip-syncing!!! Et tu, Mayall? 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry, folks. The blues republic hasn't fallen. When it comes to 12-bar 
traditionalism, Mayall is still the noblest Briton of them all. This was honest 
lip-syncing -- a fun bit of musical ventriloquism in which guitarist Coco 
Montoya played a mouth-flapping Charlie McCarthy while his sweet Stratocaster 
made like Edgar Bergen. While his fingers elicited deep, masculine harrumphs 
and falsetto female protestations from the guitar, Montoya's lips silently 
mimicked a couple in the midst of an animated domestic tiff. 
</P>
<P>
The humor went down well with the near-capacity crowd, and so did the more 
serious, high-impact fretwork that Montoya displayed during the rest of his 
long solo spot. The fact that the guitarist got the biggest ovation of the 
nearly two-hour show called to mind another Mayall tradition: The bandleader's 
long career has been as much a forum for his guitar-hero sidemen as for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the latest Bluesbreakers lineup, which also includes bassist 
Freebo and a very solid drummer, Joe Yuele, has Mayall steppin' out a bit more 
than he did during the mid- to late '80s. During those years, Mayall's band was 
a five-piece with two dominant guitarists, Montoya and Walter Trout. The 
Huntington Beach-based Trout left in 1989 to front his own band full time. 
Rather than replace him, Mayall went on with a four-piece lineup, giving 
himself more room to move, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
Mayall, who turns 57 on Thursday, moved with plenty of good-natured vigor as he 
blew lots of harmonica, played some nice chingy-jangly rhythm guitar and took 
extended glides along his digital keyboard, which alternately sounded like an 
organ and a piano (not to mention some passable flute tones and some 
too-gimmicky ersatz sax). But the concert was mainly a low-keyed, easygoing 
affair that could have used more of a jolt. While it rolled along enjoyably, it 
lacked the searing, emotive moments that can turn a blues show from an amiable, 
toe-tapping night out into something more intense and revealing. 
</P>
<P>
The material may have had something to do with that. Mayall drew most of it 
from his current album, "A Sense of Place," a collection of swampy, down-home 
tunes with a prevailing back-porch blues feel. Having recently regained 
major-label status after a long spell of recording for small companies, Mayall 
clearly wasn't in a mood for looking back. He opened with "All Your Love," from 
the classic 1965 "Bluesbreakers" album, and closed with his signature 
harp-riffer, "Room to Move." In between, everything but Montoya's spotlight 
number was drawn from Mayall's two recent Island Records releases. That wasn't 
a real problem, because the material on "A Sense of Place" and the 1988 album, 
"Chicago Line," is varied and stands up well. But Mayall could have profitably 
resurrected one or two early songs in place of a number like "Congo Square," a 
voodoo-themed New Orleans piano strut that didn't come close to replicating the 
distinctive bounce and roll of such native New Orleans players as Art Neville 
and Dr. John. Mayall played to a stronger suit with the old-time barrelhouse 
piano style of "Send Me Down to Vicksburg." 
</P>
<P>
Mayall's singing also failed to summon up the psychological drama of the 
highest-intensity blues. With its high, reedy, cottony quality, Mayall's voice 
is distinctive enough to be readily identifiable, but it is far from trenchant. 
</P>
<P>
On "Sensitive Kind," in which the singer counsels another man to deal tenderly 
and considerately with women, Mayall's mild delivery made the advice sound 
temperate, almost fatherly. It was left to Montoya to raise the emotional 
stakes. After underscoring the tender mood, and women's sadness, with 
cushioned, string-massaging tones, he moved to taut, rapid runs that elevated 
the drama. 
</P>
<P>
Mayall's encore offered a nice treat: a guitar duet (as opposed to duel) 
between Montoya and Debbie Davies, whose band had opened with a solid hour 
given mainly to blues standards that showcased her clean, nimble guitar style. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya and Davies live together, and they played together with fine 
responsiveness. At one point, the left-handed Montoya let loose with a flying 
speed run. In many circumstances, the next player up would take that as a 
challenge, a feat to be duplicated or outdone. Instead, Davies chose to play 
something contrasting and complementary -- some chunky, rhythmic Chuck Berry 
licks. The interlude ended with a tandem harmony passage that made you think 
that love really is grand, especially when two sharp guitar players are 
expressing it together. 
</P>
<P>
Having gotten Vanilli goo all over itself, the recording arts academy that runs 
the Grammy Awards would do well to look toward Mayall for a much-needed helping 
of musical authenticity. In the quite possible event that "A Sense of Place" is 
nominated in the category of best contemporary blues recording, the Grammys 
should can the lip-sync brigade and turn over a good chunk of its telecast to 
Mayall and his eminent alumni association (the leading lights being Eric 
Clapton, Mick Taylor, Peter Green, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood). Since 1990 
marks the 25th anniversary of "Bluesbreakers," the first great blues-rock 
guitar album, it would make a lot of sense.

COLLEGE GALLERY EXHIBIT HAD A HUE OF IMPROPRIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to everyday dirty dealing, the art world may not rival the 
savings and loan industry or Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk bond group. But 
shady stuff goes on anyway, whether the financial stakes are large or small. 
</P>
<P>
Some art writers become shameless hired guns, touting gallery shows they 
privately could not care less about in exchange for some badly needed cash. 
Some dealers have been known to purposely inflate demand for certain artists' 
work by announcing that only a few pieces are available. Some museum people 
have been criticized for relying on the same handful of art dealers in putting 
together shows that are supposed to be removed from marketplace concerns. 
</P>
<P>
And on and on it goes. In a sphere so dependent on the whims of fashion and so 
mysterious to the average viewer and buyer, it's no wonder that not everything 
is what it appears to be. Still, standards do exist, and upstanding folks in 
the art world normally take pains to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
So perhaps you can imagine how startling it was to read the following, in a 
press release issued last month by Saddleback College in Mission Viejo to 
announce a college art gallery exhibit of graphic works by Ed Ruscha: 
</P>
<P>
"According to Mark Moore (owner) of the Works Gallery, who curated the show, 
Ruscha is one of America's most important contemporary artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Moore elected to limit this exhibition to works dating from 1987 because 
'beginning in 1987 Ruscha started experimenting with a new style, shadow 
imagery, that has solidified his position in art history. His work is now more 
interpretive, romantic and universal. It is also much deeper.' 
</P>
<P>
"Moore considers the "That Is Right" portfolio to be the 'finest print ever 
done by Ruscha. In concept and execution, it is a unique idea in 12 component 
parts.' " 
</P>
<P>
Whoa! What goes on here? A commercial gallery dealer has curated a show for a 
college gallery of works he sells? (Out of 14 prints in the exhibit, including 
the 12-part "That Is Right" portfolio, 12 were lent by the gallery.) 
</P>
<P>
Curating an exhibit means determining its theme and purpose, and selecting the 
actual pieces to be shown. In a museum setting, curating also usually involves 
writing an explanatory statement that goes on the wall or in the catalogue. 
Although curators do a lot of grunt work -- record-keeping, paper shuffling, 
cajoling and fund raising -- their most important role is scholarly: assembling 
works of art that present a specific viewpoint about a particular style, artist 
or historical period. 
</P>
<P>
Curators may reap prestige from a good show, of course, as well as such 
pragmatic benefits as good will from the lenders of the art, trustees and 
sponsors. No curator working in a museum, however, is supposed to be in a 
position to gain financially from an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
But here is Moore acting as both the presumably "disinterested" curatorial 
authority for the show ("the finest print ever done by Ruscha . . .") and the 
guy who gets to take a cut of the sales price. That's like the art world's 
version of an "infomercial," that peculiar cable TV phenomenon in which what 
appears to be a regular program is really a commercial for a particular 
product. 
</P>
<P>
Now, to be sure, Ruscha is an important, well-known and successful California 
artist for whom an exhibit (which closed Nov. 16) at Saddleback College Art 
Gallery represents the tiniest blip in a career studded with major shows. 
Saddleback needs Ruscha much more than Ruscha needs Saddleback. But Saddleback 
doesn't need an art show in the form of blatant horn-blowing for a particular 
commercial entity. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted recently in the gallery, however, director Patricia Boutelle didn't 
see what was amiss. 
</P>
<P>
She explained that when another exhibit planned as an Orange County Festival of 
Britain event fell through, time constraints obliged her to cobble something 
together in a hurry. She said she decided to put together an exhibit 
specifically for printmaking and drawing students on campus, whose primary 
concern is technical, "how-to" stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But then, why choose Ruscha, whose paintings and prints are important because 
of the witty way the artist expresses ideas through words and stylized, minimal 
imagery? The reason Ruscha is so valued as an artist is that he has hit on 
wonderfully apt formats to express his ideas, not because he's a whiz at doing 
pebbled backgrounds or superimposed words and images. 
</P>
<P>
Boutelle said she hoped instructors would also discuss the meaning of Ruscha's 
art with the students. (There was no information on the works at the gallery; a 
notebook held copies of old and not particularly relevant articles about 
Ruscha's work.) 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, the point was to "bring the work of a major contemporary artist to the 
college," Boutelle said, and "expose (the students) to people having big shows 
in L.A." But she needed help. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know where to go to get the work. Mark had the contacts I didn't 
have." So she let him pick the pieces for the show. "I was pleased to get the 
pieces we did." 
</P>
<P>
She claims it was OK because the gallery didn't hide the fact that Moore 
curated the show. But the fact remains that she permitted a commercial entity 
to wield the kind of power that belongs by right only to disinterested parties. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter whether any sales were rung up (potential buyers were told to 
get in touch with the gallery directly). It doesn't matter if nobody from the 
non-student population except this critic ever saw the show. It just looks bad. 
Art and commerce are close enough already without marrying them once again in 
such an inappropriate setting.

SHOWMANSHIP ECLIPSES ARTISTRY IN VASARELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LEAH OLLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the Vasarely cuff links, the Vasarely wristwatches, before the 
mass-produced Vasarely serigraphs and acrylic sculpture, there was a Vasarely 
of more humble intentions. Before the flamboyant visual gymnastics, there was a 
gentle stretching of the boundaries, a limbering of the optical muscles, a 
prodding of convention and expectation. 
</P>
<P>
The current exhibition of Victor Vasarely's work at Circle Gallery (2501 San 
Diego Ave., through Dec. 3) shows us both the artist and the athlete, but it is 
the latter, the showman, who prevails and casts a dishonorable shadow across 
the entire oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian-born artist, now in his 80s, is featured in a series of 
exhibitions at four Circle Gallery branches across the country. Collectively 
titled "Victor Vasarely: A Retrospective Exhibition/Selections From 50 Years of 
Artistic Achievement," the shows can be seen in New York, San Francisco and Los 
Angeles, in addition to the show in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
Vasarely moved to Paris in 1930 and began to experiment with geometric 
abstraction while working in advertising. Not until after the war, however, did 
he resume his interest in the illusory spatial effects he could muster through 
the basic tools of line and color. 
</P>
<P>
Several series of drawings from the early 1950s, on view in the local show, 
possess a fresh, spirited approach to line. Among them are the "Denfert" period 
drawings, inspired by the cracked tiles in a train station that the artist 
frequented, in which organic shapes embrace and overlap with modest but 
appealing energy. The "Naissance" series ventures further into the realm of 
illusion and suggestion, terrain that Vasarely has since exhausted mercilessly. 
In these early works, the artist has filled each page with parallel lines that 
dip or buckle toward the center of the image. The detour is often slight, but 
enough of a deviation to imply movement and depth on the static, flat page. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings and collages that follow immediately after these works are 
equally unpretentious. They play with the ambiguity of positive and negative 
space, the secret depth of flat shadows, the power of repetition and echo. But, 
by the 1960s, Vasarely had all but discarded the subdued tones and organic 
origins of his early work for images of a tightly controlled geometry in a 
range of searingly bright colors. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts to make the flat surface breathe, to coerce straight lines into the 
appearance of curves and to make the static page feel animated and alive gave 
birth to a popular style coined Op Art (short for Optical Art) in the early 
'60s. The delightful infidelities of line and color have preoccupied the artist 
ever since. His tour de force paintings and prints of the past few decades 
feature patterns of circles, squares and diamonds that, through their spacing 
and coloration, create the illusion of bulging, pulsating, stretching forms. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, these highly synthetic-seeming exercises were inspired, according 
to Vasarely's writings, by the natural world, with its still, stable surface 
concealing a microcosmic beehive of activity. Since the early line drawings and 
collages, however, nothing in the artist's signature style even hints of the 
organic. Their artificially vivid greens, oranges and purples, as well as their 
seamless surfaces, reveal as little of the human hand as of the human soul. 
</P>
<P>
The Circle Gallery show does contain a few pleasant surprises, even in the 
later work -- such as the simple but engaging collage, "Elo" of 1989 -- but the 
bulk of Vasarely's art is merely dazzling and dry.

A Washington lawyer and his male businessman lover filed a potentially landmark 
court case today trying to become the first homosexuals to get married legally 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After being spurned by the local marriage bureau a week ago when they sought a 
marriage license, lawyer Craig Dean, 27, and Patrick Gill, 23, a corporate 
manager, filed a law suit seeking to force issuance of a license. 
</P>
<P>
Holding hands outside the Superior Courthouse where they filed the lawsuit 
asking $1.25 million in damages from the city government, they told a news 
conference that they want the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage experts said there are no legally sanctioned marriages between males 
or females in the United States, where in recent years many homosexual couples 
have gone through symbolic "marriage" ceremonies conducted by church officials 
but without the legally binding license.

Commuter traffic backed up for miles on icy roads today after a weekend deluge 
sank a floating bridge across Lake Washington, which separates Seattle's 
eastern suburbs from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it could have been worse, the Washington State Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Most commuters were aware the Interstate 90 bridge was closed and got an early 
start, patrol communications supervisor Vickie Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really not as bad as we thought it would be," she said. But, she added, 
"It was pretty much gridlocked earlier this morning." 
</P>
<P>
About 2,100 feet of the 2-mile-long Mercer Island floating bridge sank into the 
lake Sunday after a weekend of high winds and record rains. The bridge, next to 
the year-old I-90 floating bridge, was being renovated for eventual use as 
I-90's eastbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the new bridge will probably be closed for weeks. As the main 
link between Seattle and its suburbs east of the lake, the bridge normally 
handles 110,000 cars a day. 
</P>
<P>
Freezing temperatures overnight caused icy roads, which resulted in numerous 
fender-benders, Crawford said. No serious injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Metro, the regional transit agency, added extra buses to try to ease the 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters started to back down today after the weekend storm left thousands 
of people scrambling for higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty rivers overflowed their banks and high-water marks for five of them set 
records. Rainfall set records too, with 5.82 inches in Olympia and 3.56 inches 
at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport during the 24 hours ending Saturday 
afternoon.

Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist prime minister in the East Bloc, 
resigned today along with his government, a day after his crushing presidential 
election defeat, state radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki lost his chance to compete in a runoff election in two weeks when he 
finished third in Sunday's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
The first- and second-place finishers were Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and 
political neophyte Stanislaw Tyminski, a millionaire businessman who returned 
to the country after a 21-year absence. The two will face each other in a 
runoff contest on Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
With Mazowiecki's resignation, a new prime minister presumably will be 
nominated by the new president. Parliament must approve the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Before announcing his resignation, Mazoweicki vowed to continue "the struggle 
for a democracy as we want it." But he added: "I am afraid I expect a period of 
chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Tyminski taunted Walesa at a packed news conference, at which he 
said he aimed for victory in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be in first place, obviously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, asked if he will carry out his pre-election threat not to run in the 
Dec. 9 runoff against Tyminski, said: "I must say that I am hesitating. I would 
like not to run, but one has to think over what is good for Poland." 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial results from all 49 provinces except Warsaw, issued by the 
government news agency PAP, showed Walesa with 39.96% of the vote, followed by 
Tyminski with 23.1%. Mazowiecki managed only 18.08%. The rest went to a handful 
of minor contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski campaigned on a promise to create "a democracy of money." 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take my jacket off, roll my sleeves up and go to work to make 
this country rich," he told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa told reporters in Gdansk that the challenger is not a "serious man" but 
admitted that Tyminski's success shows that Poles have a lot to learn about 
democracy.

DENVER AIRPORT FIRE STILL BURNS, IS LESS INTENSE

A blaze feeding off more than 1.6 million gallons of jet fuel burned unchecked 
at Stapleton International Airport today but appeared to diminish in intensity 
as two of three ruptured tanks burned themselves out. 
</P>
<P>
Fears that a fourth tank, which had sprung a leak and was buckling, might 
rupture eased by late morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are going real, real good. The intensity has dropped dramatically," 
said Fire Department spokesman Nick Nuanes, adding that firefighters are moving 
closer to the tanks as the intensity tapers off. 
</P>
<P>
Flight delays caused by a fuel shortage wrenched thousands of travelers 
hurrying home from their Thanksgiving visits Sunday, but replacement fuel is 
being trucked in today to make up for the fuel lost in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze erupted Sunday morning and engulfed two tanks containing 400,000 
gallons of fuel each. It exploded from huge to gigantic later that night when 
an 800,000-gallon tank became overheated, ruptured and ignited. 
</P>
<P>
The two smaller tanks largely burned themselves out today, but the 
800,000-gallon tank continued to burn. Fire officials said the tank contains 
enough fuel to burn until about midday Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth tank containing 350,000 gallons of fuel was leaking fuel from the 
bottom and the fuel was erupting into flames, but the tank was not expected to 
rupture as authorities had feared earlier. In all, the tank farm contains 12 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday after Thanksgiving traditionally is Stapleton's busiest day of the 
year. The tanks had been filled Saturday night in anticipation of heavy holiday 
air traffic, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused flight delays, because of refueling difficulties, and traffic 
jams. Stapleton is the nation's fourth-busiest airport in terms of passenger 
volume.

JAPANESE WOMEN'S PAPER SOFT ON FEMINISM

<TEXT>
<P>
With a shocking-pink picture of Tokyo's skyline gracing its front page, Japan's 
first newspaper designed for women -- Lady Kong -- hit the newsstands today 
with lots of fluff but little feminism. 
</P>
<P>
As with virtually all enterprises here, men run the daily tabloid, leading some 
critics to complain that the publication is not likely to challenge the 
subservient role of women in Japanese society. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything, even sanitary napkins, has been planned and produced by men," said 
Harueko Kato, a communications professor at Tokyo Women's Christian University. 
"And news coverage is not an exception." 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid's name refers to King Kong's girlfriend. The name apparently is 
meant to show that women are strong, too. 
</P>
<P>
Kato believes that the most important aspect of the new daily newspaper will be 
"how the opinions of the female employees are reflected in the decision-making 
and news writing." 
</P>
<P>
That will depend to a large extent on Masahiro Oshima, the 41-year-old man who 
is the tabloid's editorial director. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven of the 47 editors and reporters on his staff are women, but they 
are in charge of only the entertainment and city guide sections. 
</P>
<P>
The company specifically recruited male writers to work in the news department, 
Oshima explained, "to give news stories a serious tone." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the radical image the tabloid is cultivating with its odd name and its 
advertisements suggesting greater independence for women, there appears to be 
little emphasis on feminism and social issues. 
</P>
<P>
The leading headline on the splashy front page was a call for Tokyo's commuter 
trains to extend operations a few hours each night to 2 a.m. for the benefit of 
people who stay out late drinking and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 80-cent newspaper, which describes itself in English as a 
"newsy tabloid for Tokyoites," reads like a typical fashion magazine with a few 
pages of news slapped onto the front. 
</P>
<P>
The first edition included a series of interviews with female business 
executives, as well as a soft-porn story titled "Honest Legs," gossip items and 
entertainment news. 
</P>
<P>
Oshima says he had wanted to carry more features on social issues but that a 
six-month marketing research program led him to reduce stories on politics, 
business, women's issues and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese women are not ready for such a progressive paper. . . . I was quite 
disappointed to discover that," he said in a recent interview.

JUSTICES LET FAIR-HOUSING SUITS STAND; 
</P>

SUPREME COURT: THE CASES CENTER ON NEWSPAPER ADS IN THE WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA 
THAT USED ONLY WHITES AS MODELS.

<P>
The Supreme Court today refused to kill two fair-housing lawsuits that stem 
from newspaper real estate advertisements showing only white models posing as 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that forces developers of a 
Virginia condominium community to defend themselves in a jury trial against 
allegations they violated federal law. 
</P>
<P>
The suits center on ads that appeared in the Washington Post over a 17-month 
period beginning in 1985 for Colonial Village, a condo community in Arlington, 
Va., just across the Potomac River from the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The suits were filed by Girardeau Spann, a black resident of Washington who is 
a professor at Georgetown University's law school, and two advocacy groups -- 
the Metropolitan Washington Planning and Housing Assn. and the Fair Housing 
Council of Greater Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Named as defendants are Colonial Village Inc. and its parent firm, Mobil Land 
Development Corp., a subsidiary of the huge oil company. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits allege that the defendants violated the Fair Housing Act by 
featuring only white models in ads that appeared in the Post. The suits said 
the ads were racially preferential and discriminatory, and they sought an 
injunction and monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
A federal trial judge in 1987 threw out the suits, ruling that they had been 
filed too late. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here reinstated them last March 13, and 
sent the dispute back to U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene for trial. 
</P>
<P>
In the appeals acted on today, the justices were urged to dismiss the suits for 
several reasons. The appeals said applying the Fair Housing Act to bar the use 
of six ads showing 10 human models would violate free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Colonial Village Inc. argued that the appeals court ruling "in 
effect sent the case back for a jury trial based on nothing more than the 
appearance . . . of a handful of ads in which pictures of black models happened 
not to be included." 
</P>
<P>
The appeal added: "With no evidence of discriminatory intent being required, 
Colonial's facially neutral ads may now subject it to liability if a jury in 
the District of Columbia finds that they can be read as racially preferential 
or discriminatory." 
</P>
<P>
All the disputed ads contained an Equal Housing Opportunity logo reflecting the 
developer's compliance with fair housing laws. 
</P>
<P>
In another action today, the court refused to kill an affirmative action 
program in Florida aimed at awarding more public works contracts to businesses 
run by minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by companies that said the 
Tampa-area program is unconstitutional because it condones reverse 
discrimination against white men.

Midway Airlines Inc. said today that it agreed to delay closing on the planned 
sale of its Philadelphia operations to archrival USAir Group Inc. to give the 
Justice Department more time to review the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based Midway announced in October that it would sell its costly 
Philadelphia expansion to USAir, the nation's seventh-biggest carrier, for 
$64.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We initially had indicated we thought the transaction would be completed 
before the first of December. . . . It now appears it will take a little 
longer," a Midway spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was expected to face tough antitrust scrutiny since it would give 
USAir, already the largest operator in Philadelphia, more landing slots, 
authority for routes to Toronto and Montreal, 11 gates and other facilities.

Chris Stals, the South African Reserve Bank governor, said today the country's 
economy is comfortably managing its foreign debt burden, but he ruled out any 
short-term adjustments in the financial rand system or other restrictive 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is more relaxed about its foreign debt position than we have been 
for years," Stals told the international Euromoney Conference in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
"The balance of payments position is comfortable and should, at least for the 
time being, present no serious problems. We remain cautious, however, not to 
relax on the existing restrictive policies . . . too soon." 
</P>
<P>
Stals recalled the debt crisis sparked in 1985 when foreign banks refused to 
roll over outstanding loans as punishment for South Africa's apartheid 
policies.

Philippine economic growth slowed sharply in the first nine months of 1990, 
with manufacturing output growth slumping to under half its 1989 level, the 
government's statistics bureau said today. 
</P>
<P>
Confirming a sharp downturn in the economy, the National Statistical 
Coordination Board said growth in real gross domestic product fell to 2.8% in 
the first nine months of the year, against 5.6% in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, which suffered serious production setbacks in the 
second and third quarters because of electric power shortages, grew by just 
2.5% during the period, against 6.07% in 1989.

African coffee-producing countries have lost more than $1.6 billion since the 
collapse 15 months ago of the International Coffee Agreement -- the industry's 
price cartel, a top Kenyan official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Opening a five-day meeting of the Inter-African Coffee Organization in Nairobi, 
Kenyan Vice President George Saitoti said African economies had been affected 
greatly by the losses because of their heavy reliance on agriculture as a 
source of foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Africa was worst hit, he said, but no coffee-producing country in the world 
benefited from the onset of a free market. 
</P>
<P>
"The lifting of quotas has led to increased export volumes which has caused 
considerable buildup of stocks in consumer countries, leading to the 40% drop 
in coffee prices," Saitoti told the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
He called on African producers to address themselves collectively to their 
joint problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Barkley, star forward of the Philadelphia 76ers, has apologized for a 
postgame quip that women's groups claimed made sport of wife-beating, a club 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who said the remarks were meant as a joke, was quoted as saying after 
a tough Nov. 3 win over the underdog New Jersey Nets that "this is a game that 
if you lose, you go home and beat your wife and kids. 
</P>
<P>
Did you see my wife jumping up and down at the end of the game? That's because 
she knew I wasn't going to beat her." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a reporter at the time if he wanted to reconsider the statement, 
Barkley replied, "Nah, print it." 
</P>
<P>
The comment, reported nationally, aroused the ire of battered women's groups in 
Philadelphia and Los Angeles, prompting the apology.

NFL MONDAY REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
THE LEAGUE MAY LUCK OUT IN THE LONG RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To put the NFL's Black Sunday in perspective: 
</P>
<P>
* Would it have been a surprise if someone predicted at the start of the season 
that the Giants would lose in Philadelphia, the Bears would lose in Minnesota 
and the Rams would beat the 49ers at Candlestick, where they had won three of 
the last five? 
</P>
<P>
* If the Giants and 49ers had lost in Week 3, next Monday night's meeting 
between two 10-1 teams would have been almost as big as if the teams were both 
11-0. 
</P>
<P>
* How much do those losses really matter to the Bears, Giants and 49ers when 
they all need little more than one more victory in five weeks to clinch their 
divisions? 
</P>
<P>
"They're still chasing us," the Giants' Bill Parcells said after his 10-0 team 
crashed and burned, 31-13, at the hands of the Eagles, who have now won five of 
their last six over New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the truck hit me I just stood there and watched," Mike Ditka said after 
his Bears were crushed 41-13 in Minnesota. "I wasn't worried about getting up. 
That's part of life." 
</P>
<P>
The day gave credence to the theory of that it's not being hot that puts you in 
the playoffs, it's being hot at the right time. The Eagles now have won five 
straight and the Vikings four straight after awful starts. Philadelphia should 
be the first NFC wild-card and Minnesota now has a good shot. 
</P>
<P>
What all this means in the long run is that the NFL may luck out, getting teams 
into its expanded playoffs that deserve to be there. 
</P>
<P>
In the NFC, you can pencil in the 49ers, Bears, Giants and Eagles (No. 1 wild 
card), then select from the Redskins, Packers, Vikings and perhaps the Saints 
for the other spot. 
</P>
<P>
In the AFC, mark in Buffalo, Miami, Kansas City and the Raiders plus the winner 
of the Central Division where Pittsburgh and Cincinnati are tied at 6-5 with 
Houston half a game behind going into tonight's game with Buffalo. The last 
wild-card team most likely will also come from the Central. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs' victory over the Raiders on Sunday gives them the ultimate 
tie-breaker (two wins in head-to-head meetings) should they tie for the 
division title. The AFC East should come down to the Dec. 23 Miami-Buffalo game 
in Buffalo (the Dolphins won the first meeting).

HANKS POOH-POOHS GRIPES OVER FILMING OF 'BONFIRE OF VANITIES'

Tom Hanks says the much-ballyhooed protests that accompanied filming of the 
soon-to-be released movie "The Bonfire of the Vanities" were overblown efforts 
to horn in on the act. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing much really happened," Hanks says in the Winter issue of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, it was 'Bonfire' we were shooting . . . so there were a lot of 
people who had a very great interest in it and wanted to get their two cents 
worth in," Hanks said. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie based on Tom Wolfe's novel of the same name, Hanks plays Wall 
Street bond salesman Sherman McCoy, who is thrust into the New York court 
system after he accidentally kills a black youth. 
</P>
<P>
During filming in May, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer objected to a 
Bronx courthouse being used for filming, complaining that the movie unfairly 
painted the area as dangerous. He tried to get Warner Bros. to add a 
disclaimer.

Giuseppe Tornatore remembers his low point. 
</P>
<P>
A film on which he had worked for years closed after a few days. Friends were 
politely suggesting a career change. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of committing suicide, I wrote a new film," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after that dark period, the 34-year-old Tornatore is being hailed as 
Italy's hottest new director in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The film that flopped in 1988, "Cinema Paradiso," went on to win him an Oscar 
in 1990. And the movie written "in a moment of my life in which things were 
bad" is being released in a moment in which things couldn't be better. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has gone so well," said the grinning, baby-faced director, his eyes 
sparkling behind horn-rimmed glasses. "I'm sorry there was so much delay." 
</P>
<P>
Two years after its dismal debut, "Cinema Paradiso" is alive and well in 
Italian cinemas, and has drawn crowds in Europe, Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the question is whether Tornatore can succeed again, and prove himself an 
heir to Federico Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci and other great Italian 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
His new film, "Stanno Tutti Bene" (They're All Fine), has just been released in 
Italy and is due to open in the United States in February. 
</P>
<P>
It tells of an elderly man's journey through Italy to visit his five widely 
scattered children, whom he wants to reunite for a dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The father, played by Marcello Mastroianni, is chagrined to discover that his 
children have drifted from him and have hidden their failures at work and in 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make a film about the difficulty there is today in personal 
communication," Tornatore said. 
</P>
<P>
While the film displays Tornatore's keen eye for the Italian character and for 
day-to-day human comedy, it is more melancholy than "Cinema Paradiso," a 
semiautobiographical tale of a child enraptured by the silver screen.

Actor Alain Delon, the heartthrob and screen tough guy who has dominated French 
film for more than three decades, sold 32 paintings at a Paris auction Sunday 
for a total of $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Delon sold his most valuable painting of the day, a 1910 Modigliani portrait of 
a young woman, for $1.2 million, the Drouot auction house said. 
</P>
<P>
The entire sale, including works by other art lovers, fetched $18 million, with 
the most expensive painting, Picasso's "The Yellow Belt," going for about $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Delon has said he is selling part of his collection to pay for his March 25 
purchase, with French steel magnate Francis Bouygues, of Modigliani's 
record-breaking "The Pretty Shopkeeper," sold for $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an act of madness. She ("The Pretty Shopkeeper") seduced me, and was 
certainly the most expensive woman of my life," Delon said.

TOP 10 NET $100+ MILLION OVER HOLIDAY; 
</P>
<P>
BOX OFFICE: NO. 1 'HOME ALONE' TAKES IN $30 MILLION. 'LITTLE LADY' DEBUTS IN 
SECOND PLACE AND 'ROCKY V' TAKES A TUMBLE.

<P>
Hollywood had much to be thankful for over the Thanksgiving holiday period. Led 
by the startling second-week performance of 20th Century-Fox's family comedy, 
"Home Alone" -- which had five-day receipts of an estimated $30 million -- the 
top 10 films delivered $100-million plus to the coffers. 
</P>
<P>
But if the news was good overall, the figures -- which represented ticket sales 
for Wednesday through Sunday -- also reflected disappointing returns for 
certain titles. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, MGM-UA's "Rocky V" -- which opened last weekend to $14 million 
and second place -- tumbled 44% in its second weekend. With five-day receipts 
of approximately $11.8 million, it ranked fifth for the holiday period. 
</P>
<P>
And although Touchstone Pictures' "Three Men and a Little Lady" debuted with 
earnings of about $19.2 million -- for second place -- some industry observers 
wondered if a portion of its family-oriented audience hadn't been kidnapped by 
"Home Alone." 
</P>
<P>
Another just-out sequel, Fox's "Predator II" -- which this time finds the alien 
killer on the prowl in Los Angeles -- came in third, with approximately $14.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Orion Pictures' western epic, "Dancing With Wolves" -- previously in limited 
release -- widened to 1,048 screens for receipts of $12.6 million and fourth 
place. That's an impressive figure, considering the film's three-hour running 
time, which limits the number of daily screenings. 
</P>
<P>
But the most impressive numbers went to "Home Alone," which jumped 
approximately 27% in ticket sales in its second weekend. Its per-screen average 
also shot up from $14,211 in its opening weekend to approximately $17,000. 
After just two weeks, the $15-million comedy about an 8-year-old (played by 
Macaulay Culkin) who is inadvertently left on his own during the Christmas 
holidays, has earned more than $45 million. Its surprise performance had Fox 
executives crowing, and executives at competing studios acknowledging a lively 
marketing campaign led by a show-stopping trailer. Also applauded was Fox's 
decision to open the film ahead of much of the holiday pack -- especially 
"Three Men and a Little Lady," which vies for some of the same audience. 
</P>
<P>
As for those films which rounded out the top 10, they are, in estimated 
figures: "The Rescuers Down Under" (Disney), $5.2 million, sixth place; "Ghost" 
(Paramount Pictures), $4.5 million, seventh; "Child's Play II" (Universal 
Pictures), $4.3 million, eighth; "Jacob's Ladder" (Tri-Star Pictures), $2.8 
million, ninth; "White Palace" (Universal), $1.7 million, 10th.
