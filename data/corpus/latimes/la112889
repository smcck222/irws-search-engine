SATELLITE'S FALL POSES LITTLE RISK, NASA SAYS

The defunct Solar Max satellite is expected to fall from orbit Friday, and 
while chunks of the spacecraft may survive the fiery re-entry, the risk of 
injury or damage from the debris is "very small," NASA officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,000-pound sun observatory, which cost $80 million to build in 1978, had 
been expected to fall Wednesday, but the North American Aerospace Defense 
Command, which is tracking the satellite, revised its estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be the first of December, plus or minus a day," said a NORAD spokesman 
in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Solar Max will break apart somewhere over an area between 28 degrees north and 
28 degrees south of the Equator, a path that is mostly over ocean but also 
covers large parts of Florida, Texas, Mexico, Central and South America and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel there will be debris, but we don't know how big the pieces will be," 
said Randee Exler of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "We 
feel the risk to people is very small." 
</P>
<P>
The satellite could have been lifted into a higher, more stable orbit by a 
space shuttle, but tight budgets and an equally tight shuttle schedule 
precluded such a rescue mission. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, mission controllers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, near 
Washington, jettisoned the satellite's solar panels, which provided power to 
recharge its batteries. 
</P>
<P>
"The spacecraft is dead," Exler said.

Israeli troops forced their way into a U.N. clinic in the occupied Gaza Strip 
and tried to arrest a Palestinian receiving emergency treatment for a serious 
gunshot wound, a U.N. spokeswoman said. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency 
spokeswoman said the soldiers beat two employees at the clinic in the Bureij 
refugee camp and may have suffered broken bones. The 18-year-old Palestinian, 
identified as Mohammed Hisham Nasser, was brought to the clinic suffering from 
an army bullet wound in the upper arm which had apparently severed an artery, 
she added.

The two daily newspapers in Detroit launched their long-delayed partial merger, 
as union and management officials resumed contract talks. Publishers of the 
Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News said they expected to reach an 
agreement with five of the newspapers' six unions by a 12:01 a.m. Thursday 
strike deadline. The press operators' Graphics Communications International 
Union ratified a contract Sunday. Union members are seeking raises totaling 
$110 a week during the 2 1/2-year contract, plus a three-week pay bonus, said 
Louis Mleczko, president of Local 22 of the Newspaper Guild. The average weekly 
salary of all workers at the two newspapers, excluding benefits, is about $570.

A truck driver testified a pickup driven by an alleged drunk driver missed his 
vehicle while going the wrong way on an interstate highway before slamming into 
a church bus, killing 27 people in May, 1988. James Thom, a truck driver from 
St. Charles, Ill., said the bus was "blazing furiously" soon after it was 
struck by Larry Mahoney's pickup. Thom, testifying during the third day of 
Mahoney's trial in Carrollton, said he snatched some of the children from the 
burning bus amid "a constant barrage of screams." Mahoney, 36, is charged with 
27 counts of murder in the case. He also is charged with 12 counts of 
first-degree assault, 42 counts of wanton endangerment and one count of drunk 
driving.

FRIENDS SAY SLAIN MOTHER DROVE SON OVER THE EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: AN ESCONDIDO MAN HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDERING HIS MOTHER, BUT SOME

<P>
As 41-year-old Tom Hayhurst of Escondido sits in the County Jail in Vista, 
charged with murdering his 74-year-old mother by pounding her unmercifully on 
the head with a crowbar, neighbors and friends talk of justice. 
</P>
<P>
"I sympathize with him," said Gordon Christensen, "for having had to put up 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
"I was struck by the horror of it, but he's more the victim than her," said a 
longtime family friend, a professional who asked not to be identified. "She 
pushed him over the edge." 
</P>
<P>
"She drove her son to kill her," said Mildred Culbertson, who had known the 
Hayhursts since 1972. "She drove him beyond endurance." 
</P>
<P>
Even the prosecutor, although emphasizing the brutality of the killing, 
concedes that Tom Hayhurst "had finally come to his wit's end with his mother." 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of killing that beckons reference to the black comedy "Throw 
Momma From the Train," where the son, played by actor Danny DeVito, plots to 
murder his tyrannical, curmudgeon of a mother, played by the late Anne Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
In this situation, Tom Hayhurst -- a small (5 foot 6, 110 pounds), quiet man so 
unobtrusive that neighbors didn't know he had moved in with his mother last 
December -- is charged with murdering her Oct. 15 in an outburst so violent it 
left both prosecutors and his defense attorney shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the beating the body took, there was a considerable amount of anger 
in this attack," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Walden, the prosecutor. "It 
wasn't for any other reason than to get back in anger." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hayhurst is being held in jail without bail pending his preliminary 
hearing, scheduled for this morning before Vista Municipal Judge Suzanne Knauf. 
Hayhurst, through his attorney, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother was very strong-willed and very opinionated," Walden said. "She 
rode roughshod over everybody she came into contact with, from what we can 
gather. We believe he finally got tired of that and took matters into his own 
hand and did the dirty deed." 
</P>
<P>
Added John Jimenez, Hayhurst's defense attorney: "The question isn't so much 
whether Tom is guilty or innocent, but why it occurred. Apparently he was mad 
as hell and didn't want to take it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Take what? 
</P>
<P>
Close family friends and longtime neighbors along San Pasqual Road and Viento 
Valle, a rural neighborhood on Escondido's eastern side, say the Hayhurst 
household was a volatile one punctuated by the sounds of berating, arguments 
and shouting, day and night. Consistently, Violet Hayhurst, who stood less than 
5 feet tall, was painted as the antagonist, the bullheaded, imperious matriarch 
who occasionally would even kick her own husband out of the house for reasons 
that were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"She would berate Lou (husband) terribly in front of other people," said the 
longtime family friend who asked for anonymity. "He was a gentleman and very 
meek, and he wouldn't ever retort. Everyone wondered why Lou would take that 
kind of abuse from her." 
</P>
<P>
Christa Petro, another longtime family friend, added: "She was always cutting 
him short, to knock him down. It was pretty nasty, but he'd take it. I 
understand, though, that, when they were alone, they fought a lot." 
</P>
<P>
But the abrasive relationship between husband and wife could stand no more, 
apparently. Lou Hayhurst killed himself with a handgun shot to his head in 
August, 1987. Different stories had come from Violet Hayhurst in trying to 
explain her husband's death; she never publicly acknowledged his suicide, and 
curious friends found out by checking the county coroner's records. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife said at the time he should have been nominated for sainthood for 
having put up with his wife that long," said neighbor Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hayhurst didn't know of his father's death for many months. Hayhurst had 
sold a piece of property in Escondido and -- to his mother's consternation -- 
used his $80,000 profit to satisfy his wanderlust. He eventually settled down 
near one of his two older brothers, Ray Hayhurst, in Glendale, Ariz., where he 
worked first as a manager of a car wash and then with his brother at a feed 
supply store. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hayhurst returned to Escondido last December, after Violet Hayhurst was 
struck by a car while trying to repair her mailbox at the bottom of her 
driveway. She was hospitalized at Palomar Medical Center for more than a month 
and needed Tom to help care for the family's 10-acre avocado grove and to help 
care for his sister, Ann, who is 30 years old and developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
To Violet Hayhurst, "the sun rose and set on Ann," said Mildred Culbertson, 
whose friendship with the Hayhursts goes back to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Others agreed that Ann was the center of Violet Hayhurst's life. She would 
invite friends over to listen to Ann play popular show tunes on the organ; she 
would frequently take Ann to a roller-skating rink in town, and she supported 
Ann's involvement as a singer in the folk music group at St. Mary's Catholic 
Church in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
But the two also fought often. 
</P>
<P>
When Ann visited her mother at the hospital after the car accident, the two 
became so violent that nurses had to physically separate them and Ann was 
ordered to stop going to the hospital, according to one hospital employee. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors say the two fought so loudly that the heated words were broadcast 
over the neighborhood. Others, to Violet Hayhurst's defense, said Ann simply 
needed to shout because of her disability, in order to effectively communicate 
with her mother without stammering. 
</P>
<P>
When they did argue, it always seemed to be over food and concern for Ann's 
weight. Once, in a cafeteria line, Violet Hayhurst ordered her daughter to 
return a helping of potato salad. Another time, Violet Hayhurst locked the 
family refrigerator with a bar and padlock so Ann couldn't get inside in her 
absence, one friend said. 
</P>
<P>
It was to this home that Tom Hayhurst returned last December, and mother and 
son had a testy relationship at best. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hayhurst slept in his van, parked in the driveway, and was only allowed to 
go into the three-bedroom home to use the bathroom and occasionally fix meals 
in the kitchen, Walden said. One friend said the third bedroom in the house, 
one that could have been used by Tom Hayhurst, was instead used as an office by 
his mother. Yet another friend speculated that the son didn't want to live in 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
Petro said she was bothered by having dinner at Violet Hayhurst's home while 
Tom stayed outside in his van. "She always seemed very secretive about Tom, or 
ashamed of him, although I don't know why she would be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another friend said Violet Hayhurst was still angry at her son for spending the 
proceeds of his real estate sale. 
</P>
<P>
"She was always butting into his business," Culbertson said. "She said she was 
the mother hen looking after her children. But she had a bossy nature to her." 
</P>
<P>
Others saw a decidedly different side to Violet Hayhurst. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the most wonderful woman you'd ever want to meet," Debi Temprendola, a 
church musician and good friend of Ann, said of Violet Hayhurst. "She was 
always very gracious to me the five or six times I had seen her." 
</P>
<P>
Temprendola said she wasn't sure what would spark the arguments between mother 
and daughter, but characterized them as spats not unlike those that occur 
between teen-age girls and their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ann's very sensitive. She loved her mother to death, but there's no question 
they were always fighting. When Ann would talk, you'd hear the anger in her 
voice toward her mother," Temprendola said. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Vivian Barga, a music instructor at St. Mary's School, knew Ann and her 
mother for years and characterized Violet Hayhurst as "socially pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the mother was at times "nagging and critical" toward her husband and 
would make "quick remarks" to Ann, Barga said. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Leland, who moved to a house next door to the Hayhursts 18 months ago, 
said Violet Hayhurst was a pleasant woman who would share her avocados with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"She had us up for dinner and was very nice -- extremely nice -- to us," Leland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aurora Engel, who lived on the other side of the Hayhursts for 11 years, also 
described her as "very nice." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Engel said, "she was different than most people. She was very strong and 
complained about a lot of things. It sounded to me like she wore the pants in 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, a neighbor of more than 15 years with the Hayhursts, recalled his 
own confrontations with Violet Hayhurst. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen is the superintendent of the San Pasqual Union School District and 
remembers fielding any number of phone calls from her, complaining about this 
or that. 
</P>
<P>
"After I was installed as superintendent, she complained that, by hiring me, 
they were taking food out of the mouths of hungry kids," Christensen said. "She 
was not a rational person." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen and other neighbors said Violet Hayhurst was also an unwelcome 
guest at the neighborhood's homeowner meetings. "She was loud and rude and 
argumentative and irrational. She would make statements that made absolutely no 
sense. It was always nicer when she wasn't there," Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Frances Maceri, added: "She was loud and obnoxious. We didn't 
mind her giving her opinion, but it was the way she did it -- loud and 
arrogant. We'd just let her talk so when she was done we could continue the 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood teen-age boy said that, on one occasion, Violet Hayhurst 
beckoned a boy riding a dirt bike to approach her -- then tried to hit him with 
a shovel. Another time, several neighbors said, Violet Hayhurst was so angry at 
someone riding a motorcycle up the street that she chased him -- in reverse -- 
in her car, only to strike a retaining wall and roll her vehicle on its side. 
</P>
<P>
She paid for the damage to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hayhurst said he is wary of neighborhood gossip about his family. "I'm sure 
there were arguments," he said, "but I think you're hearing quite a bit of 
gossip and embellishment, with maybe only a grain of truth." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hayhurst said he did not know why his father killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Depression is the only answer I can come up with. He didn't leave any 
information behind." 
</P>
<P>
And he said he couldn't conceive what would have set off his younger brother to 
have erupted in the way he is accused of doing. "I'd never seen him get 
provoked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors themselves aren't sure what sparked the violence. Tom Hayhurst 
himself called 911 that morning in October. When investigators arrived, they 
found Violet Hayhurst's body at the bottom of the hillside, in a dirt-pullout 
area alongside San Pasqual Road that had, to the woman's anger, become a 
dumping ground for others' garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hayhurst told investigators his mother must have been attacked by a 
stranger, and her body dumped at the bottom of the hill alongside the street. 
But Walden, the prosecutor, said it didn't take too long for investigators to 
pointed the finger at the son. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the pattern of bloody footprints, it was clear that she was 
bludgeoned just outside her garage -- the exterior wall was spattered with 
blood -- and then put in her own Ford Bronco. The car was driven to the bottom 
of the hill and her body thrown onto the ground, Walden alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst told investigators he spotted the car from the yard above, ran down, 
discovered his mother and ran back up the hill to call for help, Walden said. 
But, from Hayhurst's claimed viewpoint, the car could not have been seen. 
Furthermore, U.S. Border Patrol trackers detected only one set of tracks -- 
going uphill from where the body was left. 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst has maintained his innocence, said Walden and Jimenez, the defense 
attorney, although both men indicated that a plea bargain may be offered today. 
</P>
<P>
"She may have been hard to get along with -- she may have been cantankerous -- 
but no one deserves to die the way she died," Walden said.

GALLEGLY'S CHIEF OF STAFF QUITS, SAYS FAMILY PREFERS WEST COAST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Sedell, who journeyed from Ventura County with Rep. Elton Gallegly to help 
the former Simi Valley mayor set up and run a congressional office, announced 
Monday that he is resigning. 
</P>
<P>
Sedell, 38, will be replaced as chief of staff by Lisa Boepple, whose career 
includes positions as top aide to former Reps. William Stanton (R-Ohio) and 
John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was subsequently elected to the Senate. Boepple, who 
will join Gallegly's staff Dec. 6, has been the congressional liaison officer 
for the Australian Embassy since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sedell, a former Simi Valley deputy administrator, will leave his 
$80,000-a-year post to return to Southern California with his family. He will 
remain with Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) until Dec. 31 to help with the transition. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew I had the intention to go back," said Sedell, who has relatives, 
including his parents, in Los Angeles. "I see my career on the West Coast." He 
said he is considering several job options in the public as well as private 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said Sedell's tenure in Washington has "been a strain on his family." 
</P>
<P>
Sedell joined Gallegly immediately after the congressman was elected in 
November, 1986, traveling to Washington to help him look at apartments, pick an 
office and hire staff. Sedell commuted from Thousand Oaks to Washington for 
nearly two years before reluctantly moving his wife and son to northern 
Virginia last November. 
</P>
<P>
He has generally received high marks from lobbyists, other Capitol Hill 
staffers and those familiar with the California delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't replace a Mike Sedell," Gallegly said. "Mike probably knows how I 
tick in a lot of ways better than I do." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly experienced considerable staff turnover during his first term 
representing the 21st District. Some former staffers said privately that they 
found him to be a difficult boss. But he and Sedell noted that the staff has 
stabilized and both described their parting as cordial. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's and my relationship is certainly -- I don't know a word that describes 
it -- is nothing but positive," Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
Sedell said he and Gallegly "have worked closely together for many years. I'll 
be with him in support in what he's trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Boepple, a 17-year government veteran, will take over Sedell's 
responsibilities, overseeing district offices in Chatsworth and Thousand Oaks 
as well as the day-to-day operation of the Washington office. She will be paid 
$55,000, Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
Sedell's salary was the highest permitted to a congressional staffer. His 
compensation raised some eyebrows in 1987 when, as a newcomer to Washington, he 
joined the ranks of the highest-paid veteran administrative assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said the salary savings are expected to be used to hire another 
assistant. He has 13 full-time and two part-time employees.

INTENSIVE-CARE NURSE ARRESTED IN DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A registered nurse has been arrested for allegedly injecting himself with 
morphine while on duty in the intensive care unit at Burbank Community 
Hospital, Burbank police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
James Ross, 40, of Van Nuys was released on his own recognizance after he was 
arrested at the hospital about 2:30 a.m. Sunday on suspicion of being under the 
influence of a controlled substance, Sgt. Don Goldberg said. Ross is scheduled 
to be arraigned Dec. 12 in Burbank Municipal Court, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
A nursing supervisor called police when he saw the man acting unusually and 
noticed a substantial amount of morphine and Demerol, a brand-name sedative and 
painkiller, were missing, Goldberg said. The supervisor also said medical 
records had been altered to increase the quantity of morphine delivered to the 
unit to more than twice the 18 milligrams originally requested, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"When police responded and talked to the subject, he displayed all the 
objective symptoms of someone being under the influence of morphine," including 
lethargy, slow and deliberate speech and constricted eyes, Goldberg said. Ross 
also had three fresh puncture wounds on his left arm, and admitted to injecting 
himself with about 10 milligrams of morphine around midnight Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Landman, spokeswoman for Burbank Community Hospital, said patient care 
was not jeopardized because the supervisor noticed Ross' condition a short time 
after he took the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Landman said Ross is employed by Specialty Care Nursing Service Agency, 
headquartered in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles, and had worked at the 
hospital only once before, in late October. The hospital gave him a favorable 
evaluation for his work on the earlier occasion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Landman said prospective nurses are screened by the registry for medical 
problems and are given an orientation before working at Burbank Community 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A supervisor at Specialty Care refused to comment on the arrest, and said 
questions from a reporter would have to be submitted to the company in writing 
before a response could be considered.

POLICE MOUNT PATROLS FOR HOLIDAY CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's horses, not reindeer, that signal the start of the Christmas season at 
shopping centers in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Los Angeles Police announced that mounted and foot patrols are being 
added at major shopping plazas in the area in an effort to cut down on crimes 
that usually increase with holiday shopping volume. Shoppers often are victims 
of robberies, purse snatchers, automobile thefts and break-ins during the peak 
shopping period. 
</P>
<P>
In North Hollywood, police said four officers on horses and another two on foot 
will patrol the commercial corridor along Laurel Canyon Boulevard near Victory 
Boulevard during the next six weeks. The area is bounded by Laurel Plaza on the 
south and Valley Plaza on the north. 
</P>
<P>
Police said four officers on foot beats already have begun holiday season 
patrols at the Northridge Fashion Center, and six mounted officers will be 
added later. The same is planned for other Valley shopping areas, including the 
commercial strip on Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Woodland Hills from the 
Promenade Mall to Topanga Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Kent Setty said the department plans to use all 16 of its available 
mounted officers in the Valley during the shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
It is the third consecutive year that mounted patrols have been used in North 
Hollywood in the roughly 10-square-block area shared by small shops, department 
stores, movie theaters and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to previous years, horse patrols have cut in half the number of 
shopper-related crimes such as robberies, car thefts and break-ins, said Capt. 
Rick Dinse. He said the high-profile patrols have worked so well that the 
department may consider adding permanent foot or horse patrols in the highly 
concentrated commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have a horse patrol, it is very visible," Dinse said. "It is 
going to have a deterring effect" on crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at expanding" to permanent patrols, Dinse added. "We think we 
might be able to justify it." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the horse and foot patrols give officers better maneuverability in 
areas with crowded parking lots, heavy pedestrian traffic and many adjoining 
shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Robert Brannon, one of the mounted police assigned to the North 
Hollywood area, said a horse gives him a better view of the area than he can 
get in a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
"From up here, I can see from one end of the parking lot to the other. I am 
also very visible. That's the deterrent," Brannon said. "We can cover a lot of 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
The return of the holiday patrols was welcomed by North Hollywood merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Imp, a sales manager at the Sears store in Valley Plaza, said the 
increased police presence improves security for customers and employees at the 
stores and has an added positive effect. It's a "great attraction" for 
shoppers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People like seeing them here. They want their kids to see the horses and the 
police officers. It helps make the area more attractive."

TRIAL BEGINS IN STUNT WOMAN'S SUIT OVER 'AIRWOLF' ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On this, both sides in stunt woman Desiree Kerns' lawsuit agree: Kerns wasn't 
supposed to be burned as she leaped from a pickup truck rigged with an 
explosive device in a 1985 stunt for the television series "Airwolf." 
</P>
<P>
But something went wrong. When the device detonated, Kerns was badly burned. At 
issue in Kerns' lawsuit in San Fernando Superior Court against four television 
production officials is the question of who was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns, 33, of Van Nuys, alleges that the four were responsible for her injuries 
by allowing her to go into the stunt thinking that the device would produce 
only smoke and no flames. 
</P>
<P>
Selection of a jury began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Thomas A. Foster said he will argue that the stunt was fully 
explained to Kerns, but she panicked and jumped before the fireball had 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Feb. 25, 1985, during the filming of "Airwolf" at Indian 
Dunes Park near Valencia. In addition to executive producer Donald P. 
Bellisario and his company, Belisarius Productions, Kerns is suing stunt 
coordinator Ron Stein, director Virgil Vogel and special effects coordinator 
Conrad Krumm. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns and stunt man Chad Randall, standing in for two actors, were in the 
pickup, which was rigged with an explosive device that Kerns could trigger by 
pressing a button. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns' attorney, Gerald L. Kroll, said in an interview that Kerns was told by 
Stein that the button would set off smoke. Kroll said the fireball surprised 
Kerns, who wore no protective clothing. Kerns, who suffered second- and 
third-degree burns on her face, scalp, neck and one arm, could have been more 
seriously hurt or killed had she not jumped when she did, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, representing all of the defendants, said Kerns was warned that the 
explosive device would set off "a momentary flash of flame." He said she was 
told not to jump until it cleared, but she pressed the button too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it was fully explained, and it was rehearsed several times, when 
it came down to actually doing the scene . . . she basically jumped the gun," 
Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Randall, who sustained minor burns, is expected to testify for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Kroll said he will argue that the defendants and defense witnesses are blaming 
Kerns to save their careers. Kerns, he said, is being blackballed by the 
entertainment industry as a result of the accident.

VIETNAM PILOT'S ASHES SCATTERED FROM SHIP NAMED IN HIS HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy frigate named after Vietnam War hero Lt. Cmdr. Wilmer Paul Cook 
performed a solemn mission Monday, scattering its namesake's ashes at sea 22 
years after the combat pilot died in battle. 
</P>
<P>
The Cook left port in San Diego Monday morning and paused off the coast for the 
20-minute service before resuming training maneuvers, Navy spokesman Cmdr. 
David Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a highly decorated A-4 Skyhawk pilot, was shot down three days before 
Christmas in 1967, while leading an air strike over North Vietnam. He was 
listed as missing for more than 20 years before his remains were returned to 
the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, his remains were identified by the Central Identification 
Laboratory in Hawaii and the family notified. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice that he came home finally. It's nice that he's back in the United 
States. That's all I care about really," said his eldest son, Wilmer Paul Cook 
Jr. "It eased my mind to know where he is exactly. For years, I didn't know 
whether he was alive or dead." 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 31; his brother, John, 26; and their uncle, John M. Cook Jr., 65, of 
Titusville, N.J., attended a memorial service aboard the frigate in port 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The family requested that Cook's remains be scattered at sea from the ship that 
bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to be remembered by the ship and the people who make it go," the 
flier's oldest son said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rare occasion for a ship and its crew to be able to honor the man for 
whom the ship is named, and to commend the remains to the deep," the frigate's 
skipper, Cmdr. Richard Kalb, said at Friday's memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's service was believed to be the first in which a Navy ship was involved 
in the sea burial of its namesake, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer 1st Class James Gorham, who attended Monday's service on behalf 
of the family before returning to San Diego by helicopter, said the ship was 
brought to a stop and the crew of 250 mustered to pay final respects. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Chaplain James Sharrett led a prayer and read from the Scriptures as the 
ship's executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Steven Bostwick, scattered the ashes into 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-member honor guard fired three volleys into a clear sky to salute the 
dead pilot, and taps was played to conclude the service. 
</P>
<P>
The frigate Cook was commissioned in 1971 in New Orleans. It was named after 
Cook, who was 35 when he died, because of his record of valor, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Navy frigates like this are traditionally named after military heroes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a native of Annapolis, Md., and a 1956 Naval Academy graduate, became an 
aviator in 1957. His carrier-based squadron was sent to Vietnam in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
He flew more than 300 missions in his Skyhawk, named the "City of Annapolis," 
during two tours to the Tonkin Gulf on the carriers Constellation and Coral 
Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Among his commendations were three Distinguished Flying Crosses and five Air 
Medals for aerial combat. He was considered an expert in the A-4 Skyhawk and 
had been urged to return stateside to train others but felt he was needed more 
on the front line. 
</P>
<P>
On the day he was shot down, the Navy said, he had turned down shore duty to 
lead the fateful air strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always go where my country sends me and will always do whatever it asks," 
Cook once wrote in a letter to his parents. "Perhaps what I am doing may keep 
my two sons from going to war."

MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN AUTO INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Woodland Hills man pleaded guilty Monday to charges stemming from a scheme to 
defraud insurance companies by filing claims for accidents that never happened, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Grishin, 40, a native of the Soviet Union, pleaded guilty to four 
counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy, said Assistant U. S. Atty. 
David Scheper, who prosecuted the case. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 
25 years in prison and $1.2 million in fines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grishin will be sentenced Feb. 12 by U. S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, 
Scheper said. Fourteen other participants in the scheme have pleaded guilty to 
mail fraud charges, and one was sentenced to six months in federal prison after 
pleading innocent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grishin, said to be the mastermind of the scheme, paid employees of a North 
Hollywood body shop to crash cars on the company's lot and used the wrecks to 
back up accident claims, Scheper said. 
</P>
<P>
Participants would call their insurance companies to report that they had 
caused an accident. And others pretended to be injured victims, seeking 
compensation from the guilty party's insurance company for up to 30 visits to a 
West Los Angeles physician who was later sentenced to six months in prison and 
fined $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies stood to lose $160,000 in the scheme, but ended up losing 
only several thousand dollars because the operation was stopped in time, 
Scheper said.

BROTHERS AID ELDERLY SAUGUS COUPLE, DONATE MOBILE HOME, FURNITURE, RENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news gets better and better for Frank and Mabel Fisher these days. 
</P>
<P>
The Fishers, an elderly couple from Saugus, were promised a mobile home free of 
charge last month by the owners of a mobile home dealership who read news 
accounts of how the Fishers had their utilities cut off for 55 days this summer 
in a lease dispute with their landlord. 
</P>
<P>
The Fishers, who have been married 63 years, went to court in October to have 
utility service restored to the trailer, which had been their home since a 
brush fire destroyed their house two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday the Fishers were given their new home by brothers Frank and Pat 
Milan, co-owners of Apple Homes, a mobile home dealership in Canyon Country. In 
addition to providing the $35,000 mobile home, the Milan brothers have pledged 
to pay the $275 monthly rent for a mobile home park space. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the biggest surprise of my whole life," Frank Fisher, 83, said of the 
day the Milans offered him the mobile home. "I'll never get over it." 
</P>
<P>
The Milans also agreed to furnish the mobile home, and the Fishers watched in 
disbelief Monday as workmen moved in a bed, dresser, chairs, tables and a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it, babe," said Frank Fisher as two men carried in a dresser. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodness sakes," said Mabel Fisher, 85. "Will wonders never cease?" 
</P>
<P>
Pat Milan said Douglas Furniture of Newhall was providing the furniture below 
wholesale prices. Milan said he hoped donations from the public might defray 
the cost but said he and his brother were prepared to pick up the whole tab if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fisher, meanwhile, said his good fortune has given him peace of mind. He 
recently had pneumonia and is in poor health. "If something happens to me, at 
least she has a place where she can stay," he said of his wife.

DRUG TESTS NEXT FOR LAPD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates wants random and mandatory drug tests 
for all officers, including the top brass. The Los Angeles Police Protective 
League has raised questions on constitutional grounds. But in the wake of a 
recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, both have demonstrated a refreshing 
willingness to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the high court let stand a lower court ruling that allows 
the Boston Police Department to require random drug tests. The decision clearly 
gave Gates an opportunity to try again to get drug testing under way here. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Gates did not try to impose mandatory testing unilaterally. 
Instead, the department followed the procedure set out by state law and 
submitted a formal proposal to the union to open discussions. That is the 
correct way to try to resolve a conflict over work conditions and a welcome 
contrast from the chief's heavy-handed approach of last month when his order 
requiring desk officers to do field patrol several times a month resulted in a 
lawsuit by the union. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. George Aliano, president of the police protective league, is showing 
similar restraint. Instead of stalling the issue until the current union 
contract expires in 1992, he plans to put the issue before the membership. A 
poll will determine whether members are willing to reopen negotiations. If a 
majority answers "yes," as Aliano anticipates, the union will talk. 
</P>
<P>
There are many stumbling blocks on the way to agreement. Under Gates' proposal, 
police officers from the department's medical liaison staff, would collect 
urine samples to be tested by the department's lab. A positive reading would 
trigger a test by an independent lab. An additional positive reading would 
result in termination. 
</P>
<P>
The union wants to know how many times a year officers would be tested, who 
would collect urine samples and where they would be analyzed. The union also 
wants officers to qualify for rehabilitation if they admit to drug use before 
being caught. The department resists second chances. 
</P>
<P>
Although the police chief and union chief agree that few officers use drugs, 
the public needs to have every confidence in the men and women who protect and 
serve.

A WILDERNESS SYSTEM FOR NEVADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For generations, Nevada was almost the exclusive province of free-wheeling 
gamblers, miners and ranchers who sneered, or worse, at those federal fellows 
who tried to tell them what they could do, and what they could not do, with the 
land. Nevada was the wellspring of the Sagebrush Rebellion against the alleged 
oppressive land management tactics of the federal government, which controls 
most of the state. But finally, the environmental movement has staked a 
legitimate claim to its share of the Silver State. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Congress created the first national park in Nevada, the Great 
Basin National Park in the east-central part of the state. And now, Nevada is 
on the threshold of having a National Forest wilderness system worthy of its 
name. After seven years of battling federal land exploiters, wilderness 
advocates in Congress led by Democratic Sen. Harry Reid have managed to pass a 
bill to create a 14-unit, 733,400-acre wilderness system on forest lands 
throughout the state. "For the first time in our history as a state we have 
said that wilderness is a resource to save for ourselves and future 
generations," Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
Only one hurdle remains, the signature of President Bush. Republican Rep. 
Barbara Vucanovich, the only member of the Nevada delegation to oppose the 
bill, is imploring Bush to veto it. But the wilderness plan, scaled back from 
the 1.4 million acres originally sought, is a fair compromise that has wide 
popular support in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Would Bush want to be remembered as the President who vetoed a reasonable 
Nevada bill -- the only wilderness legislation to clear Congress on the 25th 
anniversary of the passage of the Wilderness Act and the first wilderness bill 
to reach his desk? Not likely. Our hunch is that Bush will be proud to sign the 
Nevada wilderness bill into law at the first possible moment this week.

CHINESE STUDENTS IN U.S. COLLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my opinion, your editorial "An Affront to Tradition" (Nov. 17) has voiced 
the general sentiment among Chinese students in this country concerning the 
Bush Administration's conduct of Sino-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
While we are generally appreciative and supportive of the Administration's 
initial actions in response to the June 4th massacre in Beijing, we have become 
increasingly wary of the Administration's current approach to its relations to 
Beijing as exemplified in its intervention of the congressional proposal 
providing political protection to Chinese students in America. What is even 
more alarming is the State Department argument that the passage of the proposal 
would threaten the Sino-American educational exchange programs. When we 
consider this argument in conjunction with the recent withdrawal by the Chinese 
government from the Fulbright scholarship program and its explicit threat to 
suspend the intercollegiate exchange programs between the two countries, we 
cannot help asking two questions: 
</P>
<P>
First, what are the principles whereupon the Administration formulates and 
conducts its China policy? On geopolitical expediency and interests? Or on the 
historic American tradition of freedom and democracy? 
</P>
<P>
Second, is the current Chinese government sincere in resolving the differences 
between China and the U.S.? So far, all we hear is rhetoric. Even the rhetoric 
does not invoke any optimism. We hear Deng Xiaoping lecturing former President 
Nixon, the good friend of China, on the fine points of how "too deeply America 
has involved and interfered in China's internal affairs" and, therefore, the 
U.S., not China, should take initiatives toward resolving the differences. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, your editorial has also helped clarify a long held myth about the 
"government sponsorship" of the Chinese students in America. Not only a large 
percent of the total 40,000 or more students are solely supported by either 
their families or relatives in the West, but the rest of the so-called 
government-sponsored students or scholars normally only receive government 
financial support for one or two years. Of these government financial supports, 
a large portion consists of World Bank or other international fund scholarships 
and other foreign institutional scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Chinese students and scholars have depended solely on their own 
merits, and on the good will and generosity of American universities to get 
through.

I glanced at test scores of schoolchildren in Los Angeles County and felt great 
pain in my eyeballs. These youngsters represent the future of America. The 
prospect fills me with despair. 
</P>
<P>
Let me recommend my solution -- a revolutionary reading program for the first 
12 grades of school. Every student would be required to read at least 10 books 
during the summer months in order to advance to the next grade level. 
Validation of book reports would involve teacher and librarian cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Reading is the key to lifelong education. Benjamin Franklin and Abe Lincoln had 
a total of four years of schooling between them, but they became readers, and 
that made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 summers each student will have read at least 120 books. Result: vastly 
improved ratings in writing, spelling and other areas. In three years, Los 
Angeles students will zoom up to mediocrity; in eight years they will breathe 
the rarefied air of top quartile in nationwide tests. 
</P>
<P>
If this program sounds too radical for the school system, then let one 
innovative school principal try to experiment and lead the way.

STATE TAX ON ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What "Stiff 'Nickel-a-Drink' Tax on Alcohol Proposed by Coalition" (Part A, 
Nov. 10) neglected to point out were the measly amounts of yearly revenue to 
California our decades-old booze taxes provide. In 1988-89, wine brought in 
$922,000! Its 52-year-old tax -- the nation's lowest -- has been frozen at 1 
penny per gallon! 
</P>
<P>
Beer brought in $26,835,000 but, beer alone comprises a whopping 81% of all 
booze gallons bought statewide. That is why the booze merchants' own, proposed 
rival ballot initiative for November, 1990, which would up our beer tax from 4 
pennies to 20 cents per gallon, is an insult to the voter's intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Can you just imagine what will happen to trauma and emergency care when "the 
Big One" comes and local government was denied the yearly 25% (a modest $200 
million) from the health and safety coalition's alcohol-tax statewide 
initiative for November, 1990? It's high time the thinking taxpayer saw the 
bottom line after reading Gov. George Deukmejian's lips. 
</P>
<P>
No new taxes are needed -- only a reasonable surtax readjustment for inflation 
and health and safety's sake from hitherto untouchable taxes on our most common 
drug of violence. After all, barely 14% of the drinkers drink 74% of the booze. 
Let the heavy user beware!

BURBANK COUNCIL TO VOTE ON FIRST RAISE SINCE '85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank City Council will vote tonight on whether to give themselves a 25% 
pay raise, which would be their first salary increase in five years. 
</P>
<P>
The five part-time council members receive a monthly salary of $600. If 
approved, the pay increase would raise their salaries to $765 a month or $9,180 
a year, beginning Jan. 1, said Christopher L. Foss, assistant to City Manager 
Robert (Bud) Ovrom. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have not received a salary increase since Jan. 1, 1985, when a 
voter-approved ordinance went into effect setting salaries at the same rate 
that council members of similar-size cities receive under state law, Foss said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also required that a maximum 5% cost-of-living raise be voted on 
annually by the council, but the votes were never taken because of an oversight 
by city staff, Foss said. Staff members recently discovered the discrepancy 
while reviewing salary provisions for elected officials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the pay increase would represent the amount council members could 
have received over the last five years, Foss said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Thomas Flavin and Michael Hastings, both of whom favor the pay 
increase, said they spend an average of 20 to 30 hours a week on council 
business. "It's almost a full-time job," Flavin said. "A lot of time you have 
to take off your regular job to do it." 
</P>
<P>
No public hearing is scheduled on the proposed pay increase, but City Attorney 
JuliScott said residents can address the issue during a general public comment 
session at the beginning of the 7:30 p.m. meeting.

CALL 'STAND DOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel the federal government might benefit by calling a "stand down" like the 
Navy did recently. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy had so many unexplainable accidents that it suspended all military 
operations to take a good look at itself. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration would profit from a good look at the direction it is 
headed.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
ABOVE ALL, A PARK FOR THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All things being equal, you would think that homeowners in the Dana Woods 
subdivision in Dana Point should be able to keep their four-acre park private 
if that is what they want to do. After all, they have paid $200,000 over the 
last 10 years to landscape and groom it. But all things are not equal: The 
builders of Dana Woods agreed 10 years ago that the county could give title to 
the park to a local government whenever it could afford to do so. And now it 
can. 
</P>
<P>
Such agreements as a condition for permission to build anything at all are 
common in the county. There are a number of reasons, among them the shrinking 
amount of open space, not only in Dana Point, but also in communities 
throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Other planned communities, such as Woodbridge in Irvine, maintain their own 
parks and officially limit access to residents. But Woodbridge makes no 
organized effort to keep outsiders away; besides, its parks were not created by 
the same legal terms as the one at Dana Woods. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the county now has the money to purchase title to the Dana Woods 
park and the homeowners are plainly worried. Vandals have been visiting the 
park: Tacks were spread around the playground and a pipe bomb was set off in 
the swimming-pool area. Homeowners cannot be blamed for being alarmed for 
thinking that similar incidents might occur if the park is opened to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
But even for parks in planned communities, exclusionary policies set a bad 
precedent. Parkland is too scarce not to be shared by all. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, Dana Woods homeowners would like to keep their park the way it 
is, but they say that if the county insists on exercising its legal option, 
they would definitely prefer that it turn over the land to the city of Dana 
Point. We see no problem with that, as long as Dana Point shares the county's 
view that the park at Dana Woods should be opened for all to enjoy.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The home of Los Angeles' inner-city pro basketball team no longer should be 
known as the Clip Joint. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A capacity crowd went to the Sports Arena Sunday night to see the Bulls' 
Michael Jordan and stayed to cheer the Clippers' Ron Harper. The win gave the 
Clippers a 4-6 record that easily could be 6-4 were it not for a last-second 
tip-in by the Knicks and a bum call by referee Earl Strom that kept the game 
against San Antonio from going into overtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This could be just the start of something serious for the perennial 
laughingstock of the NBA. Wednesday night, Danny Manning will return against 
Milwaukee. You remember him, the one-man show who brought Kansas the NCAA 
championship and then wrecked his knee early his rookie year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper and Gary Grant at the guards. Manning, Charles Smith and Ken Norman 
to choose from at forward. Benoit Benjamin at center. Now that's 
respectability. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin used to make about $500,000 per floor burn, but showed late last 
season that he likes playing for Coach Don Casey. Casey is one of the best-kept 
secrets in town. Nobody knows him except the 12 guys who are busting their 
butts for him nightly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Clipper announcer Ralph Lawler calls the youngest team in the league Casey's 
Kids. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the crowds right now," insists owner Donald Sterling. 
"What's important is that we win. The crowds will come. L.A. is a good pro 
basketball town." . . . 
</P>
<P>
To prove Sterling's point, 15,350 watched the Clippers and Bulls at the same 
time that 17,505 took in the Lakers and Spurs at the Forum. Not an unsold seat 
at either place. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's football team, which lost to Notre Dame, shouldn't be ranked ahead 
of the Fighting Irish. . . . 
</P>
<P>
For a change, here's a nice story about the fight game. Five of his former U.S. 
Olympic teammates and ex-world champion Donald Curry are footing the 
$10,500-bill for Kennedy McKinney's 90-day stay in a Memphis drug rehab center. 
The 1988 Olympians who have contributed are Ray Mercer, Andrew Maynard, Riddick 
Bowe, Michael Carbajal and Todd Foster. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard has closed his workouts to the public and cut his entourage 
from 20 to six as he prepares for his bout with Roberto Duran on Dec. 7 at the 
Mirage in Las Vegas. Fine, but he also should have rehired Angelo Dundee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Leonard on his tough fight with Thomas Hearns: "The trouble was that I read the 
papers. I thought I would knock him out with the first punch." . . . 
</P>
<P>
I get a kick out of boxing announcers who say a fighter "doesn't like it in the 
body." Who does? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Kings showed more in their 3-3 tie at Vancouver Sunday than in many of 
their victories this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
American men no longer win the big tennis tournaments, but five of them rank 
among the top 10 money winners. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the four millionaire golfers each represented a charity, the Skins Game 
would be a better event. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Anderson out-gained the New Orleans Saints on Sunday night, 336 yards 
to 301. . . . Say this for Jim Everett: He threw well on a night when his pass 
protection wasn't the best. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, things had gotten so bad for the Rams that John Robinson actually 
looked grim on the sidelines. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One note on a scorecard that had to be scratched after Mike Lansford's field 
goal in overtime: "The Rams will never win again in Louisiana if they keep 
calling drop-back passes on third down inside the one-yard line." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Denver's clinching of the AFC West title as early as the 12th week shouldn't 
hurt the Raiders' chances against the Broncos Sunday in the Coliseum. Last 
season, Buffalo clinched the AFC East title the 12th week and then lost three 
of its remaining four. Granted, the Bills' one victory was over the Raiders. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders and New England Patriots played the first quarter in a snappy 28 
minutes before settling into a more leisurely pace and finishing in 3 hours 1 
minute. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hank Kuhlmann's long-awaited debut as head coach of the Cardinals attracted 
33,297, smallest NFL crowd ever in Phoenix. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Steve Largent points out that the Seattle Seahawks finally are playing 
consistent football. They're lousy every week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears now know the true value of injured defensive end Dan Hampton. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Offensive rookie of the year: Detroit running back Barry Sanders. Defensive 
rookie of the year: Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Pack is back and so are the best-looking uniforms in the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It seemed fitting that Carnell Lake recovered a fumble for the Pittsburgh 
Steelers Sunday during the torrential downpour in Miami. . . . 
</P>
<P>
From Pat Haden: "Time of possession counts only in jail." . . .

KEEFE SPARKS STANFORD PAST UC IRVINE, 70-57

IRVINE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanford's Adam Keefe came home Monday, where he: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Was honored by having his high school basketball uniform retired at 
Irvine's Woodbridge High. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Was roasted by by UC Irvine basketball fans ("Irvine wasn't good enough for 
you, huh?"). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Was awful in the first half against UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Was nearly unstoppable in the second, leading the Cardinal to a 70-57 
nonconference victory over the Anteaters at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe scored 20 points, 14 in the second half, and added 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive loss for Irvine, which led, 22-12, midway through 
the first half, and 24-17 with slightly more than five minutes left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford pulled to four by halftime and made the score 41-41 on Keefe's 
layup with 14:25 to go in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Once again Irvine, which blew an 11-point second-half lead against the 
University of San Francisco on Saturday, went cold, scoring 12 points in the 
final 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to be a good shooting team," Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan said. 
"What happened to our shooting?" 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters made 38% of their shots from the field, only 32% in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine made up for its poor shooting with a good job defensively in the first 
half. Sagging toward the middle against Keefe, Irvine made it hard for the 
Cardinal to go inside. When Stanford did, many times it resulted in a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Keefe was aggressive inside, scoring 10 points in a 
10-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Palmer led Irvine with 18 points.

THE PREPS: TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH VENICE'S JONES IS IMPOSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the start of the high school football season, Louis Jones of Venice High 
gave little indication that he would have the type of season he has had. 
</P>
<P>
After playing primarily as a defensive back and wide receiver his previous two 
varsity seasons, Jones was moved to quarterback during the off-season before 
the start of his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the best decision Venice Co-Coach Al Dellinger could have 
made. Jones has become one of the most dominating players in the City Section. 
</P>
<P>
In leading Venice to an 11-0 record, Jones, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound all-purpose 
quarterback, has left opponents wondering if there is anything he can't do. 
</P>
<P>
He has played nearly every skill position, and has been the Gondoliers' kicking 
specialist, despite having never kicked before. He has accounted for nearly 
two-thirds of Venice's points and has amassed more than 1,500 yards in total 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
In accounting for 22 touchdowns, Jones has rushed for 13, passed for six, 
caught passes for two and returned a fumble for one. He has kicked a 30-yard 
field goal and more than a dozen extra points. He has rushed for a two-point 
conversion and is averaging nearly 40 yards a punt. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, Jones usually plays free safety, unless Venice needs him at 
linebacker, defensive end or to cover the opposing team's best receiver, one on 
one. He has five interceptions, seven forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and 
is among the team leaders in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had to play Venice again, I would have Jones kidnaped before the game," 
Westchester Co-Coach Larry Wein said. "The only way to stop him would be for 
him not to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Wein should know because two weeks ago, in the Western League championship game 
between the schools, Jones was unstoppable in Venice's 29-27 victory. He scored 
23 points, including the winning two-point conversion with 13 seconds left in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Jones is the biggest impact player in the city," Wein said. "He makes his team 
so much better with his winning attitude. He just has the ability to always 
make the big play." 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger, who in 25 years of coaching has worked with several players who have 
played professional football, calls Jones his best all-around player, ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Louis does everything so well," he said. "He is a leader and a competitor who 
comes into every game ready to play. He is like a throwback from an old 
football movie with a triple-threat hero. He is an All-American." 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger says that he did not expect Jones to be so successful this season at 
running Venice's offense. Jones was originally scheduled to stand in at 
quarterback until sophomore Jason Ehlers matured. 
</P>
<P>
"Jones played quarterback during the summer passing leagues, but we were not 
certain that he was going to stay at quarterback," Dellinger said. "But once 
the season started, it was clear that he was our quarterback. He is an 
excellent runner who throws well enough to be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Jones says that his quarterback role turned out different than he had planned. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd be more of a passer than a running quarterback," said Jones, 
whose stepbrother, Morris Nettles, played professional baseball for the Angels. 
"I'm glad that things turned out like they did because this season has been 
like a dream. I never thought that I would have so much success and fun at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
Venice is a strong contender to win its first City football title. Last 
Wednesday, Jones rushed for more than 200 yards in Venice's 28-6 win over 
Marshall in the first round of the playoffs and Friday night, the undefeated 
Gondoliers will play host to Locke. 
</P>
<P>
In the City's Pacific League, Crenshaw and Dorsey have advanced to the second 
round of the 4-A Division playoffs, but it hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw, 7-4, earned its spot the hard way, by defeating Wilmington Banning, 
6-0, in a 16-play tiebreaker Nov. 20, and then opened the playoffs with a 27-24 
victory over San Fernando, two days later. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cougars' win over Banning -- which halted a Pilot playoff-appearance 
streak stretching back to 1974 -- Crenshaw needed a dramatic 79-yard touchdown 
catch and run by quarterback Derreck Williams on the 11th play of the 
tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the play, we were worried that we would run out of plays," said 
Williams, who caught the option pass from tailback Kevin Hicks. "Someone needed 
to come up with the big play and I'm glad I was able to provide it." 
</P>
<P>
Against San Fernando, Crenshaw again needed late heroics. With 3:17 left in the 
game, fullback Sean Lowery scored on a one-yard run on fourth and goal, then 
Hicks added a 35-yard touchdown run to hold off the Tigers. Hicks, who has 
rushed for more than 1,600 yards this season, had 137 yards against San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey's problems have been well documented, from the tragic death of Kevin 
Copeland to the early ending of its game against Crenshaw because of gunfire 
outside Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the leadership of Co-Coaches Paul Knox and Eugene McAdoo, the Dons 
are 7-3 and have become a force in the 4-A Division. Dorsey won its first-round 
playoff game over Reseda Cleveland, 26-0, with junior running back Lamont 
Warren, accounting for all of the Dons' points. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very difficult season, in which we have had one major and 
three or four minor incidents," Knox said, whose Dons will play Palisades 
Friday. "I am real proud of the kids and how they have hung in there mentally. 
They all have stuck together and believed in each other." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, in the City 4-A Division quarterfinals, Crenshaw travels to meet 
Woodland Hills Taft and Dorsey will play at Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, Newbury Park was ousted from the Southern Section Division 
II football playoffs by Santa Barbara, 28-7. Even so, the Panthers ended their 
7-3-1 season on a positive note. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season began, the team and its coaching staff made a commitment to 
take an unannounced drug test during the season. Every player's parents agreed 
and in late October, the tests were administered to detect any street drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Panther Coach George Hurley reports that no one tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone had tested positive, only he and his parents would have been told," 
Hurley said. "However, since there were no positives, I was told about the 
results." 
</P>
<P>
Athletes from 12 states and U.S. military overseas bases will compete in the 
11th annual Kinney Cross-Country Western Regional Championships Saturday at 
Woodwark Park in Fresno. Bryan Dameworth and Deena Drossin of Agoura High are 
favorites to win in the boys' and girls' sections, respectively. Dameworth won 
his third consecutive state Division I title last Saturday and Drossin won her 
second in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The first eight runners in each section will represent the West in the Kinney 
National Championships, to be held Dec. 9 at Balboa Park in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
In City football playoff action, Ivan Wilson rushed for 196 yards and scored 
the winning touchdown in South Gate's 20-19 comeback win over Reseda. . . . 
Ontiwaun Carter rushed for 219 yards and scored two touchdowns as Kennedy of 
Granada Hills beat Manual Arts, 25-7. . . . Quarterback Arnie Madrid rushed for 
131 yards and scored two touchdowns in San Pedro's 31-17 win over Sylmar. . . . 
Locke running back James Fuller rushed for 188 yards and scored three 
touchdowns in the Saints' 37-6 victory over Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin's record breaking quarterback, Santiago Alvarez, completed 20 of 30 
passes for 208 yards before going down with a knee injury in the third quarter 
in the Panthers' 27-3 win over Huntington Park. Alvarez is expected to play 
against Gardena Friday. . . . Westchester hopes to have tailback Tim Holliday 
ready for its game against South Gate, the defending 3-A Division champion and 
top seed. Two weeks ago, Holliday rushed for a career-high 274 yards in three 
quarters against Venice before injuring his knee. Holliday, who has rushed for 
1,115 yards, sat out Westchester's 13-3 win over Belmont last Wednesday night. 
. . . Hilario Espinosa rushed for 249 yards in 45 carries in Garfield's 11-7 
win over Wilson. Espinosa has 1,826 yards for the season, with 21 touchdowns.

ERMA BOMBECK: LAST CHANCE AT AWAKENING MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am always looking for new things to extend my marriage. Take the dual-control 
electric blanket, for example. It came along just in time. I was on the verge 
of donating my frozen body to science. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when I thought peace and harmony in our union was threatened. 
Then my husband got an exercise bicycle with portable wheels on it. Now I just 
wheel it out of sight every chance I get and his heart rate accelerates just 
trying to find it. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot imagine my giddiness when I noted last week that there is a new 
alarm clock on the market called Shake Awake. It's touted as being for the 
"morning-impaired." 
</P>
<P>
Morning-impaired people are not physically impaired in any way. They are just 
endowed with convenient hearing. They can lie in bed and hear a water faucet 
drip outside the house. They can't hear the dog tunneling under the door when 
he wants out. They can hear the score of a ballgame when they're fast asleep in 
front of the TV set. They can't hear a baby crying at 2 a.m. in the next room. 
They can hear the tires on their car screech when it is being parked in a 
garage a block away. They cannot hear an alarm clock when it is 2 feet from 
their face. 
</P>
<P>
Shake Awake is a dream come true. You stick the clock under the pillow of the 
awakee, and when it's time for the alarm to go off, it pulsates and vibrates as 
though it's shaking you out of a coma. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to get my hopes built up, but I think this time I'm on to 
something. We've had alarm clocks in the past that did everything from play 
music to begin with a hum and build to a crescendo that threatened to crack the 
walls. I once got an alarm clock that nagged my husband to death. As soon as he 
turned it off, it would wait five minutes and then go off again. He became 
quite hostile and one morning drowned it in the washbowl. 
</P>
<P>
One year, I bought him a clock that looked like a yellow tennis ball. When the 
alarm went off, the only way you could stop it was by slamming it against a 
wall. He eventually threw it into the driveway and ran his car over it. 
</P>
<P>
Shake Awake is my last chance. Other than having an alarm clock that grabs a 
person around the throat and shouts, "Wake up or you're a dead man!" I don't 
know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
Why am I smiling?

MISS MANNERS: GREETING AT ENTRANCE NOT A MUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I live in a secure building that contains eight 
apartments. When guests arrive, they must first ring my apartment from the 
front door. I may then use the intercom system to allow the guests to announce 
themselves, and I then electronically unlock the entrance from my apartment. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to be somewhat inhospitable, as the guests must then find their way 
up a flight of stairs and through a series of doors. Should I be greeting them 
at the door and saving the intercom for package deliveries? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- While appreciating your hospitable intentions, Miss Manners 
believes it superfluous for you to greet your guests in the lobby. (It is even 
considered a politeness, for those who have the luxury of a household employee 
to open the door, to allow guests to collect themselves and smooth the ravages 
of the weather before being greeted by their hosts.) 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that you want them stumbling about the building. You have an 
intercommunication system, so use it to say a pleasant word of greeting and 
give your guests instructions. In these circumstances, a hospitable gesture 
would be to be waiting at your open apartment door when they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- At a wedding reception we attended in a country club, they 
were serving free drinks. I was surprised to see on the trays of the waiters 
and waitresses, along with champagne, small containers for tips. Many people 
thought they were to pay for the drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Am I wrong in thinking that this wasn't proper and that it was up to the bridal 
party to take care of the tips? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- While Miss Manners shares your distaste for this crass 
maneuver, she is not as quick as you in placing the blame. Let us hope that the 
hosts were unaware that their guests were being solicited for money. Miss 
Manners would go so far as to hope that the trays were there for the guests to 
deposit soiled cocktail napkins before taking fresh drinks. In any case, the 
practice should be reported to club management, which may not have authorized 
it -- or may decide not to authorize it if people oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- My niece, who was married and divorced, is remarrying, and 
we are all invited to the wedding, dinner and reception. We each gave her a 
nice wedding gift for her first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Are we to give her another big gift? What is the correct thing to do? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- The correct thing to do is not always what the principals most 
want. (For example, it is incorrect to tip the owner of an establishment, such 
as a restaurant or a hair salon.) But those who follow it have the comfort of 
knowing that it is correct. 
</P>
<P>
Now -- it is perfectly correct not to give a present for a second wedding. Most 
people generously ignore this rule, because if they feel close enough to attend 
the wedding at all, they are moved to give a present as well. But it is 
perfectly sensible to invoke the rule when you have already given the same 
person a substantial present.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: OK FOR KIDS TO BE AFRAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Recently, our 7-year-old has been watching the evening news 
with his father, and I've noticed that he's become much more fearful. He's 
worried about robbers, fires, earthquakes -- you name it. It is normal for 
children his age to have fears? How many are too many? -- S.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR S.S.: Everyone needs a certain amount of fear to protect us from danger. 
If your son has been watching the news, he's become more aware of what's 
happening in the world around him. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. While 
parents need to take time to explain the dangers to the child, they should also 
let him know that there are lots of good things happening in the world that 
don't get reported on the evening news because people take them for granted. 
It's the bad and the unusual that make the news. 
</P>
<P>
If parents are calm, controlled and in command of their lives, children are 
more likely to feel curious rather than anxious. Children's fears are sometimes 
a reflection of their parents' anxiety levels. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leon Rosenberg, child psychologist at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Children's 
Center in Baltimore, says being afraid or worried about strangers, bad people, 
fire and robbers isn't unusual for 7-, 8- and 9-year-olds. If the child is 
spending any significant amount of time with these worries, if it's 
interrupting the child's play during the daytime, then the anxiety may be 
unhealthy. If he's only a little anxious before bedtime, take time to talk 
about his fears and explore the source, but chances are this is healthy, normal 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I love my wife despite the fact that she's convinced she is 
sick, when her doctors and I know that this isn't the case. I have to screen 
newspapers and magazines before leaving them around the house, because if there 
is an article about an illness, she's got it and nothing will persuade her that 
she hasn't. What causes this preoccupation and how can I get her off the 
subject of her health? -- L.R. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR L.R.: Some hypochondriacs develop the problem as children, often as a way 
of getting attention from parents or friends. Children discover that the only 
time a mother or father shows affection is when they have a headache or when 
they complain about some physical ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Hypochondriacs often come from homes where one parent has been seriously ill 
for a long period of time or when their life has been threatened by invalidism 
in the home. A parent may pass on his or her anxieties about illness to the 
child so that the youngster grows up with a persistent preoccupation with 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
As for the treatment of this imagined illness, it isn't easy. Most 
psychiatrists agree with Sigmund Freud that intense, long-term psychoanalysis 
isn't especially effective in treating hypochondria. Group therapy, behavior 
modification and drugs to treat the accompanying depression are generally what 
is advised today. Treating the depression helps the patient feel better. 
Doctors usually try to manage the patient's anxiety, as this is the dominant 
emotion with hypochondriacs. This will help your wife.

DEBUTANTE IN A SEAMY SUBCULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WANDA URBANSKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
Urbanska is the author of "The Singular Generation: Young Americans in the 
1980s" (Doubleday). 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bad Behavior by Mary Gaitskill (Random House/Vintage: $7.95; 178 pp., 
0-679-72327-7) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Bad Behavior," Mary Gaitskill's impressive debut collection of short stories, 
recently published in paperback, runs a live wire into a seamy subculture of 
artists, artistes and aspirants in New York City who live to "medicate" (take 
drugs), who frequent gay and lesbian bars, who work as prostitutes while 
battling for their dignity. Gaitskill stakes out her turf and writes 
unsentimentally, with confidence and verve. She comes off as that rare author 
who has lived whereof she speaks -- rather than attaching herself to a scene 
and making ironic, Peeping Tomish notes about it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Gaitskill is the real thing. At 16, she fled her native Detroit for 
Manhattan where she worked for four years panhandling in the streets and as a 
strip-tease dancer. Later she studied at the University of Michigan and 
graduated in 1981, winning a prestigious literary prize. 
</P>
<P>
One of Gaitskill's most memorable stories, "A Romantic Weekend," is a graphic, 
unsparing exploration of a tryst between a sadistic married man in search of a 
woman to humiliate, and a disturbed, seemingly meek but inwardly rigid woman 
who wants to lose, and unleash, herself in passion. 
</P>
<P>
"On meeting Beth, he was astonished at how much she looked, talked and moved 
like his former victim," Gaitskill writes. "She was delicately morbid in all 
her gestures, sensitive, arrogant, vulnerable to flattery. She veered between 
extravagant outbursts of opinion and sudden, uncertain halts, during which she 
seemed to look to him for approval. She was in love with the idea of 
intelligence, and she overestimated her own." 
</P>
<P>
The adulterer's desire to make Beth a sex slave -- to beat her, urinate on her 
and make her drink it and to eventually draw his delicate Korean wife into the 
sordidness -- contrasts with Beth's fantasy of "swooning in his arms . . . 
supported by a soft ball of puffy blue stuff." Gaitskill deftly alternates 
between the two points of view as the story gains momentum with each emotional 
twist and verbal parry. 
</P>
<P>
Both parties wind up feeling cheated, and he begins hurling recriminations. " 
'I don't think you're very sexual,' he said. 'You're not the way I thought you 
were when I first met you.' 
</P>
<P>
"She was so hurt by this," Gaitskill writes, "that she had difficulty 
answering. Finally, she said, 'I can be very sexual or very unsexual depending 
on who I'm with and in what situation.' " 
</P>
<P>
Prostitution is a recurring theme in the collection -- the look and feel of a 
present-day brothel. The stories humanize the hooker, the customer and the 
sex-for-money exchange, shattering stereotypes. Here we have brainy, idealistic 
hookers and forlorn, romantic johns. 
</P>
<P>
In "Something Nice," Lisette -- a newcomer working girl whose real name is Jane 
-- asks Fred, her second customer, how it's done. Smitten by her honesty, Fred 
returns for more too often; Jane tries, and eventually succeeds at, pushing him 
away. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Do you really think it's a good idea for you to come see me every night? 
It's awfully expensive. I know lawyers make a lot of money, but still. Won't 
your wife wonder where it's going?' 
</P>
<P>
". . . 'Don't you see how special you are? No other girl I've seen like this 
would ever have thought to say something like that. All they can think of is 
how to get more money out of you. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Aren't you worried about getting AIDS?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'From a girl like you? C'mon, don't put yourself down.' " 
</P>
<P>
Suffering pervades these tales: in "Secretary," the story of a young woman 
sexually abused by her boss; in "Connection," about a woman longing for the 
ex-best friend with whom she once shared "a complex system of reassurance and 
support for self-involved fantasies"; and in "An Affair, Edited," when a man 
bumps into a former lover whose presence he can't shake. 
</P>
<P>
Gaitskill's stories are exciting to read because they make voyeurs of us the 
way all good fiction should. You come away believing that you've gotten the 
real goods about life on this particular edge. 
</P>
<P>
The publication of "Bad Behavior" heralds the arrival of a strong, new talent 
on the literary scene. Gaitskill's clear, direct and distinctive voice 
humanizes this dark underbelly world, making understandable why people choose 
to live there.

"Trump Card" Host Selected: Real estate developer and casino tycoon Donald 
Trump has reached into sports television for the host of his new game show, 
"Trump Card," to be produced by Lorimar Television. NBC football analyst Jimmy 
Cefalo has been named to host the show, scheduled to debut next fall. Cefalo 
joined NBC in 1985 after playing for the Miami Dolphins from 1978-84. The daily 
syndicated show, based on the British game show "Full House," will combine 
elements of bingo with viewers' playing on cards at home. Although Trump might 
make an appearance on the program, he has said he does not expect to play a 
major creative role in it. CLAUDIA PUIG

Writing Well: Actor-producer Robert Guillame, star of "Benson," announced 
Monday that he will sponsor a writing competition for minority students. The 
Robert Guillame Writing Competition is limited to students at 150 selected 
black colleges and universities around the country and is intended to encourage 
young writers to write for television. First-prize honors will be $5,000 and a 
development deal with Guillame's production company, Longridge Enterprises. 
Second- and third-place winners will receive $2,000 and $1,000 respectively. 
Guillame will also arrange for leading entertainment literary agencies to read 
the finalist's scripts so that finalists can obtain representation. CLAUDIA

A New Akroyd/Dixon: It's a girl for actor Dan Aykroyd and his actress-wife, 
Donna Dixon. Danielle Alexandra weighed 8 pounds, 13 ounces when she took her 
first breath of air at 12:05 p.m. on Nov. 18, said Susan Patricola, publicist 
for the couple. The couple wanted to get the baby out of St. John's Hospital 
and Health Center and home for Thanksgiving before a birth announcement was 
made, Patricola said Monday. "They're thrilled with their new arrival. She's 
healthy and beautiful and they're looking forward to parenthood," Patricola 
said. CLAUDIA PUIG

One of two brothers who turned in a fugitive spy seven years ago received the 
death sentence for killing a U.S. Forest Service agent. At a hearing in 
Sandpoint, 1st District Judge Watt Prather sentenced James Pratt, 30, to die 
for the fatal shooting of Brent Jacobson. Joe Pratt, 28, was sentenced to life 
in prison. Jacobson, 41, was ambushed Jan. 12 while tracking the Pratts after 
they had tried to rob and kidnap a Sagle, Ida., resident. Both men were 
convicted of first-degree murder. They and a third brother in 1982 tipped off 
U.S. marshals to the whereabouts of fugitive spy Christopher Boyce after they 
had helped Boyce, who had escaped from prison, rob banks in three states.

The farming community of Acme ended its search for 18-year-old Amanda Stavik 
with the discovery of her body in the shallow Nooksack River near her home. She 
had been missing since she went jogging Friday with her dog while home from 
college on Thanksgiving break. The dog returned alone. Authorities believe 
Stavik was abducted, said Whatcom County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Peterson, who 
refused to discuss the condition of the remains or the cause of death pending 
an autopsy. Peterson said there were no suspects in the case and that anyone 
who might have noticed anything suspicious along Highway 9, near which Stavik 
was last seen jogging about 3 miles from her home, should contact police.

A gravely ill, 22-year-old woman received a liver transplant in San Francisco 
after a frantic search for a donor organ that included the efforts of Olympic 
gold medalist Carl Lewis. Officials feared that they would not find a 
replacement organ in time to save Wendy Marx, who suffers from hepatitis B. But 
with the aid of a public plea from Lewis, the new liver was obtained from an 
accident victim in the East. Lewis, who won six gold medals and a silver medal 
during the last two Olympics, is writing his autobiography with the aid of 
Marx's brother, Jeffrey Marx. The woman was listed in stable condition after 
the transplant operation.

A convicted murderer tried to swim to freedom from San Quentin Prison only to 
be collared by a correctional officer just 30 yards from shore. Officials said 
the inmate managed to slip out of the maximum-security section of the prison 
and jump into San Francisco Bay before he was spotted by Sgt. G.H. Riley, who 
grabbed the prisoner and pulled him back to the beach. The inmate was not 
identified, but officials said he was serving two consecutive life terms for 
murder convictions.

USIU WINS UGLY BUT EASILY AGAINST SONOMA

As U.S. International was well on its way to a 110-94 victory over visiting 
Sonoma State in one of those unattractive early-season games Monday, a lone 
voice carried from the crowd of 160 at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you leave your starters in there a little longer, coach?" the 
partisan Sonoma State fan yelled. "Why don't you score another 50 points?" 
</P>
<P>
The fan's critique did not get USIU Coach Gary Zarecky in a pique. Instead, he 
was grateful. Zarecky has waited five years to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
"When he said that, I remembered four years ago when I was driving to Golden 
Hall to play a Division II team and we were the underdog," Zarecky said. "What 
a change four years make. That means we're doing something right with the 
program. To me it was a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
That was more than Zarecky had for his team's play against Sonoma State (2-1), 
which advanced to the NCAA Division II tournament last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ugly," Zarecky said. "With a capital U." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky should not have expected anything more considering he cleared his bench 
with 2:53 remaining -- in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the Gulls' 13 players scored and USIU was never threatened after 
taking a 16-14 lead. USIU led by only 55-45 at the half, but ran that to 80-63 
midway through the second half and 110-88 with two minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Kevin Bradshaw (28 points) and Steve Smith (20) led the Gulls. Forward 
Demetrius Laffitte added 19 points and 13 rebounds. Creedence Perkins led the 
Cossacks with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
And although USIU was always in control, it never really played under control. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried different players with different combinations and that can get out of 
sync with the starters," Zarecky said. "It's a 'W' and for this program, a 'W' 
is an important thing." 
</P>
<P>
But Zarecky couldn't be faulted for being concerned about his team's play. He 
knows the Gulls will have to play a polished game when they play at No. 16 
Oklahoma in the Sooners' season opener Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They were out there for themselves, but at what point do you say as a coach, 
'let them have fun,' " Zarecky said. "But it's not going to be fun Wednesday 
night."

DAVE MURPHY RESIGNS AS SIMI GRID COACH AFTER SIX SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Murphy has resigned as football coach at Simi Valley High, six years after 
accepting the position and four years after the school's only Marmonte League 
grid championship. 
</P>
<P>
In six seasons, Murphy became the second winningest football coach in Simi 
Valley history, despite a 1-19 record over the past two. He compiled a career 
21-40-1 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy on Saturday tendered a two-page letter of resignation to Simi Valley 
Principal Dave Ellis, who set no timetable in finding a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons for resigning, Murphy mentioned the problems a three-year 
high school like Simi Valley has in competing against four-year schools in the 
Marmonte League. He also said that football has maintained a lower priority 
than other sports on the Simi Valley campus. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy will retain his duties as coach of the girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when you have to leave gracefully," Murphy said. "I've seen 
very little progress in certain areas. It wasn't anybody's fault, but it's not 
getting done. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy. I know what I'm doing is right." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said he accepted the resignation with mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame Dave for the decision he made," he said. "He has been a class 
guy always."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: CONCERNED USD BRACES FOR SANTA BARBARA

<TEXT>
<P>
Two dates in the past year make tonight's (7:30) basketball game against UC 
Santa Barbara a worrisome one for University of San Diego Coach Hank Egan. The 
other date proves anything can happen in the early portion of the college 
basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3, 1988, USD barely had its warm-ups off before UCSB assumed leads of 
11 and 22 points en route to a 76-58 romp in Goleta. It was one of USD's few 
lopsided losses of an 8-20 season. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a similar script favored UCSB over Pepperdine, 67-46, in both 
team's season opener. Pepperdine is picked by some to win the West Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
In the preseason, UCSB lost to Athletes in Action, 85-81. The Toreros beat AIA, 
85-84. 
</P>
<P>
UCSB finished 21-9 in 1988-89, including a first-round loss in the National 
Invitation Tournament. In the Pepperdine game, the Gauchos were led by Gary 
Gray who had a career-high 24 points. Eric McArthur had 15 points and 11 
rebounds. UCSB, which has won 20 of its last 21 nonconference games, 
out-rebounded the Waves, 42-27. 
</P>
<P>
USD won its opener against Cal Lutheran, 82-46. USD's John Jerome had 15 
points, Dondi Bell 13 and Gylan Dottin 12. UCSB leads the series, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego All-College tournament begins today and runs through Saturday at 
the University of San Diego. The tournament is open to all full-time college 
students in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
USD sophomore Jose Luis Noriega (No. 6 in the Volvo/ITCA Collegiate rankings) 
is the defending singles and doubles champion (with teammate David Stewart). 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded players all received first-round byes, but La Jolla's fifth and 
sixth-seeded players both advanced in the men's 45 singles of the Beach Club 
Invitational at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Bob Seymour defeated Tom Laughlin of Del Mar, 7-5, 6-3, and No. 6 Bill 
Bond ousted San Diego's Joe Hathaway, 7-5, 6-1. The second round continues 
today. JIM LINDGREN

SUMMIT HEALTH HIRES PRESIDENT TO NURSE FIRM BACK TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summit Health Ltd., which operates 21 hospitals and 21 nursing homes and 
retirement centers, is seriously ill itself. The 12-year-old company lost $15 
million in the past two years, piled up a mountain of debt and watched its 
stock plunge to $1.50 a share from $14 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
What's the solution? Summit founder and Chairman Don Freeberg, and the rest of 
Summit's board, think that they found part of the answer last month in a 
37-year-old numbers whiz named Donald J. Amaral, who was hired as president and 
chief operating officer after a yearlong search. 
</P>
<P>
Shedding assets also is part of the plan. Last month, Burbank-based Summit said 
its bankers urged the company to weigh the sale of its nursing-home division, 
which accounted for 15% of Summit's $376 million revenues for the fiscal year 
that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
That division already had been pared by the divestiture of 31 nursing homes 
over the past three years, according to Summit's fiscal 1989 annual report. 
During the same period, Summit sold one hospital and closed two others to cut 
its debt load and improve profitability. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever other strategies Freeberg and Amaral have in store for Summit, 
they're not sharing them publicly. Both declined to be interviewed, as did Vice 
Chairman John E. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, one thing is for sure: Freeberg, Anderson and the other directors 
have more riding on the company's turnaround than just fiduciary duty to the 
public stockholders. Lots of their own money also is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
According to Summit's latest proxy statement, issued Oct. 18, Freeberg, through 
his 93%-owned Sierra Land Group Inc., and his two sons control 56% of Summit's 
stock, worth about $26.4 million. But the value of their stake has plunged 71% 
since early 1988, when Summit's stock traded for $5.25 a share in the 
over-the-counter market. Summit's directors and officers as a group own 66% of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Summit began looking for a new president a year ago, after William L. 
Pierpoint, who had held the post since 1977, resigned. Summit gave no 
explanation for his departure. But a money manager who owns Summit stock and 
who asked not to be identified said that with the company sagging under 
Pierpoint's leadership, "they mutually agreed that he should go." 
</P>
<P>
Pierpoint remains a director and still owns 11% of the stock, according to the 
proxy statement. Freeberg assumed the president's post during the search for 
Pierpoint's successor. 
</P>
<P>
Amaral, who has a master's degree in business administration from UCLA, came to 
Summit from Mediplex Group Inc., a health-care unit of Avon Products. Amaral 
was president and chief executive of Mediplex, based in Wellesley, Mass., and 
had plans to expand Mediplex with Avon's backing. But in 1988, Avon decided to 
largely abandon the health-care field and began divesting Mediplex's assets, so 
Amaral quit. 
</P>
<P>
Amaral "left because the mission that brought him here and attracted him, in 
terms of expansion, was gone," said William J. Hartigan, who succeeded Amaral 
as Mediplex's president. 
</P>
<P>
Amaral had spent 10 years working in various financial posts for the hospital 
group of National Medical Enterprises, a Los Angeles-based health-care concern. 
</P>
<P>
Hartigan said Amaral has the credentials to help Summit, whose local facilities 
include the Woodland Care Center in Reseda, Midway Hospital Medical Center in 
Los Angeles and St. Luke Medical Center in Pasadena. The company employs about 
4,600 people. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very bright, with very good management ability," Hartigan said. "He's an 
exceptional talent around numbers. He could do them in his head faster than I 
could do them with my calculator." 
</P>
<P>
Summit's numbers certainly present Amaral with a challenge. In fiscal 1989, 
Summit lost $8.4 million, and its long-term debt as of June 30 of $137 million 
-- although down 4% from a year earlier -- remained nearly twice as large as 
Summit's equity, or net worth. By contrast, the net worth of Humana Inc., one 
of the biggest health-care concerns, is about equal to its long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
Summit's fiscal 1989 loss stemmed in part from a $15.5-million provision for 
the company's losses on the sale or closure of assets during the year, which 
included the closing of a loss-ridden hospital in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
Excluding the provision, Summit's pretax income from operations tumbled 82% to 
$1.2 million, from $6.8 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to further cut its debt, Summit last January also suspended its 
semiannual dividend of 2 cents per share. And Summit can't pay future dividends 
without approval from its bank lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Summit's problems grew serious in the mid-1980s, after the company aggressively 
raised cash for acquisitions, including an initial public offering of stock 
(priced at $7 a share), bank borrowings and its issuance of $86.3 million of 
high-yield "junk bonds" 
</P>
<P>
(of which $49 million remained due as of June 30). 
</P>
<P>
Just as Summit was gearing up to expand, financial trends in the health-care 
field began undergoing major changes that subsequently put pressure on the 
industry's profits. Specifically, Medicare, the federal health insurer for the 
elderly that accounts for up to half of some hospitals' revenue, began to clamp 
down on its costs in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare once reimbursed hospitals with a fee based on each service given to a 
Medicare patient. But to encourage hospitals and doctors to cut costs, the 
government switched to a system of paying a flat fee based only on the 
patient's ailment. 
</P>
<P>
This new system often forces hospitals to perform fewer tests and discharge 
patients sooner to earn a profit on each patient. But the shorter visits, 
together with the growth of health maintenance organizations (HMOs), have 
reduced hospitals' overall occupancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
Summit's U. S. hospitals "have been experiencing declining occupancy levels and 
average lengths of hospital stays for the past few years," the company stated. 
The average occupancy rate, for example, fell to 42% in fiscal 1989 from 48% in 
fiscal 1986, Summit said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, "reimbursement from Medicare and other governmental programs have 
lagged behind increases in labor and other costs" at Summit, the company stated 
in its fiscal 1989 10-K, an annual financial report that publicly held 
companies must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Even outside the United States and the Medicare regulations, Summit is 
struggling. The company has a 60% stake in Orbit Summit Health, a partnership 
that manages several hospitals in Saudi Arabia. But Summit has decided that the 
business -- which kicked in $20.2 million of Summit's fiscal 1989 revenue -- is 
not worth the cost and is trying to sell its interest in the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Amaral has some room in which to work. As of June 30, Summit's current assets 
-- its cash on hand plus money the company expects to receive within a year -- 
totaled $119 million. That was nearly twice as much as Summit's current 
liabilities, or bills due within the year, including the payments on its 
long-term debt of $69.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Amaral could get a bigger cushion if Summit continues shedding properties and 
uses the cash to reduce its debts. Even so, he will remain under pressure to 
control Summit's costs if the company is to turn steady profits over the long 
haul because the government's efforts to curb health-care expenses are unlikely 
to abate anytime soon.

HITS PROVE HARD TO FIND AT DICK CLARK PRODUCTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN MEDIOCRE SINCE THE COMPANY WENT PUBLIC IN 
1987. ATTEMPTS CONTINUE TO LAUNCH A SUCCESSFUL GAME SHOW OR SITCOM. 
</P>

<P>
All the cats watched "American Bandstand," Dick Clark's rock 'n' roll 
television show, back when Chuck Berry released "Sweet Little Sixteen" in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
But 31 years later, the stars rock around the clock for video junkies on MTV 
and other music video channels. That's bad news for "Bandstand," which 
disappeared from TV after Oct. 7, when it had its last USA cable network 
airing. The show ultimately will be replaced in the same time slot by a 
look-alike music program, "Dance Party U.S.A.," and a teen-oriented magazine 
show called "Youthquake." 
</P>
<P>
It's the first time since Clark took over "Bandstand" in 1956 that the show has 
been out of production. But though it's an American cultural icon, the show's 
cable cancellation came with a whimper and not a bang. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Clark -- "Bandstand's" host for 33 years -- said the show's not 
dead. He'll try to bring "Bandstand" back on prime-time network TV. Moreover, 
America's oldest teen-ager had already quit hosting the show, which was aired 
only on cable since April and hadn't been seen on ABC-TV, its home for three 
decades, for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the cancellation was symbolic of the times for Dick Clark Productions, 
the Burbank company that produced it. The company badly needs a sitcom or game 
show in regular production to smooth out its history of bumpy earnings caused 
by a reliance on revenues from the periodic musical and comedy specials it 
produces. 
</P>
<P>
When Dick Clark Productions went public early in 1987 and raised $8.2 million, 
the company planned to expand into game shows, sitcoms and dramatic TV. (Clark 
and his wife, Karen, own about 76% of the company.) Then, as now, the plan was 
to keep generating new program ideas until one took off. 
</P>
<P>
"One successful game show, one successful series, and everybody will be happy," 
said Clark in a recent interview. "One will beget another, which will beget 
another." 
</P>
<P>
But since the public offering, revenues have tailed off and profits have 
gyrated. The company's stock still trades at about $6.50 a share -- its 
original offering price. Part of the problem has been a competitive market for 
new TV shows, exacerbated by the continued success of many shows already on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's company has failed to produce a successful series and continues to rely 
largely on specials. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make it on specials alone," said industry analyst Harold Vogel of 
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Specials, however, make up most of Dick Clark Productions' schedule -- although 
the company declined to break down its earnings by show. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four 1989-90 season series listed in the company's most recent annual 
report, "American Bandstand" is already off the air, and "Trial by Jury" -- a 
courtroom drama -- may soon follow, said Francis C. La Maina, the company's 
president and chief operating officer. One show, "Dick Clark Presents," aired 
only six times in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
What's left, for the most part, are specials. Some are successful perennials: 
Dick Clark has produced "New Year's Rockin' Eve" for 18 years, the "American 
Music Awards" for 17 years and the "Academy of Country Music Awards" for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But some, like "Farm Aid IV" and "The Ice Stars' Hollywood Revue," have 
appeared only once and have an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
That means the company's creative staff has to reinvent the wheel each year 
just to keep rolling at the same pace. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, it also means that revenues come in fits and spurts, not a steady stream 
-- creating stark quarter-to-quarter contrasts. After a fairly strong fiscal 
year that ended June 30, in which Dick Clark earned $2.6 million on revenue of 
$25.6 million, the company's earnings for the first quarter that ended Sept. 30 
plunged 97% to $14,000 from $435,000 a year earlier, despite a 47% jump in 
revenue to $6.9 million from $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the volatility: in the first quarter last year, the television 
company was producing a couple of series -- including "Bandstand" -- that 
generated respectable profit margins. This year, most of Dick Clark 
Productions' first-quarter revenues came from an expensive made-for-TV movie 
that exceeded its budget, cutting into profits. 
</P>
<P>
One of Dick Clark's bids for a regular series is a game show pilot called "The 
Challengers" -- a quiz show Clark would host. The program would focus on 
up-to-date news and entertainment topics. Buena Vista Television, the 
syndication arm of Walt Disney Co., already has sold the show to at least 10 TV 
stations around the country, according to Buena Vista representative Andi 
Sporkin. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, NBC has commissioned Dick Clark and another production company to 
produce a pilot for a revived version of "Let's Make a Deal." 
</P>
<P>
But what's behind Door No. 1 for Dick Clark in game shows could be 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
For one, there's plenty of competition. "It'll be pretty hard, I think, because 
there are many doing the same thing," said Merrill Lynch's Vogel. In fact, 
about 45 game shows are now in development and vying for air time, said 
Sporkin. 
</P>
<P>
Among those, one heavyweight contender will be "Monopoly," a TV version of the 
classic board game, produced by Merv Griffin Enterprises, the company that 
created "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune." 
</P>
<P>
So Dick Clark is also working on pilot scripts for sitcoms. One would star the 
Motown recording group, The Boys. "The script has gone and it's . . . been 
received well. It looks very good for a pilot," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Another pilot script the company is working on is based on the Judy Blume book 
"Just as Long as We're Together." 
</P>
<P>
Counting on a sitcom or series success has its pitfalls too. For the most part, 
such series are so expensive to write and film that their producers don't 
profit from them until they're sold for rerun syndication. But to make it as a 
rerun, a show has to last three or four years as a first-run series. Meanwhile, 
production costs are up front. 
</P>
<P>
It takes considerable resources to bankroll that kind of gamble. And La Maina 
admits that Dick Clark's bigger rivals are better prepared for the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can compete on the same level," said La Maina. "We can't have 
15 or 20 writers under contract." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the company's need for a breakthrough, Clark said he had no plans to 
try to match his bigger competitors' spending on a single project to create a 
success. "If anybody wants to criticize us they'd say we've been too 
conservative," said Clark. "But we're not in the business of spending the money 
in a dangerous way. With one or two modest successes, everybody will be very 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Clark still has a few other businesses besides Dick Clark Productions. Clark 
and La Maina own Olive Enterprises, which essentially leases to Dick Clark both 
the building that houses the company and the right to use the name "American 
Bandstand." 
</P>
<P>
That right could become important soon. A subsidiary of the production company 
has entered into a deal with an East Coast real estate company to develop an 
American Bandstand Grill restaurant in Miami, and La Maina said he hopes the 
restaurant will become the first of a chain. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make the asset work in different ways," La Maina said of the 
"Bandstand" trademark. Being off the air "may add value to the company because 
it now has legendary status," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A former Utica, N.Y., newsman, Clark started in television production in 1956 
when he took over "Bandstand," a local music program on television in 
Philadelphia. Within a year, ABC brought the show to national television, 
dubbing it "American Bandstand" and giving Clark the boost he needed to start a 
series of businesses, one of which eventually became Dick Clark Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, approaching 60, said he's eager to show that his company can do more 
than specials and musical variety shows. "Absolutely, that's the only reason 
this whole world of entertainment is so fascinating," he said. "It's always new 
challenges. It's a great boon for your head. You never get bored." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he is looking forward to results, too -- to the day when observers 
might look at the company's strategy and say "Gee, aren't they smart." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "Right now you can't say that."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC: AWARDS ASIDE, S.D. PIANISTS HONOR THEIR 
PROFESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH K. HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite its reputation as a fun-in-the-sun, laid-back haven, San Diego County 
has contributed its share of diligent and accomplished young pianists to the 
larger musical world. A triumvirate of local musicians, Gustavo Romero, Kevin 
Kenner, and David Korevaar developed their talents here before pursuing 
advanced studies and careers on the East Coast. Each has successfully competed 
for acclaim in a field crowded with able aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, Romero, who has earned the greatest amount of international 
attention, has kept his local ties in best repair. This summer he won 
Switzerland's Clara Haskell Competition before embarking on a tour. Yet he made 
his usual San Diego fall pilgrimage this month, appearing as soloist with the 
International Orchestra and playing a solo recital on the same weekend. It is 
unusual for a season to pass without a generous supply of Romero performances. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner, the Coronado native who captured momentary media attention as the only 
American semifinalist in this year's Van Cliburn Competition, has rarely 
performed in the area since he began his studies at Baltimore's Peabody 
Conservatory. His next local appearance will not be until April, 1990, when he 
will play Grieg's ubiquitous Piano Concerto with the San Diego State University 
Orchestra under music director Donald Barra. 
</P>
<P>
On the local scene, former La Jollan David Korevaar has been more visible than 
Kenner, but he rarely plays outside La Jolla. This Saturday, the 27-year-old 
pianist will make his recital debut on the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's 
Sherwood Auditorium Series. The society had sponsored a benefit recital for 
Korevaar in 1984 to sponsor his New York City debut, but that benefit program 
was not part of the society's prestigious chamber music series. 
</P>
<P>
Like his colleagues, Korevaar has found the competition route conducive to 
career building. His 1985 Peabody-Mason award -- a not to be sneered at $40,000 
-- and the top prize at the 1988 William Kapell Competition have kept Korevaar 
visible. While pursuing his performing career, he continues to enter 
competitions, largely for the publicity value. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm careful to mention only those competitions in which I have done well," 
said Korevaar from his home in Norwalk, Conn. "In August, I entered the Robert 
Casadesus Competition in Cleveland, where I won the prize for the best 
performance of a work by a French composer." 
</P>
<P>
Korevaar paused and then conceded, "But that was more of a consolation prize 
from a few judges who felt I should have ranked higher in the competition 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Though he is not a rabid crusader for new music, Korevaar's innovative 
programming frequently favors new compositions. The first half of his La Jolla 
recital will be divided between Mozart and Brahms, but he will also play his 
own single-movement Second Sonata (1985) and Ernst von Dohnanyi's rarely heard 
"Ruralia Hungarica." 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had an affinity for Dohnanyi," he said. "I programmed his music on 
my New York debut. The 'Ruralia' is a relatively late work in the composer's 
career, highly personal and full of spectacular virtuosity." 
</P>
<P>
Korevaar spends the other half of his performing dates with Hexagon, an unusual 
chamber music ensemble made up of piano and woodwind quintet. 
</P>
<P>
Kudos for SONOR. The Schoenberg Institute of the USC School of Music has 
announced that UC San Diego's SONOR contemporary will perform the fourth and 
final installment of its "Homage to Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire" on Jan. 25 at 
the institute. The ambitious project, inaugurated by the San Francisco 
Contemporary Players in 1987, has commissioned leading composers to write their 
own musical settings of Albert Giraud's poems not selected by Schoenberg for 
his landmark 1912 "Pierrot lunaire." Soprano Carol Plantamura will be SONOR's 
featured soloist in this concert. 
</P>
<P>
North County Culture. Violinist David Kim will conclude his week-long residency 
in Carlsbad with a performance Friday night at the Carlsbad Community Cultural 
Art Center. Part of the Affiliate Artist program of the Pacific Telesis 
Foundation, Kim will present eight informal musical programs at schools, 
retirement homes, and service clubs throughout the North County city. Since his 
splashy debut at the 1986 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow -- he was the only 
American violinist to win a top prize -- he has enjoyed solo performances with 
the Moscow State Symphony and a respectable number of American orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Go for Baroque. San Diego's intrepid Early Music Society will open its 1989-90 
season at the La Jolla Congregational Church with a concert Sunday by Trio a 
Corde, a Baroque ensemble of violin, viola da gamba and lute. Each member of 
the Los Angeles-based trio plays a period instrument, which gives this 
specialized chamber music its authentic sound. This concert may also be the 
only local opportunity to hear works by Uccelini and Zamboni on the same 
program.

COUNCIL URGED TO OK PANEL'S ETHICS PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council members Gloria Molina and Marvin Braude called Monday 
for quick adoption of a code of ethics proposed by the mayor's blue-ribbon 
panel and, if necessary, abandonment of the council's own attempts at drafting 
such a code. 
</P>
<P>
Molina, in a written statement, asked the council's ad hoc committee on ethics 
to immediately convene and recommend to the City Council that "we adopt the 
entire . . . ethics package" released by Mayor Tom Bradley's special ethics 
commission last week. 
</P>
<P>
Braude has also thrown his support behind the ethics commission's proposals. He 
said he will call for a full council vote on the proposals if the council's 
ethics committee cannot come to general agreement on its own package by Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said he will urge his colleagues, "Let's go. Stand up and be counted." 
And he said council members will need a "damn good reason not to support" the 
reforms, or they could face public criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping reform measure drafted by the mayor's commission calls for a ban 
on outside employment, gifts and honorariums for elected officials, a 
toughening of financial disclosure regulations, a cap on campaign spending and 
partial public financing 
</P>
<P>
of city political campaigns. In addition, the commission proposed a procedure 
for appointing a special prosecutor for politically sensitive cases, such as 
the Bradley conflict-of-interest scandal, and establishing an independent 
ethics agency. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was established by Bradley in April, the day after his close 
election to an unprecedented fifth term in office. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has continued to face questions about his personal finances, including 
his relationship with Far East National Bank, which received $3 million in city 
deposits. The bank paid Bradley $18,000 as an adviser in 1988 -- money later 
returned by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the city attorney's office in September concluded that there was 
insufficient evidence to prosecute Bradley for conflict of interest. But City 
Atty. James K. Hahn criticized Bradley's ethical conduct and sued him for 
failure to properly disclose his financial holdings. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury is currently investigating Bradley's ties to Far East and 
seven other financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the City Council began its effort to draft new ethics laws but has 
become bogged down by differences among its four members in key areas such as 
bans on outside employment and acceptance of gifts and honorariums. The 
committee has also avoided the issue of campaign finance reform, a critical 
component of the mayoral commission's package. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has set a February deadline for City Council adoption of its 
proposals, or it will seek voter approval of the code of ethics through a 
ballot initiative, said commission Chairman Geoffrey Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners have formed a "watch committee" of prominent civic, business 
and labor leaders to ensure that the reforms are enacted. 
</P>
<P>
The positions taken by Braude and Molina are among the first public stances 
taken by council members in what is expected to be a divisive debate over 
ethics reform. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, through a spokesman, said Monday that he did not feel 
it was necessary to respond to Molina's request for quick committee action. 
Woo's spokeswoman, Julie Jaskol, said an ethics committee meeting was scheduled 
Thursday to discuss Woo's earlier proposals for tighter regulation of 
lobbyists. No date had yet been set to discuss the ethics commission report. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, another committee member, urged restraint and a 
full public airing of the proposals. "The City Council should not be stampeded 
into approving any new ethics reforms without a full analysis of their intended 
and unintended effects," Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, the fourth member of the committee, has not 
made public her position on the ethics reform package. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the council members were in Atlanta on Monday.

DROPOUT PROBLEM BURDENS JUNIOR HIGHS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: RATE IS PUT AT 7.4% IN L.A. DISTRICT, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW 
THE SCHOOLS ARE RUN. OFFICIALS STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE 
DIFFICULTIES AND TO MAKE THE CLASSROOM MORE APPEALING.

<P>
More than 8,000 junior high school students in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District dropped out last year, offering troubling evidence that junior highs 
-- as well as high schools -- have a serious dropout problem. 
</P>
<P>
Many local educators say the new findings suggest that junior high -- an 
institution often described as being caught in the middle, lacking direction 
and adequate resources -- may be in sore need of an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report from the district's dropout prevention office showed that 7.4% 
of the school system's 117,000 sixth-to-ninth graders -- or 8,680 students -- 
dropped out of junior high during the 1987-88 school year, the latest for which 
statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate ranged from 1.76% at Dodson Junior High in San Pedro to 28.46% 
at Bethune in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the scope and causes of the dropout problem in junior 
high in part because most states, including California, ask school systems to 
report dropouts only from the 10th grade on. The Los Angeles district began 
counting junior high dropouts on its own three years ago, but made the latest 
figures available as part of school board hearings on the dropout problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're flying blind right now," said state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill 
Honig. "We know (dropping out in junior high) is a potential problem. But I 
don't think people really know that much about it. We haven't been keeping 
score."

<P>
The district's overall junior high dropout rate actually declined from 14.4% in 
1985-86 and 10.19% in 1986-87. School officials say the decline may signal 
better reporting by schools, although others say some schools may be 
undercounting dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Dropout studies generally focus on the senior high years, when the hemorrhaging 
is most severe. Nationally, about 25% of students fail to finish high school, 
and in large cities, such as Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, the rate ranges 
between 40% and 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' 7.4% rate in junior high reflects the number of 
sixth-through-ninth graders who dropped out over the course of one year. Most 
of the district's junior highs run from seventh to ninth grade, so that could 
translate into at least a 20% dropout rate overall for the graduating class of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some junior high principals suspect that the figures are too low. But others 
complain that the current methods of conducting dropout surveys are unreliable 
and exaggerate the problem. Some of the students recorded as dropouts may be 
enrolled in another district, for instance, but if they have not requested a 
transfer of their school records, the district assumes they are not in school. 
</P>
<P>
Although he disputed the accuracy of the district's figures, Gompers Junior 
High Principal Ron Sakoda said, "We know what occurs and we're trying to 
prevent it. For (students) to drop out at junior high school age is just 
deadly." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reasons why students drop out in junior high are the same as in 
senior high, experts say. Students who are older than their classmates because 
they have had to repeat grades, who have low self-esteem and are failing 
academically, or who lack strong parental guidance are prime candidates. Drug 
abuse, gang involvement and pregnancy also cause many students to abandon 
school. 
</P>
<P>
But educators believe factors unique to the junior high experience also cause 
dropouts. District statistics show that most junior high dropouts leave in the 
seventh grade, when junior high begins. Larry Glenn, an El Sereno Junior High 
School science teacher, said, "They're coming from elementary school to a big 
zoo," and some students may feel lost. 
</P>
<P>
Often, several factors combine to produce a dropout. On a recent morning, for 
example, El Sereno Junior High School dropout counselor Ana Maria Romero gently 
questioned a teary-eyed eighth-grade boy who had already missed half of the 
first 10 weeks of classes. The boy told her that he feels dumb and can't keep 
up with class work. To make matters worse, his parents apparently do little to 
force him to attend school. In fact, they write excuse notes for him so that he 
won't be marked truant. 
</P>
<P>
Romero promised to provide him with extra tutoring after school and planned to 
contact his parents. Without special attention, he might well become a dropout, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Board of Education President Jackie Goldberg said that cultural 
beliefs may contribute to the district's junior high dropout problem. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the district's 610,000 pupils are Latino, many of them 
immigrants. "In some countries," said Goldberg, "the expectation is that being 
educated means (finishing) elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
In Goldberg's view, this could explain why more than a third of the junior high 
dropouts in the 1987-88 school year fell into the "no-show" category -- 
students who were expected to enroll in junior high but never appeared at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, schools find that the no-shows include immigrant students who 
returned with their families to their native country -- Mexico, in particular 
-- or who, because of financial difficulties, moved in with relatives in 
another area. Many families who move at the end of the academic year fail to 
notify the school that their children will not be returning. 
</P>
<P>
Some principals criticize the dropout statistics because they count new 
students who fail to show up for school in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people we don't know -- we've never seen them," said Marvin 
Gottlieb, assistant principal of Nobel Junior High School in Northridge, where 
71 of the 95 dropouts recorded in 1987-88 were no-shows. "If they never showed 
up, the school never got a chance to work with them. That should not reflect 
(negatively) on the school." 
</P>
<P>
At Watts' Gompers Junior High, where a 24.59% dropout rate was reported, 
Principal Sakoda said the problem could stem in part from a shortage of "fun" 
elective classes, such as wood shop, which were eliminated due to budget cuts 
beginning about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Supt. Sidney Thompson said junior highs also lack an adequate number of 
counselors to reach out to potential dropouts. "The thing that burns me up 
about this is that we know that outreach programs work. But the resources are 
spread very thin. What happens is pretty soon kids start to slip through the 
cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Junior highs have about one counselor for every 400 or 500 students, Thompson 
said. Twelve of the district's 73 junior highs have an additional dropout 
prevention counselor paid for with special state funds. 
</P>
<P>
At Nimitz Junior High School in Huntington Park, one of the 12 schools in the 
state-funded program, dropout counselor Ryan Scott said overall student 
attendance has improved from 93% to 95% in two years, in large part because of 
special efforts he has mounted to reward good attendance. "We have to get the 
kids in school before we can work on their academics and behavior and 
attitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the district runs 16 student assistance centers that provide 
would-be dropouts with small group instruction and extra counseling. An 
independent evaluator found that the centers' dropout rate was 7% in 1987-88, 
slightly lower than the district average of 7.4%. But the centers are able to 
serve only 4,500 students a year. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of educators believe that the problem is the basic structure 
of the traditional junior high, which presents students with too drastic a 
change from elementary school. Aside from coping with traumatic physical 
changes associated with puberty, junior high students are asked to adjust to a 
totally different school pattern. Instead of having the same teacher and 
classroom all year, they suddenly have six or seven teachers, and different 
classmates and rooms every period. Moreover, they have to carry books, remember 
locker combinations and suffer the indignities of dressing and showering for 
gym. And, junior highs are bigger, more impersonal places, with perhaps 1,000 
to 3,000 instead of 300 to 600 students. 
</P>
<P>
Junior high may represent "more of a shock for kids," UCLA education professor 
and dropout expert James Catterall surmised, "and some kids fail to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
The solution, some junior high teachers and administrators in Los Angeles and 
other districts across the country say, is to reorganize the schools to soften 
the transition from the elementary grades and make junior high a friendlier 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles district junior highs have taken the approach of creating a 
separate school-within-a-school for high-risk students. At one campus, 
Hollenbeck in East Los Angeles, the entire school of 2,300 students was 
reorganized this year into five separate clusters or "casitas." Each 
mini-school has 466 students, 17 teachers -- including one "lead teacher" who 
carries a lighter class load and helps supervise instruction -- a counselor and 
coordinator. Students will stay with the same classmates and teachers for all 
of junior high. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to create a warm environment that is academically productive and 
that makes kids feel good about being here," said Hollenbeck Principal Evelyn 
Lucero. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is too early to judge whether the new approach will discourage 
dropouts, Lucero said student attendance already has improved school-wide. 
</P>
<P>
At El Sereno Junior High School, 180 of the 2,600 students belong to Partners 
in Learning, a mini-school created last year through the efforts of teacher 
Larry Torres and dropout prevention counselor Romero. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the students in the program are considered at risk of 
becoming dropouts, Romero said. Teachers are encouraged to collaborate on 
lessons and confer with each other about their students during weekly meetings 
before school, an aspect of the program that aids quicker identification of 
truancy problems. 
</P>
<P>
"One teacher can say, 'Is anyone else having a problem with Joe?' " said 
Romero, "and another person may say, 'Oh, yeah, Joe's father left the home.' 
There's more cohesiveness this way." 
</P>
<P>
The program also emphasizes cooperation among students. Students tutor each 
other, and the eighth graders are encouraged to "adopt" a seventh grader for 
special attention. Last year, the students and their teachers went on a 
three-day camping trip together, and more such activities are planned to help 
foster a family feeling among the students and staff, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, an eighth grader who was truant during most of the seventh grade and 
almost got kicked out of school, said he likes the program. "The teachers talk 
to you like friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maggie, also an eighth grader, said she would be bored with school if she 
weren't in the program. "We have fun together," she said, recalling the camping 
trip. "The teachers know about us and we know about them." She also likes 
having a fellow student tutor her in math, a subject she said she is failing. 
</P>
<P>
Although only in its second year, the Partners in Learning program has produced 
some encouraging results. Romero said that a study of students in the program 
who read below grade level showed they had a 2.1 grade average, compared to 1.5 
for similar students attending the regular school. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that almost three-quarters of the program's seventh graders last 
year signed up for pre-algebra this year, and 80% say they want to go to 
college. "That is not representative of this school," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
Another component of the program offers parents training and information on how 
to help their children stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, who teaches social studies and helps coordinate the 
school-within-a-school, said he has high hopes for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"In elementary school, kids really like school. In junior high, something 
happens that causes them not to like school. This type of program will make the 
staying power of school greater because the school will feel more like a 
community."

1987-88 JUNIOR HIGH DROPOUT RATES FOR L.A. UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
Here are the Los Angeles Unified School District's dropout rates for junior 
high schools. Most junior highs run from seventh through ninth grade, but 
several have been reorganized as middle schools, which run from sixth through 
eighth grade. The figures show the number of students who dropped out in each 
grade over the course of one year and the dropout rate for each school.

DAY-CARE CENTER SHUT; STATE WIDENS INVESTIGATION; 
</P>
<P>
MOLESTATION: A SECOND MAN IS CHARGED. CLOSING OF THE ECHO PARK FACILITY CATCHES 
PARENTS UNPREPARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State regulators Monday ordered the immediate closure of a city-run day-care 
center in Echo Park where two former workers have been accused of molesting 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Social Services said the action was taken because officials 
perceived an "immediate danger" to children at the facility. Eight other 
state-subsidized day-care centers operated by the city also are under 
investigation because they have the same licensee, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles city attorney on Monday filed misdemeanor charges of 
molestation, lewd conduct and indecent exposure against Simon Bermudez, 37, of 
Los Angeles, a former recreational aide at the Echo Park Recreation Center 
day-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
Eight felony counts of lewd conduct with children already also have been filed 
against Charles Chavez, 33, of Los Angeles, who once drove a van for the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were fired last month after five children made the allegations to Los 
Angeles police. Two other children later came forward with similar accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The state's order required the day-care center to cease operations at 5 p.m. 
Monday because of conduct "inimical to the health, welfare and safety of the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The action, according to department legal counsel Daniel Garcia, grew out of 
the allegations of molestation as well as a long list of other violations of 
the state Health and Safety Code and departmental rules. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the order will remain in effect until an administrative law judge 
hears the case, probably in January. At that time, he said, the agency will 
seek to have the center's 14-month-old license revoked for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Brough, director of the Echo Park Recreation Center, where the day-care 
facility is located, said workers began notifying parents of the closure about 
noon Monday. Many of them, she said, "were disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
"It's putting great hardship on them to have to find child care in 24 hours," 
Brough said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the families served by the center are poor; some paid as little as $40 
a month for a service that can cost $250 a month elsewhere, she said. The 
facility was licensed to serve 49 children. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents seemed bewildered about the closure order when they arrived Monday 
afternoon to pick up their children. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do," said Marta Dorantes of Silverlake, a shoe 
factory worker and mother of a 6-year-old girl. "I'm going to have to quit work 
so I can stay home and take care of her." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Stover, whose 8-year-old son, Salvador, attends the center, appeared 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, two hours' notice is not enough," she said. "We're 
Echo Park. We're low income. We're low on the totem pole. If this were Beverly 
Hills, they would have fixed this up right away." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said in a letter Monday to Recreation and Parks chief Jim 
Hadaway that he was "shocked and dismayed" to learn of the suspension. Bradley 
ordered Hadaway to "immediately comply" with state requirements and identify 
another agency that can operate the program if his department is unable to. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina and officials of the Recreation and Parks Department 
told about 40 parents at a meeting Monday evening that the city would help them 
find alternative day-care facilities. The city will also provide money to 
parents if their alternative centers charge more than the Echo Park facility, 
said Art Gastelum, principal administrative coordinator for Bradley's office. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the molestation allegations, the state accused the center of failing to 
verbally report the molestation accusations to the Department of Social 
Services within 24 hours and failing to report them in writing within seven 
days. The center also was accused of not providing adequate bathroom facilities 
and not separating children from other visitors to the park, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
One of its most serious offenses, he said, was failing to fingerprint employees 
for background checks before they were hired. 
</P>
<P>
A police investigation showed that neither of the suspects were fingerprinted 
before they were allowed to work with children. Police contend that a thorough 
background check on Chavez would have shown he had a criminal record involving 
lewd behavior with a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez was arrested last month and charged with four felony counts of lewd 
behavior with two girls, ages 5 and 10, who said he had fondled them. Four 
other counts were lodged against him last week after a 5-year-old boy and his 
6-year-old sister made similar allegations. He is being held on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Bermudez was also arrested last month, but was released after posting $5,000 
bail. On Monday, he was charged with two counts of child molestation, two 
counts of indecent exposure and three counts of performing a lewd act in front 
of children, said Deputy City Atty. Alice Hand. The misdemeanor charges, she 
said, involve three children who accused Bermudez of either fondling or 
urinating in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosures earlier this month that Chavez and Bermudez had not had their 
backgrounds checked touched off heated complaints from Molina and parents of 
children in the day-care program. In response, city officials ordered the 
immediate fingerprinting of 2,000 part-time workers in the Recreation and Parks 
Department.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEN. GLENN IN PASADENA TO REASSURE DOUBTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), grand marshal of the 1990 Pasadena Tournament of 
Roses Parade, dropped by the Tournament House on Orange Grove Boulevard Monday 
to "straighten out" any doubters who might have questioned his integrity, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn and four other senators are being investigated by a special counsel of 
the Senate Ethics Committee. They are accused of improperly intervening with 
federal regulators on behalf of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan after 
receiving political contributions from its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The senators met twice in 1987 with regulators to question why Lincoln had been 
audited for more than a year. On Monday, Glenn again denied any wrongdoing and 
said he was merely trying to discover why the audit had taken so long. He 
withdrew once he learned the savings and loan was to be investigated by the 
Justice Department, he said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE ORDERED TO PAY TRIAL COST OF $2.1 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Monday added $2.1 million in attorneys 
fees and trial expenses to the $5.5-million civil verdict that the city of 
Torrance was ordered to pay in September when a jury found that six of the 
city's police officers covered up for a colleague after a fatal traffic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Abby Soven ordered Torrance to pay $329,000 in expenses and $1.8 million 
in attorneys fees to the firm of Greene, Broillet, Paul, Simon &amp; Wheeler, 
which represented John Rastello of San Pedro. Rastello's 19-year-old son, 
Kelly, died in a collision with off-duty Torrance Police Sgt. Rollo Green in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
A jury awarded the judgment against Torrance and its officers after finding 
that the Police Department had protected Green as part of a "custom and policy" 
of whitewashing police misconduct. Jurors found that John Rastello's civil 
right to meaningful access to the courts was infringed because Torrance police 
officers did not thoroughly investigate the crash or order a blood-alcohol test 
for Green, who admitted that he had been drinking before the crash.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLE FOUND IN BASE OF GARVEY RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Divers have discovered a hole one foot in diameter that extends at least six 
feet into the 10-foot-thick clay liner at the base of the Garvey Reservoir in 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two weeks residents near the 41-acre reservoir have complained of 
flooding in their yards and basements. As a result of Monday's discovery, the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California announced it will drain the 
reservoir by today and begin repairing the crack and any other damage that is 
uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
So far, city officials said, at least 13 houses have been damaged by water. The 
city has installed water pumps at six houses, but no one has had to leave home 
because of the flooding, said City Manager Mark Lewis. Monterey Park officials 
said they are still pressing the water district on the issue of liability.

JIM MURRAY: TARPLEY WINKS AT TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roy Tarpley Jr., power forward-center for the Dallas Mavericks, is so good, the 
Lakers once considered giving up James Worthy for him. Fortunately, Laker 
General Manager Jerry West threatened to quit if they went through with it. 
</P>
<P>
But Tarpley can play. He was the first-round choice of the Mavericks out of 
Michigan, and he gives them muscle where they need it. He is no Michael Jordan 
around the basket, but he is no bricklayer, either. They voted him the Sixth 
Man Award in '88, which meant he was the best off the bench in the league, in 
the view of those who covered the game most. He gets you the ball, almost 1,000 
rebounds in his first full year. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 7 feet tall, almost 250 pounds, he is a fairly dominating figure in the 
pivot. He gets several thousand dollars a minute -- $9 million over five years. 
But the club takes no nonsense from him. Roy Tarpley is a two-time loser in the 
drug sweep, but when he went missing for 24 hours recently, didn't show up for 
a practice and a mandatory AA meeting, the club threw the book at him. A $250 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when Tarpley got picked up for drunken driving and resisting arrest by 
the Dallas police the other day and he was shown on TV being hustled out of the 
police station after posting bond, I was not quite ready for his reaction. I 
thought he might weep, sob, protest his innocence, charge police brutality or 
even show some embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
He winked. 
</P>
<P>
You heard me. He blinked an eye and cocked the corner of his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you and I know what a wink is. The time-honored way of signaling to the 
gang that this is just a big joke. There's cayenne in the soup, or a rubber 
mouse in the bed, or that cigar is about to explode. A wink indicates that 
you're putting one over on the world. Get ready for a yuk. Watch this. 
</P>
<P>
Given the circumstance that he was on TV, you might have expected Roy to come 
gravely on camera with a contrite, sober plea for forgiveness, understanding, a 
repudiation of what he had done, a promise not to do it again. You may recall 
that Dexter Manley said, in similar circumstances, "I have made a grave mistake 
and showed extremely poor judgment by slipping up." 
</P>
<P>
Not Tarpley. He winked. 
</P>
<P>
A few of us happened to be watching down in Dallas as Roy came on the evening 
news that night and the consensus was, either we didn't understand the 
situation -- or Roy didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Here was the picture: In July of 1988, Tarpley, who led the league in rebounds 
by a rookie, was enrolled in the NBA's watchdog drug agency, ASAP (Adult 
Substance Abuse Program) for alcohol and cocaine dependency. He had a smash 
season after that, 959 rebounds and an average of 13.5 points playing only 28.5 
minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
In January of 1989, Tarpley who had been put on ASAP's random drug-testing 
program, tested positive again and was reinstalled at the ASAP treatment center 
in Van Nuys. Strike 2. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the team April 12, after a 49-game absence. He averaged 22.7 
points and 13.3 rebounds the rest of the season, playing only 33.7 minutes a 
game. The club gave him a three-year extension on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 27, Tarpley missed a practice and an AA meeting and was out of touch 
with everybody for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Tarpley hadn't missed practice Nov. 16. But he had missed a few 
things the night before -- like the freeway buttons, the tailgating law and, 
apparently, the law against drinking and driving. The Dallas police said he was 
drunk. It took six of them to arrest him, so they added resisting arrest. 
Tarpley is used to double-coverage. 
</P>
<P>
It was a violation of his after-care program, which prohibits alcohol as well 
as drugs. In jail, he submitted to a blood test. Fortunately for him and the 
Mavericks, it showed no more than alcohol. Had it shown other drugs, Tarpley 
would have been banned for life. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Tarpley is under suspension, but not by the Dallas Mavericks. ASAP, 
which has that authority from the league, did the suspending. Its medical 
director gravely announced that Tarpley was indefinitely suspended until he 
showed readiness to abide by the terms of his after-care program. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, it wouldn't appear to be anything to wink at. 
</P>
<P>
And then, there is that contract. Roy is supposed to be getting $9 million for 
the next five years, guaranteed. But while he's under suspension, he is getting 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
And Tarpley winks? Either we don't understand the situation, or he doesn't.

EVERETT RECEIVES SOME CREDIT FOR FLIPPER'S RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: JOHN ROBINSON MAKES SURE HIS QUARTERBACK ISN'T OVERLOOKED DURING 
CELEBRATION OF RECEIVING-YARDAGE MARK. 
</P>

<P>
Flipper Anderson's set-up man, Jim Everett, was so lost in the landscape of 
Anderson's record-breaking receiving performance against New Orleans that it 
took a night's sleep and a film session to comprehend Everett's role. 
</P>
<P>
Now, brace yourself for the two greatest single feats ever witnessed by a coach 
on the same night. Move over, Flipper. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jim Everett played his best game ever as a pro," Ram Coach John 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's assessments were based on more than sheer numbers, although Everett 
set career bests for attempts, 51, completions, 29, and passing yardage, 454, 
in the Rams' overtime victory over the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was Everett's relentless pursuit of victory under difficult 
circumstances that moved Robinson to several words. 
</P>
<P>
"He had so many opportunities to say 'To hell with it,' " Robinson said. "He 
had injuries, his best receiver out of the game (Henry Ellard), the team was 
ineffective running the football, the rush was getting to him. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some assignment errors, we had a lineman hurt (Jackie Slater), we were 
behind, there was frustration. He had every possible reason to not keep 
playing, more so than anyone else on the team." 
</P>
<P>
On a night when teammate Anderson shattered the NFL's single-game yardage 
record with 336 in 15 catches, Everett seemed reduced to the guy who had enough 
sense to keep throwing Anderson the ball. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't that easy. 
</P>
<P>
"There were guys that were open," Robinson said, "but it was just their left 
ear that was open sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
That Everett would remain steady in the pocket with Saints' linebacker Pat 
Swilling and Co. breathing down his neck all night was testimony to his 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Everett was sacked six times and, according to Robinson's estimate, knocked 
down 25 times in all. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew they were coming on all of those and he just stood in there and got 
better and better," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
There's some image-changing going on here. The Everett of 1988 put up great 
numbers but couldn't put away opponents, throwing last-minute interceptions 
that cost his team possible victories against Philadelphia and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Everett has rallied his team four times in the fourth quarter to lead 
in the closing minutes. The defense gave away games at Buffalo and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things people said about him before was that, 'Well, we're never 
going to put him at the top level until he proves he can do those kinds of 
things,' " Robinson said. "But he is doing those things. We're talking about a 
very, very, very good quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
The week in New Orleans turned out to be the most bitter in Robinson's memory, 
and this time he is dropping his gloves and fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson remained incensed on Monday over a weeklong media campaign in which 
one Robinson quote about the Rams supposedly "forfeiting" the first game in 
Anaheim was taken out of context and repeatedly used to incite the Saints 
during the week. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, a New Orleans Times-Picayune story included an unedited Robinson quote 
that played upon the coach's staggered speech patterns, including the use of 
six "uh's" in a paragraph he's sure was designed to make him sound foolish. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson once was a stammerer, and has worked hard to make the problem 
virtually undetectable in conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they did was a cheap shot," he said. "I think it was poor 
journalism. I think the motivation was a reach under any circumstance. Those of 
us that are in this business are constantly quoted and constantly in front of 
the cameras and are exposed in that manner. 
</P>
<P>
"When one response is twisted so manipulatively by someone, it gives you a 
tendency to become distrustful. I think what they did was out of line, 
completely. I have no recourse, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said fans at the Superdome were particularly hostile, but the 
logistics of the stadium kept hecklers at a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
Greatest performances, Part III: Robinson said the play he will remember for 
years to come is linebacker Kevin Greene's leaping tackle of Dalton Hilliard on 
third and one at the Rams' 45 in overtime. Hilliard lost two yards on the play, 
and the Saints were forced to punt. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said the move was instinctive, but that he did have a sense Hilliard was 
going to get the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"A good linebacker will get a feel for what they're going to run at you," he 
said. "I kind of had a feeling that basically it was going to come my way." 
Greene had two sacks in the game and has 13.5 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
What price glory? Flipper Andersen's yards-per-catch ratio has dropped from 
30.7 to 27.1. . . . The Rams moved up three more spots in total defense to 15th 
this week. The unit ranked 26th only three weeks ago.

MIKE DOWNEY: ANDERSON SUITS RAMS SWIMMINGLY

Flipper should have been a Dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
How many passes did Mark Clayton catch Sunday for Miami? 
</P>
<P>
Only four? Poor baby. 
</P>
<P>
How about Mark Duper? 
</P>
<P>
What's that? Three! Three lousy passes? 
</P>
<P>
Flipper caught 15. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know how many passes the entire Miami Dolphin team completed against 
Pittsburgh? 
</P>
<P>
You got it -- 15. 
</P>
<P>
The same number Willie (Flipper) Anderson latched onto for the Rams in Sunday's 
20-17 overtime party at the expense of the where'd-he-go-now New Orleans 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen catches for 336 yards. No man ever got that many yards for Miami 
catching passes, even with Dan Marino doing the throwing. No Dolphin on Sunday 
even got 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Aw, you say the Dolphins had to play in the rain? Hey, babe, that's what 
Dolphins do. They play in water. They splash around real frisky-like and make 
Dolphin noises like "Fa!" and "Be!" and pop up once in a while to catch fish. 
So it rained a little at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Flipper probably would have caught 30 passes there. 
</P>
<P>
Look what he did Sunday night at New Orleans -- indoors, yet. All but one of 
Anderson's 15 catches were for 10 yards or longer. Diving, sliding, kneeling, 
reeling -- he flipped, he flopped. He'd fetch 'em and catch 'em. He ran them 
down like Ashley Whippet after a Frisbee. Willie went around in a circle. He 
did everything but balance balls on his nose, like a seal. Flipper became the 
greatest creature on land or sea since -- well, since Lynn Swann. 
</P>
<P>
What a night it was for Willie Lee Anderson Jr., who made more catches in one 
day than he did all of last season. Whatever he ate for breakfast, be sure he 
eats it again. 
</P>
<P>
As a rookie from UCLA, Flipper had 11 grabs. As a second-year man, his season 
total had grown slightly, to 19 going into Sunday night's game at the Louisiana 
Superdome. But Henry Ellard, who already had 61 this season, couldn't play 
because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Better get back out there, Henry. Remember Lou Gehrig and Wally Pipp. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Rams have the luxury of being able to use Anderson and Ellard 
simultaneously. Both catch passes thrown by Jim Everett, the quarterback in 
John Robinson's Guys Whose Names Begin With Vowels passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
In the huddle, here's what Everett usually calls: "Henry, you go long. Flipper, 
you go longer." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is the deep threat, the decoy, the guy who cuts loose like Carl Lewis 
and goes streaking down field, until the worn-out defensive back's tongue is 
sticking out like Michael Jordan's. Willie Anderson uses more fly patterns than 
a seamstress. 
</P>
<P>
He was aware that Everett would be looking for him, with Ellard out. "But I 
never dreamed of having a day like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Who would? Who could? 
</P>
<P>
Robinson called it the greatest work by a receiver in all his years of 
coaching. Everett said he was still somewhat in shock. Anderson's college 
coach, Terry Donahue, said he wished he had him back, and probably wondered why 
-- even with Troy Aikman around -- Flipper never caught more than seven passes 
in one game. Anderson's high school coach in New Jersey probably wondered why 
he had made Flipper a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Saints, they probably wondered why they didn't use a prevent 
defense. You know, like locking Flipper in the locker room to prevent him from 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
On ESPN, Joe Theismann, who knows something about quarterbacking, clued in the 
TV audience as to what Everett was calling in the huddle. The sophisticated Ram 
strategy for the fourth quarter, Theismann said, was: "Willie, get loose." 
</P>
<P>
He was more than half-serious. When a guy has a day like Flipper was having, 
you don't bother calling Power X Blue 83 Eagle Left anymore. You call Willie 
Get Loose. 
</P>
<P>
The whole game became "Win One for the Flipper." Teammates even asked for his 
autograph afterward, saving the scorecards as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
On the flight home, he and the Rams were singing. By practice Monday, Anderson 
was hoarse. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's been calling and saying, 'Do you know what you did? You did more 
than (Jerry) Rice! You did more than Swann!' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
And what did he get for his trouble? 
</P>
<P>
Trouble, that's what he got. Bawled out by his coach, that's what he got. While 
watching game films Monday, Ram offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese got on 
Anderson's case for running poor routes. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on," a skeptic said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm serious," Anderson replied. "The coaches kind of chewed me out for it. I 
was supposed to push deeper up the field. Everett and I, it was like we were 
playing street ball. I was just getting open and he was hitting me." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, this guy got open like nobody's ever gotten open. Three hundred and 
thirty-six yards! Know how many yards the leading Ram receiver had at the 
Superdome in 1985? Try Barry Redden -- two catches, 34 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't matter if your quarterback is Dieter Brock or Dan Marino -- 336 yards 
for one receiver is a whole lotta yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tough luck, Marino. Flipper could have been a Dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
Miami had every chance. Willie (Flipper) Anderson was still eminently available 
in 1988's college football draft when Don Shula's Dolphins made defensive end 
Eric Kumerow their first-round pick. He was still available in the second 
round, too, when they took Jarvis Williams, a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
You would think the Dolphins would do anything to get a guy whose grandmother 
nicknamed him Flipper because as a baby he made crying noises that sounded like 
dolphin talk. 
</P>
<P>
It's like San Diego in last year's draft taking that guy who should have been a 
Ram: Marion Butts.

DENVER IS FOE, NOT SHANAHAN; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: SHELL, PLAYERS AVOID BULLETIN-BOARD FODDER CONCERNING THEIR DEPOSED 
COACH, NOW EMPLOYED BY BRONCOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Here are some things the Raiders did not do Monday as they prepared to meet the 
Denver Broncos and their old coach, Mike Shanahan: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hang a pinata shaped like Shanahan and have everyone bash it with that 
helmet he once couldn't sit on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spit once-forbidden-in-the-locker room sunflower seeds at it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the pinata an assigned seat at a team meeting, like the ones they used 
to have to sit in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to play the Denver Broncos," said Art Shell, promoted eight weeks 
ago when Shanahan was fired. "The football players are going to play the game 
on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing Dan Reeves, we're not playing Mike Shanahan, we're not 
playing Earl Leggett (Raider defensive line coach who went to Denver this 
season). We're just playing the football players." 
</P>
<P>
And his players? 
</P>
<P>
"I want to show my old coach, all right," Howie Long said. "His name's Earl 
Leggett." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after his firing by the Raiders, Shanahan went back to his old job as 
Bronco quarterback coach. No Raider has ripped him personally since he left, 
although many have said they were glad to return to the traditional customs of 
the old regime. In Shanahan's few public comments, he has been gracious, 
thanking Al Davis, congratulating Shell, saying only that the situation hadn't 
been right for him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Raiders don't need to cast around for motivation. They're still 
up to their neck in alligators in the wild-card race. They have two home games 
before their final two on the road, and they need at least three victories, so 
what does that make this game? 
</P>
<P>
M-U-S-T. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't it be ducky for them if the Broncos (10-2), having just clinched the 
AFC West, and leaders by two games in the race to stay home throughout the 
playoffs, showed up fat and happy? 
</P>
<P>
Shell doesn't feel like banking on it or thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care," he said, stonily. "I really don't care. 
</P>
<P>
"Understand where I'm coming from. I only care about the Raiders, not the 
Broncos. I don't care whether the Broncos are ready. Whether they're ready or 
not, we're going to be ready to play football." 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the Raiders trailed four wild-card contenders: Miami by two games; 
Houston by two games with the Oilers owning a head-on victory; Cincinnati by a 
game; and Indianapolis, which is tied in the standings with them, but which has 
a better conference record. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Dolphins, Oilers and Bengals all lost. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are still fighting uphill, needing to catch and pass three of the 
four. 
</P>
<P>
They're a game behind Miami, which was buried at home by the Steelers. Next for 
the Dolphins: at Kansas City. Could Sunday have been Miami's version of that 
14-12 Raider loss to the Chargers a week ago? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are one behind the Oilers. Next for Houston: at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are tied with Cincinnati in the standings, but have two potential 
tiebreaks over them. Next for the Bengals: at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are tied with Indianapolis, but trail in conference record (5-4 to 
5-5). Next for the Colts: at New England. A key game for the Raiders, who need 
the Colts to lose. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are tied with Pittsburgh, but lead in conference records (5-5 to 
4-5). Next: Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dan Reeves said that making his 8-2 Broncos underdogs to the 5-5 Redskins 
showed a lack of respect. Wait 'til he sees that his 10-2 Broncos are an early 
two-point underdog to the 6-6 Raiders. . . . Marcus Allen returned to practice 
last week, but only worked lightly. Art Shell says he may try some contact work 
this week. . . . Safety Vann McElroy says he's ready, but the Raiders have been 
moving slowly with him, happy with the play of Eddie Anderson, an Al Davis 
favorite. . . . Shell, on the hit on Bo Jackson by New England defensive back 
Fred Marion, who blind-sided him just as Jackson caught a pass: "It shook him 
up a little. It shook me up, too, I mean to tell you. I think it surprised 
Marion more than it surprised Bo." Afterward, however, Jackson got only 43 
yards in 15 carries. . . . Shell was less than his usual effusive self, terming 
the Raider performance "not bad," saying the running game "might not have gone 
like we wanted it to," but adding it was "a good win for us and I'm proud of 
this football team."

COLLEGE DIVISION; 
</P>
<P>
HER CONSISTENCY OVER YEARS LEADS TO 400 VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Darlene May became women's basketball coach at Cal Poly Pomona 16 years 
ago, she took the position with what she says were modest aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to have a college coaching job," she said. "That was the main 
thing I was concerned about and I just wanted to do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
May has fulfilled those goals -- and then some. 
</P>
<P>
With her team's 70-68 victory over Weber State on Saturday, May became one of 
the few women's basketball coaches to have 400 victories. 
</P>
<P>
May's record is 400-91, a winning percentage of .815. She already has the most 
victories in NCAA Division II history. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me proud to be at that level," May said. "I would've never imagined 
that I could reach that level in 15 years and about three games." 
</P>
<P>
May's Bronco teams have averaged 26.5 victories. In the last eight seasons, 
Pomona has won or shared the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title eight 
times, won three Division II championships and finished second in the nation 
three times. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to me are the conference and national championships 
but I feel pretty proud that we have stayed at the same level for 15 years," 
May said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is," May said. "I have such a tremendous desire to excel 
that if we lose I always take it personally. I just don't accept losing. Even 
if I'm just fishing, I don't like to lose -- and I like fishing." 
</P>
<P>
May is quick to credit her players and assistant coaches, principally longtime 
aide Barb Thaller, for her success. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have 400 wins but (Barb) has played a big part in a lot of them," May 
said. "You can't say enough about having good assistants." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have also had more than their share of outstanding players, most of 
whom have fit nicely into the coach's hard-working, disciplined approach to the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
But along the way May has also developed players, such as All-American forward 
Niki Bracken, who didn't fit into the mold when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Niki Bracken was that kind of player when she came in," May 
said. "I don't think she had that killer instinct inside her when we first got 
her but she is certainly that kind of a player now." 
</P>
<P>
The coach doesn't dispute that she can be very demanding of her players, 
especially during practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I have kids who come in here and they just don't know how to practice and I 
demand that from my players," she said. "That's when they really learn how to 
play the game. You have to teach kids to learn how to practice and sometimes it 
takes a year or two for them to understand what you want." 
</P>
<P>
May also attributes her success partly to her flexibility in coaching 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like the athletes have changed a lot in the 15 years that I've been 
here," she said. "I think I've changed along with them and learned how to 
communicate. In my first two or three years, I think I was awful in that regard 
but I've changed as I've gone along. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see that we don't have many players that leave our program (before 
graduation). That's because I try to keep the lines of communications open all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
She has succeeded as a recruiter, although May acknowledged that it is not easy 
to compete for talent against Division I programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition for recruiting the athletes has really changed," she said. "I 
can't even begin to explain what it's like to recruit now. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to find sleepers. At our level you don't have any other choice. 
That's what you have to do because the competition for the athletes has become 
tremendous. You walk into a gym and all the coaches know about the players you 
are recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
With her success, both as a coach and as a recruiter, May has had her chances 
to move up to Division I. In recent years she was offered the job at Washington 
and was in the running for positions at Cal State Fullerton, San Jose State and 
San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
But May said she has not been eager to move up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a real big person for change," she said. "I didn't shop around for a 
lot of other jobs. There are times that I've had second thoughts. The 
Washington job was a really good possibility. But I always figured that this 
was my home and I just wanted to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
May said she doesn't have any serious complaints about her position at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"The enjoyment I get from working with the kids is still there," she said. 
"It's some of the other things about the job that get to me. I don't enjoy 
losing and I don't enjoy spending every day of my life in a gym. But as far as 
working with the kids and being at the school, I do enjoy that part." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she doesn't think she will be coaching for more than about four more 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to retire by the end of my 20th year," she said. "I would like to 
retire before my 21st year, maybe 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just got other things that I would like to do and that's long enough to 
be coaching basketball. It's still a young person's game and I think it'll be 
time to let somebody else beat the bushes for talent." 
</P>
<P>
May said if she doesn't accomplish anything in her final years of coaching, she 
has nothing to be disappointed about. 
</P>
<P>
"If I never win another national championship, I'll still feel like I 
accomplished a lot," she said. "There are so many coaches out there who haven't 
even won one championship." 
</P>
<P>
But as the newest member of the 400-victory club, May has already left a 
lasting mark on women's basketball.

<P>
The CCAA will be well-represented when the NCAA Division II women's volleyball 
playoffs start Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Four CCAA teams have received berths in the 20-team tournament, including 
third-seeded Cal State Northridge and fourth-seeded UC Riverside. The others 
are Chapman and Cal State Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
In first-round regional matches Friday, Northridge (26-10) visits Bakersfield 
(17-15) and Riverside (25-4) plays host to Chapman (26-5). 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, which is led by All-American outside hitter Sheri Benson, won the 
CCAA title, although the Highlanders were seeded behind Northridge for the 
playoffs. The teams split in four meetings this season but the Matadors won the 
last two matches. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento State heads into the playoffs as the top seeded team and Portland 
State, defending national champion, is seeded No. 2. But since 1980, Northridge 
has won three titles and finished second five times and Riverside has won three 
national titles since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Regional winners will advance to the Elite Eight championship tournament Dec. 
8-10.

LENDL, BECKER SET TO SEND MASTERS OUT IN STYLE

The Nabisco Grand Prix, men's professional tennis as we know it, goes out of 
business in about a month and so does the Nabisco Masters, which begins tonight 
on its last legs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the season-ending tournament finished with Boris Becker winning a 
five-set final over Ivan Lendl. Who could have known then that this lame-duck 
event would propel Becker toward his biggest year ever? 
</P>
<P>
The ATP Tour makes its debut in 1990 with the players running it. There will be 
an ATP Finals to replace the Masters, so that means that this 19th Masters 
event will be the last. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl and Becker are the top-seeded players in the $3-million Masters, 
featuring the top eight players in the rankings and starting its week-long run 
at Madison Square Garden with three round-robin matches. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the No. 1-ranked player in the world, has already clinched the $800,000 
Grand Prix bonus pool, so there's no suspense there. This event does not 
involve computer points, only money, which means plenty of suspense remains. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Becker, who defeated Lendl in the semifinals 
on grass at Wimbledon and the final on the hardcourt at Flushing Meadow, will 
try to repeat his success of last year on the Garden's rubberized indoor 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Becker will play Brad Gilbert in the third match tonight, after Andre Agassi's 
match against Stefan Edberg and Lendl's French Open rematch against Michael 
Chang. 
</P>
<P>
The eight players who qualified for the Masters are divided into two groups and 
play the other three players in their group. Each player receives $15,000 for 
qualifying and $15,000 for winning each round-robin match. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, John McEnroe, Chang and Aaron Krickstein are in one group while Becker, 
Edberg, Agassi and Gilbert are in the other. 
</P>
<P>
The road to the semifinals is somewhat confusing. The player in each group with 
the best overall record will be placed in a semifinal bracket and the 
second-place finisher in each group will cross over to play the opposite 
group's champion. 
</P>
<P>
From there, it's easy. Winning semifinalists get $60,000 and the eventual 
champion earns $150,000 more. If a player goes undefeated, he would earn 
$315,000.

NFL SAYS OFFICIAL ERRED IN CALL AGAINST BENGALS 
</P>

<P>
The NFL said Monday that referee Red Cashion and his crew erred by failing to 
give Cincinnati another play after a field goal had been negated by a penalty 
at the end of the first half of the Bengals' 24-7 loss to Buffalo on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The situation arose with the Bills leading 10-0 and no time left on the clock 
after a facemask penalty on Buffalo's Bruce Smith. NFL rules specify that a 
half can't end on a defensive penalty, and the Bengals' Jim Breech kicked an 
apparent 26-yard field goal to cut the margin to 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a penalty on the play and the Bengals, thinking it was offside 
against the Bills, ran off the field, assuming the field goal would count. 
</P>
<P>
Cashion, however, ruled that two Cincinnati linemen had moved, creating a false 
start. He nullified the field goal and ruled the half over. 
</P>
<P>
But after a review of the play by Art McNally, the supervisor of officials, the 
league said the false start negated the play, that the ball should have been 
marked back five yards and the Bengals given another play because the penalty 
against Smith was still operative. 
</P>
<P>
Bengal Coach Sam Wyche, however, continued to protest the call rather than the 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I've run the film back 1,000 times. Our guy did not move before the ball," 
Wyche said. "I disagree with it obviously, but I respect the referee's 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche said said he was more concerned about a ruling that James Brooks had 
fumbled early in the third quarter, a play that led to a Buffalo touchdown two 
plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of 10-3, the game became 17-0," Wyche said. "But we got beat on that 
ballgame. The Buffalo Bills outplayed us."

SPORTS BETTING CONSIDERED A THREAT TO RACING INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
WAGERING: SPORTS BOOKS PROBABLY WOULD DIVERT MONEY FROM RACE TRACKS, SOME 
HORSEMEN SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A quiet alarm is being set off in all corners of the California horse racing 
industry. Slowly but surely, it is alerting race track operators, horse owners, 
breeders and trainers to a phenomenon that could make the competitive impact of 
the state lottery look like a flea bite. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is coming from legalized sports betting, and it's coming quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) has filed an initiative with the office 
of the state attorney general that would put the sports-betting issue to a vote 
on the general election ballot in November of 1990. Supporters of the 
initiative are likely to begin collecting the needed 595,485 signatures in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, whose district contains a large number of legal card parlors, has 
proposed a measure that would create a Nevada-style atmosphere of 
state-controlled gambling on all manner of sports, including collegiate events. 
</P>
<P>
Sports betting, as envisioned by Floyd, would be conducted primarily by 
established card parlors and race tracks. But the wording of the initiative 
allows for anyone with a clean record and a $100,000 license fee to set up a 
sports book in a community where local laws permit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the initiative permits betting by telephone, similar to Nevada 
practice, wherein persons with an established account may simply call in bets 
to their local sports book, then sit back and watch the game on television. 
</P>
<P>
Such sports books would be taxed between 3% and 6% of gross revenues after 
paying off winning bets. The higher the revenues, the higher the tax bite. The 
state's share of the tax revenue would be earmarked for services to senior 
citizens, according to the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
There is even something called the "Anti-Pete Rose Provision" that makes 
athletes and coaches who bet on their own sports subject to felony prosecution 
and up to three years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BYPASSING LEGISLATURE 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Ruch, a spokesman for Floyd, explained why the initiative process was 
chosen for sports betting, rather than running it through the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost a puritanical reaction in the legislature when any kind of 
gaming proposal is introduced," Ruch said from his Sacramento office. 
</P>
<P>
"The lottery failed for 20 years in the legislature," Ruch went on. "Then, the 
first time it was put to the people, it was enacted right off the bat. Dick 
(Floyd) has introduced a sports-betting proposal for four years in a row and 
not been able to get another single legislator to vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction within the horse racing community has been one of wary 
opposition. With few exceptions, racing leaders see sports betting as direct 
competition to pari-mutuel betting. Were sports betting to become a reality in 
the form of the Floyd initiative, they predict dramatic decreases in race track 
handles and, as a result, purse money for owners, trainers, breeders, jockeys 
and stable personnel who are on some sort of profit-sharing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, to the man or woman in the street, there is little ethical 
difference between betting on horses and betting on basketball. A bet is a bet. 
</P>
<P>
John Harris, president of the California Thoroughbred Breeders Assn., is aware 
that the racing lobby could come off as blatantly self-serving in opposing 
sports betting. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be careful in our arguments that we don't sound hypocritical," 
Harris said. "At the same time, we can't get away from the bottom line. Sports 
betting could damage the horse racing industry." 
</P>
<P>
The realists among racing's leaders are looking back on the lessons learned in 
their losing campaign against the state lottery in 1984. If sports betting is 
inevitable, they are hoping to shape the legislation to their advantage, rather 
than merely wringing their hands and pleading for relief when business begins 
to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the race track least alarmed by the prospect of sports 
betting is Golden Gate Fields in Albany, south of Oakland. Golden Gate is owned 
by Ladbroke, the British bookmaking firm that operates about 2,000 betting 
shops in England and western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Tunney, Golden Gate vice president and general manager, conceded the 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think Ladbroke would be very interested in looking at sports betting 
in some form, whether on the race track or off, because that's the business 
they're in," Tunney said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not, however, had a chance to really study what has been proposed. We 
know what we read. Now we need to know exactly what Floyd has in mind." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A PIECE OF THE ACTION 
</P>
<P>
Golden Gate was criticized when it became the only track to withhold funds from 
the racing industry's battle against the California lottery. As it turned out, 
the track saved money. The lottery passed by an overwhelming margin. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our concern," Tunney said. "If sports betting is going to become a 
reality, I think we'd like to be a part of it and have it properly structured." 
</P>
<P>
At Del Mar, the philosophy is similar, according to Joe Harper, executive vice 
president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the initiative would have to be changed considerably to work for 
racing, rather than just rearrange the same disposable income," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can see it working is to have the tracks operate some or most 
of the sporting books, or something that wouldn't compete with the other books, 
and have those revenues going toward the racing associations. The only other 
way is to run it in such a way that you're not competing in the same market 
area, and I can't see that happening. The market areas are L.A., San Diego, San 
Francisco for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar is in a position to partially gauge the impact of sports betting on 
race track business. The sports book at Caliente race track just across the 
border in Tijuana has been in operation since mid-September and does a reported 
$750,000 in action each week, whereas Del Mar's inter-track betting on Los 
Angeles area racing handles roughly $2.5 million weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to measure its impact yet," Harper said. "But you talk to the 
people at Caliente and in Las Vegas and they'll tell you the horseplayers and 
sports book patrons don't really mix." 
</P>
<P>
Fistfights between the two groups forced Caliente management to move sports 
bettors to another building. Seems the noise level of those cheering for 
football teams disturbed the more sedate handicappers. 
</P>
<P>
No formal meetings have been held between Floyd and the various racing 
interests over sports betting. Floyd's staff, however, is optimistic. Ruch 
hinted that there was already support from some tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park, which bucks the football season, is opposing the sports-betting 
initiative as written. At the same time, the track has introduced eight sports 
viewing centers throughout its vast racing plant in an attempt to lure people 
back to the track and away from their weekend easy chairs. Marje Everett, 
Hollywood Park's chief operating officer, insisted that sports centers are not 
a precursor to actual sports books. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were talking about the sports centers, we wanted to be careful not to 
identify them in a way they could be interpreted as a sports betting set-up," 
Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not feel sports betting is something we should support. It's an 
unhealthy thing for sports. You're legitimatizing bookmaking, something that 
could cause a scandal somewhere down the road. We've all seen it happen. And it 
would be very difficult to regulate and supervise properly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A CAUTIOUS APPROACH 
</P>
<P>
Still, the racing industry's position is perhaps best reflected in the cautious 
approach taken by Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're concerned," said Santa Anita president Cliff Goodrich. 
"Sports betting just means an added element of competition. Dick (Floyd) has 
tried to help the industry in allowing race tracks to be potential sports book 
licensees. But there are many other potential licensees surrounding us." 
</P>
<P>
Goodrich is seeking more data on public sentiment toward sports betting before 
committing to any sort of political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the lottery, we probably never had a chance," Goodrich pointed 
out. "Though we tried to beat it, there was a tremendous groundswell of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports betting, on the other hand, is perceived more like true gambling. Our 
inclination is that the public as a whole would not be as prone to favor it as 
they did the lottery. If it's a close call, we might take one position. If it's 
inevitable, we might take another." 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar's Harper worries that recent developments might have encouraged a 
climate in which sports betting could be accepted by the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
"Between inter-track betting and the lottery, the taboos of gambling have 
already been removed to a certain extent," Harper said. "We do have betting 
everywhere now -- if that's what you want to call the lottery -- and sports 
betting may be the next step. But I think it's much bigger step than people 
realize. I think there will be some lines drawn on this issue that were not 
drawn on the lottery." 
</P>
<P>
Sports betting is certainly not an isolated California issue. In Oregon, the 
lottery is hooked up to the point spreads of NFL games. In Kentucky, a sports 
betting-lottery connection was beaten back by a powerful horse industry lobby, 
which includes Lt. Gov. Brereton Jones, a noted breeder. And in Louisiana, 
where sports betting is right around the corner, the Fair Grounds Race Course 
in New Orleans is welcoming it with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
Race tracks, as potential sports book outlets, have a built-in reason to 
compromise on the issue. Breeders, owners and trainers, however, are on the 
outside looking in. They would need specific modifications in the language of 
the initiative -- or special legislation -- to get a piece of the 
sports-betting pie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEERING COMMITEE 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Eddie Gregson is the head of a committee appointed by the California 
Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. that will seek to stop the 
sports-betting drive, or at least bend the initiative to its advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Gregson on the committee are trainers Charlie Whittingham and Richard 
Mandella, horse owners Ed Friendly and Mace Siegel, CHBPA attorney Don Johnson 
and Nat Wess, general manager of the breeders' association. 
</P>
<P>
Gregson and his committee plan to meet with Gov. George Deukmejian as well as 
the two men who figure to meet in next year's gubernatorial election, Sen. Pete 
Wilson and Attorney General John Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Floyd is a cinch to get this on the ballot," said Gregson, a native 
Californian. "And if sports betting went on the ballot next month, it would 
pass in a landslide. Hopefully, the governor and the two candidates for the 
governorship will be against it." 
</P>
<P>
Gregson said the first thing his committee will do is meet with lobbyists in 
Sacramento "to try to understand the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in a move against Floyd politically," Gregson said. 
"We're trying to understand the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he claims to be a big fan of horse racing, Floyd is not the most 
popular legislator with some segments of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Floyd introduced what he called the "Drug-Free Horse Racing Act" in 
the Assembly, which called for an end to California's controlled medication 
program for race horses. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd made the proposal during a controversy over the California Horse Racing 
Board's handling of what were initially identified as cocaine positives in 
horses trained by several well known conditioners. The board later dropped all 
charges on the advice of the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
And whereas Floyd cites a desire to recapture the gambling money flowing to Las 
Vegas and illegal bookmakers as the reason for his initiative, Gregson sees the 
sports betting movement as simply another indirect tax. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so opposed to raising taxes that politicians are desperate to find 
alternative ways to raise revenues for welfare programs," Gregson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe this will kill our business," he added. "As far as I'm 
concerned, those universities are not going to benefit enough by what we're 
betting on their football teams to make any difference. And sports betting is 
not going to employ anybody -- it's going to be a relief for taxation, if 
indeed the money does get to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"The racing industry, on the other hand, generates so many jobs, so many 
careers, that to destroy all that for something that's manufactured on a 
television camera . . . to me the comparison is odious. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope," Gregson said, "that we're a little bit better than just a 
gambling sport."

Chevron Corp., the oil giant that has been the subject of takeover speculation 
for weeks, said Monday that it would create an employee stock ownership plan to 
buy $1 billion worth of newly issued Chevron shares, raising the amount of 
stock in employee hands. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the San Francisco-based company announced plans to buy back 
an equal number of shares on the open market over an unspecified period -- 
Chevron's first stock repurchase plan in memory. 
</P>
<P>
The net effect of the two actions will be to maintain the number of outstanding 
shares at about 342 million, increase employee stock holdings to 16% from 11% 
and allow the company to realize tax benefits, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The company denied that the actions were intended to ward off suitors who may 
be interested in buying the company or forcing it to restructure. However, 
analysts said the moves would make a takeover more difficult for any outsider 
because they would add debt, remove shares from the open market, increase 
holdings in friendly hands and -- in the short term -- raise the total number 
of shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is anyone searching for a company like Chevron, this would tend to 
put a higher level of price support under the stock," said George Gaspar, an 
industry analyst with the Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. brokerage in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors have circulated since September that companies including Pennzoil Co. 
and British Petroleum have been buying up Chevron stock, driving the price up 
in heavy trading. So far, no large investor has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, trading in Chevron stock was halted briefly before the company's 
announcement. After it resumed, the market responded positively by sending the 
stock up $3.25 to close at $68.25 on volume of 3.33 million shares, making it 
the fifth-most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The new employee stock ownership plan would be part of the company's existing 
profit-sharing and savings plan, which now holds about 11% of the company's 
outstanding stock. A newly created trust would borrow $1 billion from banks on 
behalf of the employee stock plan to buy the newly issued shares. 
</P>
<P>
The move would increase Chevron's total level of debt, which stood at about 
$7.74 billion at the end of the third quarter, or 33.8% of the company's total 
equity plus debt, spokesman Larry Shushan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the time before Chevron begins buying shares, the move would also increase 
the total number of outstanding shares, possibly diluting per-share earnings 
slightly, analysts added. 
</P>
<P>
The dilution would be partly offset by tax benefits. Under the budget 
reconciliation bill passed by Congress last week, companies retained a tax 
deduction on dividends paid on shares held by an employee stock ownership plan. 
In the third quarter, Chevron paid a dividend of 70 cents per share, Shushan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron will begin issuing new shares once it arranges financing for the plan 
in the next few days and will allocate the stock to employees in May, when the 
company normally makes a profit-sharing distribution for the first quarter of 
1990, Shushan said. 
</P>
<P>
The company will repurchase stock on the open market depending on market 
conditions, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said Monday's actions were consistent with Chevron's strategy of 
bolstering shareholder value, including a stated goal of raising average annual 
return to stockholders -- including dividends and capital gains -- to 15% 
through 1993 from its present level of about 8%. 
</P>
<P>
But others argued that the new employee stock plan and buyback would do little 
to change the company's position. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of investors who own the stock had complained that the company was not 
doing anything (to bolster shareholder value), so this is (at least) some 
demonstration of shareholder sensitivity," said William H. Brown III, an 
analyst with the Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. investment firm in New York. "But 
it's not realistic to think they can go farther than that," particularly given 
their current financial condition, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said Chevron does not have enough cash to launch a major stock 
buyback program, especially since it paid mostly cash in its $2.6-billion 
acquisition last year of Tenneco Inc.'s oil and gas reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many analysts remained skeptical that a serious suitor for Chevron 
is waiting in the wings to mount a full-fledged bid for the company, which they 
estimated would cost more than $35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, rumors persisted Monday, centering mainly on cash-rich Pennzoil, and 
they gained momentum when Pennzoil requested confidentiality earlier this month 
for a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing 
its investments. 
</P>
<P>
A Pennzoil spokesman declined to comment on the filing.

POSSIBLE SALE OF CHIP FIRM STIRS HIGH-TECH POLICY DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The potential sale of a key American electronics operation to a Japanese 
competitor is sparking renewed debate over whether the United States needs a 
policy to protect and nurture critical technologies. 
</P>
<P>
A report that Perkin-Elmer Corp.'s semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
division might be acquired by Japanese rival Nikon Corp. also raises new 
questions as to whether American business is too shortsighted to invest in 
firms offering a lot of promise but only slim immediate profits. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of the division to Nikon, an event widely speculated upon by industry 
insiders, will come only because a willing U.S. buyer couldn't be found, 
analysts said. The big negative: the division's lackluster profits. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, this wouldn't put an end to the American presence in semiconductor 
manufacturing equipment. Perkin-Elmer ranks only fifth among U.S. makers of 
such machinery, behind Applied Materials in Santa Clara, General Signal of 
Stamford, Conn., Varian Associates in Palo Alto and Eaton Corp. in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the loss of the Perkin-Elmer unit to the Japanese would be significant 
because the firm has some important technologies that other U.S. companies 
lack. And while the division is not very profitable now, it could be in the 
future, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the Japanese value technology more than we do in the U.S. That's the 
heart of the issue," says Dan Hitchinson, president of VSLI Research, a San 
Jose market analysis company. "The Japanese view technology as a source of 
future wealth, and clearly we do not." 
</P>
<P>
When Norwalk, Conn.-based Perkin-Elmer announced that it wanted to sell its 
semiconductor equipment unit last April, its stock shot up $2.25 per share. On 
Monday, following news of the potential Nikon deal, the stock jumped $1.125 to 
close at $23.375 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither company will discuss the possible deal, analysts said industry 
insiders have known for months that Nikon was extremely interested in buying 
the last of three divisions Perkin-Elmer put on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
The lure to Nikon, the well-known Japanese camera maker that has quietly and 
steadily become the world's No. 1 maker of semiconductor manufacturing 
equipment, is not size or immediate profits. The Perkin-Elmer unit, once the 
world's top semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker, had pretax earnings of 
just $3.2 million on sales of $200 million in its 1988 fiscal year, a small 
fraction of Nikon' sales of $1.9 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the attraction is Perkin-Elmer's advanced technology for etching 
patterns of computer chips on silicon wafers. Perkin-Elmer is one of the few 
companies in the world to make machinery that photographically reproduces 
circuit patterns -- whose lines are less than one-tenth the width of a strand 
of hair -- on the wafers. 
</P>
<P>
Canon, the other Japanese camera giant that has become a force in semiconductor 
manufacturing equipment, has the technology. Nikon is said to want it to 
protect its market dominance. 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts and others argue that if the Japanese control the market 
for machines that make semiconductors, just as they do the actual semiconductor 
market, they will have an even greater lock on the overall market for 
high-technology products. 
</P>
<P>
"If you own the technology, you have a 4- to 5-year head start on knowing how 
to apply that technology," VSLI Research's Hutchinson said. "You know what 
products are possible." 
</P>
<P>
Perkin-Elmer officials -- including Chairman Horace G. McDonnell, a former 
president of the American Electronics Assn. -- had repeatedly said they prefer 
to sell the unit to a U.S. company to keep its technology in domestic 
ownership. And, according to analysts, several domestic concerns expressed 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, the potential U.S. buyers concluded -- just as 
Perkin-Elmer did months before -- that they couldn't make enough money 
operating the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The pullout of potential U.S. buyers left Nikon the sole bidder, and because 
Perkin-Elmer is trying to complete the deal before year-end, analysts said 
Nikon appears to have won what it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a deal is reached between the two companies, it could be subject to 
review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a 
14-year-old federal agency whose powers have recently been expanded and 
strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
The agency can study the proposed sale for up to 75 days and send it to 
President Bush for his personal approval. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sematech, the consortium formed to bolster the semiconductor 
industry, said the group opposes the potential deal with Nikon, but will not 
formally challenge it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a development we deplore. It bodes ill for the future of the country," 
says a spokesman for the consortium. "If we don't start preserving our 
manufacturing and materials industry immediately, they'll be nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines Corp., the world's leading chip maker, also 
said Monday it hopes American investors will keep the division under U.S. 
control.

QUIRKY SI NEWHOUSE BECOMES A MEDIA POWER; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLISHING: THE OWNER OF THE NEW YORKER, VOGUE AND RANDOM HOUSE BUILDS HIS 
EMPIRE THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION. IN THE PROCESS SOME HEADS ROLL.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was early 1984, and a new magazine called Vanity Fair was suffering a birth 
agony of dwindling advertising, anemic circulation and regular editorial 
makeovers. 
</P>
<P>
On the fifth floor of his office in midtown Manhattan, ad director Douglas 
Johnston had finally admitted to himself that he didn't have a strategy for 
saving the magazine. And he was hoping -- fervently -- that nine floors above 
him, company Chairman Samuel I. (Si) Newhouse Jr. did. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston put the question to Jonathan Newhouse, the cousin of Si Newhouse, who 
was then Vanity Fair's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there a plan?" Johnston asked. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan," Newhouse said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no grand plan at Advance Publications, the nation's largest 
private media company, since Si Newhouse and his brother Donald took control 
after the death of their father 10 years ago. Rather, there has been constant 
experimentation, change and growth. Over the decade, this formula has made Si 
Newhouse, the most reluctant of public men, one of the most powerful and feared 
figures in the publishing world. 
</P>
<P>
With a famously quirky style, the shy Newhouse has expanded the five Conde Nast 
women's magazines into a 15-publication chain that includes Parade, the New 
Yorker, Vogue, Glamour and Vanity Fair, which has grown to prosperity after its 
early travail. Random House, bought for $65 million in 1980, has increased 
sales 20-fold and is considered by some to be the nation's most important book 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The privately owned Advance realm also includes the 31 newspapers, broadcast 
and cable-TV operations overseen by Donald Newhouse. In all, the Newhouse 
properties are worth an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion, making Si and 
Donald the fifth-richest men in the nation, according to Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The magazines and book operations have given the chain its visibility, through 
the glamour that surrounds some of them and through the publicity they receive 
when Newhouse orders a change of command or direction. And while turnover is 
notoriously high in the publishing world, Newhouse has sent heads rolling with 
a regularity that has made him the Alice's Queen of Hearts of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Newhouse surprised the book world by announcing the 
departure of Robert Bernstein, the literary mandarin who had run Random House 
for 25 years. In the past three years, Newhouse has installed three editors at 
HG magazine and three at Self, and he ousted Grace Mirabella, who had presided 
over Vogue for 17 years. In 1986, provoking a very public protest from the 
staff, he fired William Shawn, editor and guiding intelligence of the New 
Yorker for a generation. 
</P>
<P>
"Change is change," said Newhouse, unapologetic. "It doesn't happen slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse's habits suggest more a man trying to build his own fortune than one 
who inherited wealth from his father, as he did. He arrives at his spare office 
at Conde Nast's headquarters about 4:30 a.m. and meets with top managers as 
early as 5:30. He may hold the record for the shortest New York business 
lunches, often finishing a meeting with a subordinate at the Four Seasons 
restaurant within 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse, who finished three years of college at Syracuse University, rarely 
wears a tie to work, and for a recent interview wore a purple sweat shirt over 
a cotton polo shirt with the New Yorker insignia. "I saw him in Paris wearing 
this sweater with a hole in the sleeve that made him look like an out-of-work 
messenger," said Peter Diamandis, a former Newhouse employee and head of the 
Diamandis Communications magazine chain. "He's not awed by wealth." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Newhouse spoke softly, sometimes nearly inaudibly, and paused 
at length. 
</P>
<P>
When he has a question for his lieutenants at Conde Nast, Newhouse, who is 62, 
writes it out on a scrap of legal paper and dispatches it to have an answer 
written below and returned. Sometimes the notes swirl down in a storm, an event 
insiders call "the yellow rain." 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse's publishing operations are highly decentralized. Because it's 
privately held, Advance doesn't have to disclose financial details and can 
absorb losses on new magazines or overhauls for years without having to worry 
about restive shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The company doesn't hedge its bets with lengthy market research. Typically, Si 
Newhouse will consult a small number of senior executives such as Alexander 
Liberman, Conde Nast's editorial director and longtime confidant, and then act. 
</P>
<P>
In a tax case that the Internal Revenue Service has brought against the family 
over the tax bill on the estate of Samuel I. Newhouse Sr., Si Newhouse was 
cross-examined on just how the family makes key decisions. It was difficult to 
explain, he said, frustrated: "It's a little bit like love." 
</P>
<P>
How effective has this management style been? Admirers contend that Si Newhouse 
has shown that he has few peers in revitalizing old publishing properties. 
"He's an expert at polishing and restoring old jewels," said John Mack Carter, 
director of magazine development at Hearst Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Others claim that his frequent and messy dismissals show a lack of skill with 
people, contending that Advance's management apparatus has begun to creak under 
the strain of its size. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the critics believe Random House is now facing problems that 
demonstrate the risks in moving too fast. The difficulty, they assert, was the 
company's acquisition of two British publishing houses and Crown Publishing 
Group, a huge marketer and publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The British companies weren't complementary and, unbeknownst to the buyers, 
Crown was losing surprising sums, said an executive close to Random House. 
"They didn't do their 'due diligence' diligently," he said, speculating that 
Crown's ills have helped dropped earnings of the overall book group to a meager 
2% to 3% of revenue, from a typical 8% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
When Bernstein couldn't correct the problems, the executive said, "Si figured 
it was time for a change." Bernstein's replacement, Alberto Vitale, earned a 
reputation as a skilled financial manager and cost cutter during his last job 
as chief executive of Bantam Doubleday Dell. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse wouldn't comment when asked whether earnings problems led to 
Bernstein's departure. "We don't have to talk about earnings and I'm not very 
interested in other peoples' speculation," Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
Another jolt came last year when Newhouse overhauled Vogue, which is by far the 
most valuable fashion magazine, with ad revenue of a whopping $88 million last 
year. Apparently shocked by the success of Elle magazine and other competitors, 
Newhouse decided Vogue needed a fresher, younger look. 
</P>
<P>
He installed Anna Wintour, the British-born editor who had led a faltering 
attempt to revitalize HG, Conde Nast's home decor magazine once known as House 
&amp; Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Some predicted disaster when ousted editor Grace Mirabella started her own 
magazine, with her own name, and aimed at the over-40 woman Vogue seemed to be 
neglecting. On Seventh Avenue, the fashion advertisers who depend on Vogue 
seemed unsettled by the changes. 
</P>
<P>
But evidently they have adjusted, for Vogue's ad revenue is up 17% for the 
first nine months of the year, after a 10% year-to-year rise in 1988. Vogue "is 
back on track," acknowledged competitor Diamandis, whose company owns Elle. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse is unquestionably on track with Vanity Fair, the namesake of the 
celebrated society magazine of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Announced in 1980, the magazine had gone through two editors, two publishers 
and a series of face lifts by early 1984. The thoughts and life styles of 
intellectuals were featured in one incarnation; another dwelt on the jet set's 
Manhattan party-going. ("It was the daily journal of Eurotrash," said New 
Yorker writer Calvin Trillin.) 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's fortunes began to change in April, 1984, when the current 
editor, British-born Tina Brown, began to give Vanity Fair a clear focus, 
emphasizing show business personalities along with articles on weightier 
subjects. Ad revenue has increased an average of 60% a year since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
If the company doesn't have an elaborately plotted strategy, said Vanity Fair 
Publisher Johnston, "there is a vision. It's Si's vision." 
</P>
<P>
The most publicized upheaval in Newhouse's empire came at the New Yorker, the 
admired literary weekly he purchased in 1985 for $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
When Newhouse fired Editor William Shawn, 154 staff members signed a letter of 
protest that asked Newhouse's chosen successor, Robert Gottlieb, not to take 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
Both Newhouse and his father had coveted the magazine for years, but it may 
have proved a more difficult investment than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
While circulation is up 25% from 1985 and advertising revenue has advanced 
about 7% in the first nine months of this year, many in the industry believe it 
is not making money and that more change is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Many expect Newhouse will be forced to order major editorial changes to attract 
enough younger readers to guarantee the magazine's future. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that, at the very least, Newhouse will have to add more pictures 
and more stories tailored to the impatient readers of the video age; others 
predict that only by "softening" the magazine -- perhaps with Vanity Fair-style 
glitz -- will Newhouse be able to give the New Yorker the needed boost. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorker President Steven Florio insisted that the magazine is already on the 
right track, but he acknowledged the difficulty of running an institution that 
is so closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of an uncomfortable fishbowl existence," he said. "If Bob (Gottlieb) 
makes changes, some people scream, 'They're changing it!' If he doesn't do 
anything, some people scream, 'They're not changing it enough!' " 
</P>
<P>
Is Newhouse now satisfied with the New Yorker's progress? "The concept of 
complete satisfaction is like the concept of truth," Newhouse said. "You can 
move toward it, but you never entirely get there." 
</P>
<P>
But if rapid change is the norm, some of his lieutenants say they understand 
the ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
"If my figures were down for a year, I understand he'd be lunching other 
editors," said Vanity Fair's Brown. "That's the way the game is played." 
</P>
<P>
The lieutenants who do have Newhouse's confidence are well rewarded. Top 
editors at Conde Nast are sometimes given automobiles and clothing allowances 
in addition to salaries that are among the best in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a morale problem here, it hasn't made it hard for me to find 
people," Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his role at the book and magazine businesses, Newhouse has other 
company duties, including attending to the IRS suit that may pose the the 
biggest single threat to the family fortune. 
</P>
<P>
The case revolves around the value of the 1,000 shares of common stock that S. 
I. Sr. bequeathed to his sons when he died. 
</P>
<P>
The family has contended that the shares didn't represent the full worth of the 
company, since other family members, who held preferred shares, got an equal 
say in the running of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS has maintained that since the bequest included the sole voting shares, 
they represented control, and the full estate should be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has scaled back its original demand but still wants $609 million 
plus interest from the family. 
</P>
<P>
A tax court judge may rule on the case early next year, though some observers 
still expect a settlement in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
There are now about 20 Newhouses in some role at the company, including 10 in 
management positions. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Steven Newhouse, who is publisher of the Jersey Journal daily 
newspaper and was rumored to be in the running for the Random House job. 
</P>
<P>
Si Newhouse said the family hasn't decided who will succeed him when he retires 
and denied that there's any competition between members of the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
"The transition will be smooth," he predicted. 
</P>

GROUP CHALLENGES WELLS FARGO HIRING, LENDING PRACTICES

In what may put more pressure on banks to expand lending to low-income groups, 
a coalition of California civil rights and business groups on Monday asked 
regulators to block Wells Fargo Bank's proposed acquisition of American 
National Bank because of Wells' alleged failure to follow equal opportunity 
employment and lending practices. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint is among a growing number of challenges of bank mergers by 
community groups nationwide under the federal Community Reinvestment Act. The 
1977 law allows regulators reviewing bank mergers to consider whether those 
financial institutions are making loans and providing credit in the 
neighborhoods where their depositors live. 
</P>
<P>
In an 11-page letter sent to the federal Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency -- which regulates national banks including Wells Fargo -- the Latino 
Issues Forum, Black Business Assn. of Los Angeles and 24 other groups 
complained that Wells Fargo has a poor record of lending to low-income and 
minority groups because the bank favors risky "leveraged buyouts at the expense 
of (meeting) community needs." 
</P>
<P>
The group, which asked the Comptroller to conduct an audit of Wells Fargo and 
hold a public hearing on its claims, also alleged that Wells is the only major 
California bank that has no blacks, Asians or Latinos on its board and that 
only three of its top 125 managers are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo acknowledged that it currently has no 
minorities on its 15-member board and analysts say it is one of the largest 
lenders to highly leveraged transactions in the nation -- with about $3.1 
billion in leveraged buyout loans outstanding in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Betty Lattie, a Wells Fargo vice president in San Francisco, said the 
coalition was citing erroneous and misleading figures to bolster its claims. 
</P>
<P>
Lattie said leveraged buyout transactions financed by Wells Fargo represent 
less than one-tenth of the bank's $37.7-billion loan portfolio. She also said 
that Wells Fargo has had minorities on its board in past years and currently 
has more than three minorities among its 125 top managers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not in our interests to be against California," Lattie said. "It's in 
our interest to meet community needs." 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo, the state's third-largest bank with $48 billion in assets, has 
been buying smaller banks recently as it seeks to expand in California through 
acquisitions. In September, it agreed to acquire American National Bank for 
about $160 million. American, which is owned by Central Pacific Corp. of 
Bakersfield, has 28 branches from Modesto to San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable federal regulators could not be reached for comment Monday. But 
in recent months, a number of protests similar to the one filed against Wells 
Fargo have been lodged against First Interstate Bank, Security Pacific Bank and 
other banks across the country by various community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the complaints, which have met with mixed success, have relied on 
community service provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act to try to 
persuade banks to increase services and lending to minorities and those with 
low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
The protests recall the citizens activist movement that enveloped the nation's 
broadcasters after former Federal Communications Commission member Nicholas 
Johnson wrote a book in 1970 called "How to Talk Back to Your Television Set." 
The book, which criticized stations' alleged failure to broadcast in the public 
interest, prompted dozens of challenges to television and radio broadcast 
licenses by civil rights and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Such grass-root protest movements waned in the 1980s during the climate of 
federal deregulation encouraged during the Reagan Administration. But in recent 
years, with increased nationwide concern over issues such as housing, the 
environment and drug safety, citizen groups have again turned to federal 
regulators for help, especially in encouraging banks to lend to low-income 
consumers and do more to finance community redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"They have discovered a new weapon," said Joe Belew, president of the Consumer 
Bankers Assn., a suburban Washington trade group that represents large retail 
banks such as Wells Fargo. "I'm very concerned, and I think the entire industry 
is concerned, that the CRA act is being misused." 
</P>
<P>
In February, for example, the Federal Reserve Board turned down a request by 
Continental Illinois National Bank of Chicago to buy a small bank in Arizona 
after the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union used the Community 
Reinvestment Act to challenge Continental's alleged failure to serve low-income 
residents. In blocking the merger, the Fed said Continental "did not have a 
plan" for complying with the act and "made no significant effort to ascertain 
the credit needs of its communities." 
</P>
<P>
More recently in October, the Fed delayed action on the proposed merger between 
Charlotte-based First Union Corp. and Florida National Banks of Jacksonville 
after the Charlotte Reinvestment Alliance picketed First Union headquarters, 
claiming that just 5.8% of the bank's mortgage loans went to minority groups 
representing 21.8% of the area's population. 
</P>
<P>
The protests were dropped Monday after First Union announced that it would 
provide $9 million in mortgages and business loans to low-income neighborhoods 
in Charlotte.

Sales of new North American-made cars fell 6.1% in mid-November from the same 
period last year, auto makers reported Monday in the latest indication of their 
industry's weakness. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's lengthening sales slump -- which has been paced by the Big Three 
of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. -- could mean that 
auto makers will lengthen their year-end factory shutdowns in an attempt to 
trim production and deflate an inventory backlog, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The eight major companies making cars and light trucks in North America said 
they sold an average of 31,032 vehicles daily during the Nov. 11-20 period, 
compared to a daily rate of 32,466 during the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Light truck sales fell 1.8% during the period, putting the decline for both 
cars and light trucks at 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
For the Big Three, overall vehicle sales were down 8.6% from last year during 
the 10-day period. 
</P>
<P>
Through Nov. 20 of this year, car and truck sales from all U.S.-based 
manufacturers were 2.6% behind last year's pace. Car sales were down 3.6% and 
truck sales were off 0.8% during the year-to-date period. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's sales slide began in early October.

Butcher Pleads Guilty: Former Tennessee financial wizard Jake Butcher and a 
close associate pleaded guilty to two counts of a federal indictment accusing 
them of defrauding an Orlando, Fla., bank of $3.9 million. The plea-bargain 
agreements in the complex case were entered before U.S. District Judge G. 
Kendall Sharp shortly before the two men were to have gone on trial. Butcher, 
who until 1983 headed a financial empire of 28 banks in Tennessee and Kentucky, 
is serving a 20-year prison term for bank fraud. Also pleading guilty was Earl 
D. Wilson, who worked for Butcher at the time the banks failed and is serving a 
10-year sentence for bank fraud. Butcher's attorney, Edward Garland of Atlanta, 
said related conspiracy charges against his client would be dropped.

HOME RESALE PACE HIGHEST SINCE JANUARY

Sales of existing homes held at a steady pace in October as lower mortgage 
rates opened the resale market to a wider range of buyers, the National Assn. 
of Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The trade association said sales of single-family homes at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate totaled 3.52 million in October, unchanged from 
September's revised rate and down 4.3% from the October, 1988, rate of 3.68 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The resale pace was the highest since January's rate of 3.55 million units and 
not that much lower than the solid housing years of 1986 and 1987, said Rob 
Rosenblatt, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The future for the overall housing market is a bit brighter because of a 
slowdown in economic activity coupled with a slow but steady drop in mortgage 
rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A decline in interest rates nationwide began in March, and the trend is 
expected to continue, housing economists said. 
</P>
<P>
They expect mortgage rates to remain low into the first quarter of 1990, 
possibly through the spring, dropping to about 9% from the current average of 
9.75%. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported Nov. 17 that the national average 
for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 9.72%. 
</P>
<P>
The national median price for existing single-family homes was $92,100, down 
$2,200 from September but up $3,200 from the same period a year ago. The median 
represents the price at which half the homes sold are more expensive and half 
are less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"Home financing conditions probably will stay quite favorable in the months 
ahead," said John Tuccillo, NAR chief economist. "But rates can't drop low 
enough in high-cost areas to make homes affordable to buyers on a tight 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the West was the only area recording a month-to-month resale pace 
increase, with October home sales rising 3.4% from September to 610,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
The median existing home price in the West was $142,200 in October, which was 
$5,400 below the previous month but $12,200 above October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Stable activity was recorded in the South, with existing home sales totaling 
1.34 million units, unchanged from September, while the median home price fell 
$1,000 from September to $83,400. 
</P>
<P>
In the Midwest, the region containing the largest concentration of affordable 
housing, the October resale rate dropped 1% to 980,000 units from 990,000 the 
previous month, while the median home price slipped $1,300 to $70,900. 
</P>
<P>
The Northeast resale pace dipped to 580,000 units, down 1.7% from 590,000 in 
September, while the median home price fell $2,400 from September to $143,300. 
</P>
<P>
In October, there were 2.11 million existing single-family homes available for 
sale, representing a 7.2-month supply at the month's resale rate. 
</P>
<P>
In September, an inventory of 2.32 million units was recorded, which was a 
7.9-month supply at the September resale rate.

GOLD DECLINES IN A ROUND OF PROFIT TAKING

The price of gold, which soared last week to a high for the year, suffered a 
setback Monday in a round of profit taking -- but analysts remain optimistic 
that the precious metal will soon resume its rise. 
</P>
<P>
In lively trading on the New York Commodity Exchange, gold futures closed 
Monday with losses amid heightened worries about the political upheaval in 
Eastern European countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold had six days of consecutive increases, and, on the seventh day, the 
market needed a rest," John Brimelow of Keane Securities said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $5.20 to $6.10 lower, with the contract for delivery in 
December down $5.20 at $414.10 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all profit taking that is long overdue, and traders are capitalizing on 
the lower prices," said George Nickas, a trader at Geldermann Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Gold leaped $25 an ounce last week and hit a 1989 high of $419.70 Friday, 
eclipsing the previous high of $413 an ounce set in January, as investors 
snapped up the metal for its safe-haven status, wary of the economic impact of 
continuing East Bloc upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
A weaker dollar last week also boosted the price of gold, which is seen as a 
solid investment in times of economic or political uncertainty.

The stock market racked up another solid gain Monday, despite a surge in 
short-term interest rates amid new signs that the Federal Reserve may not 
loosen up on credit to get the economy moving. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up 22.89 points last week, rose another 
19.42 to 2,694.97. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 149.39 million shares, against 86.29 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 883 up, 612 down and 489 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The market began to rise last week on signs that the Federal Reserve was taking 
steps for the second time this month to relax its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
That development prompted Fed watchers to conclude that the central bank had 
decided to become more aggressive in its efforts to cushion the impact of a 
slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
The new trading week began amid talk of impending reductions in major banks' 
prime lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
There was also conjecture that the Fed might make its intentions clearer before 
long by cutting the discount rate, the charge that it imposes on loans to 
private financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
That optimism faded a bit in Monday's activity, as the Federal Reserve drained 
cash from the banking system in its open market operations early in the day, 
dashing hopes for an immediate credit easing and a cut in banks' prime lending 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron climbed 3 1/4 to 68 1/4 in active trading. The company said it would 
create a leveraged employee stock ownership plan financed with borrowings of 
about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric gained 1 1/4 to 61 3/8. GE said it was a buyer of its shares 
as part of a recently announced $10-billion repurchase program slated for the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Among other actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose 1 to 46 7/8; Bristol-Myers 
Squibb added 1/8 to 56 1/2; Philip Morris was unchanged at 41 1/2; American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph lost 5/8 to 43 1/8, and International Business 
Machines was down 1 at 99 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-share Nikkei index soared to a record close Monday 
for the fourth-straight session. It finished up 397.06 points, or 1.1%, at 
36,881.53. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices on London's stock exchange were slightly higher. The Financial 
Times 100-share index closed up 1.9 points at 2,224.3.

Bond Prices Fall as Fed Funds Rate Rises 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices dropped and short-term interest rates jumped Monday 
after the Fed drained reserves from the banking system, confounding traders who 
had guessed that the central bank had decided to relax its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 13/32 point, or $4 per $1,000 face 
amount, while its yield climbed to 7.90% from 7.87% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on some short-term Treasury bills were up more sharply, soaring by as 
much as two-tenths of a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Federal Reserve drained money from the banking system about 
an hour earlier than its normal intervention time Monday morning, driving the 
key federal funds rate up to 8.50% by the end of the day from 8.25% late 
Friday.

Interest Rate Fears Pull Dollar Down 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell sharply against most major foreign currencies Monday as traders 
anticipated a further decline in interest rates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The psychology is definitely bearish for the dollar and bullish for the (West 
German) mark," said Earl Johnson, a vice president for foreign exchange at 
Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Traders expected interest rates to fall in this country in response to a 
slowing economy, and to rise in West Germany because of the continuing 
political changes in Eastern Europe, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's downward trend is expected to remain in place in the next few 
weeks unless the Bush Administration issues new statistics indicating strength 
in the economy, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 143.35 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen at 
Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 143.40 yen, but in New York, it 
fell to 143.195 yen from late Friday's 143.60. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against the British pound, as sterling fell to $1.5605 from 
$1.5635 late Friday in London, and to $1.5585 from $1.5625 late Friday in New 
York.

Energy Futures Dip as OPEC Talks Stall 
</P>
<P>
U.S. energy futures closed lower after OPEC ministers ended the fifth day of 
talks without setting a ceiling on total oil output or allocating quotas for 
the first half of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
January crude oil fell 19 cents to $19.63 a barrel. December unleaded gasoline 
fell 0.74 cent to 50.89 cents a gallon and December heating oil fell 0.49 cent 
to 60.92 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, cotton futures plunged the permitted daily limit; 
soybeans were down sharply; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Most cotton futures prices fell the daily limit of 2 cents a pound on the New 
York Cotton Exchange in a selloff inspired almost entirely by technical sell 
signals in the absence of fresh supply-and-demand news. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton settled 1.75 to 2.33 cents lower, with March at 71.08 cents a pound; and 
the December contract, which has no limit pending expiration, was down 2.33 
cents at 67.72 cents a pound.

MARKETING: ADVERTISERS HOPE REGIONAL CAMPAIGNS WILL GET 'EM WHERE THEY LIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ

<TEXT>
<P>
The way Amil Gargano figures it, Los Angeles residents see things differently 
from people who live in New York. 
</P>
<P>
So the Manhattan adman asked himself, why use the same ads in both cities? 
</P>
<P>
His agency, Ally &amp; Gargano, recently created some provocative print ads for 
a brand of premium dog food that is supposedly so nutritious that it makes dog 
droppings less messy. To get that rather unsavory point across in the Los 
Angeles market, the ad showed a sour-faced jogger looking disgustedly at the 
bottom of his shoe. "If more dogs in L.A. ate Purina Hi Pro," the headline 
says, "it would seem like there were less dogs in L.A." To make that same point 
in New York, the ad showed a well-dressed businessman discovering the same 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in a New York apartment building with about 500 dogs and three 
children," said Gargano. "You have to be in training like a football running 
back to get from your home to your office unscathed. The same message applies 
to people in Los Angeles, but we knew we had to change it slightly to get Los 
Angeles residents to relate to it." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, a new print ad campaign for Jim Beam bourbon has come up with very 
different ways to talk to Los Angeles residents and New Yorkers. The theme of 
the campaign, which was created by Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott, is 
"you always come back to the basics." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles campaign theme shows six matchbook covers from Los Angeles 
restaurants that have been in vogue over the years. The oldest matchbook, dated 
1950, is from the Hollywood dining institution, Musso &amp; Frank Grill. This 
is followed by restaurants from the '60s, '70s and '80s that have fed some of 
the biggest stars -- and biggest egos -- in town. Finally, the last matchbook 
cover, dated 1990, is once again from Musso &amp; Frank Grill. 
</P>
<P>
But to get that same message across in New York, the company didn't use 
matchbooks. Instead, it used Playbill magazine covers of popular Broadway 
shows. The Playbill displayed from the 1950s is from "Gypsy." It is followed by 
a series of plays from the '60s, '70s and '80s, and ends with the Playbill for 
"Gypsy" in 1990. The play just reopened on Broadway this month. 
</P>
<P>
Behind these campaigns for dog food and bourbon is the increasingly popular 
advertising strategy of regionalization. Over the years, consumers have become 
accustomed to regionalized ads for items such as cars (i.e., Southern 
California Ford Dealers Assn.) or fast food (McDonald's Operators' Assn. of 
Southern California). But industry executives say when the makers of products 
like bourbon and dog food begin to create targeted ads for specific regions 
like New York and Los Angeles, the trend is unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new movement that has only recently taken shape," said Gary L. 
Frazier, associate professor of marketing at USC. "It is an attempt by 
advertisers to cut through the clutter. Clearly, the more specialized you can 
make your ad, the more persuasive it can be." 
</P>
<P>
Take the dog food ad, for example. Yet another version that ran in the Dallas 
market also featured a businessman -- but he was wearing cowboy boots and a 
cowboy hat. And the makers of Jim Beam brand bourbon now say a follow-up 
campaign in the Los Angeles market may feature some night clubs -- or even some 
local architectural landmarks -- that have come and gone from prominence. 
</P>
<P>
"It jogs your attention when you see your town mentioned in an ad," said Vic 
Olesen, president of the Los Angeles agency, Vic Olesen &amp; Partners. "It 
works for the same reason that people from Cucamonga will applaud when they 
hear Cucamonga mentioned. It's self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, said Miles Turpin, chairman of the Western division of Grey 
Advertising, "this all sounds like recognition of the theory that mass 
marketing is dead. More companies are asking themselves: Can I focus locally 
and do a better job communicating?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer appears to be yes. 
</P>
<P>
Several big packaged goods makers, including Procter &amp; Gamble, have 
recently begun to shift money from their national ad campaigns to regional 
advertising ventures. And earlier this year, Burger King hired separate 
agencies to create its regional and national campaigns. Also, a growing number 
of publications are offering advertisers the opportunity to place regional ads. 
</P>
<P>
Even when creating ads within the state of California for client Lucky Stores, 
Turpin said his agency sometimes creates subtle differences between the ads 
that run in the northern and southern regions of the state. For example, he 
said, in the competitive Southern California market, Lucky tries to attract 
customers with ads that promote certain grades of beef not available at its 
stores in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Executives from both Ralston-Purina and Jim Beam said their regional campaigns 
are still so new that it's too early to tell how they have affected local 
sales. But both companies indicate that they will continue to create these ads. 
</P>
<P>
"In the very near future, companies that don't regionalize their ads may be 
open to trouble," said USC's Frazier. "But as more and more companies go into 
regionalized ads, there will be more failed campaigns. Remember, the key to 
competitive advertising is doing what everyone else isn't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Creators of 'Mac Tonight' Win Arizona McDonald's Account 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles ad agency has sunk its teeth into yet another piece of McDonald's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Davis Ball &amp; Colombatto on Monday was handed the estimated $3.5-million 
account from the Phoenix &amp; Northern Arizona McDonald's Operator's Assn. 
franchisee group. With this win, the agency will annually create more than $40 
million worth of regional ads for the hamburger giant. The agency, which also 
creates McDonald's ads seen in the Los Angeles market, now ranks as the 
nation's second-largest creator of McDonald's regional ads. 
</P>
<P>
Davis Ball &amp; Colombatto may be best known for its "Mac Tonight" ads that 
feature a man who wears a giant moon-shaped head and sings McDonald's lyrics to 
the old Bobby Darin tune, "Mac the Knife." 
</P>
<P>
Since that successful campaign, the agency has picked up other McDonald's 
business, including that of the Tucson-area franchisees earlier this year. 
These wins come at the heels of the stinging loss earlier this fall of longtime 
client Glendale Federal Bank. "We're ready to rebound after the Glendale 
Federal loss," said Brad Ball, president of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The agency will now open a new office in Phoenix to service the new McDonald's 
account. And besides the regional pieces of McDonald's business, it will seek 
national assignments from the chain. "Each time we get a little more into the 
McDonald's family, the opportunity grows to pick up national assignments," said 
Ball. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Burnett of Chicago is McDonald's national ad agency.

Irvine Ranch Market Wants to Bag New Image With New Agency 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Ranch Farmers Market has had a shopping cart full of problems over 
the past two years. During that time, its founder filed for personal bankruptcy 
and the chain closed or sold a number of its stores. 
</P>
<P>
But with the help of a newly selected agency and a new ad campaign, the upscale 
chain that specializes in fresh produce hopes to turn things around. Last week 
it handed its estimated $750,000 annual account to Los Angeles ad agency Larsen 
Colby Koralek. 
</P>
<P>
How to persuade consumers to shop at Irvine Ranch? "We're going to point out 
what makes them different," said Rick Colby, creative director at the agency. 
"Their foods come from all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a Thanksgiving ad that the agency created pointed out that the 
supermarket sells Brie cheese from France, pineapples from Tahiti, peppers from 
Holland and asparagus from Chile. Not to mention coffee from Kenya. 
</P>
<P>

Nike's McEnroe Super Bowl Ad Is New Racket for Tennis Pro 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for Doug Dean in Nike's upcoming Super Bowl commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Dean is a Beverly Hills tennis instructor. But last week he found himself on 
the tennis court taking a lesson from one of the best: John McEnroe. The two 
men were at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, where McEnroe was being filmed for his 
part in Nike's Super Bowl commercial. Dean -- who will not appear anywhere in 
the commercial -- was there simply to keep hitting the ball back to McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not often that a tennis pro gets to hit with one of the best players in 
the world," said Dean, who was picked for the assignment by his buddy, Joe 
Pytka, who directed the spot. "As many times as I've watched McEnroe on TV, 
it's pretty weird to see his serve coming at you on the court." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, McEnroe was impressed with Dean. "I don't know who I played," 
said McEnroe, after the filming, "but that guy was like a human backboard."

MCCARTNEY MASTERS THE POSSIBILITIES, INKS DEAL WITH VISA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul McCartney -- acknowledged as one of rock's richest stars -- is getting 
richer. It was announced Monday that Visa will sponsor the ex-Beatle's 1990 
U.S. concert dates. 
</P>
<P>
At a Forum press conference to announce an 11-city U.S. concert swing and 
acknowledge the possibility of a Beatles reunion, McCartney also found himself 
defending his just-signed Visa sponsorship deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as a sellout and anyone who does ought to go live in Russia," 
McCartney said. "This is a capitalist country." He added that he would not 
actually be pushing product: "As far as I'm concerned, it's them promoting us." 
</P>
<P>
The reported $8.5-million advertising campaign will feature McCartney and tout 
the fact that his concerts "don't take American Express" -- Visa will be the 
only credit card accepted for purchase of McCartney concert tickets. 
McCartney's 1990 tour will start in Detroit on Feb. 1, with additional cities 
to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference, the rock star was forming a portion of a Visa 
television spot outside the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The first-ever appearances of McCartney in advertising follows such noted 
corporate-rock hook-ups as Michael Jackson and Pepsi, and sponsorships of the 
Who's summer tour by Miller beer and the current Rolling Stones trek by 
Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of rock and sponsorship has long been controversial, both for the 
general concern about the commercialization of what was once perceived as a 
counter-culture phenomenon and for such specific brouhahas as Pepsi's tie-in 
earlier this year with Madonna's "Like a Prayer," for which the singer produced 
a video which some called blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney himself was critical that Michael Jackson, who had purchased the 
Beatles song catalogue, allowed the song "Revolution" to be used in 1987 
television ads for Nike. The Beatles sued for $15 million, fans wrote the shoe 
company vituperative letters and Nike abandoned the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But McCartney was in turn chastised by members of the rock community for 
selling songs from the Buddy Holly catalogue, which he owns, for commercials 
(one turned "Oh Boy!" into "Oh Buick!"). 
</P>
<P>
Already there has been negative reaction to the announcement from rock 
observers and Beatles fans. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal preference would be that they don't have sponsors, especially 
someone like McCartney, for whom money is not a problem," said Jim Henke, 
managing editor of Rolling Stone magazine, acknowledging that he finds it less 
offensive than if someone with the image of a Bruce Springsteen had agreed to 
sponsorship. "But he's an ex-Beatle and has that tradition and body of work to 
uphold." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney is not the first Beatle to take the commercial route, however. Ringo 
Starr has pitched wine coolers and stars in one of the "This Is Not Your 
Father's Oldsmobile" commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The tour is McCartney's first since the 1976 "Wings Over America" series. Where 
those featured a few songs from the Beatles era, the current shows are 
dominated by them, with selections drawing on the innocence of the early 
Beatles and the turmoil and upheaval of the later '60s. 
</P>
<P>
As for McCartney's own one-time revolutionary image (as recently as January, 
1980, he spent nine days in a Tokyo jail for possession of marijuana), a Visa 
spokesman dropped the subject like a bad credit risk. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that he's a perfect association," said Dave Brancoli, director of 
public relations for San Francisco-based Visa USA. "He does have a very 
family-oriented image that fits in nicely with the demographics of our card 
owners."

SCHICKELE PLANS PASADENA END TO TOURS AS P.D.Q. BACH; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: AN EMPHASIS ON OTHER COMPOSING PUSHES ASIDE 25-YEAR CAREER OF CLASSICAL 
MUSIC SATIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE METCALF, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with all the usual reasons for going to see P.D.Q. Bach, there is now one 
bittersweet additional one. 
</P>
<P>
Sad to say, this may be the last time around for the hapless composer of 
"Concerto for Horn and Hardart," the "No-No Nonette," the "Schleptet in E-flat" 
and many even less distinguished pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I've decided that this season is my next-to-last touring with P.D.Q.," 
said Peter Schickele, the man who, as "Prof." Peter Schickele, not only 
discovered P.D.Q. -- the fictive, besotted last-born son of J.S. Bach -- but 
also parlayed him into a hefty, improbable 25-year career. 
</P>
<P>
"My last regular concert will be April 1, 1991, which is of course P.D.Q.'s 
birthday," said Schickele by phone from his country getaway in Woodstock, N.Y. 
"It will be with the Pasadena Symphony, which is conducted by Jorge Mester. It 
was Mester who conducted the first P.D.Q. concert when we were Juilliard 
students in 1959, and the very first public concert in 1965." 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, Schickele softened the shocking finality of this announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't necessarily be a complete goodby to P.D.Q. I still plan on doing the 
New York concerts during the last week in December, as long as a crowd shows 
up. And some more recordings." 
</P>
<P>
But with the end of regular touring, an era will end. P.D.Q. Bach concerts -- 
with their distinctive blend of deliciously low slapstick and brilliant musical 
parody -- have taken their place in the very top drawer of musical satire. The 
shows appeal to all levels of musical and comedic sophistication. They are even 
loved by most classical music fans, a group not always associated with a 
razor-sharp sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
The P.D.Q. performances are physically taxing. Making one's entrance by 
shimmying down a knotted rope from a balcony places more of a demand on one 
than, say, walking on from the wings. But the endomorphic, 54-year-old 
Schickele says it is not declining stamina that's behind P.D.Q's 
semi-retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got other things I want to do. I've got an idea for a radio program and a 
couple of television possibilities. These aren't signed and sealed, so I can't 
really talk about them. I also enjoyed the few film scores I've done (four 
altogether, including "Silent Running") and would like to do more. But the 
trouble with that business is that they always want you to start tomorrow, and 
I'm booked up two years in advance." 
</P>
<P>
He also cites the mounting commissions for his "serious" music. This has always 
been a touchy point for Schickele, who was a graduate composition student of 
the eminent composer Vincent Persichetti. Schickele's non-P.D.Q. music is 
widely performed and, for the most part, warmly embraced by audiences and 
critics. But Schickele is clearly discomfited that the unwelcome shadow of 
P.D.Q. hangs inappropriately over many of the serious performances. "Some 
people go into a concert of my serious stuff determined to find things to laugh 
at. And they do. It's as if they can't accept the distinction." 
</P>
<P>
So one additional purpose of P.D.Q.'s withdrawal from the public stage will be 
to help put the two aspects of Schickele's career into what he regards as a 
healthier balance. 
</P>
<P>
"My hope is that in the long run there would be an appreciation for both. To me 
they are very complementary. In a way, the spirit that leads P.D.Q. also gives 
my serious music a sunny, dramatic quality. . . . On the other hand, to tell 
you the truth, if I were forced to list my favorite works -- something I hope 
I'm never forced to do -- I would include some P.D.Q. pieces along with the 
Peter Schickele pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Schickele conceded that without the impetus of touring, certain ideas for gags 
or bits that have been percolating may never be realized. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an 'Ideas' file that's full of napkins from Holiday Inns and that kind 
of thing. Over the years some of them have indeed turned into pieces." 
</P>
<P>
One of them that hasn't is a rather recondite idea for a sendup of Paul 
Hindemith's Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes by Carl Maria von Weber. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be fun to write a piece called 'Symphonic Metamorphosis on 
Themes From Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes by Carl Maria von Weber by Paul 
Hindemith by Peter Schickele.' But I'm not sure the piece could have ever lived 
up to the title." 
</P>
<P>
Schickele also noted ruefully that certain P.D.Q. instruments may forever 
remain in the concept stage. "A timpanist wanted me to invent a ukulele da 
gamba, and I'm sorry I didn't do it." The uke would have been played -- like 
the now-out-of-fashion viola da gamba -- upright, between the performer's 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
But the P.D.Q. muse is not silent. Schickele recently released a new recording 
on the Telarc label and another is already in the works. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the same arrangement with Telarc that I used to have with Vanguard (his 
longtime record company during the '60s and '70s). It's a gentleman's agreement 
that I won't do any P.D.Q. Bach records without telling them first. But I'm not 
tied down to having to produce one a year, or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are some P.D.Q. commissions left to honor. Among them at the 
moment is a piece that will premiere later this season with the Cleveland 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Its title alone should reassure any P.D.Q. fans who fear that the master is in 
danger of losing his creative spark. It's called . . . "The Safe Sextet."

RICK DU BROW: 'CHEERS' HELPS NBC SWEEP THE RATINGS AGAIN 
</P>

TV or Not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
THAT CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON: The November sweeps end Wednesday, and NBC wins again 
</P>
<P>
but the most astonishing performance comes from "Cheers" and its amazing 
endurance in its eighth season. The stratospheric ratings for "Cheers" in its 
new NBC episodes are unaffected by rerun saturation such as KTLA's 11 p.m. 
repeats of the sitcom seven nights a week. That's right -- every night, or 
hadn't you noticed? 
</P>
<P>
VERDICT: The question about CBS' "The Famous Teddy Z" -- set in a Hollywood 
talent agency -- was whether they'd buy it in Peoria. Hollywood loved it. 
Peoria didn't. Actually, there's probably not a lot of identification with it 
in Bakersfield or Riverside, either. So much for the wisdom of the Bel-Air 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT: With NBC transferring "Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow" 
and its re-enactments from the news division to the entertainment department 
after tonight's broadcast, ABC is boasting that it would never put on such 
journalistic flimflam. The network has a better idea -- carefully labeled news 
fiction, you could call it. On Dec. 7, ABC airs "The Blue X Conspiracy," with 
real-life U.S. and Soviet government officials taking part in a crisis game -- 
set in 1991 -- of what might happen if an American President were hit "with an 
incapacitating poison gas." Just call it pre-enactment. 
</P>
<P>
FAREWELL TOUR: Those romantic potboilers that CBS has a penchant for are 
probably in for a long, long rest after last week's production of "Till We Meet 
Again." They seem somehow quaint and outdated in an era when Farrah Fawcett is 
socking it home in "Small Sacrifices." 
</P>
<P>
THE HOWLING: Nobody ever said NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff 
wasn't funny. Proof: He's scheduled "The Goddess of Love," 1988's camp classic 
with Vanna White as Venus reborn, for a rerun New Year's Eve. Talk about 
turning a sow's ear into a silk purse. This could become a New Year's Eve 
tradition, a kind of TV "Rocky Horror Show" to go with the champagne and "Auld 
Lang Syne." Perfect. But what a way to end the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
SCROOGED: CBS has issued a warning that it's going to rerun "A Very Brady 
Christmas" on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
TRIBUTE: But what a fine idea for CBS, in this year of Lucille Ball's death, to 
schedule her 1956 "I Love Lucy" Christmas show for Dec. 18. The network says it 
hasn't been seen in 33 years. Explains CBS Entertainment President Kim 
LeMasters: "Because it contained flashback sequences from earlier 'I Love Lucy' 
episodes, it was not included in the 'Lucy' syndication package." In any case, 
a must-see for couch potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
FLIP SIDE: Too bad CBS isn't thinking as creatively in all areas. It's the only 
network not involved with cable, which is like walking the high wire without a 
net in these days in which a new TV world is emerging. Surely someone at CBS 
knows that cable now comprises about 22% of the private market value of all 
U.S. media assets and that broadcasting is just a hair ahead with about 23%. 
</P>
<P>
FINAL CUT: Bad move by CBS in dropping film director Peter Bogdanovich's 
splendid video reviews and movie nostalgia from the network's "This Morning" 
series. The cut was made by executive producer Erik Sorenson, former news 
director here of last-place KCBS Channel 2. Why does it seem nonsensical that a 
recent local news honcho should have any say-so in the career of the director 
of "The Last Picture Show"? 
</P>
<P>
TIPOFF: Sorenson, after dropping Bogdanovich, is bringing in KCBS' 
entertainment reporter, Steve Kmetko, to cover Hollywood for "This Morning." 
Kmetko will continue on KCBS as well. But does Sorenson's immediate tapping of 
his old KCBS staff give credence to insider speculation that he might also 
recruit KCBS anchor Jim Lampley and/or Bree Walker for the network's morning 
show? 
</P>
<P>
ZAPPING: Best video I saw all week was Spike Jones and his City Slickers 
tearing into "The Sheik of Araby" on the Nostalgia Channel. 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: Couple of Emmy winners, Daniel J. Travanti ("Hill Street Blues") and 
William Daniels ("St. Elsewhere"), star next Monday in NBC's "Howard Beach: 
Making the Case for Murder," about the ugly New York racial incident. Travanti 
plays the prosecutor of three white teen-agers, and Daniels is their defense 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
PLOT: The way it's shaping up for the return of "Beauty and the Beast," the 
child born to Catherine (Linda Hamilton) and the man-creature Vincent (Ron 
Perlman) won't be seen for a while after the series comes back Dec. 12, says a 
CBS source. That's one way to hold and build an audience after Catherine dies 
and there's a funeral for her in a follow-up episode Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
ENCORE: Isn't it about time for a new series from "Moonlighting" creator Glenn 
Caron? Look, that was great stuff until it went off the track. Caron once 
described David (Bruce Willis) and Maddie (Cybill Shepherd) like this: "He 
plants his feet and looks her in the eye and tells her what's what. He doesn't 
crack open a bottle of white wine and say, 'Let's discuss this.' She feels free 
to snap back at him. That's kind of fun." Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "Sometimes you have to get to know someone really well to realize 
you're really strangers." Mary Richards, "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."

GORBACHEV FACES CRUCIAL YEAR AS ECONOMY WORSENS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time is quickly running out for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and 1990 
appears increasingly likely to be the year when his reforms will succeed or 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
The original economic crisis that forced the Soviet leadership to rethink 70 
years of socialism has deepened. And as Gorbachev prepares for his 
Mediterranean summit meeting with President Bush this weekend, the Soviet 
Union's empty stores mock his promises of plenty with the reform of socialism. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic political changes of the last four years -- a free-wheeling 
Parliament, open debate on the most sensitive issues, multi-candidate 
elections, a virtually uncensored press -- have not yet developed the muscle 
necessary to transform the whole Soviet system and resolve the country's acute 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The restive non-Russian nations around the periphery of the Soviet Union are 
now a ring of mounting unrest that runs from the Baltic republics of Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania through Moldavia and the Ukraine down to Armenia, 
Azerbaijan and Georgia and across Central Asia. Their push for independence is 
spurred as much by despair of substantial changes in the Soviet system as by 
their resurgent nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Social discontent is growing rapidly. As the lines for food and consumer goods 
lengthen, tempers grow shorter and police report more and more street 
disturbances. Serious crimes have increased more than 35% so far this year. 
Strikes, rare a year ago, are becoming common, and worker slowdowns often 
paralyze whole regions or industries. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 million people -- one in seven -- now live below the official 
poverty line, subsisting on the equivalent of less than $80 a month. Inflation 
is running at nearly 10% a year, according to official figures, and this has 
more than eroded the pay gains of most of the middle class. Unemployment, once 
virtually unknown, has become a serious problem in certain regions. Corruption 
and black-market dealings have become the way of virtually everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all this, ordinary people are starting to demand to know when they will 
see the better life Gorbachev promised when he assumed the Soviet leadership 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even his most dedicated supporters have developed an "eleventh-hour" 
psychology, and some have begun suggesting that Gorbachev ought to assume 
dictatorial powers to ensure the success of his program -- although at what 
they concede would be the "temporary" cost of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The future of our society will depend not only and not so much on the economy 
as on whether we manage to avoid political blunders capable of provoking 
citizens into taking anti-constitutional actions," Otto Latsis, the influential 
deputy editor of the Communist Party journal Kommunist, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The nation's leadership must advance a series of political initiatives to help 
people regain their faith in reform and their faith in the strength of our 
socialist system that has been in for much battering lately." 
</P>
<P>
What has brought on such pessimism, skepticism, cynicism and fear is, most 
observers agree, the destruction of the country's old political and economic 
system without its replacement by the socialist millennium that Gorbachev had 
suggested could come with perestroika, his program of economic and political 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Only 23% See Gains 
</P>
<P>
The scale of this crisis of confidence became apparent in a survey conducted 
last month by the National Center for the Analysis of Public Opinion, which 
found that only 23% of the people questioned felt that their lives had improved 
for the better under perestroika and that 53% now seriously doubted whether the 
reforms would ever improve anything. 
</P>
<P>
And with this wave of pessimism is growing another crisis -- one of legitimacy 
for the Communist Party and Gorbachev as its leader. By what right, people are 
starting to ask, does the Communist Party continue to rule? What justifies its 
offer to share power rather than compete for it with rival groups? Who has 
ordained Gorbachev as the leader of reform and blessed his reform plans? 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev himself acknowledges that the coming year will be "decisive" for his 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at the stage of a historic breakthrough," he told a recent meeting of 
students here. "The fate of our society for many decades is being decided." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's multiple crises -- political, economic, ideological, ethnic 
and social -- must be quickly resolved, his advisers say, if perestroika is to 
retain its focus and regain its momentum in the months before the Communist 
Party congress next October. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are to prepare a program that will carry the nation forward toward the 
21st Century, we must deal with these problems from yesterday," a policy 
specialist from the party Central Committee said. "And then we will recover our 
confidence and our will to forge ahead." 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev admitted this month that the outcome, in fact, is very much in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The changes now seen as necessary are far greater in dimension than first 
imagined, the Soviet leader said, and they must be broadened and accelerated 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"At first glance, everything would seem to be quite simple -- we live in this 
society, we know it, everything is clear," Gorbachev said. "Yet this turned out 
to be the most difficult task. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We came to the concept of perestroika as a revolutionary renewal of socialism 
and of our whole society. . . . We must now look boldly and openly into the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
The reforms proposed by Gorbachev are so fundamental, however, that they amount 
to a redefinition of socialism, and Gorbachev sees this as one of the most 
important aspects of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
The consequent break from the political and economic system developed here over 
seven decades has met with substantial opposition from conservatives in the 
Communist Party and the government bureaucracy and provoked a sharp debate over 
the country's future. 
</P>
<P>
Forced to Compromise 
</P>
<P>
Radicals and conservatives have, as a result, been able to force Gorbachev into 
frequent compromises that have both slowed the reforms and given them the 
uncertain character that now compounds the sense of crisis here. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not know really where he stands," Tatyana Koryagina, a prominent 
economist, complained this month. "Everything depends on Gorbachev. If he is 
not with the conservatives, then he ought to explain to the people openly why 
he has been taking the conservatives' side." 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives have the same complaint, however, and warn that Gorbachev's 
reforms have cast Soviet society adrift. They, too, want a clear blueprint for 
the future, one that lays out means and ends, one that defines the scope of the 
reforms and sets clear limits for them. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, whose whole political style has been characterized as an "ability to 
seize the moment" and then press ahead, continues to reject these demands for 
the reform process, although the cost of the resulting uncertainty is high. 
</P>
<P>
"This would mean only a futile attempt to drive this movement of life into some 
office-bound scheme once again," he said this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Specific decisions must be based on an analysis of the rapidly changing 
situation and with due account, first of all, of the requirements and 
aspirations of the broad masses of people." 
</P>
<P>
To resolve the country's economic problems, Gorbachev has placed considerable 
hope on a new, six-year transitional program that, step by step, will transform 
the centrally planned and managed Soviet economy into one that operates on the 
market principles of supply and demand and that will include privately owned 
businesses and cooperatives competing with state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
In response to nationalist demands from the country's constituent republics for 
greater autonomy and even independence, he is proposing far-reaching 
negotiations to develop a new constitution with a decentralized, federal 
system. 
</P>
<P>
He sees the republican elections that begin next month and continue into March 
as taking the political reforms down to the local level and breaking the party 
bureaucracy's monopoly on power there as it has at the national level. 
</P>
<P>
To ease the ideological qualms of conservatives, Gorbachev published on Sunday 
a lengthy position paper, outlining his philosophy of political change and 
reiterating the basic directions in which the country should head. 
</P>
<P>
And he is now putting together a series of ad hoc measures, such as increased 
imports of consumer goods, an anti-crime campaign and greater attention to 
worker complaints, that he hopes will restore some of the lost confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Our forward movement may be too slow unless we manage drastically to improve 
the psychological climate in the country," said Kommunist deputy editor Latsis, 
who is a leading Soviet economist. "The people must fully understand the 
complexity of the situation, and we must take a fresh look at things." 
</P>
<P>
But Stanislav S. Shatalin, another leading economist, warned Monday that 
reforms in the Soviet Union have tended to stall and then collapse -- a pattern 
that may be repeated this year. 
</P>
<P>
The country's continued economic decline -- growth might come to only 1% this 
year -- will not be arrested easily, he said, and momentum must be regained. 
</P>
<P>
"Economic reforms have a history of failure in our country," Shatalin said. 
"All the reforms launched since 1965 have failed. This is because they have 
been isolated from reform of the political system, but we have corrected this. 
They had also failed to establish a new relationship between property and 
ownership, and we are correcting this. 
</P>
<P>
"But I do not know whether we have that critical mass of people ready and able 
and wanting to put the reforms into effect. That is a major question and a key 
to whether we succeed or fail."

MOTHER GIVES CHILD PART OF LIVER IN HISTORIC SURGERY

In the nation's first liver transplant from a living donor, surgeons at the 
University of Chicago Medical Center on Monday removed a section of the organ 
from an elementary school teacher from Texas and transplanted it into her 
21-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter F. Whitington, director of the university's pediatric liver 
transplant program, said physicians would not know until today if the tissue 
taken from Teresa A. Smith's liver was "functioning" in the body of her 
daughter, Alyssa. The child was in "critical but stable" condition at the 
conclusion of about eight hours of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The mother's spleen, an important circulatory and immune system organ, ruptured 
while liver tissue was being taken and had to be removed. She was also in 
"critical, but stable" condition. Without a spleen, she will be at increased 
risk of suffering serious bacterial infections for the rest of her life, but 
she is expected to make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The liver is a complex organ that performs dozens of vital functions such as 
detoxifying potentially harmful substances and processing sugar, proteins, fats 
and bile. 
</P>
<P>
Transplanting livers from live donors, which has been performed several times 
in other countries, is likely to spark controversy in the United States because 
it requires that the potential risks to a parent or other family member, 
including major complications or death, be balanced against the potential 
benefits to a young child, who might die if a dead liver donor could not be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons and medical ethicists emphasized that the risks to the donor from the 
experimental surgery were substantially greater than those of donating a kidney 
or bone marrow, which are common medical procedures. "There is a quantum 
difference (in difficulty)," said Dr. Ronald W. Busuttil, the chief liver 
transplant surgeon at the UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, unlike kidney and bone marrow transplants, there is a dearth of 
medical evidence that liver tissue from a related donor is more likely to 
function in the long term than tissue harvested from a cadaver. 
</P>
<P>
The potential risks of the surgery were underscored by the rupture of the 
mother's spleen. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly didn't expect a problem with the spleen," Whitington told 
reporters " . . . I don't believe this was a matter of nerves or jitters. This 
sometimes happens." The fragile organ is next to the left lobe of the liver, 
which was the section of liver removed from the mother. 
</P>
<P>
The parents, who live in Schertz, Tex., near San Antonio, were not available 
for comment. But the mother said in an interview Oct. 25, made available by 
medical center officials, that she and her husband "both felt comfortable with 
the idea of donating. It was an obvious decision for me. Once you've given 
someone a big piece of your heart, it's easy to throw in a little bit of 
liver." 
</P>
<P>
The groundwork for the pioneering surgery was established through a series of 
recent articles in medical journals and widespread discussions at the medical 
center. University surgeons and ethicists have argued that the shortage of 
organs from cadavers justifies offering the option of liver donation to 
parents. To safeguard prospective donors, they established a detailed medical, 
ethical and psychiatric review process. 
</P>
<P>
Similar surgery has been performed in Brazil in December, 1988, in Australia in 
August and in Japan earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
While some liver transplants physicians and ethicists gave the University of 
Chicago program a cautious endorsement, others questioned whether it was 
possible to obtain "informed consent" for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"The major ethical dilemma is whether the critical organ shortage justifies the 
risk to the mother," said Dr. John Lake, the medical director of the liver 
transplant program at UC San Francisco. This "is a true ethical dilemma that is 
unresolved in most people's minds.. . . Most programs are going to see what the 
experience is at the University of Chicago before embarking on this procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Christoph Broelsch, chief of the liver surgery service at the University of 
Chicago, has pioneered techniques for using segments of livers from dead 
donors. This allows the liver to be used for two recipients, such as a child 
and an adult, or two infants, or to be cut down to fit a smaller recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Broelsch's teams also removes part of the liver from patients to treat liver 
tumors. In the last 35 such cases at the university, there have been "no major 
complications," such as serious bleeding or infections, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After a portion of the liver is removed, the remaining tissue can regenerate. 
But it is more difficult to remove a segment of the liver from a live donor 
than from either a tumor patient or a cadaver. This is because the function of 
the liver that is removed and the part that remains must be carefully 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa Smith was born with biliary atresia, a lack of development of the bile 
ducts, which is the most common cause of liver failure in children. Her parents 
first brought her to the University of Chicago in November, 1988, according to 
medical center officials. 
</P>
<P>
After a medical evaluation, Alyssa's name was entered on the national waiting 
list for liver transplants and the family returned to Texas. A potential liver 
became available in July but it was damaged and could not be used. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Whitington contacted the family to see if they were interested in 
the living donor program, medical center officials said. The parents, after 
learning that their insurance company would cover the experimental procedure, 
agreed to go forward. Both parents were evaluated, but the mother was selected 
based on "size" considerations. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed while the child was "pretty healthy," Whitington 
said. This was to maximize the chances that the surgery would succeed and to 
minimize the pressure on the parents to donate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are very strong people and I admire them for their willingness to 
step forward first," Whitington said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
From 25% and 50% of infants needing liver transplants die while awaiting the 
procedure, according to some estimates. But other medical experts said these 
figures were overstated. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Busuttil said the comparable figure at UCLA, one of the busiest 
pediatric liver transplant centers in the world, was about 10%. "If I had a 
small child that needed a liver desperately, I would be able to find a (larger) 
donor and would cut down that liver before I would consider taking a segment of 
a relative's liver and putting it into the child." 
</P>
<P>
The policy at the University of Pittsburgh, the busiest pediatric liver 
transplant center, is not to perform liver transplants using live donors 
because of concerns about the risks to the donors, said Dr. Joel Frader, a 
pediatrician and medical ethicist at the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, 727 Americans were on waiting lists for liver transplants, 
including 138 children age 5 or younger, according to the United Network for 
Organ Sharing in Richmond, Va. In 1988, 1,680 liver transplants were performed 
in the United States. The average wait for the transplant was about two months.

LIVER TRANSPLANT FROM A LIVING DONOR 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons at the University of Chicago on Monday removed the left lobe of the 
liver from Teresa Smith, 29, of Schertz, Tex., so that it could be transplanted 
into her 19-month-old daughter, Alyssa. Alyssa has biliary atresia, a severe 
and usually fatal childhood liver disease. The surgeons also had to remove the 
mother's spleen, which ruptured during the surgery.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a two-hour anti-government general strike that brought much of the 
country's industry to a standstill, the opposition group Civic Forum on Monday 
effectively declared victory in the initial phase of its struggle to end 
repressive rule in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The victory claim came on the eve of Civic Forum's first substantive talks with 
Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec -- talks that could lead to the dismantling of 
communism's 41-year-long monopoly of power. 
</P>
<P>
In what amounted to a virtual ultimatum to the Communist government, Civic 
Forum official Vaclav Klaus said that if Adamec is not prepared to create a new 
Cabinet with a new program, the opposition will demand the government's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"His answer will decide our further actions," Klaus said. 
</P>
<P>
The tough stand reflected the dramatic shift in power toward the opposition 
that has occurred in Czechoslovakia in 11 days of anti-government protest. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats believe that there is a real possibility that the government will 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the kind of pressure Civic Forum puts on them," a Western 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Civic Forum announced that it planned to suspend 
immediately both the mass demonstrations and plans for another general strike. 
</P>
<P>
"What is needed (now) is a cooling down of emotions," Civic Forum spokesman 
Vaclav Mali said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the group said that strike alert committees are being formed and added 
that pressure from the streets could easily be re-exerted. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as we are able to terminate the strike today, so we will be capable of 
calling for it again," said a Civic Forum declaration issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to suspend street action came after a two-hour general strike that 
served as the most humiliating in a series of public rejections of the 
country's hard-line Communist leadership over the past 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
Initially called mainly to express outrage at the way police violently broke up 
a peaceful demonstration last Nov. 17, Civic Forum had belatedly labeled it an 
informal referendum on one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
Major industrial concerns, schools and commercial establishments across the 
country closed, and millions of Czechoslovaks crowded into central squares of 
Prague and other regional cities for lunchtime protest rallies. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, the giant CKD group of enterprises and the Tatra heavy engineering 
concern were among hundreds of state-owned industrial groups that halted work. 
</P>
<P>
In Pilsen, the Skoda Works also observed the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Flights in and out of the capital's airport were halted during the strike, 
while a fleet of taxis circled the Communist Party Central Committee 
headquarters, the drivers honking their horns. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of those protesting, the taxis flew red-white-and-blue Czechoslovak 
flags that have come to symbolize the opposition to the Communist leadership. 
</P>
<P>
At a mass rally in the capital's main Wenceslas Square, economist Walter 
Komarek denounced Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
"This system is a historical anomaly," he told the demonstration. "It is 
opposed to normal civilization. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is not a goal in itself," he added. "We want democracy to open the 
gate to creative work. We want to have a prosperous market. We want our people 
to live well. We want them to live as they wish." 
</P>
<P>
Some Czechoslovak and foreign analysts believe that Komarek could eventually 
emerge as an opposition candidate for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
State-owned Czechoslovak television reported large demonstrations in 12 cities 
and said that many people had telegrammed the station complaining that the 
protests in their own towns had not been shown on TV. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts carried pictures of huge rallies in Bratislava, Brno and Kosica. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand also gathered in the main square of Kladno, an industrial city 
northwest of the capital that earlier this century was a cradle of Central 
European communism. 
</P>
<P>
Party Members to Join 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance to the Zapodocky coal mine, a few miles from the center of 
Kladno, even some Communist Party members said they planned to join Civic 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Some who spoke agreed on the need to end one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
Before the midday strike, new Czechoslovak Communist Party leader Karel Urbanek 
met with party members at another large coal mine in Kladno and told them there 
is no alternative to talks with opposition political groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't hide from them; we have to talk with them," he said. "We have to look 
for a common path together." 
</P>
<P>
The question of which path is likely to be the critical question at today's 
talks between Civic Forum and the government. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec is attempting to place the talks within the framework of the existing 
national constitution -- a document that guarantees the leading role of the 
Communist Party. For its part, Civic Forum believes that a new political 
charter must be adopted, guaranteeing such civil rights as free elections. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Communist Party's recent setbacks, a group of party 
reformers has launched a drive to try to salvage the party from the possibility 
of total collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Party reformers announced the formation of the Democratic Forum of the 
Communist Party, which called for the dismissal of about 20% of the current 
150-member Central Committee. The committee's ultraconservative makeup has long 
been a barrier to change. The group also advocates free, multi-party elections. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven days of demonstrations, the first such manifestations in the nation for 
more than a generation, toppled party leader Milos Jakes and led directly to 
the demotion of all prominent hard-liners in the ruling Politburo. A 
well-informed Communist Party source said that an emergency session of the 
Czechoslovak Parliament that has been called for Wednesday could vote to remove 
President Gustav Husak and parliamentary leader Alois Indra. 
</P>
<P>
Husak was installed by Moscow as party leader after the Soviet-led invasion 
that crushed the "Prague Spring" reform movement of 1968.

ARRESTED U.S. WOMAN CASTS A LONG SHADOW; 
</P>
<P>
EL SALVADOR: ARMS CASE COULD BE A PIVOTAL EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF U.S. 
RELATIONS WITH THE WAR-TORN COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few months after moving to El Salvador nearly five years ago, 23-year-old 
Jennifer Jean Casolo wrote to a close friend in the United States, describing 
her feelings and motivations. 
</P>
<P>
"I question the value of traditional success and security when the vast 
majority of beings on this Earth rarely think beyond food for their children 
and will never know security," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
She described meeting a young Salvadoran whose father had died in the nation's 
seemingly endless fighting and whose brother was in exile. "I felt like I 
wanted to cry," she wrote. "But I also feel challenged to live without fear." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Casolo, now 28, met that challenge. From a poorly financed 
office in San Salvador, she traveled the often dangerous country, arranging 
visits for thousands of Americans. Most were church workers, but they included 
congressional aides and other U.S. VIPs who over the last several years have 
flocked to El Salvador to see firsthand the devastation of civil war and to 
judge for themselves the validity of U.S. support for the nation's government 
in its fight against Marxist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
In that role, Casolo became one of the best-known Americans without official 
status in the country, as she provided a center for the church movement that 
members of the Salvadoran military and the nation's governing party have long 
suspected of aiding the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
But with violence in the country and threats against church workers escalating, 
Casolo's will to continue had begun to flag. She wrote friends about the stress 
she was under and had told her mother she was planning to return home this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before midnight Saturday, her plans changed abruptly. Police raided the 
white stucco house she had rented in the capital for the last couple of months, 
digging up a large cache of arms -- including more than 20,000 rounds of 
ammunition, grenades and explosives -- buried in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The building, Salvadoran government officials say, was a guerrilla safehouse. 
And Casolo, now under arrest along with two Salvadorans who reportedly used the 
house occasionally, faces charges of collaboration with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Justice Department prosecutors and FBI officials met 
Monday to consider charging her under the seldom-used Neutrality Act, which 
bars American citizens from taking sides in other nations' wars. 
</P>
<P>
The case may be a pivotal event in the history of U.S. relations with El 
Salvador. If Casolo is guilty, her wide contacts with virtually every 
church-related organization in the country would provide the government a 
reason to expel all American church workers -- something that conservatives in 
the military and the ruling party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance, have 
long sought. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if, as Casolo's friends insist, she has been framed by a 
government determined to rid itself of foreign church workers, the move against 
Casolo could severely damage the Salvadoran regime's chances of continued U.S. 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Casolo's supporters said that former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark 
plans to travel to San Salvador with several supporters of Casolo's to seek the 
young woman's release. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the swirling charges stands a slightly built, energetic young 
woman, barely 5 feet tall, animated, like many Americans who have traveled to 
El Salvador in recent years, by a deeply felt religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I am in El Salvador," she told her friend in the first of a series of 
letters she wrote after arriving in the country. "I have no pretensions of 
doing something important; at least I will do my best not to hurt any person. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't view myself as part of a movement," she wrote. "I don't adhere to an 
ideology; my actions come from experience, from a feeling of caring about the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
"The most valuable work I can do is to educate the North American public about 
the questions that are pertinent here and hope they come up with answers and 
actions that will bring peace with justice to El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
Casolo grew up poor in Thomaston, a town of 6,000 located in an aging 
industrial valley of northwestern Connecticut. Her divorced mother worked for 
one of the state's big insurance companies. In a high school class of barely 70 
students, she was president of the student council, chief of the honor society, 
chairwoman of the Spanish Club and head cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
A full scholarship brought Casolo to Brandeis, a prestigious private university 
located outside Boston. Four years later, having graduated with highest honors, 
Casolo turned aside suggestions that she apply to graduate school to pursue a 
doctorate in American literature. Instead, she took a post with the Brethren 
Volunteers, the social-action arm of the Illinois-based Church of the Brethren, 
a long-established pacifist church. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo worked initially on disaster relief projects, then moved to Seattle to 
serve as a social worker for Salvadorans being aided by a church-based 
"sanctuary" project that helped people fleeing the country avoid deportation 
from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"She demonstrated over two years with us a profound religious commitment," said 
Donovan Cook, pastor of University Baptist Church in Seattle, which sponsored 
the project. "She was also a tremendous organizer. She was very adept at 
working on events that would be of educational importance." 
</P>
<P>
That organizational ability, coupled with Casolo's interest in Latin America 
and fluent Spanish, caused Cook to recommend Casolo as the Salvadoran liaison 
for a new organization being set up in 1985, the Christian Education Seminars. 
</P>
<P>
The idea worried Casolo's family, her mother recalled Monday. "We thought she 
might be caught in a cross-fire," Audrey Casolo said. 
</P>
<P>
But the post appealed to Jennifer Casolo's increasing desire to put her 
religious beliefs about sharing her lot with the poor into action. 
</P>
<P>
The San Antonio-based group operates with an annual budget of about $100,000, 
most of it contributed by individuals who have participated in its travel 
seminars, according to a spokesman for the organization. It was established to 
organize tours of El Salvador for members of U.S. churches. Its national board 
includes a number of prominent American church leaders, headed by the Rev. 
Daniel Long of San Antonio, who directs Hispanic ministries in Texas and 
Louisiana for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, one of the country's 
largest denominations. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus of our work is the church," the spokesman said. "Basically, the idea 
is to allow spokespersons of different groups to get a perspective on the 
situation in El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
The job was one that brought Casolo into contact with most of the centers of 
power in Salvadoran society -- the military, the government, the churches, the 
U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"She was kind of like a tornado going around making connections," recalled John 
Rivera, a former Carmelite brother who visited El Salvador on one of Casolo's 
delegations in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I respected her, I liked her," said one of those connections, a senior officer 
of the Salvadoran army who spoke to several of the delegations that Casolo 
brought to the country. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, "For me she has betrayed us. We showed her that we have nothing 
to hide. . . . We helped her in her work, and now I think she probably told the 
guerrillas I am like this and like that. To think that she played a role in 
their logistical network. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Casolo's, of course, deny she did any such thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if she's being framed or not," Audrey Casolo said, but "I feel 
she had no knowledge of what was in the yard." 
</P>
<P>
Others talked of the young woman's longtime expression of pacifist beliefs and

The United States armed services have drafted plans to reduce military 
personnel by more than 250,000 men and women and eliminate three active duty 
Army divisions, five Air Force fighter wings and 62 Navy ships by 1994 to meet 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's demands for deep budget cuts, Pentagon 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed reductions would dramatically change the face of the nation's 
armed forces and would force major shifts in U.S. military strategy and the 
global deployment of its personnel, ships and aircraft, Defense Department 
officials said. It would mean a 16% reduction in active Army combat divisions, 
a 20% cut in the Air Force's fighter wings and an 11% cutback of naval vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Military leaders have proposed initiating the cuts in the 1991 fiscal year 
budget that begins next Oct. 1, with the full reductions scheduled to be 
completed by 1994, officials said. Cheney, however, is still engaged in a 
political duel with Budget Director Richard G. Darman, who is seeking even more 
severe military spending cuts. President Bush is expected to decide the 
Pentagon's spending ceiling for the 1991 budget within the next two weeks, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney began planning for major military cuts two months ago but in recent 
weeks has become more vocal about the reductions in response to the political 
upheavals in the Warsaw Pact and the political pressures from a deficit-driven 
Darman. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheney has lost the battle -- Darman has the clout," one defense official 
said. "Cheney had to get aboard to have a unified position with the 
Administration and stop being the odd man out." 
</P>
<P>
One defense official said the 1991 budget plan will be a "watershed," offering 
a preview of the reductions likely over the next several years. "You can look 
at '91 as an early warning," a military officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who on Sunday said deep new cuts may be possible in European forces, 
has said he has not decided how much he will cut from the new five-year defense 
plan President Bush will present to Congress in January. Cheney, attending a 
NATO defense minister's meeting in Brussels, Belgium, this week, said the new 
budgets will include average annual reductions of at least 2% after allowing 
for inflation -- about $150 billion over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services 
subcommittee on projection forces and regional defense, in stressing how much 
political priorities have shifted over the last five years, said: "If Cheney 
comes in with minus 2% real growth, we'll make it minus 4."

It took two passes in a hydraulic lift, but First Lady Barbara Bush finally got 
close enough to the top of the national Christmas tree to crown it with a white 
plastic star Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush was joined on the somewhat bumpy journey in the hydraulic lift to the 
top of the 35-foot tree by her 3 1/2-year-old granddaughter, Marshall, daughter 
of son Marvin and his wife, Margaret, and by Joseph Riley, president of the 
Christmas Pageant of Peace. 
</P>
<P>
The lift operator left the threesome a few feet short on his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush, who has been topping off the national Christmas tree every November 
since 1981, signaled to him to lift them higher, and on the second try she and 
Riley managed to get a silver pole holding the outsized plastic star in place. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, seasonally garbed in a bright red dress with a red ribbon in her 
hair, took it all in stride, waving to her mother and preschool classmates on 
the ground below. 
</P>
<P>
When the ride downward was briefly halted, Marshall called out cheerfully, but 
insistently: "Hey, when are we going down? Get me down here." 
</P>
<P>
"Perfect," pronounced Mrs. Bush as the white cage finally perched on terra 
firma. She took Marshall over to shake hands and pose for a picture with the 
lift operator, National Park Service tree worker Kevin Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she was coming over to chew me out," Guard said. "She just said 
thanks."

DATA BANK ON PHYSICIANS, DENTISTS TO START IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A far-reaching, $15.9-million data bank which tracks malpractice actions and 
disciplinary proceedings against all doctors and dentists will begin operating 
in April, federal officials announced Monday. They urged the nation's state 
licensing boards and 7,000 hospitals to waste no time in consulting the 
registry. 
</P>
<P>
The National Practitioner Data Bank is intended to help weed out incompetent 
physicians and dentists, particularly those who move from hospital to hospital 
or from state to state, keeping one step ahead of authorities. 
</P>
<P>
While actions against doctors and dentists must be reported by several sources, 
actions against nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, dental hygienists 
and others will be accepted in the computerized repository, according to U.S. 
Public Health Service officials, who will administer the controversial data 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, they disclosed additional details about the program, 
including the various circumstances under which a health professional's name 
would be entered into the data bank, which Congress authorized in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires all insurance companies to report to the registry -- as well 
as to the appropriate state licensing board -- any malpractice payments made on 
behalf of a licensed health practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, state licensing boards must report to the data bank any disciplinary 
proceedings against a doctor or dentist. In addition, professional 
organizations must report any formal actions taken as a result of a peer-review 
process. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, hospitals are required to query the registry -- at least once every 
two years -- regarding present and prospective personnel on their medical 
staffs or with clinical privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the registry will accept and disseminate information on all 
licensed health practitioners, and not just on the nation's 600,000 physicians 
and 147,000 dentists, according to John Rodak, the project's officer. It will 
be up to the discretion of hospitals whether to report on nurse anesthetists, 
pharmacists and other health practitioners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The registry will not be retroactive, according to Dr. Daniel D. Cowell, acting 
director of the Health Service's bureau of health professions, which is in 
charge of creating the data bank. Hence, malpractice actions and disciplinary 
proceedings completed before April 2 will not be included. 
</P>
<P>
Cowell and his staff have been meeting throughout the country with insurance 
firms and health care groups to brief them. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the registry would begin gathering data quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the last year for which final statistics are available, 534 physicians 
lost their licenses, 644 were placed on probation and 379 had their licenses 
suspended, he said. In addition, 102 of the nation's major medical malpractice 
insurers that year handled 73,000 malpractice claims, with 43% of the cases 
resulting in payments to the plaintiff that ranged from $1 to $2.5 million, 
Cowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of confidentiality considerations, Rodak added, neither the public nor 
the press will have access to the registry, a situation that has drawn protests 
from some consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
Under certain conditions, personal injury attorneys will be allowed access to 
the data bank. And health practitioners will be permitted to review the 
registry's data on their own records, allowing them the chance to make 
corrections if necessary, Rodak said. 
</P>
<P>
Many medical groups have expressed fear about the unwitting disclosure of 
erroneous information or violations of privacy.

PRESIDENT OF COMORO ISLANDS KILLED BY MUTINOUS SOLDIERS

<P>
Mutineers led by a former army commander attacked the presidential palace in 
the Comoro Republic and killed President Ahmed Abdallah, longtime ruler of the 
Indian Ocean island nation, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader, former commandant Ahmed Mohamed, resigned recently in a 
dispute with the 70-year-old president, an official at the Comoro Embassy in 
Paris said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
He said the assassination was not a coup attempt and that Mohamed was under 
arrest. The number of attackers was not divulged, and the official said he did 
not know if anyone else was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Abdallah was killed in a fire fight between rebel soldiers of the regular army 
and his 300-member presidential guard, state Radio Comoro said. It said a guard 
officer also was killed. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the Supreme Court, Mohamed Djohar, took over as leader of an 
interim government, as dictated by the constitution, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Abdallah had survived coup attempts in 1983, 1985 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in the capital of Moroni, on the main island of Grand 
Camore, home to half of the nation's predominantly Muslim population of 
500,000. The Comoros, which lie between Mozambique and Madagascar, were 
governed by Abdallah for all but three years since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Abdallah will be buried today on his native island of Anjouan, said Radio 
Comoro, monitored on the French-administered island of Mayotte. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting apparently did not spill into the streets. Bruce Thompson, manager 
of the Galewa Sun Hotel, told the South African Press Assn. by telephone that 
everything was normal -- "The town is very quiet."

SUMMIT ASIDE, NAVY TO CARRY OUT TRIDENT TEST 
</P>

The Navy intends to proceed with a planned test launch of the controversial 
Trident missile this weekend, even though some White House officials are 
warning it could provoke Soviet ire and taint the cooperative atmosphere of the 
Malta summit between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets consider the Trident, capable of carrying as many as 12 nuclear 
warheads, a "first-strike" weapon. They have been pressing for it and a wide 
range of Navy weapons to be included in arms control negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy has stoutly resisted a welter of naval arms control initiatives by 
the Soviets. This weekend's test, the service has argued, must be held promptly 
to allow the Navy to meet important production schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan has not changed," said a Navy official of the scheduled launch from 
the submarine Tennessee off the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the White House's National Security Council ordered the Pentagon's 
Joint Chiefs of Staff to review all of its planned military activities this 
week, including the missile test, and scrub unnecessary activities that could 
mar the summit atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"The message was, 'What you're doing could be viewed in light of the summit, so 
there could be a different context for it than on any other given day,' " said 
one Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy has argued that it must proceed with tests as quickly as possible 
in an effort to satisfy congressional restrictions on the use of program funds. 
The bill appropriating defense funds for 1990 approved a total of $1.44 billion 
for the production of 42 Trident missiles. But Congress directed that the Navy 
must first conduct three successful flight tests before it can use more than 
$250 million.

SALVADOR MISSILES ARE ON BUSH'S SUMMIT AGENDA

President Bush will tell Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their summit 
conference this weekend that the deployment of surface-to-air missiles in El 
Salvador "is a dangerous escalation" of the conflict there, the Administration 
said Monday, suggesting that Central American conflicts threaten improved 
superpower relations. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the President's spokesman indicated that because of reforms 
in Eastern Europe, the President would be prepared to discuss even deeper cuts 
in East-West troop strength in Europe than he had previously recommended. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush began his final days of preparations for the weekend meeting aboard 
Soviet and U.S. warships in the Mediterranean off the coast of Malta, his 
Administration is tugged in opposite directions: U.S. officials are upbeat as 
they look at the dramatic movements toward democracy in Eastern Europe, but 
they are speaking harshly about the impact that leftist operations in Central 
America are having on U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, a senior Soviet diplomat was summoned to the State 
Department, where Robert Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political 
affairs, delivered a protest over the alleged shipment of missiles from 
Nicaragua to El Salvador, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
And, she said, Bush would raise the issue with Gorbachev "in the strongest 
terms," telling him, in effect, "you obviously have influence with these people 
(in Nicaragua) -- use it." 
</P>
<P>
A Cessna airplane carrying anti-aircraft missiles, most of them Soviet-made, 
crashed in El Salvador on Saturday. The U.S.-supported government of El 
Salvador says that the flight originated in Nicaragua and was intended to 
supply leftist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater raised the possibility that Bush 
would propose that the United States and the Soviet Union embark on deep cuts 
in the number of troops they have stationed in Europe. He said that in 
preparation for the summit, as well as for the budget recommendations he will 
make early next year, "the President and his top advisers are considering a 
wide range of military options that involve a number of different force levels 
and a number of different estimates of budgetary reductions."

DISPUTE OVER OPERA DOOMS PLAN FOR REUNION OF KOREAN FAMILIES;

A plan for a reunion of Koreans separated by war and partition was rejected 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, the North Koreans 
insisted that Communist artists be permitted to put on four performances of a 
propaganda opera at the reunion planned for Dec. 8-11. All four performances 
were to be shown on South Korean television. South Korea's chief Red Cross 
representative, Song Yong Dae, rejected the demand. He said the opera, "Flower 
Maiden," glorifies revolution and "would hamper rapprochement between the South 
and North." 
</P>
<P>
The opera describes North Korean President Kim Il Sung's struggle against 
Japanese colonial rule, which lasted for 35 years until the end of World War II 
in 1945 and the partition of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed last Tuesday that performances by entertainers taking part 
in the reunion would be televised in both countries. But when North Korea 
demanded that it be allowed to stage "Flower Maiden," Song condemned it for 
putting propaganda above the reunion of Koreans who in most cases have not seen 
or communicated with each other since the 1951-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
Only once before, in 1985, was a reunion of separated relatives permitted, and 
only 100 people were involved, 50 from the North and 50 from the South. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's stalemate was considered particularly disappointing because all other 
details had been worked out. The North was to send 250 people to Seoul, and the 
South was to send 300 to Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to dashing hopes for the reunion, the falling-out doomed an 
agreement for talks on regular visits back and forth across the heavily 
fortified zone that separates the two countries. These talks were scheduled to 
get under way Dec. 15 in Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse served to underscore the continuing failure of South Korean 
President Roh Tae Woo to achieve the ultimate goal of his so-called 
nordpolitik, or northern diplomacy. Nordpolitik is aimed at improving relations 
with Communist governments so as to persuade North Korea to accept a peaceful 
interchange with the south. Ironically, the policy has proved a spectacular 
success nearly everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Only last week, Roh celebrated the greatest triumph of the process by visiting 
Hungary, becoming the first South Korean president ever to set foot in a 
socialist country. Earlier this year, Hungary and Poland established full 
diplomatic relations with South Korea, the first Communist states to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Since Roh first enunciated the policy, in the presidential election campaign of 
1987, South Korea's relations and trade with the Soviet Union, China and 
several East European countries have expanded dramatically.

U.S. THREATENS U.N. OVER PLO STATUS

In a preemptive diplomatic strike, the Bush Administration threatened Monday to 
end financial support of the United Nations if it approves an Arab plan to 
upgrade the status of the Palestine Liberation Organization from "observer 
organization" to "observer state." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel so strongly about this that we will cut off funding," State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
An end to U.S. contributions, which traditionally cover one-fourth of the U.N. 
budget, probably would bankrupt the financially strapped organization. The 
United States is already far behind in its payments to the United Nations, but 
the organization can borrow money using the U.S. debt as collateral as long as 
there is a prospect that Washington will pay up eventually. 
</P>
<P>
Clovis Maksoud, U.N. ambassador of the Arab League, said the Arab states would 
attempt to seat the PLO as a state, in effect giving U.N. recognition to the 
organization's 1988 proclamation of statehood. The move could come as early as 
this week, when the world body holds its annual debate on Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the U.S. opposes such an inevitable development," 
Maksoud said. "A state under occupation is not precluded from being a state 
just because it is occupied." 
</P>
<P>
At present, only Switzerland, North and South Korea, Monaco, San Marino and the 
Vatican are recognized by the United Nations as observer states. The PLO is 
included in a larger category of observer organizations.

A commuter train collided with a charter bus, killing two people and injuring 
about two dozen others during the rush hour Monday evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims were employees of ABC-TV, which chartered the bus to carry 
workers and guests around the San Francisco Bay Area, according to South San 
Francisco police. The employees were in town for the broadcast of Monday Night 
Football. Bus passengers included network employees and ABC clients, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were not identified pending notification of family. One was a sales 
executive based in Los Angeles and the other an executive with ABC Sports in 
New York, according to the network. 
</P>
<P>
Bus driver Paul Cang, 33, of Foster City was reported in stable condition at 
Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame with a head laceration. The other injured were 
treated at hospitals and released or treated for minor injuries at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was the third in a convoy of four vehicles of ABC employees and clients 
who had taken a bay cruise and were headed to Candlestick Park to watch the 
49ers play the New York Giants, ABC said. 
</P>
<P>
The train did not derail and none of its passengers was injured, according to 
Southern Pacific, which operates the CalTrain commuter. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was crossing the tracks at Oyster Point Boulevard and Old Bayshore 
Highway but had to stop behind a double tractor-trailer truck.

Calling America's war on drugs another Vietnam when it should be another World 
War II, attorney general aspirant Dan Lungren suggested Monday that the 
forfeiture of essential privileges, such as driving a car, should be employed 
to punish the casual drug user. 
</P>
<P>
For too long, the former Republican congressman said, the prime emphasis of 
drug programs has been on the trafficker, when it should also have been aimed 
at the average "Joe Doaks" who may only have been caught smoking a joint. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren proposed that a series of laws be passed to deter the casual user by 
forcing him or her to risk the loss of driving privileges, a professional 
license or eligibility for state and federal benefits if discovered possessing 
even a small amount of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to have a war on drugs, we ought to decide whether it's going 
to be the Vietnam War or World War II," he said. "We as a society have to make 
a major commitment to eradicate drugs in this country. Either that, or we ought 
to give up. And I don't believe in giving up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We have to recognize the user is as much involved in the drug process as the 
trafficker because without the user, there's no use for a trafficker. What's 
the message when you condemn the trafficker and excuse the user?" 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, the only Republican so far to enter the race for attorney general, 
gained public visibility two years ago when he was appointed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian to become state treasurer but failed to win Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Now back in the public spotlight as a candidate for his party's nomination for 
one of the the state's highest offices, he gave his views on a variety of 
topics during a breakfast with The Times' Sacramento Bureau. They included: 
</P>
<P>
* Abortion: Characterizing his position as strongly pro-life, Lungren pledged 
as attorney general to carry out the law, but acknowledged that in a "perfect 
world," he would like to see all abortions outlawed except those to protect the 
life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
* Ethics: He promised that if elected, he would establish a special unit to 
deal with public integrity issues. He said the unit would investigate and 
prosecute cases of public misconduct when there were multiple jurisdictions 
involved or when a local district attorney for whatever reason might want to 
"hand off" the case to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren also said the Legislature should be required to rotate memberships on 
"juice" committees, influential panels where members tend to receive a steady 
stream of contributions from special interests. 
</P>
<P>
* Death Penalty: If he is elected attorney general, he said, he would appoint 
his best "legal minds" to handle capital punishment cases. But he said the 
timing of executions is still "in the hands of the court." 
</P>
<P>
* Public Confidence: To improve public awareness of state government, he said a 
television channel similar to C-Span should be established to enable viewers to 
watch the conduct of state business. At the same time, he said campaign 
financing laws should be reformed to increase voters' confidence in elected 
officials, but the reform should not go so far as to require the public 
financing of elections. He said he would favor a law requiring candidates to 
raise half of their campaign funds in their district.

A compromise added to a $286-million defense appropriations bill now before the 
U.S. Senate is increasing the possibility that some military functions could 
continue at San Francisco's historic Presidio even after most of it is closed 
and converted into a national park. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, approved by the House, would allow the Army to lease back and 
operate the historic Letterman Army Medical Center, some Army Reserve training 
facilities, some of the 1,186 houses, its commissary and day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics say the bill only authorizes a study of these options and does not 
require the Army to lease any facilities from the National Park Service, which 
by law takes possession of the park-like base when the Army departs.

Democrat L. Douglas Wilder's election as governor was certified Monday but J. 
Marshall Coleman, his Republican opponent, asked for a recount and also 
requested an investigation of alleged irregularities at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman made his announcement about three hours before the state Board of 
Elections reported the returns as 897,139 votes for Wilder to 890,285 for 
Coleman -- a margin of 6,854 votes, or about 0.38% of the nearly 1.8 million 
votes cast. It was the closest gubernatorial race in Virginia's history. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial counts had put Wilder, who is the first black to be elected governor 
of a state, ahead by 6,852 votes. State law allows for a recount of any race in 
which the margin is less than 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, a former state attorney general, said he would seek a recount and 
would ask the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to investigate allegations 
of irregularities in the Nov. 7 balloting. 
</P>
<P>
In notifying the legislators that he would contest the returns, Coleman said 
that registers used at the polls included the names of some people who were 
ineligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"In an election as close as this one, irregularities which would not ordinarily 
have a probable impact on the outcome assume a greater importance," Coleman 
said in his letter to the General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's attorney, William H. Hurd, refused to say more about the allegations. 
"There are a number of areas that we're looking into," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman had until Dec. 7 to request a recount, but Monday was the last day the 
election could be contested because of alleged irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would withdraw the challenge if the recount and other information 
convince him that an investigation is "no longer necessary to safeguard the 
accuracy and integrity" of the election.

O.C. TRANSPORTATION PANEL STUDIES FEES FOR DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1-a-day parking fee for all employees driving to work in Orange County is 
one option being considered by county transportation officials to raise up to 
$5 billion that is needed for easing highway congestion in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission voted Monday to begin the process 
of hiring a consultant to study the feasibility of imposing parking fees, as 
well as possible increases in vehicle registration or driver's license fees. 
</P>
<P>
Although no public official has yet proposed parking fees in the county, the 
planned feasibility study comes as the commission seeks alternatives to Measure 
M, a proposed half-cent sales tax increase for transportation projects that was 
defeated by voters Nov. 7. The increase, which lost, 52.6% to 47.4%, would have 
raised about $3.1 billion over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how parking fees would be collected," said Stanley T. Oftelie, 
the commission's executive director. "But we want to inventory everything 
that's possible so we'll know what options we have." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no consensus on the commission to impose such fees," added Commission 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors. "I'd say 
it's a little too early for that." 
</P>
<P>
Charging people -- or their employers -- for parking at or near their 
workplaces was proposed earlier this year by respondents to the Orange County 
Transportation Commission's "100 Traffic Solutions" program. The project asked 
the public to mail in potential solutions to the county's traffic crunch. Also 
proposed were increases to existing registration and license fees. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the panel voted to seek proposals from consultants. A contract for a 
study on the proposals is expected to be awarded in February, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A countywide parking fee of $1 per vehicle per day would raise about $5 billion 
over 20 years, according to commission projections. A $1 increase in vehicle 
registration or driver's license fees would generate less than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
State legislation would be needed to enact any increase in vehicle or driver's 
license fees, and the proceeds could probably not be used for mass transit 
projects, OCTC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A $1 surcharge on registration fees was used to pay for Orange County's freeway 
emergency call box system. But since then, Gov. George Deukmejian has vetoed 
other proposed surcharges for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
No state legislation is needed for parking fees, but Oftelie said each city 
council, as well as the Board of Supervisors, would have to adopt separate 
ordinances to impose parking fees. Countywide, that would mean 30 separate 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances of that happening are slim," Oftelie said. "And that means that it 
would be difficult to make implementation uniform. But that's one of the things 
we want to find out, since our last inventory of options was done in 1983. The 
landscape has changed significantly since then." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Oftelie cited a 1983 study that gave tolls short shrift because, 
at the time, federal laws made toll roads ineligible for U.S. highway funds. 
That changed several years ago, so the county is pursuing construction of toll 
roads with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's 20-year master plan of traffic improvements -- published 
earlier this year -- forecast heavy political opposition to parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ward, a board member of Drivers for Highway Safety, a grass-roots group 
opposed to car-pool lanes that helped lead the campaign to defeat Measure M, 
said the method of raising revenue may not be the main issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know enough about it," Ward said of parking fees. "It's not the 
way they were raising the money in Measure M, it was the way they were going to 
spend it. And if they (OCTC) spend parking fees on the same plan, which 
includes more car-pool lanes, then it will all be wasted." 
</P>
<P>
Ward predicted that parking fees would be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Reeder, a spokesman for Hughes Aircraft, the county's largest employer, 
said he is unaware of the company's position on parking fees but added: 
</P>
<P>
"Hughes would have a hard time accepting them. We have empty spots now in our 
parking lot, so there's not the competition for parking space that there was 
here a few years ago. Also, we do pay for what we think is our share of traffic 
improvements in Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
Besides taking steps to hire a consultant, commission members have also 
discussed going back to the voters for approval of a half-cent sales tax 
increase, perhaps in November, 1990. However, no feasibility study for another 
tax effort has been scheduled.

SWEATSHOP PATROL: IT'S TRICKY DUTY; 
</P>
<P>
GARMENT TRADE: AUTHORITIES FACE LICENSING AND CULTURAL CONFUSION. SHOP OWNERS 
DEFEND THEIR PRACTICES.

<P>
Snuffing out sweatshops is no simple matter, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
They must educate new immigrants who have never heard of the minimum wage and 
battle shop owners who insist they cannot afford to pay it. And, in the case of 
Southeast Asians, authorities say they must try to change deeply rooted 
traditional attitudes toward work and pay. 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews, several garment shop owners insisted that although they 
pay workers by the piece, instead of the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage, workers 
who sew fast can make as much as $7 an hour. They agreed that those who sew 
slowly sometimes cannot earn the minimum wage. But they defended this practice 
as being in keeping with the Vietnamese tradition of apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
Duong Thi Huong, who works in a small family sewing business near Westminster's 
Little Saigon, said the shop earns $2 for each ladies' knit jacket delivered to 
a Los Angeles manufacturer. But the shop must pick up the garment pieces from 
the cutter, stitch it, attach the buttons and deliver the finished product, 
leaving only about 30 cents of profit per garment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the shop has been able to produce only 100 garments a day, and has lost 
$4,000 to $5,000 in the past two months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I get $2 for the jacket. I have to pay $1 for the worker," Duong explained 
through an interpreter. She pointed to a 23-year-old Asian woman struggling to 
fit a sleeve. "That girl can make 10 jackets a day. She's not very fast. She 
just came here." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the minimum wage, Duong replied: "We do pay regular workers the 
minimum wage. . . . It's true that the trainees may make only $2 an hour 
because they don't know how to sew . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we don't have any regular employees because we are new," Duong 
added. "If people want to come here to get training, they're welcome." 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, apprentices may work for three to six months before they begin to 
draw pay and might sometimes have to pay for their training, other owners said. 
However, California law requires a minimum training wage of $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse, state and federal officials say, the city officials with 
whom these new Americans first come into contact often do not help enforce 
state and federal laws. Sometimes they thwart them. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants for a sewing license in Santa Ana, for example, are told to apply 
for a state garment contracting license and state and federal identification 
numbers but are not required to have them, said Cathy Maldonado, who processes 
the licenses for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana will license home sewing for individuals and a one-year permit costs 
$330, Maldonado said. "I would say 15% of home occupational permits are for 
garments," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado said she had never been told that sewing women's garments at home is 
a violation of both state and federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burton, a supervisor for the special investigations unit of the Orange 
County district attorney's office, said his office has been trying to persuade 
cities to stop selling home sewing licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The practice infuriates state labor officials, who complain that they raid home 
sweatshops only to be confronted by angry people brandishing city licenses. The 
offenders cannot understand why they are being fined for an activity they paid 
money to be licensed to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't license an illegal function," Burton said. "But in my opinion, 
business licenses are revenue-producing things, and I think that's what they're 
concerned with more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
In Westminster, which does try to make applicants abide by the law, business 
licensing clerk Pam Narz says she tells all comers that sewing at home is 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them clearly didn't know that. They can't believe it," she said. 
"Sometimes I have the clear feeling that they're going to do it even without a 
license. And often we never see them again." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese community leaders acknowledge that some of the shops do pay their 
workers less than the minimum wage. But, they note, these new entrepreneurs 
also are providing jobs for refugees who otherwise would collect welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders warn that manufacturers and shop owners cannot pay more and 
compete with garments imported from Taiwan, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore, 
where wages are even lower. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the so-called sweatshops, there wouldn't be any garment industry 
here," said Phong Duc Tran, chairman of the Little Saigon Community Development 
Organization. "You call it a sweatshop, but we are used to it."

<P>
"We have to do a pass-through," said Joe Casasanta, general manager for the 
Tustin-based Continental Cablevision. "To say it mildly, I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Casasanta said his cable company is appealing a 400% increase in the property 
tax bill received last summer. But in order to make up the additional $170,000, 
Continental is anticipating a rate increase for its 10,000 subscribers of about 
$2 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen other cable companies in Orange County are appealing or prepared 
to appeal the new assessments and higher property tax bills, according to 
industry officials. One cable television spokesman said cable companies would 
be paying an average 300% increase on their property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the cable companies and County Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs 
centers on the technique that the assessor's office is using to compute the 
taxes of the cable companies. The worth of the companies is being increased by 
adding the value of "intangible assets," said Douglas Mo, a San Francisco 
attorney representing the cable companies appealing the tax bills before the 
Assessment Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
Mo said some of the intangibles include the company's customer base, good 
relations among customers, ongoing marketing efforts and the right to operate 
exclusively within an area. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said the matter of the cable company assessments was under appeal and he 
could not discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
The largest cable company in the county, Dimension Cable, operated by Times 
Mirror Cable Television, has yet to receive its property tax bill from the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"We find ourselves in a strange position of asking for our property tax bill," 
said Dick Waterman, director of corporate affairs for Times Mirror Cable 
Television. Waterman said if Dimension's tax bill follows the pattern of 
others, it is almost certain there would be a rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
Waterman said the property tax increases for the companies could eventually 
impact 450,000 households in Orange County with cable television. Dimension has 
more than 100,000 subscribers in South County. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really a consumer issue," Waterman said, adding that the 450,000 
households equal about 1.25 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new assessment method being used, Mo said the assessed values of the 
dozen cable companies in Orange County have jumped from $200 million to $650 
million. Taxes for those same companies increased from $2 million to $6.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable," said Navarra Williams, vice president and general manager 
of Paragon Cable, which serves, among other cities, Garden Grove, Westminster 
and Huntington Beach. "Apparently, the county is trying to generate tax 
revenues the best it can." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that his company's property tax bill increased from $500,000 to 
$1.25 million and that in one 18-month period ending December, 1990, the 
company will have paid $2 million more in property taxes than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said if the tax increase is divided by the company's 90,000 
subscribers, it could come out to a $2.70-a-month increase in cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
Subscribers to Copley/Colony Cable on Monday began receiving notices of a $1 
increase in monthly service fees. Officials for Copley/Colony were unavailable 
for comment late Monday. GEORGE FRANK

ARENA EXPECTED TO ADD 244 JOBS, TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A consultant declared Monday that the city's proposed indoor sports arena would 
create significant traffic congestion when its events begin or end during rush 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
But on the plus side, the $75-million facility would bring 244 more jobs and 
"visually attractive" new buildings to the city, according to an environmental 
report prepared for the arena's private developers, Spectacor Management Group 
and MCA Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"The project will provide employment opportunities for local residents and is 
expected to improve business and commerce in the city," said the report 
compiled by Keith Cos. of Costa Mesa for the developers. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 20,000-seat arena is expected to begin June 1 on 17 vacant 
acres at the southeast corner of Edinger Avenue and Lyon Street, according to 
the generally favorable report. The arena is expected to open in August or 
September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana environmental report comes three weeks after a similar report by 
the city of Anaheim on a nearly identical arena proposed there. But Anaheim 
officials estimate ground can be broken for their 20,000-seat, $85-million 
arena in January and construction completed by the fall of 1991. That arena 
would include 80 luxury suites compared to Santa Ana's 120 luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities hope that building an arena will lure a professional basketball or 
hockey franchise. Separate private firms propose to operate each arena. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, the facility would be privately owned and built on private land. 
In Anaheim, the arena would be built on city-owned land and operated under a 
lease agreement by private firms. Construction cannot begin on either arena 
until the environmental reports are certified by their respective city 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
Residents opposed to noise and traffic were instrumental in defeating previous 
proposals for sports arenas in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's less impact than I expected," Santa Ana senior planner Jeff Rice said 
of the Santa Ana arena report. Most of the traffic generated by the facility 
would occur during non-peak hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a televised basketball event that begins at about 5 p.m. for broadcast 
to the East Coast would generate significant additional rush-hour traffic in 
the area, which generally features light manufacturing and industrial uses, he 
said. A normal starting time of 7:30 p.m. for most basketball games would 
create much less traffic congestion, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
An "unavoidable adverse impact" would be created by traffic congestion on 
streets around the junction of Edinger Avenue and the Costa Mesa Freeway during 
rush hour, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
But the congestion can be eased somewhat by the use of traffic barriers, 
traffic control officers and changing computerized traffic signal controls, 
according to the report. Additional traffic control officers on the street 
would be paid for by the arena operators, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Although boosters of the Santa Ana arena hope to attract a professional sports 
franchise as the main user of the facility, the environmental report declares 
that "the range of possible events is limited to the imagination of the 
management staff." 
</P>
<P>
In its first year of operation, the Santa Ana arena would be used 155 to 220 
days, the report said. But by the fourth year, the arena would operate 255 
days, it said. MARK LANDSBAUM

OPPOSITION SLOWS FREEWAY WIDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for widening the Santa Ana Freeway north of the Riverside Freeway are 
moving slowly because of opposition to the project by officials in Los Angeles 
County, according to a new report. 
</P>
<P>
Seven miles of the nine-mile project are in Los Angeles County, and neither the 
cities along the route there nor the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission favor the widening, according to a project status report released by 
the Orange County Transportation Commission on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, commission officials said, Caltrans is examining other options for 
improving the freeway. No details, however, were available. 
</P>
<P>
Current plans call for doubling the freeway's width from six lanes to 12, at 
least as far as the San Gabriel River Freeway. But Caltrans officials have 
warned of serious bottlenecks if the freeway were to suddenly narrow from 12 
lanes to six at the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reconstruction of the Newport Boulevard bridge between Pacific Coast 
Highway and 32nd Street in Newport Beach has fallen several months behind 
schedule, according to the commission's report. So, too, has the widening of 
Pacific Coast Highway between Golden West Street and Beach Boulevard in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge project has slipped by five months, until April, because of delays 
in getting Coast Guard approval, the report stated. The PCH project is slowed 
by a design consultant's delays. 
</P>
<P>
The report showed that five other projects have gone out to bid. They involve 
extending the Costa Mesa Freeway from 19th Street to Wilson Street, widening 
the Santa Ana Freeway between Jeffrey Road and Jamboree Road and between Tustin 
Ranch Road and Newport Avenue, and reconstruction of the Santa Ana-Costa Mesa 
freeways interchange as well as construction of new Santa Ana Freeway ramps at 
Beach Boulevard. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

RESULTS OF GROWTH STUDY WILL BE GIVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Results of a yearlong study on growth management in the city will be presented 
tonight to the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
A nine-member committee examined areas including open space, schools, sewers, 
roads, water, libraries, parking, police and a new civic center. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, voters overwhelmingly passed Measure E, a slow-growth 
initiative. But a Superior Court judge ruled the city measure unconstitutional. 
That ruling is now being appealed by a citizens' group. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council subsequently appointed a committee to create a legally 
acceptable growth-management plan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, voters passed Measure B, the city's first growth-limiting initiative, 
which restricted home-building permits to 500 a year.

COUNCIL TO SELECT NEW SLATE TONIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
The face of the city's government will change tonight when the City Council 
selects a new mayor and mayor pro tem as part of an annual reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
In a city-manager style of government, these largely ceremonial posts rotate 
yearly among council members. For the past year, Councilman Edward L. Allen has 
served as mayor and Councilman Paul G. Verellen has held the post of mayor pro 
tem. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Redevelopment Agency is scheduled to elect new officers as well. 
Councilmen Verellen and David John Shawver currently serve as chairman and vice 
chairman of the agency, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the council will reconsider a proposed on-street parking ban 
along two busy stretches of Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The council had earlier considered, but failed to adopt, resolutions that would 
have prohibited parking on the west side of Beach from 1st Street to the bus 
stop north of Cerritos Avenue, and from the north city limits to 10181 Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While there was no opposition at the time to the measures, which traffic 
engineers had recommended to improve the visibility of motorists trying to 
leave crowded parking lots at an indoor swap meet and an auto parts yard on 
Beach, the council decided to wait until businesses that might be affected 
could be notified before taking any action. PEGGY HESKETH

PARKING LOT YIELDS A BOUNTY OF ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single parking lot proved to be a bonanza over the holiday weekend for 
Cypress police officers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thanksgiving Day at a local motel, officers say they recovered two stolen 
pickup trucks, a stolen car and stolen refrigerator. They arrested four men on 
stolen property or drug charges and almost caught a robbery suspect on a stolen 
motorcycle there but had to settle for catching him later. 
</P>
<P>
Most of this action occurred in the parking lot of the Country Club Inn on 
Lincoln Avenue, where officers went Friday to investigate the burglary of a 
refrigerator from one of the rooms. Officer Danny Forniss found a pickup truck 
that was stolen and arrested its driver, Matthew Blaine Smith, 18, of Long 
Beach. Smith was held on suspicion of having stolen property and carrying a 
concealed, loaded pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Scanning the lot, Forniss then found another stolen pickup and arrested its 
driver, Evan Fredrick Lightner, 25, of Long Beach, who had been staying at the 
motel. He was held on suspicion of possession of stolen property and a 
possession of methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, officers became suspicious of a man loitering near the parking 
lot. A license check of the black motorcycle he was riding showed that it, too, 
was stolen. The man got away on the motorcycle, however, before officers could 
stop him. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Sgt. Gordon Re arrested two men after finding another stolen 
car and then found the stolen refrigerator in one of their rooms. Kenneth 
Berry, 22, of Garden Grove was held in connection with the stolen car and Kevin 
O'Keefe, 21, of Fountain Valley was held on suspicion of having 
methamphetamines and the stolen refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a man riding a black motorcycle robbed the Taco Bell restaurant at 
5619 Ball Road of several hundred dollars. About half an hour later, Officer 
Jeff Kepley found the black motorcycle that had been ridden away from the 
parking lot the day before. He waited an hour for its rider to return and 
arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Dave Birozy noted that the man fit the description of the Taco Bell 
robber. Witnesses subsequently identified the man, Michael Scott Smith, 18, of 
Long Beach, and all the stolen money was recovered, police said.

COUNTY POLL GIVES EDGE TO 2 TAX INITIATIVES; 
</P>
<P>
JUNE BALLOT: ONE PROPOSAL WOULD DECREASE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAXES. ANOTHER 
WOULD RAISE GASOLINE TAXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By narrow margins, county voters favor a gasoline tax increase and a proposed 
residential property tax decrease, according to a poll released Monday on two 
of the most controversial issues expected on June's statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Mark Baldassare for UC Irvine, found that most 
respondents -- 50% to 45% -- support a 9-cent increase in the gas tax to help 
pay for new roads and transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
By an even slimmer margin -- 46% to 44% -- the survey also found support for 
the so-called "split roll" property tax initiative, which would reduce 
residential property taxes by $500 and almost double the tax on business 
property. 
</P>
<P>
For the split roll initiative, proponents have submitted more than 800,000 
signatures that are being reviewed by state election officials to determine 
whether the measure will qualify for the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare said it is significant that 44% of the respondents opposed a 
decrease in their property taxes. He suggested that they may actually consider 
it a tax increase if they are looking at it from the perspective of the 
business community. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the survey results, Baldassare said he believes that the electorate 
increasingly recognizes that it will have to pay more to maintain its quality 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the Orange County of 10 years ago, where people would have 
automatically voted down any measure to increase taxes," Baldassare said. "I 
think people not only are trying to find solutions to Orange County's problems 
but are also starting to realize that they might have to help pay for them." 
</P>
<P>
The poll is part of UC Irvine's 1989 Orange County Annual Survey, a broad look 
at issues and trends in the area that will be released in its entirety next 
week. It is based on 1,085 county adult respondents -- including 904 registered 
voters -- who were contacted in September. 
</P>
<P>
The error margin for the survey is plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The results released Monday also included a matchup in the 1990 gubernatorial 
race, showing Republican Sen. Pete Wilson leading Democratic state Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp, 47% to 29%, to succeed Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The survey did not include former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who is 
also running for governor in the Democratic primary; Baldassare said she is not 
a front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
The survey results on the gas tax increase showed attitudes similar to those 
found regarding Measure M, the county's proposed half-cent sales tax increase 
for transportation projects, which failed at the polls earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, polls found the proposals favored by most respondents but 
opposed by older and conservative voters. Political strategists believe that 
Measure M failed because there was a low voter turnout and, in such cases, most 
of the voters are older and conservative. 
</P>
<P>
The poll released Monday found the state gas tax increase favored by voters 
younger than 54. It was also favored by Democrats but narrowly opposed by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare said he did not ask how many voters were aware of the proposed gas 
tax increase or the split roll tax initiative. Instead, for the latter, he 
asked whether the respondents would favor a doubling in the tax rate for 
business properties and a $500 reduction for homeowners and renters. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed split roll initiative would cut residential property taxes by $500 
and grant a $500 tax credit to renters. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the split roll initiative is supported by a majority of 
voters who are young, liberal, Democratic and with lower-to-medium incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare noted that it is an interesting contrast with the 
property-tax-reducing Proposition 13, which was proposed by political 
conservatives.

The shooting occurred about 4:55 p.m. at the Tustin Arms Apartments in the 
15000 block of Tustin Village Way, where Renteria rented a two-bedroom 
apartment.

<P>
"One shot was fired," she said. "We believe it was from a handgun."

EVERETT RECEIVES SOME CREDIT FOR FLIPPER'S RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: JOHN ROBINSON MAKES SURE HIS QUARTERBACK ISN'T OVERLOOKED DURING 
CELEBRATION OF RECEIVING-YARDAGE MARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Flipper Anderson's set-up man, Jim Everett, was so lost in the landscape of 
Anderson's record-breaking receiving performance against New Orleans that it 
took a night's sleep and a film session to comprehend Everett's role. 
</P>
<P>
Now, brace yourself for the two greatest single feats ever witnessed by a coach 
on the same night. Move over, Flipper. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jim Everett played his best game ever as a pro," Ram Coach John 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's assessments were based on more than sheer numbers, although Everett 
set career bests for attempts, 51, completions, 29, and passing yardage, 454, 
in the Rams' overtime victory over the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was Everett's relentless pursuit of victory under difficult 
circumstances that moved Robinson to several words. 
</P>
<P>
"He had so many opportunities to say 'To hell with it,' " Robinson said. "He 
had injuries, his best receiver out of the game (Henry Ellard), the team was 
ineffective running the football, the rush was getting to him. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some assignment errors, we had a lineman hurt (Jackie Slater), we were 
behind, there was frustration. He had every possible reason to not keep 
playing, more so than anyone else on the team." 
</P>
<P>
On a night when teammate Anderson shattered the NFL's single-game yardage 
record with 336 in 15 catches, Everett seemed reduced to the guy who had enough 
sense to keep throwing Anderson the ball. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't that easy. 
</P>
<P>
"There were guys that were open," Robinson said, "but it was just their left 
ear that was open sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
That Everett would remain steady in the pocket with Saints' linebacker Pat 
Swilling and Co. breathing down his neck all night was testimony to his 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Everett was sacked six times and, according to Robinson's estimate, knocked 
down 25 times in all. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew they were coming on all of those and he just stood in there and got 
better and better," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
There's some image-changing going on here. The Everett of 1988 put up great 
numbers but couldn't put away opponents, throwing last-minute interceptions 
that cost his team possible victories against Philadelphia and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Everett has rallied his team four times in the fourth quarter to lead 
in the closing minutes. The defense gave away games at Buffalo and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things people said about him before was that, 'Well, we're never 
going to put him at the top level until he proves he can do those kinds of 
things,' " Robinson said. "But he is doing those things. We're talking about a 
very, very, very good quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
The week in New Orleans turned out to be the most bitter in Robinson's memory, 
and this time he is dropping his gloves and fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson remained incensed on Monday over a weeklong media campaign in which 
one Robinson quote about the Rams supposedly "forfeiting" the first game in 
Anaheim was taken out of context and repeatedly used to incite the Saints 
during the week. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, a New Orleans Times-Picayune story included an unedited Robinson quote 
that played upon the coach's staggered speech patterns, including the use of 
six "uh's" in a paragraph he's sure was designed to make him sound foolish. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson once was a stammerer, and has worked hard to make the problem 
virtually undetectable in conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they did was a cheap shot," he said. "I think it was poor 
journalism. I think the motivation was a reach under any circumstance. Those of 
us that are in this business are constantly quoted and constantly in front of 
the cameras and are exposed in that manner. 
</P>
<P>
"When one response is twisted so manipulatively by someone, it gives you a 
tendency to become distrustful. I think what they did was out of line, 
completely. I have no recourse, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said fans at the Superdome were particularly hostile, but the 
logistics of the stadium kept hecklers at a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
Greatest performances, Part III: Robinson said the play he will remember for 
years to come is linebacker Kevin Greene's leaping tackle of Dalton Hilliard on 
third and one at the Rams' 45 in overtime. Hilliard lost two yards on the play, 
and the Saints were forced to punt. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said the move was instinctive, but that he did have a sense Hilliard was 
going to get the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"A good linebacker will get a feel for what they're going to run at you," he 
said. "I kind of had a feeling that basically it was going to come my way." 
Greene had two sacks in the game and has 13.5 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
What price glory? Flipper Andersen's yards-per-catch ratio has dropped from 
30.7 to 27.1. . . . The Rams moved up three more spots in total defense to 15th 
this week. The unit ranked 26th only three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
THE RAMS BY THE NUMBERS

HIGHLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
WILLIE (FLIPPER) ANDERSON 
</P>
<P>
A "deep route" receiver for the first 11 games of the season who caught only 19 
passes for 548 yards, the UCLA product was cast in the role of No.1 pass 
catcher when a hamstring injury forced Henry Ellard to sit out Sunday's game. 
He and Jim Everett proceeded to rewrite the NFL single-game record book, as he 
caught 15 of Everett's passes for 336 yards. His three key receptions: A 
46-yarder which set up his team's first TD; a 15-yard touchdown pass which, 
with Mike Lansford's conversion, tied the score, 17-17, and forced overtime, 
and a 26-yarder on a third-and-11 play which set up Lansford's 31-yard, 
game-winning field goal.

KEEFE RETURNS HOME TO LEAD STANFORD PAST UC IRVINE, 70-57 
</P>

IRVINE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adam Keefe came home Monday, where he: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Was honored by having his high school basketball uniform retired at 
Irvine's Woodbridge High. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Was roasted by UC Irvine basketball fans -- "Irvine wasn't good enough for 
you, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Was horrible in the first half against Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Was nearly unstoppable in the second, leading Stanford to a 70-57 
nonconference victory in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe scored 20 points, 14 in the second half, and grabbing 11 rebounds to lead 
the Cardinal (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive loss for Irvine, which led by 10 (22-12) midway 
through the first half, and by seven (24-17) with just over five minutes before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford closed the gap to four by halftime and tied the score, 41-41, on 
Keefe's layup with 14:25 to go in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Once again Irvine, which blew an 11-point second-half lead against the 
University of San Francisco Saturday, went cold offensively, scoring just 12 
points in the final 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to be a good shooting team," said Bill Mulligan, Irvine coach. 
"What happened to our shooting?" 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters shot just 38% from the field, only 32% in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine made up for its shooting with a good job defensively against Stanford in 
the first half. Sagging toward the middle and paying special attention to 
Keefe, Irvine made it hard for Stanford to go inside. When Stanford did, it 
often ended in a turnover. Keefe alone turned the ball over six times. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play well at all in the first half," Keefe said. "I think I was too 
worried about them blocking my shot. I was trying to make moves I didn't need 
to make." 
</P>
<P>
Any fear seemed far removed in the second half. Keefe was aggressive inside, 
scoring 10 points in a 10-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, Keefe took over the game," Mulligan said. "No question 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to Irvine's problems was Stanford forward Deshon Wingate, who scored 19 
points coming off the bench. Wingate, a smooth 6-7 junior, could start for 
Stanford but Coach Mike Montgomery says he likes "the lift he gives us coming 
off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine provided some lift for Stanford. The Anteaters committed 16 turnovers, 
giving them 37 in their first two games. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the defense, or lack of it at crucial points in the second 
half. Twice Irvine players loafed in transition and were made to pay when 
Stanford converted baskets. 
</P>
<P>
With little more than six minutes remaining, Stanford point guard John Patrick 
was allowed to dribble unchecked to the free-throw line, where he stopped -- 
still unguarded -- and made a 15-footer to put his team ahead, 55-50. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute later, Patrick rebounded an Irvine shot, dribbled to half 
court and passed to an unguarded Wingate, who went in for a dunk to put the 
Cardinal ahead, 57-51. 
</P>
<P>
"(Guard Rod) Palmer is the only guy on this team who plays hard all the time," 
Mulligan said. "We got seven or eight other guys pretending." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer led Irvine with 18 points. Only one other Anteater, forward Jeff 
Herdman, scored in double figures. Herdman had 11. Palmer made four of eight 
three-point attempts, and the rest of the team was one of nine. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to our three-point shooting?" Mulligan said. "This game was 
ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's safe to say that the videotape of this game will never make it to 
the hall of fame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Adam Keefe's coming home to Irvine was such big news that reporters walked 
away, en masse, from Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery during his postgame 
comments. "Why don't I just leave?" a miffed Montgomery said. Keefe apologized 
to his coach for the snub, and then answered questions for about 15 minutes. . 
. . A poster giving the five reasons Keefe chose to leave Irvine -- and they 
were not nice ones -- was taken home by Keefe's parents, who said they plan to 
take a picture of the banner and send copies to relatives. . . . Center Ricky 
Butler was held to nine points. . . . Freshman Ben Rishwain, a walk-on, was 
impressive as Mulligan searches for a backup point guard. Rishwain, who is 
5-10, played 14 minutes, scored five points and had two assists.

About 25 UC Irvine fans, friends and athletic department officials greeted the 
Anteater water polo team at John Wayne Airport Monday as it returned from 
Indianapolis as the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. champions. 
</P>
<P>
A bit after noon, the small gathering cheered as Irvine Coach Ted Newland 
stepped out of the jet and walked down the stairs. Next, to continued applause, 
followed the players who defeated California, 9-8, Sunday to win the NCAA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
If it wasn't quite a heroes' greeting, it was welcomed recognition for a team 
playing a less-than-marquee sport. Newland said his NCAA championship teams 
returning from titles in 1970 and 1982 got no such response. Of course, 
aircraft weren't involved in either of those trips back from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete surprise," said tournament most valuable player Dan Smoot, 
of the welcome. "I didn't know if anybody knew or not." 
</P>
<P>
More were made aware at halftime of the Irvine men's basketball game with 
Stanford at the Bren Center Monday, when the water polo team was honored again. 
</P>
<P>
At the airport, the players got hugs and congratulations from friends and a 
chance to relive their championship by talking about the narrow victory over 
Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Duplanty, the Anteaters' goalkeeper, was still relishing the save in the 
final seconds of the match that assured the victory. He said he was worried 
that Cal would "somehow steal it from us." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine and Cal met three times in the regular season. Cal won twice and the 
third meeting went to six overtimes -- after Cal scored with a second to go in 
regulation -- before Irvine won. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, with a few seconds remaining, Cal's Luis Ortiz caught a pass directly 
in front of Duplanty, faked a couple of times and then took a shot that 
Duplanty blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"When I felt the ball hit my hand, I felt a little rush of energy," Duplanty 
said. "I just couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only were we playing a great team, but we were playing the mystique of 
Cal, the power of collegiate water polo." 
</P>
<P>
Newland, who has coached Irvine water polo since 1966, saw no such ghosts in 
the pool. Sure, Cal had defeated Irvine in four NCAA finals and the Golden 
Bears had more championships than any other team, but Newland said there wasn't 
anything mystical about finally defeating Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really it was about our turn," Newland said. "It's got to even out."

Fountain Valley High School has forfeited two nonleague football victories and 
a Sunset League victory over Huntington Beach for using an ineligible player 
under the student eligibility rules of the Huntington Beach Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dubar, a starting running back who was injured most of the season, was 
ruled ineligible for failing to apply for a transfer when his family moved from 
Fountain Valley to an apartment in Huntington Beach's attendance area before 
the start of the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley forfeited nonleague victories over El Modena and Mater Dei and 
a victory over Huntington Beach that the Barons were awarded when Huntington 
Beach forfeited eight victories for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad, but funny," said Mike Henigan, Fountain Valley athletic director. 
"Nobody won the Huntington Beach-Fountain Valley game. We ended up forfeiting 
their forfeit." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley, which finished third in the Sunset League, saw its overall 
record drop from 5-6 to 2-9 with the forfeitures. Fountain Valley finishes tied 
for third with Westminster in the Sunset League at 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal (Gary Ernst) at Huntington Beach told us about the violation, 
and we notified the schools involved within an hour," Henigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley had replaced Huntington Beach in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
David Roman, Huntington Beach's starting right tackle, was ruled ineligible for 
living with his older brother, Tony, while his mother remained a resident of 
Maryland.

Lure of the Big Board: CMS Enhancements wants to go to the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Farooquee, president of the Tustin computer company, said CMS has applied 
to the New York Stock Exchange to have its stock listed on the Big Board by 
mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Because NYSE companies tend to be followed more closely on Wall Street, 
Farooquee said the NYSE listing would increase the company's visibility with 
institutional and individual investors, as well as with the news media. 
</P>
<P>
CMS hopes that increased visibility will attract more shareholders to buy the 
company's stock and boost trading activity. 
</P>
<P>
CMS stock is currently traded on the National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
national market system, commonly known as NASDAQ. 
</P>
<P>
In order to qualify for listing on the Big Board, a company must meet minimum 
criteria for the number of shareholders, shares outstanding, market value, net 
tangible assets, and pre-tax income and profitability. 
</P>
<P>
CMS would become only the second Orange County computer company to be listed on 
the Big Board. The only one now listed is Tustin-based MAI Basic Four. 
</P>
<P>
Two larger Orange County computer makers, Western Digital Corp. and AST 
Research Inc., have their securities listed on the American Stock Exchange and 
NASDAQ market, respectively.

PAGER CAN RECEIVE MESSAGE WITHOUT OPERATOR, FIRM SAYS

A small Irvine company says it has developed a technology for the paging 
industry that allows someone to send word messages without the assistance of a 
telephone operator. 
</P>
<P>
Synerdata said its "alpha touch" technology is the first product that allows 
pager users to send such messages directly by using a push-button phone. 
Previously, if someone wanted to send a pager message that included letters 
instead of numbers -- for example, "Phone home, Bob" -- they had to relay the 
message to an operator, who typed it into a computer keyboard and then sent it 
to the correct pager. 
</P>
<P>
The main advantage of the product, Synerdata says, is that it cuts the high 
costs of paging by eliminating the operators. 
</P>
<P>
Synerdata President Leo Jednyak said the heart of the product is computer 
software that allows the pager to distinguish between numbers and letters 
punched into a push-button phone. After the message is punched in, the computer 
reads the message back to the sender for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Synerdata is a division of CUE Paging Corp. of Irvine, one of the nation's 
largest paging companies.

POLICIES PUT CONSUMERS IN CREDIT CARD CATCH-22; 
</P>
<P>
IDENTIFICATION: CUSTOMERS FIND THEMSELVES ON MERCHANTS' MARKETING LISTS AFTER 
COMPLYING WITH DEMANDS TO PRODUCE MORE THAN A DRIVER'S LICENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, credit cards were simply for buying things on credit. But 
that was in those dim, dark days when a driver's license was for driving and a 
Social Security number was for old-age benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Today those three items are evolving into a kind of unofficial but very real 
universal identification system. And while it is often against the rules -- or 
even downright illegal -- to use them this way, those who resist find the full 
weight of the nation's commercial establishment brought against them. 
</P>
<P>
Try to charge an item on a credit card without a driver's license, try to pay 
by check without a credit card, try to reserve theater tickets or even make 
reservations in some restaurants, and you'll find immediately what the 
requirements are. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the growth of this system are plain enough. Merchants, theater 
and restaurant owners and other vendors are increasingly plagued by bad checks, 
no-show reservations and other forms of theft and cheating. They want to try to 
protect themselves whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
But one increasingly common practice -- that of using credit cards as a 
backstop for bad checks -- is coming under attack. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group based in Herndon, 
Va., when a merchant writes your name, driver's license number (which in many 
states is your Social Security number) and major credit card number all over 
your check, he is exposing you to fraud at least as much as he is protecting 
himself from it. 
</P>
<P>
Checks travel a lengthy route from the merchant to his bank to yours. Anywhere 
along that line, "anyone who has access to the check, or even gets a quick look 
at it, has all the information he needs" to buy merchandise over the phone and 
charge it to you," said Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders. "Or a 
thief might apply for a credit card in your name." 
</P>
<P>
"Application fraud" is one of the fastest-growing new scams, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, that and related frauds and dubious practices have become common enough 
to persuade the Iowa legislature to prohibit merchants from recording such data 
on checks. 
</P>
<P>
Holstein said he has also heard of merchants using this information, or 
telephone numbers recorded on credit-card slips, to build marketing lists for 
mail or phone solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Visa U.S.A. told Bankcard Holders that "we do not believe the 
information is used by the merchant for marketing purposes," but MasterCard 
International said: "It is indeed our understanding that many merchants who ask 
for a cardholder's personal information do so for marketing purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Because 20% to 40% of people Bankcard Holders surveyed have unlisted telephone 
numbers, often to avoid just this sort of call, this practice exposes them to 
invasion of privacy, Holstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, many merchants use a credit card as a fallback for a check that 
bounces. Stores of The Limited chain even stamp the check with an 
authorization, which they have the customer sign, so that the amount of the 
check plus a $15 fee can be charged to the customer's credit card if the check 
is returned. 
</P>
<P>
Visa and MasterCard say this is not permitted. 
</P>
<P>
"If the personal check is returned, the merchant is not permitted under Visa 
regulations to submit a sales draft to cover the returned check," Robert H. 
Miller of Visa wrote to Bankcard Holders. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the customer has provided his permission to do so, this is considered 
a refinancing of an existing obligation and is strictly prohibited under Visa 
regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Darold D. Hoops of MasterCard wrote, "A merchant may not submit a credit-card 
slip for the amount of a returned check." 
</P>
<P>
But because merchants do it, "it is possible to conclude that Visa and 
MasterCard have to some extent looked the other way," Holstein said. 
</P>
<P>
A Visa spokesman said last week, "It is our position that a merchant cannot 
refuse to accept a Visa card if the consumer refuses to provide a phone 
number." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Visa is "studying new rules" on the subject. And a MasterCard 
spokeswoman said the company may not know about merchants' use of credit cards 
to cover bounced checks unless the consumer complains. 
</P>
<P>
Holstein acknowledged that merchants have the right to ask a customer who wants 
to pay by check to show a credit card as identification. It is when the 
merchant starts recording the credit-card number that it becomes objectionable, 
he said.

DESIGNERS SEEKING A SAFE COMPUTER KEYBOARD; 
</P>
<P>
ERGONOMICS: IDEAS KICKING AROUND ARE FOR A COMPUTER THAT WILL TRANSCRIBE 
WRITTEN OR SPOKEN WORDS. INNOVATIONS, HOWEVER, ARE MEETING RESISTANCE.

<P>
Seven years ago, Anthony Hodges added another vocation to an eclectic 
collection of careers that included stints as an environmentalist, fighter 
pilot and unsuccessful political candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges, the son of a Linotype operator, became the inventor of an 
unconventional computer keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
His design, which he calls the Tony, took a standard Apple keyboard and added 
several adjustable features, enabling a user to split the keyboard down the 
middle and tilt each half upward. The "A" shape -- which looks like someone 
broke the keyboard over his knee -- can be adjusted to varying heights, which 
Hodges says helps eliminate hand and wrist injuries suffered by many workers 
who spend long hours in front of computer terminals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had those pains," said Hodges, who lives in Atherton, just south of San 
Francisco. "Flat keyboards force your hands into unnatural 'praying mantis' 
positions. The Tony allows the machine to fit your hands, not the other way 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Hodges is one of a handful of iconoclasts promoting radical alternatives to 
today's conventional keyboard designs. Their devices -- which so far have been 
roundly rejected by the big U.S. keyboard makers -- range from variations on 
Hodges' split keyboard to keys that are moved much like a computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hodges, most keyboard inventors say their passion for change has been 
spurred, in part, by an interest in reducing hand and wrist injuries -- known 
as repetitive strain injuries, or RSI -- experienced by thousands of computer 
users each year. 
</P>
<P>
Some medical experts believe that conventional flat keyboard designs may 
contribute to RSI. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the keyboard at fault? Of course it is," says Robert E. Markison, a San 
Francisco hand specialist and assistant professor of surgery at the University 
of California School of Medicine. "The keyboard (design) forces you to deviate 
your wrists, twist your forearms, shift your elbows and tense your shoulders. 
You've set up a whole series of events that defy the normal position and 
functioning of the hand." 
</P>
<P>
At one company, U.S. West Communications, a group of telephone operators has 
filed a product-liability suit against Computer Consoles Inc. of Rochester, 
N.Y., because they feel that the computer design contributed to their RSI. The 
2-year-old suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
While old-fashioned typewriters required more force to pound the keys, these 
actions actually may have been less damaging than working on today's keyboards. 
The lighter touch of computer keys enables workers to type at high speeds, and 
these repetitive motions, experts say, can overwork a group of tendons in the 
hands and wrists, increasing the risk of RSI. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Markison and others acknowledge that keyboard design is just 
one of many factors that may contribute to RSI, also known as cumulative trauma 
disorders or repetitive motion injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"The keyboard has to be considered as part of a whole system (of workplace 
conditions)," such as keyboard positioning and a user's work habits, says 
Thomas Armstrong, director of the Center for Ergonomics at the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"People are looking for a magic bullet to make the problems go away. But even 
the best keyboards, under certain conditions where keying is repetitive enough, 
will result in some problems," Armstrong explained. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboard manufacturers take a tougher line. "It's true that a person can suffer 
from using a computer, but that problem has nothing to do with the keyboard," 
said Rita Black, a spokeswoman for International Business Machines Corp., which 
makes most of the keyboards sold with its computers. Computer users can 
minimize exposure to RSI with proper seating posture and equipment positioning, 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
IBM and other major manufacturers say they have no plans to radically change 
the keyboards used by 25 million office workers. If big changes are made within 
the next decade, it will probably be to eliminate keyboards altogether, 
substituting other inputting devices that convert handwriting or human speech 
directly to computer print, said Maryann Karinch, a spokeswoman for the 
Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Assn., a Washington, D.C.-based 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges and other innovators admit that keyboard-makers have not exactly been 
breaking down their doors with offers over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Since the subject of workers with RSI came up, Hodges said, he has gotten 
responses from company officials such as, "Let them take aspirin -- it's 
cheaper." Still, Hodges said he has been approached by a Japanese company (he 
refuses to go offshore) and several U.S. telecommunications companies recently 
have expressed interest in trying his keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Why? Because they're starting to get sued" by users of flat keyboards, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that for the most part, manufacturers have resisted changing the 
basic keyboard design simply because it's been that way for so long. 
</P>
<P>
Experts are skeptical that innovators can lure major manufacturers into 
licensing or partnership agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"Keyboard changes are driven by manufacturing costs," said Harry L. Snyder, 
professor of human factors engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. To be 
competitive, a new keyboard design must be produced at roughly the same cost as 
an average personal computer keyboard -- about $20 apiece, Snyder said. If sold 
individually to retail customers, PC keyboards often are priced between $200 
and $300, although more sophisticated keyboards for corporate office networks 
often range between $600 and $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even if costs can be driven down, experts say, the next generation of 
innovative keyboards may be eclipsed by computers that read handwriting or 
transcribe speech.

AIRLINE-SAFETY LAW OPENS MARKET FOR DYNATECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Aug. 31, 1986, an Aeromexico DC-9 jetliner with 64 people aboard and 
traveling 300 m.p.h. descended toward Los Angeles International Airport. At the 
same time, a small Piper plane with three passengers was climbing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
At 6,500 feet above Cerritos, the planes collided, showering houses with fiery 
debris and killing 82 people in the airplanes and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, hoping to prevent similar disasters, has ordered 
jetliners to be equipped with a new electronic system that warns pilots when 
they are too close to other aircraft. Each system will have backup components 
in case the main components fail, but for the jetliner to switch from one to 
the other, two electric switches will usually be needed. 
</P>
<P>
And that has created a marketing opportunity for Dynatech Microwave Technology 
in Calabasas, a leading producer of sophisticated electric switches. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Boeing Co., which builds 60% of the world's commercial jets, awarded 
Dynatech a contract to supply switches for collision-avoidance systems -- 
formally called the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS-II. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, which extends to 1991, should be worth about $1 million to 
Dynatech. In Dynatech's current fiscal year that will end March 31, the Boeing 
deal will provide about $500,000, or 5%, of Dynatech's expected $10 million in 
total sales. 
</P>
<P>
Dynatech is battling with Dow Key Microwave, based in Ventura, and other rivals 
to supply switches to the airlines as they install TCAS systems in existing 
jets. Planes with 30 or more seats that travel in U.S. airspace must have the 
system. Those sales will account for an additional 5% to 7% or more of sales 
this year, said Dynatech Microwave President John Wetzel. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, airlines must have TCAS installed by the end of 1991, although 
legislation is pending in Congress to extend it an additional two years. The 
entire TCAS system costs about $300,000. Dynatech's switch, which is slightly 
larger than a cigarette pack and is placed below the pilots' deck with the 
plane's other electronic gear, costs between $400 and $700. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of TCAS came at a key time for Dynatech's Calabasas operation. A 
unit of Dynatech Corp., a Burlington, Mass.-based electronic products concern 
with $400 million in sales, Dynatech Microwave and the rest of the switch 
industry is struggling with the slowdown in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has relied heavily on the military, which uses various switches in 
missiles, fighter jets and other aircraft. Wetzel, who took over the local 
Dynatech operation 18 months ago, said he sees no major gains in defense 
spending any time soon, and wants Dynatech to pursue more commercial customers 
to offset that slowdown. "For my planning purposes, I basically think of our 
market as flat," with industrywide sales at about $60 million, Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves two ways to grow: Find new markets or grab customers from other 
suppliers. Wetzel, 44, said "that for the past year, the strategy has been very 
much to take market share" from Dynatech's competitors. 
</P>
<P>
He claims success, saying Dynatech Microwave's current-year sales will be up 
25% from the previous year in a flat market, making Dynatech the industry's No. 
2 player behind Transco Products in Camarillo. (Dynatech Corp. does not break 
out exact figures for Dynatech Microwave.) 
</P>
<P>
But Robert F. McKenzie, a Transco vice president, said that if Dynatech is 
taking market share from its rivals, Transco is "absolutely not" among them. 
"We did $22 million last year, and will do about $24 million this year" in 
sales, said McKenzie, adding that Transco is not even trying to compete in the 
TCAS switch market. "It's modest growth, but it's growing." 
</P>
<P>
The switches made by Dynatech, Transco and the others are not the 
hardware-store variety used in turning the porch light on and off. Theirs are 
complex switches that change the direction of microwave signals that control 
certain functions on jets, missiles and satellites. Often, their use is 
pre-programmed by computer. Prices for Dynatech's switches can range from $100 
to $7,500, but average $350. 
</P>
<P>
Dynatech was chosen for Boeing's new jets, but another major jet builder, 
McDonnell Douglas, plans a TCAS system that avoids using switches and relies 
instead on twin antennas, Wetzel said. Another big potential buyer, the 
European plane builder Airbus Industrie, has yet to decide whether to use 
switches or antennas for their TCAS system. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the 4,000 or so existing U.S. and foreign jets that must be 
fitted with TCAS systems. The system includes a computer, two transponders that 
send and receive signals from other planes and cockpit displays. 
</P>
<P>
The TCAS systems are sold to the airlines by a handful of companies, including 
Honeywell and the Bendix/King unit of Allied-Signal. But those companies or the 
airlines must buy the switches separately. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel said Dynatech has won the contracts to supply Pan American, Northwest 
and Southwest airlines, but he conceded that one of the biggest carriers -- 
United -- picked Dow Key for its jets, except the 747. United's plans for that 
aircraft are undecided, Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
Other big plums are pending. USAir, which now has one of the biggest fleets 
after its merger with Piedmont, has yet to pick a switch supplier. Continental 
also is undecided. But another huge airline -- American -- has taken McDonnell 
Douglas' route and will not use switches. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel, who earned an engineering degree at Princeton and an MBA from Harvard, 
began his career spending 12 years at Hewlett-Packard, where he held various 
engineering, production and marketing posts. After a brief stint at Sierra 
Electronic, he was named president of Interface Technology in Glendora, a unit 
of Dynatech Corp. that makes electronic testing equipment. He was tapped to 
head Dynatech Microwave in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel concedes that Dynatech was lucky that the TCAS legislation handed it a 
new market. But Wetzel has made several moves himself to bolster Dynatech's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
When he took over as president, Dynatech was losing money and only 40% of its 
products were delivered on time, he said. So Wetzel streamlined its assembly 
process to slash production time; the company now takes an average of two days 
to make a switch, compared with 30 days when he arrived. It currently produces 
about 2,000 switches a month.

'GLORY OF CHRISTMAS' SERVES UP JOY OF THE SEASON -- CLUMSILY

<P>
At its most basic level, the Crystal Cathedral's "The Glory of Christmas" 
evades criticism. This elaborate but clumsy annual production is an evangelical 
entertainment for the faithful -- the Greatest Story Ever Told filtered through 
a Greatest Show on Earth sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
The latest offering, featuring a trove of special effects and the usual 
menagerie of barnyard animals, will satisfy those who come to feel both the joy 
of the season and the strength of religious conviction. Director Paul David 
Dunn gives a clear, linear telling of Joseph and Mary's being touched by God 
and that fateful night in the Bethlehem manger. 
</P>
<P>
But anyone who looks closely may be distracted by the show's uneasy staging. 
Patches are resoundingly rough, from the aimless look of crowd scenes as actors 
search for their marks to the awkward approach in setting up the big solos, and 
the general tone is so thick that only children are likely to be unequivocally 
enchanted. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, this is an event for kids as much as anyone, and you can almost 
forgive Dunn for making everything so sensational and preachy. Followers of the 
Crystal Cathedral certainly will be forgiving, even when the obvious is pushed 
into blatancy, which is often. 
</P>
<P>
To signal the Immaculate Conception, Mary (played in alternating performances 
by Jonel Dayen Christensen, Debby Smith and Donal Carol White) all but rubs her 
tummy. And when we learn of Herod's anger over Jesus' birth, it's to the 
insidious laughter of Arthur C. (Buddy) Adler as Herod. 
</P>
<P>
He makes his exit, that maniacal cackle trailing behind, as narrator Thurl 
Ravenscroft reminds us that Herod was a very bad man. Ravenscroft's 
rhapsodizing voice can get pretty heavy at times, even in a church not known 
for its subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
As spectacle, "Glory" only disappoints in its lack of simplicity and grace. But 
how agile can you be when asked to lead camels, sheep, cows and baa-ing lambs 
to center stage? Children will gape at all the animal husbandry and bold 
costumes, and their parents may be transfixed every now and then as well. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, don't expect much modesty; this isn't a high school pageant blessed 
by homespun restraint. The angels (rigged up by Peter Foy's "Flying by Foy" 
company) zoom in from smoke clouds, delivering benedictions over the audience, 
and heavenly spotlights (effects by Rick Helgason) bounce around the pews. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the Crystal Cathedral finds entertainment salvation in the boffo 
gesture, and, as usual, it is ironic that such extravagance is seen as the best 
way to tell this familiar and beautiful story. 
</P>
<P>
There is piousness, though, in the handling of most of the songs, a lovely 
compilation of Christmas' best that serves as "Glory's" centerpiece. Musical 
director Johnnie Carl has, unfortunately, prerecorded the music; but the 
singing is live, with an accomplished cast providing pleasing renditions of 
these classics. Among the best are "O Holy Night," "What Child is This?" and 
"The First Noel."

BOLD K.D. LANG ADDS NEW RUFFLE TO COUNTRY MUSIC GENRE; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMANCE: WHILE THE 28-YEAR-OLD'S STYLE SHOWS LOYALTY TO COUNTRY'S 
TRADITIONS, SHE DECLARES AN INDEPENDENCE FROM CONVENTIONAL NASHVILLE STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in Nashville, there may well be a record promoter or marketing 
specialist who grimaces whenever K.D. Lang's voice filters through the air. 
</P>
<P>
The singing itself wouldn't be to blame for the sour look on the hypothetical 
country music insider's face. That would be impossible, since Lang possesses 
one of the most confident, presence-filled and unambiguously splendid voices in 
pop music today. No -- the grimace and sideways head shake would come from the 
thought of how out-of-sync the woman behind the voice is with the country music 
image machinery, and how much more money she might generate if she could only 
be made to fit a more readily salable mold. 
</P>
<P>
If Lang's voice came in a conventionally glamorous sweetheart-of-the-rodeo 
package, there is a strong possibility that country superstardom would be hers. 
But instead of feminine cowgirl dresses, flowing tresses and the other 
trappings usually associated with country divas, Lang favors an androgynous, 
short-haired appearance closer to punk-influenced alternative-rock fashion than 
to Nashville's idea of how a star attraction should look. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Nashville would want to see me go country," Lang, who plays Tuesday 
night at the Celebrity Theatre with her band, the Reclines, said in a recent 
phone interview. "If I abided by their rules, they're sure I could sell a lot 
of records. They'd like to see me co-write with a Nashville songwriter, and 
have a contemporary Nashville producer produce me in Nashville. They're very 
incestuous." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Lang's music has been a commercial flop. Her current album, "Absolute 
Torch and Twang" had a solid run in the Top 20 on the country album charts, and 
it broke into the Top 100 on the Billboard pop album chart. 
</P>
<P>
Lang's music shows fealty to country's musical traditions with swinging 
honky-tonk stylings and spacious, big-sky atmospherics full of sighing steel 
guitars. But on a song like "It's Me," from "Absolute Torch and Twang," she 
uses country musical conventions to declare her independence from conventional 
Nashville style: 
</P>
<P>
Might not be all you want 
</P>
<P>
 But it's all you get, it's me. 
</P>
<P>
 On them shiny pages, all that hairdo 
</P>
<P>
 It ain't me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not averse to the style of Dolly Parton, but I have to be natural to 
myself to put the best art out that I can," Lang said. "If (listeners) don't 
accept the way I look, they'll never understand the music totally." 
</P>
<P>
Image may be the most apparent way Lang, 28, differs from performers working 
comfortably within the country music system. The differences that crop up in 
her music are subtler. 
</P>
<P>
Lang and the Reclines' first major-label album, "Angel With a Lariat," had 
elements of kitsch and spoof in its rambunctious, rock-flavored assault on 
country style. Still, the excellence of the singing and playing made it obvious 
that the musicians also had serious regard for country music. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Lang answered any questions about how authentically interested she was 
in being a country singer by recording "Shadowland," a tribute to the classic 
Patsy Cline sound in which she teamed with Cline's original producer, Owen 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
With "Absolute Torch and Twang," Lang said, "I sort of marked my coming of age 
as a songwriter and an artist with her own direction -- being rid of the Patsy 
Cline obsession, and coming into her own style." 
</P>
<P>
Hearing Cline's music at the age of 20 had a near-mystical effect on Lang, who 
was raised in the tiny town of Consort, Alberta. Performance art was Lang's 
genre when she came across Cline as a result of playing a country singer in a 
musical in Edmonton. Cline's music struck her so deeply that Lang began to 
entertain mystical thoughts that she and the late country star might be 
spiritually linked. For the first time, Lang considered country music as a 
creative outlet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a performance artist. I was at totally the opposite end of (the spectrum 
from) country music. For me to explain country to my art friends was kind of 
scary. They said, 'Yeah, you're going to make fun of it, right?' I said, 'Yeah, 
kind of, but not totally.' I have this kitsch side of me, but I also have 
respect for it." 
</P>
<P>
With "Shadowland" and now "Absolute Torch and Twang," Lang dispensed with the 
kitsch and positioned herself as an unabashed country singer. But if Lang seems 
comfortable enough now with country as a form to use it straightforwardly, she 
also has an idea of how to work subtle changes that give it her own outsider's 
stamp. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her songs include touches of abstraction and unorthodox word placement 
-- self-consciously artful elements that depart from country's usual directness 
and colloquial, conversational style. 
</P>
<P>
In "Nowhere to Stand," a song about child abuse, Lang takes what would be a 
reverential catch phrase in most country songwriting -- "a family tradition, 
the strength of this land" -- and twists it around to deeply ironic effect. By 
labeling child-battering "a family tradition, the strength of this land," Lang 
obliquely calls into question the sentimental, uncritical attitude that runs 
through much of the Nashville establishment when it comes to the portrayal of 
traditional values. From that conservative viewpoint, such buzzwords as 
"family," "tradition" and "strength of this land" would represent something 
inviolable. But Lang's song makes the point that a tradition such as 
unchallenged parental authority can foster evil from generation to generation. 
</P>
<P>
Lang's mixture of reverence and restlessness for traditional country forms 
leaves it open as to where she will go next with her music. 
</P>
<P>
"We're six months into a one-year tour, so I kind of have blinders on till the 
end of May," she said. "I'd really like to be on Broadway. I'd love to do 
"Annie Get Your Gun." But I think my ultimate goal is to be established as a 
songwriter and be known for developing my own style as a singer." 
</P>
<P>
Lang said she handpicked her opening act, Ranch Romance, an unsigned, 
all-female group from Seattle that she describes as "sort of like the Roches 
meets Sons of the Pioneers. They opened for me in Seattle, and I fell in love 
with their sound." 
</P>
<P>
K.D. Lang &amp; the Reclines and Ranch Romance play Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at the 
Celebrity Theatre, 201 E. Broadway in Anaheim. Tickets: $20. Information: (714)

DO WE MISS THE BIG PICTURE WITH OUR SPLIT-SCREEN LIVES?; 
</P>
<P>
BEHAVIOR: SPEEDED-UP NOTIONS OF EFFICIENCY AND TIME MANAGEMENT PRESSURE PEOPLE 
INTO BELIEVING THAT DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE GETS TWICE AS MUCH ACCOMPLISHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
I am watching an ad for a new television set that offers a screen within its 
screen. The beauty of this technology, I am told, is that it lets the viewer 
watch one channel while scanning the others. 
</P>
<P>
But this particular electronic creature gives you more than a window of 
opportunity into the wide world of network and cable television. If you are 
into double vision, it actually lets you watch two channels at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
I confess that I have trouble finding one program I want to watch, let alone 
two. But I am convinced that this is a product of superb marketing strategy. It 
is attuned to the updated and speeded-up notions of efficiency and time 
management that now rule our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the quaint needle-pointed idea taught by childhood teachers? The idea 
was that we should do "One Thing at a Time." To this day, many of us fight 
losing battles with our children in a vain attempt to convince them that they 
cannot learn multiplication tables while listening to New Kids on the Block and 
watching MTV. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to admit that most adults are leading split-screen lives. Nobody who 
is anybody does just one thing any more. Our burgeoning breed of 1-minute 
managers, in-putters and maximizers of potential have come to believe that 
those who do two things at once get twice as much accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
Busy-ness itself is no longer a symptom of workaholicism but a badge of 
efficiency. Such twofers as dialing and driving have become status symbols for 
executives. It isn't considered ditsy any more to drink coffee, apply makeup 
and insert contact lenses while commuting to work. It's seen, perversely, as 
being well-organized. 
</P>
<P>
Time is now regarded as a precious and rare resource, so wasting it is the 
modern sin of human ecology. We are expected to conserve, even recycle, every 
minute and to use several of our five senses at a time. So it is that we have 
come to breakfast with the newspaper and our kids, lunch with business 
associates and print-outs and shower with a waterproof radio. 
</P>
<P>
This double- and triple-shifting comes with its own technology. We are able to 
watch one television program while taping a second, vacuum while talking on a 
portable phone, bike 20 miles on an Exercycle while studying Swahili from a 
tape and log on to our portable computer in an airport waiting room. And so we 
do. 
</P>
<P>
What's behind all this is the true passion of the times: a lust for 
productivity. Remember the pursuit of the elusive simultaneous orgasm? We now 
pursue the illusion of simultaneous accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
There is a course offered in Cambridge, Mass., that teaches students several 
languages at the same time. That is nothing compared to the curriculum we set 
up for ourselves. Those who pass today's finals must be able to spend time with 
their kids while losing weight and making three new business contacts during 
one intensive hour at the gym. Is it any wonder we are suffering from 
performance anxiety? 
</P>
<P>
This ideal of simultaneous accomplishments fuels the favorite fantasy of the 
decade that if we were only more organized and blessed with all the proper 
electronic helpers, we would be able to squeeze at least two lives into the 
time for one. Instead of making choices, we think we can make time. 
</P>
<P>
When life is as split as the new television set, the second screen does show 
you a whole lot of options. But when it's on, funny how much harder it seems to 
focus on the big picture.

A girl who received part of her mother's liver in the nation's first such 
living-donor transplant underwent nearly five more hours of surgery today to 
stop internal bleeding, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the bleeding, doctors predicted success for Monday's transplant 
operations on 21-month-old Alyssa Smith and her mother, Teresa. Specialists say 
the procedure could relieve a severe shortage of organs for children, many of 
whom die while awaiting a liver from a cadaver. 
</P>
<P>
During the night Alyssa's new liver began to bleed, a complication that occurs 
in about 30% of all liver transplants. The youngster was returned to the 
operating room before dawn.

BUCKEY JURORS RETURN SEALED VERDICT, STUCK ON ANOTHER COUNT

<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial returned one verdict under 
seal today but indicated that they are deadlocked on another of the 65 
molestation counts against Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin 
Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
"They've said only that they've taken several ballots and cannot reach a 
verdict on a count," Superior Court Judge William Pounders said. "Given the 
fact there are 65 counts, that is not too significant." 
</P>
<P>
The judge has instructed the jurors to give him each verdict, once it is final, 
sealed in an envelope. He said he will begin reading the verdicts as early as 
next week even if all 65 charges have not been decided. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said he will meet with lawyers Friday afternoon to discuss the status 
of the case. If more than one verdict has been delivered by then, he said, he 
will set a date the following week for those verdicts to be read. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 31, and his mother, 63, are charged with conspiracy and child 
molestation at their family-owned Manhattan Beach preschool. Their 2 
1/2-year-old trial is the longest criminal trial in U.S. history and has cost 
Los Angeles County more than $15 million.

A crane toppled from a 16-story building under construction today, raining 
concrete and twisted steel on the busy financial district. Six people were 
killed, 21 injured and five left missing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The crane flattened a school van and a protective scaffolding over the 
sidewalk, crushed a taxi and several other cars, and smashed into a 21-story 
office building across the street as it buckled, swung around and went down. 
Bystanders fled in terror. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like an earthquake," said Merrill Lynch Vice President Joe McLaughlin, 
who was in the damaged office building. "I looked out and saw two bodies. One 
construction worker's boots were sticking up through a mass of jagged metal." 
</P>
<P>
A piece of the crane at least three stories long dangled from the side of the 
building under construction two hours after the 8:30 a.m. accident. Police 
roped off the area and ambulances rushed in and out, taking away the injured. 
</P>
<P>
The street was littered with flattened cars and a mangled motorcycle. Gas was 
cut off to the damaged office building for fear of an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. John Newlin said the dead were a pedestrian, three construction 
workers, the woman driving the school van, and her only passenger, a teen-ager 
with Down's syndrome being taken to a special education school. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Fred Postel said five people were listed as missing in the twisted 
steel and broken concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Three hospitals reported receiving 21 victims, four in serious condition. Most 
of the rest had minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The crane at the top of the building that will house the Federal Home Loan Bank 
was hoisting construction steel when it tipped over, Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
Debris rained down on a taxi driven by Issa Massarweh, who had two passengers 
at the time. The cab's back window was smashed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where my passengers are," he said. "I threw myself under the 
dashboard." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco General Hospital reported receiving 12 victims, four in serious 
condition and the rest with minor injuries. Pacific Presbyterian treated two 
for minor injuries, and Saint Francis Hospital treated five, all with minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a loud bang and stepped up and saw the tail end of a crane," said 
stockbroker Don Trabert, who saw the accident from his office in the Bank of 
America building. 
</P>
<P>
"It took out the top office of the old Natoma Building, then there were a lot 
of girders and it slid off the side of the building and crunched the walkway 
that protects the pedestrians. . . . It sounded like a Chinese New Year, only 
twice as loud. 
</P>
<P>
"The crane was swinging and dangling in the air and people were scrambling away 
from the scene." 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the crackling sound," said Paul Brenner, who works on the 26th floor 
of the Bank of America building. "My window faces that way. I stood up as soon 
as I saw it and I saw the crane buckle on the scaffolding that holds the crane. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about being helpless."

COMMUNISTS APPROVE CZECH COALITION RULE

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Communist Party leaders today agreed to give up their 41-year monopoly on power 
in Czechoslovakia by promising to propose a coalition government including 
other political parties and dropping its legally guaranteed "leading role" in 
political affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic move followed a two-hour meeting between Prime Minister Ladislav 
Adamec and the Civic Forum, the 9-day-old opposition organization led by 
playwright Vaclaz Havel. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, the latest in a series of lightning reforms in Eastern 
Europe, also followed 11 straight days of demonstrations organized by students 
and the Civic Forum to demand political freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Those protests climaxed Monday, when millions of Czechoslovaks walked off their 
jobs for a two-hour general strike to oppose one-party rule. The walkout was 
one of the most vivid manifestations of a peaceful revolution interrupted 21 
years ago when Warsaw Pact tanks snuffed out the reform-minded Prague Spring. 
</P>
<P>
As dusk fell, hundreds of citizens again gathered under the statue of St. 
Wenceslas in the capital's famed Wenceslas Square, shouting "Freedom! Freedom!" 
in celebration of the announcement by Adamec's government. 
</P>
<P>
"By Dec. 3, we will propose to the president of the republic (Gustav Husak) to 
appoint a government with a new composition," said Marian Calfa, a minister 
without portfolio for legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that it will be a government of a broad coalition base, in 
which there will be both non-party representatives and representatives of other 
political parties, and at the same time, of course, representatives of the 
Communist Party," Calfa said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a government first of all of specialists and experts," Calfa added 
during a five-minute news conference. He did not take questions. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in February, 1948, many crucial 
government positions were held by professional Communist Party members with no 
qualifications for the posts they held. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation on future leaders focused on Valtr Komarek, 59, an economist linked 
to Civic Forum and known for his outspoken view that the Communist leaders 
could not stop the country's economic decline. Posters have begun appearing 
saying, "Komarek for Premier." 
</P>
<P>
Calfa also said the government will ask Parliament to eliminate three articles 
in the constitution, including one guaranteeing the Communist Party the leading 
role in political affairs and another requiring a Marxist-Leninist-based 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating the education provision would end the traditional cradle-to-grave 
political indoctrination forced upon citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The third article to be dropped outlaws groups not allied with the National 
Front, a pro-government umbrella organization for political activities. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, non-Communist groups have been allowed to join the National Front, 
but such groups had to be allied with the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals will be presented to the two-chamber National Assembly or 
Parliament, which is meeting in joint session.

Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark said today he hopes to travel to El 
Salvador on Wednesday to represent an American woman who was detained after 
police discovered a large stash of arms under her house. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who served under former President Lyndon B. Johnson, said he had been 
retained by the mother of Jennifer Casolo, a 28-year old church worker, and 
Christian Educational Seminars, the group she works for. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said formal charges have not been filed against Casolo, who is being held 
under special emergency laws. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo was detained in San Salvador on Sunday after police, acting on a tip 
from a guerrilla who was under interrogation, found a large stash of arms and 
ammunition under Casolo's home, including 21,000 rounds for AK-47 rifles, 103 
grenades and explosives.

Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro indicated that the issue of Vatican-Moscow 
ties, broken after the Russian Revolution in 1917, will be high on the Pope's 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"The Holy See is asking for the possibility of a type of permanent, stable 
relationship," Navarro said.

The office of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry today branded as 
"character assassination" a televised report that Barry was hospitalized for 
treatment of a drug overdose in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
WUSA-TV said Monday that it had obtained a police report quoting a Howard 
University Hospital physician as saying Barry was hospitalized for a drug 
overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Alyce Gullattee, who directs the hospital's Institute of Drug 
Abuse and Addiction, was interviewed twice by police investigators in June, 
1984, the station said. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mayor Marion Barry was hospitalized (at Howard) . . . his illness was the 
result of an overdose of drugs (cocaine) that occurred while he was in the 
company of a female companion who also overdosed," Gullattee told police, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry overdosed a second time; however, he was taken to the District of 
Columbia General Hospital for treatment," she was quoted as saying.

FIAT TO PRODUCE CARS WITH SOVIET UNION;

TRADE: THE DEAL CALLS FOR PRODUCTION OF 300,000 CARS A YEAR. ITALIANS ARE

Italian motor giant Fiat signed a landmark car production deal with the Soviet 
Union today, setting the tone for what the Italian government and industry hope 
will turn into an export bonanza to the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Fiat Spa will set up a joint venture with the Soviet Union to produce 300,000 
cars a year for both the Soviet domestic market and export to the West, Fiat 
Managing Director Cesare Romiti told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is the largest of several to be signed with the Soviet Union this 
week, with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev due to start a three-day visit to 
Italy on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Many other Italian companies are signing new contracts or taking existing deals 
a stage further, often resulting from contacts made during a major trade 
exhibition Italy staged in Moscow last year. 
</P>
<P>
Italy is Moscow's fourth-biggest Western trading partner and has a long history 
of economic ties with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Fiat deal, production at the Yelabuga plant, southeast of Moscow, 
would start in late 1993 or early 1994. Fiat is taking a 30% stake in the 
project and the Soviet state-run company Elaz the remaining 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Romiti, who signed the accord with Soviet Automotive Industry Minister Nikolai 
Pugin, said the joint venture's A-93 car would not be based on the Fiat Panda 
but would be a new vehicle developed jointly by Soviet and Italian technicians. 
</P>
<P>
He said it would be a three-door or five-door sedan model, 11 feet long, with a 
maximum speed of 95 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new car which should be able to compete with Western vehicles but is 
also adapted for use in the Soviet Union," he said.

Japan's auto exports in October dropped 13.6% from September and 11.4% from a 
year ago to 462,548 units mostly because of a substantial decline of shipments 
to the United States, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn. said today. 
</P>

Exports to the United States, the biggest overseas auto market for Japan, 
declined 24.3% from a year ago to 191,369 units while those to Europe increased 
to 128,792 units, up 15.4%.

October exports totaled $5.17 billion, down 15.7% from September's $6.14 
billion and down 8.7% from a year ago, the association said.

Britain's national newspapers published a code of conduct today aimed at 
reviving the battered public image of the press and heading off government 
controls on reporting. 
</P>
<P>
The five-point code, agreed upon by editors of up-market heavyweights and racy 
tabloids alike, said intrusion into private lives must always be justified by 
public interest. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the code, every paper pledged to set up a system to investigate 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The British press has been increasingly accused by both the public and the 
government of intruding into privacy. Earlier this month an editor was fired 
for printing front-page color pictures of Prince Charles' son, Prince William, 
urinating in a park.

The stock market closed higher today as investors remained focused on the 
direction of the economy and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.04 points to 2,702.01. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 818 issues up, 637 down and 531 unchanged.

<P>
Big Board volume totaled 153.77 million shares, up from 149.39 million in 
Monday's session.

<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.20 to 191.33. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index advanced 1.06 to 375.10. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened weak after Monday's rally, then stalled around midday after 
the Dow pierced the psychological resistance level of 2,700. 
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip indicator had not closed higher since the day before the Oct. 13 
stock plunge, when it reached 2,759.84. 
</P>
<P>
The market regained its footing in mid-afternoon behind a strengthening bond 
market but wasn't able to sustain a strong rally as volume faded. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sleepy, slow day, not the kind of market that gives people 
inspiration," said John Burnett, senior vice president at the investment firm 
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said recent actions by the Federal Reserve confused investors and sent 
many scurrying to the sidelines to await fresh signals as to its intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the confusion, analysts said, investors remained generally optimistic 
that interest rates are in an overall declining pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next couple months the perception is that rates have to come down, so 
there's no reason to get excited about short-term action by the Fed," said 
Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Oil stocks led the blue-chips on the upside, and technology stocks remained 
generally weak, equities traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were narrowly mixed in early trading today as activity slowed after 
Federal Reserve moves Monday that indicated no relaxation in credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 1/32 point, or under $1 per 
$1,000 face amount, around midday. Its yield held at 7.90%. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's kind of licking their wounds," said Kathleen Camilli, a money 
market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "The market got kind of 
whipsawed in the last week." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed drained money from the banking system Monday, driving the key federal 
funds rate up to 8 1/2% by the end of the day from 8 1/4% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds, the interest on overnight loans between banks, is a key 
indicator of rate trends. Last week, many traders had believed that the Fed 
signaled a lower target rate for federal funds by draining reserves, but that 
belief was quashed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The rate was quoted at 8 5/8% by midday today, up from 8 1/2% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Fed added reserves to the banking system today because of 
seasonal needs for more money, but the move was seen as necessary and not a 
sign of a looser credit policy.

AS PRICES RISE, MUSEUMS SELL PAINTINGS TO AFFORD OTHERS

To update collections in today's high-priced art market, museums increasingly 
must put a price on the priceless. 
</P>
<P>
Curators haven't quite reached the level of "I'll trade you two Picassos for a 
Van Gogh," but museum boards are being forced to sell off some works to buy 
others. Budgets are simply dwarfed by the exponential growth in the price of 
auctioned art works. 
</P>
<P>
"In today's art market, museums have a hard time buying," said Lori Starr, 
spokeswoman for the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, for example, has an acquisitions budget of 
about $2 million. In a market where a Vincent van Gogh painting was recently 
sold for nearly $54 million, that doesn't go far. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the museum will put eight American paintings on the auction block to 
raise money to buy other American paintings. The 19th and 20th Century 
paintings for sale include works by John Singer Sargent, Maurice Prendergast, 
Albert Bierstadt and George Inness. 
</P>
<P>
"In the best of all possible worlds, we could keep every painting and be able 
to add through the regular purchase fund," said Theodore E. Stebbins, the 
museum's curator for American paintings. "It used to be you could go down and 
buy wonderful things on the market (with $2 million.) Now you can't." 
</P>
<P>
Stebbins expects each painting to bring at least $3.6 million at the auction at 
Sotheby's in New York -- nearly twice the museum's acquisition budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty museum planned to auction about 15 works today from J. Paul Getty's 
private collection, including paintings by Paul Gauguin and Edgar Degas. The 
expected $13 million to $16 million from the Sotheby's auction will go toward 
new purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of art to buy art is a "very established, regular procedure," 
especially as a way of weeding out works of no great interest to the public, 
said John Ross, spokesman for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"If something has not been shown in 30 years, or no other institute has asked 
to borrow it in 30 years . . . then it can be removed from the list of works in 
the museum and put up for auction," he said Monday.

CBS, trying to raise the low ratings of its late-night and morning shows, is 
putting a veteran sports producer with "The Pat Sajak Show" and two new 
reporters on "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
Sajak's talk show will get Michael Weisman, an NBC Sports producer for 15 
years, as co-executive producer. Sajak is the other executive producer. Weisman 
has won 10 Emmy awards for sports telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
The reporters joining "CBS This Morning" are Steve Kmetko of KCBS-TV in Los 
Angeles and Wayne Freedman, formerly of KRON-TV in San Francisco. Kmetko will 
report on the entertainment industry but continue at KCBS. Freedman, who will 
be a features reporter for the CBS show, will be based here. 
</P>
<P>
CBS announced the staff changes Monday. A spokesman also said that director 
Peter Bogdanovich, who had reviewed videocassettes of classic films and 
interviewed film figures for CBS' morning show, is leaving the program. 
</P>
<P>
The show, co-anchored by Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan, is a distant third 
in ratings against NBC's top-rated "Today" show and ABC's "Good Morning 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Sajak's show has struggled in the ratings since its Jan. 9 debut. It began as a 
90-minute program but was cut back to just an hour on Oct. 30.

SINGER'S LIFE A TABLOID HEADLINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Tanya Tucker, riding out another controversy in her tempestuous career, 
believes her life style has helped make her intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
"People love to read about people like me," said the 31-year-old country music 
star. "They don't like to read about people who never do anything wrong, never 
say anything wrong, have never been to a wild party. 
</P>
<P>
"People like me sell magazines. The (National) Enquirer makes a fortune off 
people like me." 
</P>
<P>
In the latest stir in her life, she is the unmarried mother of a daughter born 
in July. Just 1 1/2 years before the birth, Tucker was treated for drug 
addiction at the Betty Ford Center. In a deposition released last May, she 
admitted using cocaine with a Miami woman acquaintance charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
In the years before that, Tucker was linked romantically to singers Glen 
Campbell (23 years her senior), Andy Gibb and Merle Haggard (21 years her 
senior), actor Don Johnson, boxer Gerry Cooney and several other professional 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Around Nashville's Music Row, she has long been regarded as a vivacious dynamo 
looking for a whirlwind to deposit her at the next party. 
</P>
<P>
She said about motherhood: "I've never done anything the normal way. This is 
just one more example." 
</P>
<P>
About the unidentified father: "It's just one of those things that didn't work 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Her turbulent private life aside, Tucker has been one of the steadiest hit 
makers during the past four years. In fact, she is an 18-year show business 
veteran. She started at age 13 with the first hit version of the song "Delta 
Dawn." 
</P>
<P>
Her top records include "I Won't Take Less Than Your Love," "Strong Enough to 
Bend," "One Love at a Time," "I'll Come Back as Another Woman," "Love Me Like 
You Used to," "Texas When I Die" and "San Antonio Stroll." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after giving birth, Tucker was back on the road. But her hard work 
was unrewarded by her peers. For the second year in a row, she was a runner-up 
(some say snubbed) for the Country Music Assn.'s female vocalist of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've sort of given up," she said. "The best awards I have is when I look out 
at the audience and the seating is full." 
</P>
<P>
Besides that, daughter Presley (named after Elvis) Tanita is what really counts 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's my No. 1 priority. I have something more important than my music."

Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan paid $400,000 for a two-acre 
lot in Williamsburg's exclusive Kingsmill community and plans to build a home 
there, a spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show Regan and his wife, Ann B. Regan, paid cash for the wooded 
land in a sale that was closed Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Regans have arranged to have a house built on the lot by June, said 
Kathleen Reid, executive assistant to Regan. They are selling their home in 
Alexandria but will keep a house in Sarasota, Fla., she said. 
</P>
<P>
Regan served former President Ronald Reagan as Treasury secretary for four 
years before taking over as chief of staff for two years. He resigned in 
February, 1987, following a bitter dispute with Nancy Reagan.

Patrons of the Metropolitan Opera got a little more drama than they had 
anticipated when mezzo-soprano Helga Dernesch fainted on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Dernesch, who was playing the vocally demanding role of Nurse in Richard 
Strauss' "Die Frau ohne Schatten," "paused, coughed and fell to the floor" 
about 50 minutes into the 60-minute first act of the three-act opera Monday, 
said Metropolitan spokesman Charles Sheek. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the curtain was brought down and we decided to take an intermission," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dernesch was attended by the house doctor, who concluded that "she may be a 
little anemic, but she's fine and she's going home," said Sheek. 
</P>
<P>
The opera resumed with another singer, Diane Curry, singing the part, Sheek 
said.

ASK DR. RUTH: SEX ADDICTION MAY SIGNAL DEEPER EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. RUTH WESTHEIMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I know you say it is a false concept, but the fact is that I am a sex 
addict. I am preoccupied with pornography, and I am totally obsessed with 
women. It is adversely affecting my work and school, and my everyday life is a 
mess. I just don't know what to do. What can I do to get rid of this illness? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I can't tell you something to do to overcome this obsession or to 
understand your own perplexity or find out what it is that is really troubling 
you. Because it could be that something is wrong and you respond to it by 
thinking only about sex and women. 
</P>
<P>
I can't say join the Y and work out every day or try a camping trip or anything 
simple like that. The fact is your problem seems to me to be completely outside 
my field of work. 
</P>
<P>
You are troubled and must find a psychotherapist -- a specialist in helping 
people with deep emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I was born with cerebral palsy and have never had any kind of relationship 
with men, outside of my fantasy life. I have an elaborate technique for 
pleasuring myself that lasts for hours. I can't be sure that the intense 
sensations I achieve are orgasms, but I can go on for an hour or two producing 
them every few minutes. At the same time I feel that I would like to quit doing 
this, if there is a safe way. Please help. 
</P>
<P>
A. Again, I would like you to get help from a psychotherapist because the most 
important problem you seem to have is a terrible burden of guilt for having 
sexual desire and a solitary way of seeking release. The sensations you 
describe are orgasmic; different women have different kinds of orgasms, and the 
kind you describe may simply be your kind. 
</P>
<P>
In your letter you describe your routine pretty fully, and it seems you have 
enough privacy to pleasure yourself and learn additional ways to do it. 
</P>
<P>
A vibrator might give you stronger orgasms and longer-lasting release from 
sexual tension, but in any case you need to discuss your problem with a 
psychotherapist.

FALCONS COACH CAMPBELL QUITS;

Atlanta Falcons Head Coach Marion Campbell announced his retirement today, 
saying he wants to give the last-place team a chance "to get on with the 
future." Offensive Coach Jim Hanifan, a former NFL head coach, was named 
interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have chosen this avenue to clear the picture for the ownership to get on 
with the future of their franchise," Campbell said in a statement released from 
the NFL club's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, I am just announcing my retirement and I have no plans as 
to my future concerns." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons are 3-9, last in the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Hanifan, named interim coach an hour after Campbell's announcement, was the 
Falcons' assistant head coach for offense. He was head coach of the St. Louis 
Cardinals from 1980 to 1985, compiling a 39-49 record during that period. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Smith, the Falcons' vice president and son of owner Rankin Smith Sr., 
said Hanifan will not be considered for the head coaching job on a permanent 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Marion did a great job. We realized at the time he was hired that we 
were not a very good football team," said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell was hired to coach the team for a second time in 1987, after the 
firing of Head Coach Dan Henning. Campbell compiled an 11-32 record in the last 
2 1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also was head coach of the Falcons from 1974 to 1976 and coached the 
Philadelphia Eagles from 1983 to 1985. His career record as an NFL head coach 
is 34-80-1. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of his departure began swirling recently as the Falcons lost five of 
their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, 60, has recorded his greatest success in the NFL as a defensive 
coach, with the Minnesota Vikings, the Rams, the Eagles and the Falcons. He was 
defensive coordinator for Philadelphia's 1980 Super Bowl team.

ZENDEJAS TELLS NFL EAGLES' PLAYERS ADMITTED BOUNTIES

<P>
Luis Zendejas has told an NFL official the names of "four or five" Philadelphia 
Eagles who he said told him that Coach Buddy Ryan had placed bounties on 
certain Dallas Cowboys players before Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas running back Junior Tautalatasi said he also spoke to NFL security about 
allegations that the Eagles had placed bounties on other players during his 
years with the team, from 1986 to 1988, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, league officials spoke with Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson and punter 
Mike Saxon. 
</P>
<P>
Zendejas, cut earlier this month by the Eagles and signed by Dallas, said he 
told Warren Welch of NFL security Monday that the Philadelphia players either 
warned him before the game or admitted to him after the game that players were 
to be rewarded for knocking certain Dallas Cowboy players out of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles won the Thanksgiving Day game, 27-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him the information," Zendejas said. "I told him all the things about 
the whole thing. He says he's going to question them." 
</P>
<P>
Zendejas, who said quarterback Troy Aikman and Saxon also were targeted with 
bounties, would not disclose the names of the Eagles given to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Zendejas said he hoped the Eagles who talked to him would go public, but said 
the players had expressed to him a fear of reprisals from Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pretty much have to go on the hope that (an Eagles player) will stand 
up and say what he believes," Zendejas said. "Buddy's job is on the line, and 
he didn't do a very good job of keeping this quiet because he trusted it to a 
rookie (linebacker Jessie Small). Someone will spill their guts. They all said 
after the game they wouldn't come after me and that they were my friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if they are my friends, somebody will stand up and say the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Small has denied that he carried out a bounty on Zendejas. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, whose Eagles meet the Cowboys again Dec. 10, has dismissed the 
bounty-hunting claims as "ridiculous."

MICHICAN STATE AND SMITH WIN ALASKA SHOOTOUT 73-68

<P>
The story of the championship game of the Great Alaska Shootout was too much 
Steve Smith and not enough Steve Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State had Smith, and that proved pivotal as the Spartans beat Kansas 
State 73-68 in Monday night's championship basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, named the tournament's outstanding player, scored 17 points, handed out 
11 assists, grabbed 6 rebounds, made 2 steals and blocked a shot in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith obviously really controlled the ballgame and dictated a lot of things," 
Kansas State Coach Lon Kruger said. "They're big and strong and whipped up on 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Henson, who had directed Kansas State to two comeback victories earlier, was 
hampered by a thigh injury and spent most of the day in bed with the flu. He 
finished with 14 points but played only 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Kruger refused to use that as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not quite himself, but that's part of the game," Kruger said. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote, who says Henson reminds him of the great 
Spartan guard Scott Skiles, admitted that he was worried when Henson's jump 
shot made it 65-60 with 1:21 to go. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned -- I don't think panicked, but concerned," Heathcote said 
after watching his team fritter away most of a 16-point lead in four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirk Manns sank six free throws in the final 81 seconds to enable the 
Spartans to hold on.

The owner of Calder Race Course and a Japanese company have filed an 
application with state racing officials for a permit to buy Gulfstream Park, 
representatives said today. 
</P>
<P>
Bertram R. Firestone, 57, and Victoria Co. Ltd., a Japanese sporting-goods 
company, have asked the state Department of Business Regulation's Division of 
Pari-Mutuel Wagering for the permit required of all track owners. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Sole, DBR general counsel, said he believes this is the first case of a 
foreign investor and a Florida race track. 
</P>
<P>
"A background investigation is involved to ensure the person has no hidden 
entities who don't qualify for the permit," Sole said. 
</P>
<P>
He described hidden entities as corporations or individuals with undisclosed 
financial interests in the track's operation. Convicted felons also are not 
allowed to be part of a track ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream, which hosted the $10-million Breeders' Cup this month, would be 
sold in the first deregulated season for the highly competitive South Florida 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Firestone owns the nearby Calder track, and the historic Hialeah Park will be 
competing with the other tracks this winter for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Ltd. reportedly has agreed to become a 50% joint-venture partner in 
Gulfstream and Calder with the Virginia horse owner. 
</P>
<P>
Firestone said he established ties with the Japanese when one of his horses 
captured the Japan Cup in 1982 and has been selling horses from his Irish 
stables to Japanese breeders for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Firestone reportedly agreed to buy Gulfstream and adjoining real estate for $97 
million after the president of Hialeah Park offered more than $65 million in 
September.

The head of the Oregon Lottery says he'll recommend the state make National 
Basketball Assn. games part of its Sports Action betting game, with the 
exception of the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Davey said Monday the Oregon Lottery Commission is expected to meet next 
week to vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our motivation for not using the Blazers is primarily a courtesy to the 
Blazers," Davey said. "They, like the league, are concerned that fans would be 
more interested in the point spreads than winning or losing the game itself. I 
don't think that would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, NBA Commissioner David Stern came to Oregon to urge the commission 
not to use NBA games in Sports Action. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Grantham, executive director of the NBA Players Assn., said in Portland 
recently that the players also oppose Sports Action betting on NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
Davey said he had talked to three of the five lottery commission members "and 
they indicated they would go along with this recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
Sports Action is the nation's only lottery game based on point spreads on 
professional sports. It began in September.

Following are excerpts from an article by Ken Davis of the Hartford Courant 
exploring the views of those favoring and opposing the idea of college athletes 
receiving more compensation: 
</P>
<P>
"They (National Collegiate Athletic Assn. schools) cannot turn their eyes away 
from the fact that most of the scholarship athletes come either from poor rural 
families or inner-city areas," said Ernest Chambers, a Nebraska state senator 
who has taken up the cause of student athletes. "To ignore that poverty and the 
vulnerability of these young men is mind boggling . . . . They come to school 
penniless and we keep them impoverished just to keep up the false impression of 
amateurism." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that athletes, especially the minority kids in football 
and basketball, have this need," University of Hartford Athletic Director Don 
Cook said. "To ignore it is not facing the problem. It only subjects you to all 
the problems that a Barry Switzer experienced (at Oklahoma) -- although I'm 
sure with him that's just the tip of the iceberg . . . . We've got to face the 
reality of it. Obviously, the student athlete is not being treated properly."
