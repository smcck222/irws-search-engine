ELLIE CASEY; DYNAMO FOR L.A. CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleanor (Ellie) Casey, who in her years in Los Angeles was a tireless worker

CARLOS ARIAS NAVARRO; LAST PRIME MINISTER UNDER FRANCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlos Arias Navarro, 80, the last prime minister appointed under the 
authoritarian rule of Gen. Francisco Franco. Franco named Arias Navarro, a 
conservative lawyer and former mayor of Madrid, as prime minister in December, 
1973. Arias Navarro was chosen to appear on national television to announce 
Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. He was reappointed to the post by King Juan 
Carlos, who immediately began dismantling Franco's authoritarian apparatus. In 
July, 1976, Arias Navarro resigned and gave way to the peaceful transition to 
democracy carried out under the king and leading to the 1977 general elections, 
the first since the end of the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. Arias Navarro, who 
began his career as a prosecutor, was appointed mayor of the Spanish capital in 
1965 and held the post until 1973, when he became interior minister. In Madrid

DON'T THROW CAUTION TO THE WINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's long night of repression seems to be ending as its embattled 
Communist Party, shaken by the general strike last Monday that saw as many as 
half of the country's 15 million people take to the streets, watches its 
authority and control ooze away. The official concessions and promises tumble 
out one after another, as astonishing in their substance as in their 
suddenness: A new coalition government by the weekend. An end to the Communist 
Party's monopoly on power. No more obligatory university courses in 
Marxism-Leninism. Free elections within a year. 
</P>
<P>
This at least is how things appear after 10 remarkable days of protest and 
challenge. Certainly it is what the mass of Czechoslovaks want. Maybe the 
appearance will in fact quickly prove to be the reality as a demoralized 
Communist leadership, finally forced to acknowledge its miserably minuscule 
popular appeal, gets ready for genuine power sharing -- and for the elections 
that will almost certainly see it rejected. 
</P>
<P>
But a sense of caution is not out of place. Drastic changes have been promised; 
they have yet to be nailed down. The party, especially those top leaders who 
rode into office in 1968 almost literally atop invading Soviet tanks, might yet 
fight to hold on to what it has. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the euphoria, several disturbing signs stand out. The 250,000-man 
army, opposition leaders say, has been confined to barracks since the 
anti-regime protests began, reportedly cut off from news of what has been going 
on and subjected to indoctrination from political officers. To what end? 
</P>
<P>
At the same time the 60,000 members of the People's Militia, the party's 
paramilitary armed guard, remains in service -- and under the command of the 
party's top leaders. As professionals serving the state, the army might refuse 
orders to fire on protesting Czechoslovaks; the militia might have no such 
scruples because if the party leadership goes down, the militia goes down, too. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns may well be unfounded. The move toward political pluralism and 
freedom could roll on unimpeded. The party's retreat may in fact be the rout 
that it appears to be, rather than a tactical withdrawal to a stronger 
defensive posi- tion. All who cherish freedom and respect what the people of 
Czechoslovakia have had to endure must hope so. But all must be alert to other 
possibilities.

KOHL'S HEDGED UNITY PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few international questions bear so heavy a weight of history as what is called 
the German Question. Few carry so many practical and emotional implications; 
fewer still demand so much restraint and sensitivity from all parties. 
</P>
<P>
With an eye obviously on the Malta superpower summit this weekend, West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl showed both restraint and sensitivity Wednesday, when he 
advanced a noteworthy set of proposals on German unity in a speech to 
Parliament. His country, Kohl said, is prepared "to develop confederative 
structures between the two states in Germany in order to create a federation . 
. . . New forms of institutional cooperation can emerge and be developed in 
stages," the chancellor said. "Nobody knows how a reunified Germany will look. 
But I am sure that unity will come, if it is wanted by the German nation." 
</P>
<P>
Setting no timetable, Kohl was careful to point out that any future exercise of 
German self-determination would have to occur within the context of an 
expanding European Community and with recognition of his country's commitment 
to NATO. These are welcome reassurances. After 40 years of successful democracy 
in Bonn, the rest of the world no longer can presume that the fate of the two 
Germanys will necessarily be decided by anyone other than the Germans. They, 
for their part, cannot proceed as if other nations have anything less than a 
major stake in their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The complexities inherent in these realities were evident in the responses Kohl 
received from Washington and Moscow. State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. 
Tutweiler, while restrained in her characterization, said the chancellor was 
"responding to the deepest aspiration of his people," and argued that there was 
no need for alarm because he had "laid out his vision for the future of 
Germany." By contrast, Nikolai Portugalov, the Soviet's leading specialist on 
German affairs, declared flatly that "under today's geopolitical conditions, 
Europe cannot bear a (German) confederation." 
</P>
<P>
Twice in this century, an aggressive, highly centralized, authoritarian German 
nation has plunged the world into catastrophe. That cannot be forgotten or 
ignored. But while it is foolish to pretend that the past has no influence on 
the present, it is simplistic, and vulgar, to insist that the past is an 
unfailing guide to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Groping for the answer to today's German Question obviously will require every 
ounce of creativity and goodwill that can be mustered by statesmen on both 
sides of the Elbe.

CONSEQUENCES OF PORNOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were delighted to see the article on the social impact of illegal 
pornography. Just as the community has united on the war against drugs, we must 
also join together to eradicate illegal pornography which debases our women and 
children, and contributes to a wide variety of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Because we believe that one of the most urgent causes today is the more 
stringent enforcement of existing laws against illegal (child and violent) 
pornography, we implore our local law enforcement agencies and the U.S. 
attorney's office to prosecute those who have broken these laws.

24TH INFANTRY IN KOREAN WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to express some disappointment about Broder's article. As the 
author of a congressional House Resolution honoring the achievements of the 
majority black 24th Infantry, I was dismayed by the article's negative 
overtones and perpetuation of biased accounts of their overall performance in 
the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
The article states the assertion of the 24th Infantry combat veterans that 
their regiment "fought no worse, in many instances fought better, than 
comparable white units." More of the article should have been devoted toward 
examining this point instead of resurrecting the exaggerations, and in many 
cases falsehoods, which stigmatized the 24th Infantry. 
</P>
<P>
Greater insight could have been provided about the 24th's victory at the Korean 
town of Yechon; their holding of a most vital portion of the Pusan Perimeter 
against the main North Korean attack and other outstanding military action. We 
all know that in war not every military battle or engagement is distinguished 
by heroism. However, instances of dubious military action must be put into fair 
perspective. Incidents of poor performance were pervasive in the early stages 
of the Korean War. Poorly trained troops, inadequate supplies and equipment, 
and less than superior leadership contributed to some cases of unsatisfactory 
combat performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the 24th, these conditions were further exacerbated by the shame 
of segregation. Despite this, the 24th Infantry in many instances performed 
valiantly. 
</P>
<P>
Those who served in, and alongside, the 24th Infantry Regiment are simply 
asking for fairness. They are requesting to be credited for their success, as 
well as their failures.

CONSEQUENCES OF PORNOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary "The Consequences of Pornography Are Too Extensive to Ignore" 
(Op-Ed Page, Nov. 12) is a blatant piece of misinformation. The authors managed 
to link "child pornography" to "hard-core pornography" every time the latter 
was mentioned. This was a simplistic attempt at guilt by association. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin and the Rev. Eileen Lindner would have us believe 
that the adult film industry produces mostly movies about child molestation, 
rape, torture and murder. This is not true. 
</P>
<P>
The vile films mentioned cater to a small underground of deranged consumers of 
decadence and child abuse that dates back far beyond the Marquis de Sade. The 
majority of adult films are produced for average men and women. These consumers 
may be oversexed, sexually repressed or suffer from any one of scores of minor 
sexual hang-ups, but they are not murderers, rapists or child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two national commissions on pornography in the past 20 years, one found 
absolutely no link between violence and pornography. The other was so biased by 
right-wing pseudo-moralists that almost half the commission rejected the 
findings of the final report. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardin and Lindner note that the Supreme Court has ruled that obscenity is 
not protected by the First Amendment. They didn't mention that the vast 
majority of adult films are not obscene, by the court's definition. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, religious leaders will concentrate their energies on real dangers to 
society -- poverty, war and unchecked capitalism -- and stay out of our 
bedrooms.

24TH INFANTRY IN KOREAN WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the more pleasant aspects of my duties as executive chairman of the 
International Korean War Veterans Memorial project involves meeting people, 
some of them fellow Korean War veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago I met and formed a friendship with retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. 
Charles M. Bussey of Los Angeles. Based on this friendship, I can say without 
reservation the article on this man is an insult to Lt. Col. Bussey and to the 
veterans of that war. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie was a fighter pilot during World War II in the original all-black 332nd 
Fighter Group, commonly called the "Tuskegee Airmen." As commanding officer of 
the 77th Combat Engineer Company of the 25th Infantry Division, he and his 
soldiers were among the first to meet the enemy in Korea. Like other United 
States military units in those early days of the war, the 25th Division and its 
combat support units were rushed from Japan into combat woefully unprepared to 
meet and fight the professional North Korean Army. 
</P>
<P>
I know Charlie Bussey to be a man of dignity and personal integrity with a 
down-to-earth understanding of reality. To make him appear as a doting old man 
with a feeble memory of the past is without honor. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate the reporter was unable to see and know the real character of 
Charlie Bussey.

24TH INFANTRY IN KOREAN WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times is to be commended for its continuing coverage of the Army's last 
black 24th Infantry Regiment and of the 10-year effort to correct the unit's 
mistreatment in official Korean War history. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, John Broder's article ("War and Black GIs' Memories," Part A, 
Nov. 15) treated only the 24th's initial weeks in Korea, rehashing many of the 
negative reports of the 24th and every other regiment's baptism to fire without 
reporting a single subsequent outstanding combat action. As I have long 
maintained, the 24th fought as well as other American regiments throughout its 
14 1/2 months of extended front-line combat. 
</P>
<P>
Broder also fails to complete an important comparison between the 24th and two 
sister regiments during the initial weeks of combat. The 24th experienced an 
unprecedented 13 changes in battalion commanders (only two were 
casualty-related) in its first three months in action -- an average of one new 
battalion CO per week, not the one per month Broder reports. Its sister 
battalions, the 27th and 35th, had just one and three changes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the 24th had throughout these initial two months fought as well 
as other American regiments is a tribute to the extraordinary performance of 
the regiment's company-grade officers, white and black, and to its exceptional 
NCOs.

FREEDOM'S UMBRELLA ALSO COVERS RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: BISHOP LEO MAHER'S PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST A PRO-CHOICE CATHOLIC 
POLITICIAN IS AS MUCH WITHIN U.S. RELIGIOUS TRADITION AS PLYMOUTH ROCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN K. ROTH, John K. Roth, a professor of philosophy at Claremont McKenna 
College, is a Protestant with pro-choice leanings and the co-author of American 
Ground: Vistas, Visions, and Revisions (Paragon House, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before Thanksgiving, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops ruled that "no 
Catholic can responsibly take a 'pro-choice' stand when the 'choice' in 
question involves the taking of innocent human life." Bolder -- if not wiser -- 
than his colleagues, Bishop Leo T. Maher of San Diego acted promptly on that 
ruling. Assemblywoman Lucy Killea's "media advertisements and statements 
advocating the 'pro-choice' abortion position," he stated, put this practicing 
Catholic from his diocese "in complete contradiction to the moral teaching of 
the Catholic Church." Then he banned Killea, who is running for the state 
Senate against anti-abortion Republican Carol Bentley, from the sacrament of 
Communion until she recants. 
</P>
<P>
No faithful Catholic would take such action lightly, which brings us back to 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday rests on Protestant Pilgrims who dissented from the Church of 
England's authority and followed their consciences to New England, landing at 
Plymouth Rock. From these Pilgrims flowed a belief that Alexis de Tocqueville, 
the French observer of democracy in America, would later identify as our 
"general distaste for accepting any man's word as proof of anything." 
</P>
<P>
But Pilgrim dissenters were not the only ones who landed here, a point to which 
the current political tempest in San Diego testifies. Nearly a century before 
the Pilgrims crossed the Atlantic, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese 
explorer in the service of Catholic Spain, sailed into San Diego Bay. He did 
not stay, but other Roman Catholics did -- including the Franciscan Junipero 
Serra, who founded the first of California's many missions in San Diego in 
1769. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic tradition has been less reluctant to accept a man's word as proof, 
especially when that word is thought to come through a centuries-old, unbroken 
authority that could be traced back to St. Peter. In that tradition, the 
National Council of Catholic Bishops regards the Catholic Church's teachings as 
true and intends that they should be received as authoritative, particularly by 
members of that body. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, San Diego's voters will likely prevail against Bishop Maher's 
vision of the church and send Lucy Killea to the state Senate, a victory that 
would give pro-choice advocates a 21-19 edge in that house of California's 
Legislature. Reasons for that forecast reside in our past. 
</P>
<P>
From Plymouth Rock to San Diego Bay, American origins produced an understanding 
about religious civility. No religion, hierarchical or otherwise, would be 
established by the state or be permitted exclusive rights. Thanksgiving affirms 
that civility. We understand, however dimly, that the holiday involves the 
intertwining of political and religious liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Religious traditions based on hierarchy and authority did find their place in 
the United States. But Tocqueville got it right. Most Americans -- often in 
political matters and particularly in religious ones -- do not accept "any 
man's word as proof of anything." Undoubtedly some voters will be influenced by 
Bishop Maher and decide that Killea is not fit to serve. Politically, however, 
Maher's forthrightness will backfire -- if not by aiding Killea on Tuesday, 
then by alienating further the millions of American Catholics who are already 
discomfited by their church's stance on a wide range of sexually related 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
But one should pause before agreeing completely with critics who take Maher 
simply to be heavy-handed, more imprudent than adroit. As a bishop, Maher is 
responsible for his church's integrity no less than elected political leaders 
are responsible for the integrity of their government. In good conscience, he 
can no more allow members of his church to reject its teaching with impunity -- 
especially when the actions of a particularly visible member have the effect of 
contradicting that teaching publicly -- than elected political leaders can 
blithely allow lawbreakers in their jurisdiction to proceed unhindered. 
</P>
<P>
Some teachings of Maher's church, like some laws at times, may be unjust and 
rightly subject to change. But neither Maher's conscience nor the traditional 
religious authority that informs his position on abortion finds that to be the 
case now. The bishop's action against Lucy Killea has its logic and 
authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
This week between Thanksgiving and San Diego's special election, as we keep 
struggling with the immense issues that abortion raises, we should give thanks 
for our religious and political diversity, including the commitment and 
civility on which it depends. Let it encompass the likes of Carol Bentley, Lucy 
Killea and, at least a bit, those of Bishop Maher as well. Their collision 
could produce better religious teaching and sounder public policy.

FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS HURT CARSON'S BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As December approaches, it's business as usual at Carson High. 
</P>
<P>
The Colt football team begins defense of its L.A. City 4-A title Friday night 
against Kennedy of Granada Hills, while basketball Coach Rich Masson counts the 
days until the end of football. 
</P>
<P>
Because four of his top players are also football stars, Masson probably will 
have to wait until the third week of December, after the City playoffs, before 
the basketball team is at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, Carson played its basketball opener Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Conceivably, we could get three or four starters from the football team," 
Masson said. "Right now we're suiting up 10 players and only four are solid 
varsity players." 
</P>
<P>
That puts Carson at a considerable disadvantage early in the season, but Masson 
has grown accustomed to sharing players with the football team. This year, 
though, he says the problem is worse. 
</P>
<P>
Football players expected to play prominent roles on the basketball team are 
forward Nkosi Littleton and guards Michael Ross, Clayvand Thomas and Armin 
Youngblood. Littleton plays middle linebacker and leads the football team in 
tackles, Ross is the Colts' leading receiver, Thomas is a star defensive back 
and Youngblood plays quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst year ever, as far as the number of bodies playing football," 
Masson said. "It's created a total lack of continuity. We could easily be 1-6 
by the time (the football players) come out. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when they do come out, there's going to be a total lack of chemistry for 
quite a while. What's that going to do to the morale of the other guys?" 
</P>
<P>
Masson scoffed at Carson's No. 3 seeding for the Pacific Shores Tournament 
starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way in the world we should be that high," he said. "(The coaches) 
are seeding us on what we'll be, not what we are. Realistically, we should be 
seeded 13th." 
</P>
<P>
Masson might have trouble convincing other coaches of that after Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts rallied from a 23-point deficit to defeat Locke, 81-80, behind 42 
points from 6-foot-2 swing man Bobby Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Mitchell has yet to coach his first regular-season basketball game for 
Bishop Montgomery, but he's already experienced his first bad break. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell suffered a broken leg in a motorcycle accident Thanksgiving Day near 
his parents' home in Lancaster. He underwent surgery to have four pins inserted 
in his left leg above the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to remember my younger days, and I shouldn't have," he said of 
the accident, which involved no other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's injury prevented him from conducting practice this week, but he says 
he will be on the sideline Monday night when Bishop Montgomery opens the season 
against Carson in the Pacific Shores Tournament at Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'll be in a wheelchair or on crutches, but I'm going to get 
there," he said. "I wouldn't miss that one." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell coached South Torrance the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester High was well-represented Monday at a downtown meeting to appeal an 
L.A. City Section proposal to move the school to another sports conference, 
football Coach Larry Wein said. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave what we thought was a real good presentation," he said. "We had a lot 
of community support." 
</P>
<P>
Wein said more than 50 parents, coaches and community residents attended the 
meeting to protest a proposal to move Westchester to the Southern-Pacific 
Conference in place of Narbonne, which requested a change because of its 
failure to compete effectively on that level over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Wein, Principal Eileen Banta and two parents addressed the eight-member 
releaguing committee in an effort to change the original 5-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we changed anybody's mind," Wein said. "We expect to find out 
in a week or so." 
</P>
<P>
Westchester, currently grouped with other Westside schools in the Coastal 
Conference, argues that moving to the Southern-Pacific Conference will bring 
gang violence to the area and hurt the school's sports program by placing it in 
a conference with higher-enrollment schools such as Banning and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"If Narbonne has a problem, deal with Narbonne's problem," Wein said. "But 
don't use Westchester as a solution to the problem. Don't solve it by making 
Westchester a victim." 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance Co-Coach John Black reports that Warrior assistant Bill Vincent 
is retiring from football after coaching in the South Bay for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent was a member of West's staff for nine years, helping the Warriors win 
five league titles and the CIF Coastal Conference championship in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, he was the head coach and an assistant at El Camino College, where 
he coached both of West's co-coaches, Black and Mark Knox. 
</P>
<P>
Said Black: "His knowledge of the game, understanding of the kids and his great 
demeanor were keys to our success at West. We'll miss Bill Vincent, but the 
game of football will miss him even more." 
</P>
<P>
The youngest of Vincent's six sons, Matt, played tight end and linebacker for 
West's Ocean League champion team this season. 
</P>
<P>
Following are enrollment classifications for Southern Section schools for the 
1989-90 boys and girls basketball season. Teams have until Friday to move to a 
higher state division. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's girls team, as it did last year, has requested to move from the 
3-AA to the 5-AA Division. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION I (5-AA): Leuzinger, Hawthorne. (5-A): Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION II (4-AA): Torrance. (4-A): North Torrance, Redondo, West Torrance, 
Mira Costa, Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION III (3-AA): Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes, Morningside, South Torrance. 
(3-A): St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION IV (2-AA): St. Mary's. (2-A): El Segundo, Miraleste, Serra. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION V (1-A): Chadwick, Mary Star. (Small Schools): Wilmington Christian, 
South Bay Lutheran, Coast Christian, Harbor Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside girls basketball Coach Frank Scott is finding that life at the top 
can be distracting. 
</P>
<P>
Since practice began two weeks ago, the defending state champions have been 
besieged by the media. ESPN filmed their first practice Nov. 13 for a program 
that will air Sunday at 7 a.m., and journalists from around the country have 
requested interviews, mostly with 6-foot-5 senior Lisa Leslie, considered by 
many the nation's finest schoolgirl player. 
</P>
<P>
"The first couple of days it was distracting," Scott said. "But then I got 
smart and started scheduling (interviews) before and after practice. I don't 
mind the attention, but we have to get some work under our belts." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Leslie, Morningside also boasts a budding star in 6-4 sophomore 
Janet Davis, who earned All-CIF honors as a freshman. Scott says Leslie and 
Davis can dunk, a rare feat for females. Leslie did it in two games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs open the season Dec. 9 in the Morningside Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Mira Costa's girls volleyball team will play Lynbrook of San Jose 
in the State Division I finals at 7:30 Saturday night at Cal State Fullerton. 
The Mustangs (27-0) swept Granada of Livermore, 15-0, 15-5, 15-13, in the 
semifinals Tuesday, while Lynbrook (22-0) beat Corona del Mar, 15-9, 7-15, 
15-10, 17-19, 15-12. This will be Mira Costa's fourth appearance in a state 
final. The Mustangs won titles in 1982 and '85 and were runners-up to Hueneme 
in '86 . . . The Morningside boys basketball team will play an alumni team at 7 
p.m. Friday in the campus gym . . . Said Leuzinger football Coach Steve Carnes, 
whose team blew a 13-6 lead and lost to Thousand Oaks, 18-13, Friday in the CIF 
Division II playoffs: "I keep rehashing the game over and over in my mind. 'I 
wish I had done this, I wish I had done that.' We had our shot and blew it." . 
. . The 22nd annual South Torrance Holiday Soccer Tournament, featuring 16 
girls teams and 32 boys teams, gets under way Saturday with the girls 
tournament at South. The boys tournament starts Dec. 8. Both run through Dec. 
22.

CLEVELAND FALLS IN OPENER, BUT NOT ALL IS LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps first-year Cleveland High Coach Marc Paez can take solace in a few 
scribblings from last season's score book. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, Cleveland lost its opener to Westchester last season too. 
Afterward, though, the Cavaliers rebounded and spent most of the regular season 
ranked No. 2 in the state. Cleveland reeled off 18 consecutive wins after the 
loss, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, after losing in overtime, 78-75, to Westchester in a nonleague 
City Section opener at Cleveland on Wednesday night, an instant replay of last 
season would be just fine. But first things first: Wednesday's letdown beckons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed in the score," Paez said. "I mean that facetiously." 
</P>
<P>
While Paez's tongue was planted firmly in cheek, those of the players were 
definitely hanging out. As usual for Cleveland, the tempo was at double-time 
pace, with the guards carrying the scoring load. 
</P>
<P>
The final moments of the fourth quarter were a blur too. Cleveland led, 54-52, 
after three quarters, but Westchester took advantage of Cleveland's pressing 
defense by making eight of its first 11 free-throw opportunities to take a 
68-63 lead with 4:13 remaining. Cleveland's Eddie Hill, who finished with a 
game-high 27 points, led the comeback with a pair of quick baskets and an 
alley-oop assist to backcourt mate Pat McCook, who finished with 22 points in 
his first varsity game. 
</P>
<P>
McCook's basket cut Westchester's lead to 73-71, and Cleveland took advantage 
of a pair of missed one-and-one opportunities by the Comets and tied the score 
on Vincent Herring's follow shot underneath with 35 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, forward Mike Milligan (18 points) drilled a jump shot from the 
corner and knocked down another long shot with 1:18 remaining for a 77-75 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Westchester's Kelly Robinson missed the front end of a one-and-one 
situation with 28 seconds remaining, Hill missed a running seven-footer with 15 
seconds left. Out of desperation, Hill fouled Robinson, who made the first of 
two free throws for the decisive margin. 
</P>
<P>
After Robinson's miss, Hill missed an off-balance three-point shot attempt with 
one second left. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and McCook accounted for 49 of Cleveland's points. The youthful Cleveland 
bench -- depleted by the loss of seniors Andre Chevalier and Brandon Battle to 
academic eligibility -- scored just eight points. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of talent, we're OK," Paez said. "Experience is where we need the 
work."

SERRA MUST WIN FRIDAY NIGHT TO REACH FINALS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE '80; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: COACH LEO HAND'S SQUAD, WITH THE POWERHOUSE BACKFIELD, WILL FACE NOTRE 
DAME OF SHERRMAN OAKS IN THE SEMIFINALS. 
</P>

<P>
Serra High fumbled twice in the fourth quarter in last week's second-round 
32-25 victory over Arroyo Grande in the Southern Section Division VII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for the Cavaliers to be so charitable at 7:30 Friday night when 
they travel to Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks for a semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
"The team that makes the fewest mistakes in championship games will win," Serra 
Coach Leo Hand said. 
</P>
<P>
It also helps to have a backfield that has scored 57 touchdowns in 12 games, 
all victories for the Cavaliers. Quarterback Fred Safford and running backs 
Dennis Gerard, Lamont Daniel and Jerald Henry have been nearly unstoppable in 
the regular season and playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard has gained more than 1,500 yards and scored 26 touchdowns, including two 
last week. Daniel rushed for 207 yards last week, a career high. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (11-1) counters with Errol Small, who has rushed for 1,404 yards and 
25 touchdowns. But the running back has been slowed by an ankle injury suffered 
in the Knights' playoff opener. Kicker Chris Afarian is another scoring threat, 
having converted all 53 of his extra-point attempts in addition to seven field 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Serra missed four of five conversions last week, all two-point tries. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Notre Dame beat defending Division VII champion San Marino, 17-7. The 
San Fernando Valley League champion's only loss was to Division II semifinalist 
Canyon of Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
If Serra wins, it will reach the CIF finals for the first time since 1980 when 
it lost to Schurr in the Southeastern Conference title game, 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
Following are rundowns of L.A. City Section quarterfinal games involving South 
Bay teams. All games start at 7:30 p.m. Friday: 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (5-6) vs. Carson (8-1) at Veterans Stadium -- After a week off, Carson 
opens defense of its 4-A Division championship against a team it beat in last 
year's playoffs, 53-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we're ready," Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said. "I'm not a person that 
likes byes. We already had a bye, and that was good for us, but I don't like 
them now." 
</P>
<P>
That bye came in the third week of the season. It didn't slow Carson, which 
came back and routed Washington, 52-0. 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle said fullback Jim Lincoln is suffering from a severe thigh bruise and 
probably will not play. The passing game, in the capable hands of quarterback 
Armin Youngblood, will carry the team, as it has all season. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood has thrown for 1,927 yards and 24 touchdowns, which ties a school 
single-season record. Carson's all-time leading receiver, Michael Ross, has 
caught 39 passes for 765 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood might have his way with the Kennedy defense, which has given up an 
average of 287 yards a game. But the Carson defense will have its hands full 
with running back Ontiwaun Carter, who leads Kennedy with 1,301 yards rushing 
and eight touchdowns. Carter rushed for 219 yards and two touchdowns in last 
week's opening-round win over Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle said Kennedy has changed some of its offense but that his defense 
should be ready to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester (9-2) at South Gate (10-0-1) -- Westchester heads into a rematch of 
last year's City 3-A final won by South Gate without starting tailback Tim 
Holliday, who suffered a knee injury in the Comets' final regular-season game, 
a 29-27 loss to Venice. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out of the Venice game in a worst-case scenario," Westchester Coach 
Larry Wein said. "We lost the game, we lost the No. 2 seeding (for the 
playoffs), and we lost our best player." 
</P>
<P>
Holliday, who had rushed for a season-high 274 yards in three quarters against 
Venice, will be missed against the 3-A's No. 1 seed. He leads Westchester with 
1,115 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that could be worse is if we show up at South Gate and they 
already have 14 points on the board," Wein said. 
</P>
<P>
Wein said Holliday's injury will prevent him from matching skills with South 
Gate's Ivan Wilson, who rushed for 196 yards in last week's playoff win over 
Reseda. "He's a guy who can break one for 70 yards any time he gets the ball," 
Wein said. "It's a shame for the fans, because they were going to see two of 
the best running backs in the City. They could have competed and seen which was 
better, but these things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Westchester beat Belmont last week, 13-3, but Wein said the Comets were not at 
their best without Holliday: "We went from a strong offensive team to a 
struggling team. We will try hard, but we lost a big weapon." 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro (5-5) vs. Garfield (8-1-1) at East Los Angeles College -- San Pedro 
will don high-top tennis shoes for its 3-A quarterfinal game on the artificial 
turf of Weingart Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first time our coaches have ever walked on turf," San Pedro 
Coach Henry Pacheco said. The team practiced on the field Wednesday to become 
familiar with the traction. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates are treading on other unfamiliar ground as well. If San Pedro wins, 
it will reach the semifinals for the first time, according to Pacheco. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield has played five games on the turf at East L.A., its home field. 
</P>
<P>
Last week against Sylmar, San Pedro quarterback Arnie Madrid rushed for 138 
yards and two touchdowns and threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to Herb Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro will have to stop Garfield's Hilario Espinosa, who has rushed for 
1,826 yards and 21 touchdowns. Espinosa carried the ball 45 times in Garfield's 
first-round win over Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very exact team," Pacheco said of Garfield. "They don't make any 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena (5-6) vs. Franklin (10-1) at L.A. Wilson High -- Gardena is looking for 
about 26 points worth of revenge Friday night. That's the margin by which 
Franklin beat the Mohicans in the second game of the season, 34-7. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, we'll have to play a lot better pass defense than we did last 
time," Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai said. In the first meeting, Franklin 
quarterback Santiago Alvarez threw for 330 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Alvarez passed for 208 yards in a playoff win over Huntington Park 
but left the game with a knee injury. He is expected to play against Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena's defense turned in a strong performance in last week's 28-14 win over 
Grant, led by linebacker Prentiss Parker and tackle Alex Martinez, a two-way 
starter. Receiver-running back Manley Woods scored touchdowns on a pass 
reception and a run. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to play our best to stay in the game," Sakurai said.

CSUN'S BURT SEEKS COACHING POSITION AT NEW MEXICO ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Burt, football coach at Cal State Northridge, is among those being 
considered for the vacant job at New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Shutt, assistant athletic director at New Mexico State, said that the 
school has had "some correspondence" with Burt but that no interview has been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Burt, whose four-year record at Northridge is 27-17, confirmed that he had 
applied for the job but had no further comment. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State has dropped 17 consecutive games, the longest losing streak in 
Division I-A football. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Knoll, who was fired Nov. 19, had a 4-40 record in four seasons as coach 
of the Aggies. New Mexico State was 0-11 the past season, its first winless 
season in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Burt, 48, has not had a losing season since coming to Northridge in 1986. CSUN 
has been playing football for 28 years and no other Matador coach has had more 
than two winning seasons in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Elway, who went on to coach at San Jose State and Stanford, came the 
closest. Elway had winning seasons in 1976 and 1977 and a 5-5 record in 1978, 
his final season at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was 6-5 overall and finished in a second-place tie with Southern 
Utah State in the Western Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Although CSUN needed wins in its final two games to escape with a winning 
record, the Division II Matadors raised eyebrows by almost upsetting Cal State 
Fullerton in their second game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge lost, 27-20, but only after a Fullerton interception in the end zone 
foiled a last-minute drive. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton finished at 6-4-1 and went 5-2 in the Division I Big West Conference 
to end up in a second-place tie with San Jose State. The Titans defeated New 
Mexico State, 45-10, in a Big West game at Fullerton on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Burt is familiar with the New Mexico State program, having coached against the 
Aggies during his six years as Fullerton's defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Burt family has deep historical ties with New Mexico. In 1944, 
Burt's grandparents, Robert and Edna Peterson, ran against each other for 
governor of the state. The only other person on the ballot won. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in New Mexico State's athletic department hinted that Burt, who was 
born in Albuquerque, N. M., might be interviewed for the position sometime next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Stolz, formerly coach at San Diego State, is reportedly New Mexico 
State's top candidate. Stolz, who was 16-19 with the Aztecs before being fired 
last November, was interviewed by New Mexico State officials last Wednesday. 
Stolz has been men's golf coach at San Diego State for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bradley, New Mexico State's coach from 1973-77 was interviewed Monday and 
Bob O'Mera, coach at Western New Mexico, met with Aggie administrators 
Wednesday.

RBV STAYS IN GREAT SHAPE BY RUNNING

<P>
It was dark, lonely and about 2 a.m. Sunday when Carl Parrick, Southwest High 
School's football coach, finally found the key to stopping the Rancho Buena 
Vista backfield. 
</P>
<P>
The previous night, Parrick's team had become another ruin along RBV's road to 
a possible San Diego Section 3-A championship. So there he was, sitting in 
front of a television, eyes glazed over, watching the films from the Longhorns' 
48-21 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Zoom. There went standout running back Markeith Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Zip. There went standout running back O.J. Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Pow. James Lewis was laying out a Southwest player with a crunching block. 
</P>
<P>
And there was quarterback David Roberts, calmly directing it all. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Parrick figured out the only way to put a stop to it. He reached out, 
picked up the remote control . . . and pushed the pause key. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were good, but I wasn't paying that much attention to them during 
the game," Parrick said. "I was busy getting my offense ready to go back on the 
field. But it was third-and-six or third-and-nine or whatever, and next thing 
you know, they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
Parrick is no rookie. He has been a football coach for 15 years, a head coach 
for nine. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the best offensive team I've ever seen," he said. "Not only do they 
have the two best running backs we've ever faced, but they are exceptionally 
well-coached. I was talking to our defensive coach before the game, and we 
figured if we could hold them to four touchdowns, we could score five." 
</P>
<P>
Hold them to four touchdowns. Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns' lowest single-game output this season was 34 points, against 
both Vista and Poway. They averaged 44.6 points a game during the regular 
season, first in the county. OK, their record is 9-3. But two of those losses 
were forfeits after it was discovered that they unknowingly used an ineligible 
player. The other was a 42-35 victory by Point Loma, the team they get another 
crack at Friday in the section semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
RBV has won 26 of its past 27 games on the field, dating back to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is, after RBV eased to the section 2-A championship last year, 
coaches looked forward to this season's move up to 3-A. Hee hee, they chuckled. 
Let's see if the ol' Longhorns can be as dominating playing large schools week 
after week. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they could, thanks in large part to their unstoppable offense. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Tennis of Cal-Hi Sports has said Ross, Hall, Lewis and Roberts make up the 
best backfield he has seen this year. Point Loma Coach Bennie Edens, who has 
been coaching since the 1950s, said they are the best backfield he has seen in 
at least 10 years -- maybe longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any attack that can compare with them in the last 10 years," 
Edens said. "It's hard to compare past then because you get into vague 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
Said Parrick: "I know there's been a lot of great back tandems in the county, 
but nobody I've ever played has had anybody as good as those guys. We have a 
great defense, and for a team like that to do that to us . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Southwest's defense finished the season ranked seventh in the county, allowing 
9.3 points a game. Ross ran for 182 yards against it, Hall 108. 
</P>
<P>
"Their backfield is very well-balanced," Edens said. "Hall runs the ball 
excellently. Ross is a long-ball hitter. (Lewis) is more than adequate -- you 
can't say he can't run, because he can. And he blocks well. And their 
quarterback runs the option bootleg pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, a 5-foot-10, 185-pound junior, is the youngster of the group. Hall (5-11, 
185), Lewis (5-11, 180) and Roberts (5-9, 175) are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, Hall and Lewis line up in the backfield at the same time -- Ross as the 
tailback, Hall as the fullback and Lewis as the slotback. RBV Coach Craig Bell 
employs an unbalanced line and a lot of misdirection. From left to right, the 
RBV offensive line is tight end Shannon Levings (6-0, 190), guard Don Aliipule 
(6-0, 240), center Owen Gonder (5-10, 185), right guard Mark Gasio (6-0, 185), 
tackles Jonathon Vaeena (6-0, 185) or Brian Flanagan (6-1, 200) and George 
Zavala (6-2, 240). The split end is Art Serrano (5-11, 180). 
</P>
<P>
According to Roberts, one of the keys to getting things rolling is to open the 
"No. 1" hole for Ross. In Longhorn-ese, that means getting Ross free on sweeps. 
Once that's accomplished, they pound away inside to get Hall some yards up the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
"We sweep to the outside to try to spread the defense out," Roberts said. "It 
makes it a lot easier then. It's hard for defenses to key on four guys who can 
run the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Take it from the opposing defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember after the San Dieguito game, one of the guys in their secondary 
told me I'd beat a plane to its destination," Hall said. "Then, the next day I 
was taking the SAT and another San Dieguito player complimented me on how fast 
our backfield is. He said that once they realized what was going on, most of 
the time it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
Hall moved into first in all-time section rushing this season and currently has 
4,073 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the team leader," Bell said. "He has made the biggest contribution of 
all to the team. He and David Roberts aren't measured in statistics." 
</P>
<P>
One way to measure Hall is in how many steps it takes him to crank up to full 
speed. You don't have to count very high. 
</P>
<P>
"He's at full speed in one step," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's favorite player is Jim Brown. O.J.? Stands for Orthro James. 
</P>
<P>
"I look up to O.J." Ross said. " He's an elusive back. I've seen him slip so 
many tackles, it boggles me. And he hits the hole so fast. He bugs me because I 
can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
That's not what Parrick remembers from last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (Ross) being bottled up and thinking we're going to stop him, and 
20 yards later, he was still going," Parrick said. "He went into holes 
extremely quick." 
</P>
<P>
Ross is the type of running back who dishes out as much as he takes. He lowers 
his shoulder and delivers as many punishing hits as he gets. 
</P>
<P>
"And he has the ability to go sideways as fast as forward," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' 77-yard touchdown run in the playoff opener against Patrick Henry two 
weeks ago is what stands out most for Hall this season. It came toward the end 
of the first half and brought RBV to within four, 21-17. RBV ended up winning, 
51-27. 
</P>
<P>
"It was spectacular -- probably one of the best runs I've seen all season," 
Hall said. "He broke a couple of tackles, and sheer determination got him to 
the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Ross gained 1,341 yards despite playing only nine games -- he was suspended for 
disciplinary reasons for the season finale. But Bell said what stands out in 
his mind most about Ross is that he hasn't let his accomplishments during his 
junior season go to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the same today as when the season started," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
While Hall and Ross have had more than their share of success, Lewis has been 
quietly blocking in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really mind as long as it helps the team, " Lewis said. "It feels as 
good to make a block that springs somebody as it does to run myself." 
</P>
<P>
On most teams, Lewis would probably be a star. He has gained 350 yards in 37 
carries -- a 9.4-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets the least amount of credit but contributes just as much," Bell said. 
"He's a tremendous blocker. He knows the team is better off with him blocking. 
For a lot of people, there would be sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts is another guy who quietly labors in the RBV backfield. The running 
attack is good enough that the Longhorns rarely pass; they went two games 
without throwing one. But that doesn't mean that Roberts can't pass. He has 
completed 22 of 30 for 703 yards -- 32 yards per completion. 
</P>
<P>
But in this offense, his leadership abilities are more important than his 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like having a coach out on the field," Bell said. "He has great 
leadership ability, tremendous poise, and he gets the job done. He's an 
excellent thrower and runner." 
</P>
<P>
This season may be even sweeter for Roberts than for his partners in the 
backfield because he sat out last season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, Ross, Lewis and Roberts are inseparable off the field as well as on. They 
are good friends, often hanging out at each other's houses on weekends and 
renting movies. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite this year is "I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka." That's the movie, not some 
kind of theme for the RBV offense.

RAMONA THOUGHT BIG AND REACHED SEMIFINALS 
</P>

<P>
Now that his team has reached the section 2-A football semifinals, Bill 
Tamburrino, Ramona High's offensive line coach, said it's probably safe to let 
everybody in on a little secret about his not-so-little offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
On paper and a scale, they average 6-feet-3, 236 pounds, but Tamburrino said 
scales can be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"From Day 1, all we kept putting in the paper was 'big' -- not many people knew 
that none of these kids, outside of (right tackle) Brandon Dipietro, even 
played football last year." 
</P>
<P>
Or wanted to play this year. Ramona Coach Mel Galli said that of the five 
offensive lineman, Dipietro may have been the only one with an aggressive bone 
in his body. 
</P>
<P>
"It was against their nature to work hard and to be aggressive," Galli said. 
"It seems like all the big guys work to get along with people their whole 
lives, and now they have to change personalities on the football field. It 
takes time to bring these kids out of their shells." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Ramona football team, Tamburrino took the time -- even 
though he admits that patience is not his best quality. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to learn what patience is all about this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also had to learn what coaching an offensive line was all about. Tamburrino, 
Ramona'a head coach in 1986 and '87, had worked with receivers or other 
skill-position players until this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them at the beginning of the year that playing the offensive line is 
the most boring thing in the world," Tamburrino said. "I said the wide 
receivers get all the glory, but we get to beat on people all game. All the 
ballet types cheer for the receivers, but the blue-collar guys -- the guys that 
work for a living -- cheer for us." 
</P>
<P>
Tamburrino's motivational speeches have not only translated into huge holes for 
running backs Sarn Salmon, Frank Thomas and Tom Smith -- who combined for about 
2,000 yards this season -- and victories for Ramona's once dormant football 
program. They have given Jason Emerick, Adam Klukowski, Mike Murray, Bobby 
Valentyne and Dipietro some self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
But if not for Galli's fondness for large people, the five would have never 
been given an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"We've encouraged these guys and cultivated them," Galli said. "We've brought 
in a system where they feel like they can succeed. A big kid can do a lot of 
things a little guy can't. You can't see around them, and it takes longer to 
get around them." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-6, 260 pounds, Klukowski may be the biggest obstacle. But he also may have 
benefited the most from the system of Galli and Tamburrino. 
</P>
<P>
"Adam has got to be the nicest 260-pound kid you'd want to meet," Tamburrino 
said. "But Adam did not have very good grades. Now he's passed the SAT, and 
he's got a good chance to get a college scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Klukowski said San Diego State, San Jose State and the University of Texas El 
Paso have shown an interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even going to play this year," Klukowski said. "But I started getting 
a few letters, and I went to a lineman's camp. I wasn't a very physical person, 
but I've matured a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Dipietro said Murray, a 6-2, 245-pound junior center, may have been the meekest 
of the bunch. But that is changing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a real nice guy," Dipietro said. "But last week (a 20-6 quarterfinal 
victory over Mission Bay), he surprised everybody when he almost got in a 
fight. He's not backing down anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Valentyne, a 5-11, 190-pound guard, began the year as a nose guard, but an 
injury forced him to switch positions. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to play nose guard so bad, I had to beg him to play offensive line," 
Tamburrino said. "But after the first game, he loved it. Now, he said he'll 
never go back. He's like a kamikaze pilot out there." 
</P>
<P>
Tamburrino said Dipietro (6-2, 230), a first-team All-Avocado League selection 
this year, is probably the most talented, and also the strangest. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the season, Dipietro had an appendectomy, and he came back before 
the injury had healed. Later, he collapsed on the field because of a 
combination of exhaustion and asthma. When Tamburrino called an ambulance, 
Dipietro told him never to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
A renowned slob, it was only a couple weeks ago that Dipietro's jersey was 
washed for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to go the whole year without washing his jersey, but we wouldn't let 
him," Tamburrino said. 
</P>
<P>
Galli said Emerick, a 6-6, 255-pound junior guard, probably played his best 
game of the season in the victory over Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt Jason had an all-league type game," Galli said. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, Galli said, everybody played like an all-leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some unbelievable line surges," he said. "When you look at the films, 
you'd see (Mission Bay) guys five and six yards down the field." 
</P>
<P>
And to think that looking at films used to be the most dreaded part of the 
linemen's week. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be just a rip session," Klukowski said. "Now it's fun to see how 
much we've improved each week." 
</P>
<P>
With 5 being the top grade on Tamburrino's scale, Ramona linemen are now 
scoring 3s and 4s instead of 0s and 1s. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids used to be the butt of all jokes, now we kick butts for fun," 
Tamburrino said. "These kids have taken some pride in themselves. They have 
learned a complicated system, and they've done something good. Their whole 
self-image has improved, and with it, Ramona's football team has improved." 
</P>
<P>
Has it ever. 
</P>
<P>
Until this season, Ramona had never made the 2-A playoffs. From 1974-1988, the 
Bulldogs suffered through four winless seasons and had only one winning season, 
6-4 in '88. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Bulldogs are 8-4 and one victory away from playing for the 
section title at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. To get there, Ramona must beat 
an El Camino team it lost to, 23-0, in the fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
Dipietro said Saturday night's game at Mira Mesa High will be different. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all intimidated a little," he said. "El Camino was the first good team 
we'd played, and we weren't sure of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Now, they are so sure of themselves that they have a name -- "The PITBULLS." 
</P>
<P>
It's an acronym for something, although Tamburrino can't really explain what it 
is. The second-team lineman have joined the name game and are calling 
themselves "The Rejects." 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a counter-culture," Tamburrino said. "Since they can't grade 
themselves on the field, they count how many times they run up and down the 
sidelines during a game. They also repeat names the coaches have called them 
through out the year." 
</P>
<P>
Some of The Rejects may eventually start next year, although Tamburrino said 
they will certainly be pushed by a couple players on the junior varsity line. 
That includes a 295-pounder and a 305-pounder and is actually bigger on 
average, at 6-2, 240, than the varsity. (By way of comparison, this year's line 
at the University of San Diego averaged 6-1, 237). 
</P>
<P>
Since the playoffs have begun, the junior varsity line has joined the varsity 
practices. Tamburrino said they look and sound very similar to another group. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them are whining and crying about being overworked," Tamburrino said. 
"I said to the varsity: 'Hey guys, do they remind you of anybody?' " 
</P>

COMPUTER FILE: HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT WILL MAKE A HACKER HAPPY

analyst and writer.

<P>
I got a fax from Santa asking me to recommend gifts for computer users. I 
suggested that he concentrate on accessories, games and reading material. It's 
generally a bad idea to give expensive hardware or complicated business 
software unless you know exactly what someone wants. 
</P>
<P>
Before Santa does give software, he sends an elf to check out the equipment to 
be sure everything is compatible. The elf makes a list (and checks it twice) of 
all the equipment, including the disk drive (3 1/2- or 5 1/4-inch) and monitor. 
</P>
<P>
As for what you can give your computer-user friends, I'll start with 
accessories. A lot of people can use a "power strip" that allows them to plug 
their PC, printer and other electrical devices into a single outlet. You can 
get an inexpensive six-outlet power strip with an on-off switch at just about 
any hardware store. Radio Shack and most computer dealers carry power strips 
with built-in surge protectors. A surge protector filters out electrical 
surges, or spikes, which could damage your computer. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to check your local office supply store. That's where I found 
several varieties of diskette holders (make sure you know whether to buy the 3 
1/2- or 5 1/4-inch size) as well as colored disks and lots of other gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
I also saw a number of useful accessories from Curtis Manufacturing. I liked 
the Computer Tool Kit ($29.95), which comes with a variety of demagnetized 
screw and nut drivers and a device to remove chips from computers. Other useful 
Curtis products include a tilt-and-swivel monitor stand, a universal printer 
stand to elevate your printer ($24.95) and a $6.95 clip that attaches to your 
monitor and holds your papers. The company is at 30 Fitzgerald Drive, Jaffrey, 
N.H. 03452. 
</P>
<P>
I like giving and receiving books. If you're buying a gift for a Macintosh 
user, consider "The Macintosh Bible," edited by Arthur Naiman (Goldstein &amp; 
Blair, $28). It's an indispensable tool for those who want to get the most from 
their Macs. It comes with a coupon for two free updates. If you can't find it 
at a bookstore, you can order by phone (add $4 for shipping) at (415) 524-4000.

For the IBM PC user, consider "PC Magazine DOS Power Tools" by Paul Somerson 
(Bantam Computer Books, $44.95). This 1,275-page colossus contains tips and 
ideas, many compiled from the pages of PC Magazine. It comes with a disk full 
of programs to help streamline your use of the PC.

As much as I hate to spoil the spirit of Christmas, it does come right before 
tax season. So you might think about tax-preparation and financial 
record-keeping programs. TurboTax ($75) from San Diego-based ChipSoft is the 
leading tax program for the IBM PC, while MacInTax ($99) from Softview of 
Oxnard dominates the Macintosh market. 
</P>
<P>
For budgeting and financial record keeping I recommend Quicken ($59.95), which 
runs on the PC, Macintosh and Apple II. Check your retailer for a special 
Christmas "bundle" that includes the IBM version of Quicken, Turbo Tax and a 
stock portfolio management program for $99.95. Macintosh Quicken, bundled with 
MacInTax, costs $109.

I don't know a lot about computer games, so I sought the advice of Peter Spear, 
author of a recently published book called "King's Quest Companion" 
(Osborne/McGraw Hill, $14.95). The delightfully literate 360-page book 
creatively provides tips to players of that popular game series from Sierra 
On-Line. 
</P>
<P>
For science fiction fans, Spear recommends Neuromancer, an animated adventure 
game from Costa Mesa-based Interplay. There are versions for just about any 
type of computer at prices ranging from $29 to $49. Interplay can be reached at 
(714) 549-2411.

If you're inclined to run for mayor, why not practice on a simulator? Sim City 
lets you create and run a modern city and solve problems related to taxes, 
crime, disasters and monsters. It's available for the Mac, IBM PC, Amiga and 
Commodore 64. List price is $49.95 for all versions except Commodore, which 
sells for $29.95. A color version for the Mac II sells for $79.95. It's 
published by Maxis Software of Moraga at (415) 376-6434.

If your friend is an Indiana Jones fan, you might consider giving Indiana Jones 
and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure from the games division of 
LucasFilm at (415) 662-1902. It costs $49.95 and runs on IBM compatibles, Amiga 
and Atari ST computers. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure Suit Larry 3 ($59.95) is the newest addition to the series about a 
"lovable nerd and world-class lounge lizard." When the game opens, you play the 
recently divorced Larry "out for pure carnal pleasure." Somewhere in the middle 
you switch roles and become "passionate Patti." I'll leave the rest of the plot 
up to your imagination. Don't ask me why, but the series is quite popular, even 
among reasonably intelligent adults. It's published by Sierra On-Line and is 
only for IBM compatibles. 
</P>
<P>
Other versions are also available for the Mac, Atari ST, Amiga and Apple IIGS. 
Sierra can be reached at (800) 326-6654.

Personal computers offer a safe alternative for those among us who enjoy 
barnstorming or strafing villages. A host of flight simulation programs make it 
possible to take the controls of everything from an early biplane to a modern 
jet fighter. You can even fly an alien spacecraft by purchasing UFO ($49.95) 
from SubLogic of Champaign, Ill., reachable at (800) 637-4983. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Flight Simulator 4.0 is one of the few flight games for people 
interested in noncombat planes. Version 4.0 ($59.95) lets you fly a broad 
variety of planes and even lets you create your own experimental aircraft. The 
program runs only on IBM compatibles, but users of a Mac, Apple IIGS, Amiga or 
Atari ST can take advantage of SubLogic's Flight Simulator program. 
</P>
<P>
F-19 Stealth Fighter from MicroProse is Computer Gaming World magazine's 
top-rated game. It allows you to conduct combat missions in the Mediterranean, 
Middle East and Europe. The product runs only on the IBM PC and compatibles 
($69.95) and the Commodore 64 ($44.95). MicroProse can be reached at (301) 
771-1151. 
</P>
<P>
For a more realistic flight experience, consider getting your own "yoke" to 
control the plane. The Maxx Yoke, which works with IBM and compatibles, lets 
you steer your aircraft into 60-degree turns and even has its own thumb 
controls to invoke your simulated guns. It can be ordered from the Tailwinds 
Catalogue for $99.95 plus shipping. For some PCs, you will need to buy a game 
port (available from Tailwinds for $49.95). Call them at (800) 992-7737. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for more game ideas, check out a copy of Computer Gaming 
World magazine at most major bookstores. A 1-year, 12-issue subscription costs 
$24 and can be ordered by calling (800) 827-4450.

Finally, there is one product that you don't even need a computer to enjoy. The 
Chocolate Software Co. offers a full line of "eat-ware" that includes chocolate 
diskettes and keyboards in a variety of configurations. The diskettes, whose 
capacity is measured in calories rather than kilobytes, are bug free but loaded 
with sugar. Call them at (213) 931-1527. Outside of California, dial (800) 
332-BYTE.

<P>
Interest rate jitters and profit taking continued to pressure the stock market 
Wednesday, pushing prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 13.23 points to 2,688.78. 
</P>
<P>
Losing issues outpaced gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 892 issues down, 595 up and 484 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Trading activity was generally sluggish throughout the session. Big Board 
volume totaled 147.27 million shares, down from 153.77 million in Tuesday's 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks took the biggest hit, reflecting disappointment over the recent 
mixed signals by the Federal Reserve as well as the decision by Southwest Bank 
of St. Louis to raise its prime rate back to 10.5%. The small Midwestern bank, 
which often leads prime rate moves by bigger banks, had cut the rate to 10% 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly doesn't bode well for the short term," said Jack Baker, head of 
block trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed confused the financial markets by first letting key short-term interest 
rates fall last week, which led analysts to conclude that the central bank was 
easing credit to stimulate the economy. But Monday, the Fed sent a strong 
signal that it wasn't easing credit. Stock prices nonetheless had advanced in 
the two sessions before Wednesday's fall. 
</P>
<P>
The market came under pressure at the opening bell Wednesday from profit takers 
eager to cash in on the recent gains. A handful of blue chip issues led a 
narrow rally by midday, but the broader market did not follow, and the gains 
were quickly erased. 
</P>
<P>
Two separate reports that showed an upward revision in the gross national 
product and lower corporate profits in the third quarter were generally 
overlooked by investors. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Great Western Financial fell 1 1/8 to 
18 1/8, reflecting the news that it expects to report a fourth-quarter loss due 
to difficulties with its commercial real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica lost 1 1/4 to 27 5/8, Chemical Bank slipped 1/2 to 32 1/8, and Penn 
Central dropped 1/8 to 25 5/8. Exxon declined 7/8 to 47, American Express slid 
1/8 to 35 1/4, and UAL lost 5 1/2 to 160. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, Chevron rose 5/8 to 68 3/8, Philip Morris gained 3/8 to 41 
7/8, and Union Carbide advanced 1/4 to 24 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index, setting a record high for the 
sixth-consecutive trading day, closed above 37,000 for the first time 
Wednesday. The 225-share Nikkei index gained 36.16 points to close at 
37,021.46. The index closed above 36,000 for the first time on Nov. 21, when it 
ended at 36,059.87. 
</P>
<P>
Prices also finished generally higher in thin trading on London's Stock 
Exchange with few substantive developments to affect the overall market. At the 
close, the Financial Times 100-stock index had gained 13.6 points to 2,255.6.

Bond Prices Drop Amid Interest Jitters 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices also gave ground amid pessimism about the possibility that interest 
rates will fall any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 9/32 point, or $2.50 for every 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, increased to 
7.93% from 7.90% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the bond market's decline reflected signs of stability in the 
government's latest report on economic activity in the July through September 
period. They said the Federal Reserve won't likely push interest rates lower 
until it sees evidence of further weakening in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest charge on short-term loans between banks, 
was quoted at 8.675% late Wednesday, down from 9% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>

Dollar Mixed, Mark Grabs Spotlight 
</P>
<P>
The dollar turned in a mixed performance as the West German mark continued to 
dominate the foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar was relatively neutral" as most currency traders focused on the 
mark, said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The mark fell amid profit taking in response to a surge since East Germany 
opened the Berlin Wall Nov. 9. The opening of the wall raised expectations that 
West German industry would benefit from the relaxation of East-West tensions. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's upward revision of the gross national product to a 
2.7% annual rate in the third quarter gave the dollar some support but tended 
more to prompt selling of the mark, Holzer said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against the West German currency in New York, rising to 
1.7875 marks from 1.7770 late Tuesday. In earlier Frankfurt trading, the dollar 
closed at 1.7825 marks, down from 1.7880. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound edged up to $1.5678 in New York from $1.5670 late Tuesday, 
and sterling also rose earlier in London, closing at $1.5655, compared to late 
Tuesday's $1.5625. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.12 Japanese yen to a closing 143.53 yen. Later, in 
London, it fell further to 143.15 yen and in New York, it was quoted at 142.855 
yen, down from 143.20.

Gold Futures Prices Continue to Slide 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange, steepening a slide 
that represents either a temporary setback in a bull market or gold's retreat 
from its highest point in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the verdict is still out on that one," said John Jonat, a trader with 
Deak International Inc., a New York-based dealer of precious metals and foreign 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets Wednesday, pork belly futures fell the limit for the second 
straight day; energy futures advanced, and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $3.90 to $4 lower on the Comex, with the contract for 
delivery in December down $4 at $409.50 an ounce. Silver fell 9.5 to 9.7 cents, 
with December settling at $5.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
The December gold contract has dropped more than $10 since Friday, when it 
peaked at $419.70. 
</P>
<P>
Jonat said he was surprised gold fell so sharply after Tuesday's very slight 
loss, which he had taken as a sign that a wave of profit taking had passed. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Platt, a metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, said 
the dollar's gains following its recent slide probably contributed to 
Wednesday's decline in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Don Tierney of Stanley Bell &amp; Co., a New York-based futures 
brokerage, blamed the decline on selling ahead of the first notice day for the 
December gold contract. 
</P>
<P>
Pork belly futures prices slammed down the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit for the 
second straight day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after the government 
announced that it had accepted bids for 920,000 pounds of pork bellies to be 
shipped to Poland as part of a food aid package. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows last week's announcement of a 280,000-pound government 
purchase, bringing to 1.2 million pounds the amount of bellies the government 
has bought to ship to Poland.

BUYERS OF SALVAGED CARS GIVEN CHANCE TO RECOUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of 753 "potentially dangerous" salvaged used cars sold by the Hertz 
car-rental firm can either get their money back or have their autos inspected 
and fixed free, the San Diego County district attorney's office announced 
Wednesday in settling a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
All 753 cars are Hertz Corp. rentals that had been in crashes, then sold from 
1984 to 1987 through a Chula Vista auto auctioneer without the document that 
would alert buyers that the cars had been in serious collisions, Dist. Atty. 
Edwin L. Miller Jr. said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement of the suit filed by the district attorney's office 
against Hertz and the Chula Vista-based County Auto Pool, Hertz agreed to buy 
back or to inspect and repair the cars, Miller said. The pact could yield as 
much as $2 million in benefits for the 753 owners, Miller said, calling the 
case the "largest consumer-protection settlement" ever produced by his office. 
</P>
<P>
Hertz executives and the company's San Diego lawyers, however, said the agency 
figured the program would cost a maximum of $1 million and insisted that none 
of the cars were, or are, unsafe. And one of the lawyers, Robert G. Steiner, 
called the settlement "discriminatory enforcement, not consumer protection." 
</P>
<P>
As many as 60 other private firms and government agencies followed the same 
resale procedure Hertz did, but only Hertz was sued, Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hertz believed it was "free from fault or illegality," it agreed to 
settle the case "as a safety matter" and to show it is a "very responsible 
company," Steiner said. Besides, though the settlement also included the 
payment of civil penalties and fees -- $285,000 by Hertz and $50,000 by County 
Auto Pool, or $335,000 -- to the district attorney's office and to the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, it was still more economical than years of 
litigation, Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Hertz sold wrecked cars from its California fleet 
through County Auto Pool, unlawfully passing along with each a certificate of 
title -- the familiar DMV "pink sheet" -- that provided no clue that the cars 
were salvage vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
California law says a car that has been so banged up in a crash that the owner 
finds it uneconomical to repair must be sold not with the "pink sheet" but with 
a "salvage certificate," which lets buyers know they are buying a damaged car, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Clifford P. Dobrin said. 
</P>
<P>
The cars suffered "frame damage, brake damage, steering damage -- that sort of 
thing," a DMV investigator, John Acuna, said at the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,040 Hertz cars that should have had salvage certificates were sold 
through County Auto Pool from July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987, the suit 
said. Of those, 753 still do not have the salvage certificate, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Hertz contended that the law originally required only insurance companies to 
obtain salvage certificates before sale. The law has been amended several 
times, but, until 1987, it was unclear whether private and fleet owners also 
had to obtain salvage certificates, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Because the law was fuzzy, Hertz did not believe the cars it sold through 
County Auto Pool during those three years fit the definition of salvage 
vehicles, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the law was changed in 1987 to specify that fleet owners must apply for 
salvage certificates, all damaged Hertz vehicles have been sold with that 
document, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
There is "no indication" that autos Hertz sold through its own used car lots 
from 1984 through 1987 were in any way defective or that any cars other than 
Hertz autos sold then through County Auto Pool were lacking the correct 
documents, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Miller repeatedly said at the press conference and in a statement 
distributed to reporters that the 753 remaining cars could be unsafe, he 
conceded that his office has "no evidence of injury" to drivers or passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Hertz lawyer Steiner adamantly denied that any of the cars were dangerous. 
"There are no reports of unsafe cars on the road arising from these sales," 
Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the 753 cars will be receiving a letter from Hertz in the next 60 
days outlining the repair or buy-back plan, Miller said.

<P>
HOUSING: 'STICKER SHOCK' ON NEW-HOME PRICES TURNS ATTENTION OF SHOPPERS BACK TO 
CONDOS, THE PRICES OF WHICH ARE STARTING TO RISE. 
</P>

<P>
With fewer home buyers able to afford to pay the high prices of new San Diego 
County houses, budget-conscious buyers are increasingly turning their attention 
to the condominium market. 
</P>
<P>
According to recent market data, San Diego County condominiums are posting 
healthy price rises this year. Year-to-year unit sales are down, but observers 
blame that on diminished inventory. 
</P>
<P>
The condo market is benefitting from "sticker shock" experienced by new San 
Diego residents after seeing the county's steep housing prices, industry 
observers say. Interest shown by the "move-up condominium buyer" is also 
contributing to the condo price increase. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beginning to see a new breed of home buyers," said Gerald T. LaFlamme, 
managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a public accounting firm that 
closely monitors the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
"About three years ago, somebody may have bought a condominium for $80,000 to 
$100,000 with plans to eventually buy a single-family, detached home," LaFlamme 
said. "But, as (the buyer) looks around now, he's finding himself priced out of 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, instead of buying a new home, the buyer is purchasing bigger and 
better condominiums," LaFlamme said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted by Market Profiles, a San Diego-based 
research firm that tracks subdivision sales, the average price of attached 
housing, including town homes and condominiums, during the three months ended 
Sept. 30 was $170,553; up 18% from the $144,562 average price posted during the 
same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of new units sold during the third quarter of 1989 dropped 
to 816 from last year's 1,381, the units sold figured as a percentage of 
available inventory has steadily increased in recent years, said Russell T. 
Valone, president of Market Profiles. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of available units sold through the third quarter of 1989 was 
66%; up from 58% in 1988 and the 47% recorded in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Valone says family-oriented condominiums, rather than smaller apartment style 
units, should fare well in the coming years because it will be a less costly 
alternative to pricey, single-family detached homes. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Krivoshia, a Meyers Group consultant said: "New homes prices are 
leveling off, but I don't think they're going to go down. That's why, at 
$150,000, condos are still a good deal. You can't buy any kind of home for that 
price." 
</P>
<P>
During the three months ended Sept. 30, the median price of a new condominium 
was $153,950, up 29% from $118,900 during the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The condominium is becoming the only choice for a larger and larger 
cross-section of the home-buying public," said LaFlamme of Kenneth Leventhal. 
"Condominiums are coming back into vogue again. 
</P>
<P>
"They lost their appeal back in the 1960s," LaFlamme said "It was new product 
at the time and single-family homes could still be bought at a reasonable 
price. In the 1970s, we had the inflation problem that made compact housing 
more of a necessity. If you remember, apartments were rapidly converted into 
condominiums. That created a oversupply, and prices came down. (Condominium 
prices) have been relatively flat ever since, but now they're starting to 
increase again." 
</P>
<P>
Resale prices of condominiums are going up, too, LaFlamme said, though at a 
slower rate than those of single-family dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing July median resale prices of the last three years, LaFlamme said the 
prices have increased from $100,600 to $112,500 to $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
LaFlamme added: "Just between June and July of this year, the median resale 
price of condominiums went up from $115,000 to $120,000." 
</P>
<P>
Lack of available land and growth control measures should prevent overbuilding 
and a drop in condominium prices, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the better condominium markets in the United States," said Sanford 
Goodkin, executive director of Pete Marwick Main &amp; Co./Goodkin Real Estate 
Consulting Group. "With land prices continuing to inflate, there will be more 
condominiums. They have become a legitimate product in the marketplace."

* Reagan raking: Ready for yet another Reagan Administration insider book? In 
her upcoming "What I Saw at the Revolution," excerpted in Mirabella magazine, 
former Presidential speech writer Peggy Noonan says Nancy Reagan, by and large, 
disliked people who believed in ideas, because she thought that meant they were 
disloyal to her husband. Although Noonan calls Ronald Reagan one of the great 
men of our time, she also thought of him as a gigantic, heroic balloon floating 
in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The White House, she says, was "like a 
beautiful clock that keeps time and makes all the right sounds, but when you 
open it up there's nothing inside." 
</P>
<P>
* Strange cats: Saudi Prince Mohammed al-Fassi has returned to Florida with the 
goal of plucking unwanted cats from animal shelters and giving them a sultan's 
home. "I have strict orders from His Royal Highness to put aside $2.5 million 
for cats," said Victor Talaat, the sheik's personal adviser. "We are going to 
send Asians through the United States to hunt the cats . . . but they have to 
be Muslims; they have to have good hearts." The cats, he said, will have a 
private veterinarian, nurses and a nine-member staff to feed and bathe them. 
</P>
<P>
* Homeward-bound: Former U. S. Sen. Barry Goldwater said he felt fine Wednesday 
after being released from a Phoenix hospital where he underwent hip-replacement 
surgery earlier this month. "If I don't run out of parts, I'll probably be here 
the rest of my life," said Goldwater, 80, referring to St. Luke's Medical 
Center, where he has had several major reconstructive surgeries. Orthopedic 
surgeon Anthony K. Hedley said Goldwater would receive therapy at his home and 
probably would be walking with a cane by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
* Royal catch: The Octagon Museum in Washington snared a real headliner to kick 
off its exhibit on "Sir Christopher Wren and the Legacy of St. Paul's 
Cathedral." Great Britain's most outspoken architectural critic -- Prince 
Charles -- will open the show at a private reception Feb. 22.

The Scene: A kickoff party for Fred Hayman's new cologne for men, 273. For 
those who think that real men don't wear fragrance, Hayman held the affair in 
the testosterone-soaked atmosphere of Gold's Gym in Venice. Quite a sight to 
see Beverly Hills business types mingling and cheek-kissing among weight 
lifters whose biceps were as big as the average man's head. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Only men were invited, read the invitation, but the rules seemed 
to be waived -- if the woman in question was a world-class bodybuilder. There 
were lots of muscle men and muscle women inside, along with Gary Collins, Jack 
Carter, Casey Kasem, George Peppard, fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell, 
restaurateurs and chefs Jacques Camus, Patrick Terrail, and Jimmy Murphy. 
Everyone received a bottle of cologne on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Each guest was sent a mustard yellow 273 T-shirt and urged to "come 
as you are," which made for some interesting fashion combinations. Hayman 
himself accented his T-shirt with a bright yellow double-breasted blazer and 
gray sweat pants. Photographer Alan Berliner wore his T-shirt under a tuxedo 
jacket, while others sported everything from three-piece suits to leather 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: A fresh oyster bar kept guests shucking. Waiters circled the workout 
gear, bearing hamburgers, hot dogs, and pizza. At the bar, guests demonstrated 
their machismo by grabbing long neck Budweisers out of a silver bucket and 
drinking the beer out of the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Pastimes: Incoming guests were sprayed with cologne by men in Gold's Gym tank 
tops. Inside one could listen to a strolling mariachi band, or watch 
weightlifters go through their paces on serious workout machines that look like 
they were designed by the Marquis de Sade. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: Mr. Blackwell topped his T-shirt with a black coat that looked 
suspiciously like that favorite four-letter word of animal activists: Mink. 
(Was it or wasn't it? Only his furrier knew for sure.) 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Did all the XY chromosomes in the air mean that 273 was the most macho 
fragrance in Beverly Hills? Fred Hayman laughed. "It's one of the most macho," 
he said. "An elegant kind of macho. It's very secure here. An ordinary 
fragrance couldn't come to Gold's Gym, could it?" 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: In this day and age, when the launching of a new perfume is treated 
with the gravity one associates with the announcement of the Salk vaccine, it 
was refreshing to be at a party with such a sense of humor. Even Hayman got 
into the spirit of things, sitting in the back of his yellow and black 
Rolls-Royce as two muscle men hoisted up the back of the car with him inside. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: There was no club soda or designer water at the bar, proving that it 
is possible to be too macho. KEVIN ALLMAN

YOUR STAMPS: VALUE FLYING HIGH ON INVERTED-PLANE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE, Krause is a free-lance writer and member of several national 
stamp-collecting organizations. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What is the famous air mail invert worth? -- J.C. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I assume you are referring to the 24-cent U.S. air mail stamp of 1918 
(Scott number C3a) with the airplane inverted in the center of the design. 
Current catalogue value is $115,000 for a mint copy, and all known specimens 
have never been canceled. A pane (sheet) of 100 of these stamps was purchased 
by William T. Robey when they were issued, and later these were sold for 
ever-increasing prices to wealthy collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Although the stamp is rare and has a lot of romantic demand pushing its market 
value up, some copies come on the auction block every year, fetching prices 
from $50,000 up, depending on the condition of the stamp. 
</P>
<P>
You might be interested to know that this stamp has been faked by clever 
forgers who cut out the airplane engraving from a genuine copy of the normal 
"right-side-up" version of this error, then pasted it carefully onto the center 
of a shaved-down stamp of this issue. Watermark and ultraviolet analysis would 
indicate this fake immediately, but novice collectors could be fooled for a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any expensive stamp should be guaranteed by the seller, and maybe 
come accompanied by expertizing certificates to assure its authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My post-card collection of old Los Angeles views goes back to about 1910. 
There are about 700 cards with their original 1-cent stamps on them. Are these 
worth anything? -- M.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably not much. Pre-1910 post cards are more in demand. Even 75 years ago 
many picture post cards were being printed and sold to tourists and post card 
collectors in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Q: While stationed overseas in 1974, I purchased a stamp in Thailand. The stamp 
has not been circulated and is misprinted with the denomination "2 Bath" 
instead of "2 Baht." Is there any value to it? If so, where would I find a 
buyer?D.D. 
</P>
<P>
A: You have Scott catalogue No. 704 from Thailand, the "2 Bath" error stamp, 
first issued Sep. 19, 1974. Its current catalogue value is 35 cents mint, 25 
cents used, so you can see that it is not of great value today. Not all stamp 
errors are valuable, and yours is a good example of this. The invisible law of 
supply and demand rules the stamp market, and the supply of the "2 Bath" Thai 
error is quite sufficient to satisfy collector demand the world over, hence its 
low catalogue value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do U.S. air mails look now for investment purposes? I understand that 
they have a good track record in constant price appreciation. -- K.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: In the opinion of most stamp-market experts, many elusive U.S. stamps are 
currently underpriced and are set to move up gradually in value over the next 
decade. And I must emphasize long-term investment rather than short-term (say, 
one year) speculation for the best prospects of profits. For example, there are 
Scott catalogue No. C18 at about $100 mint for a choice copy, and No. C13-15 
(the expensive Zeppelins) at around $2,000 to $3,000 retail for the set. 
Interest on bank accounts is guaranteed, though, so buy stamps with extra funds 
for hoped-for profits.

Q: What is the value of a plane out of position on U.S. Scott No. C11, the 
5-cent Beacon air mail issue of 1928? I have one copy with the plane about 
midway between the beacon and the "AIR" panel. My other copy shows the plane 
slightly overlapping the word "AIR." Is this a common error? -- K.E.O. 
</P>
<P>
A: Number C11 was printed in two colors, carmine red and blue. The center 
vignette and outside framework of the design are sometimes found to be 
misregistered, but of no special extra premium value, in my opinion. 
</P>
<P>
When you consider the press run of C11, more than 100 million copies, then it 
seems logical that plenty of them are "off-center" and, therefore, of no 
particular error value. As you may know, some air mail philatelists specialize 
in collecting this stamp on covers of the time period when it was current, and 
they may be interested in obtaining printing varieties of it. But they 
shouldn't have any trouble finding them, because the stamp isn't rare today. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where do you begin to look for rare stamps? It seems like all I can find are 
cheap ones. How are those rarities discovered, the stamps that you hear about 
being found in somebody's attic or garage and later auctioned off for thousands 
of dollars? -- F.McG. 
</P>
<P>
A: First of all, rare stamps are hard to find. Most of the fabulous discoveries 
that you read about or heard about from other collectors were found by chance. 
</P>
<P>
Old correspondence, family scrap books, chests and drawers of mementos, old 
business files, and even antique cabinets and desks have all yielded their 
share of choice stamps. 
</P>
<P>
Modern errors are occasionally noticed by alert collectors at the post office 
and are purchased over the counter at face value. It is nice to dream, but 
don't expect to discover rare stamps on your own. A better way is to save up 
your money until you can buy them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: While traveling through Sweden in the late 1960s, I picked up a quantity of 
souvenir sheets with stamps showing paintings by Ivan Agueli. What are these 
things worth today, and are they scarce items? -- T.D. 
</P>
<P>
A: Issued June 6, 1969, this souvenir sheet is listed at $2.75 mint, $5 
canceled. This is an example of stamps that are worth more used than unused. Of 
course, the cancel should be genuine and of the time period when the stamps 
were issued, to justify the hefty discrepancy between cheaper mint and more 
expensive canceled prices.

HUMAN BINGO PLAYERS WIN TOLERANCE FOR OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

They lined up in the cool fall evening, out the door, down the walk, past the 
Mercedes and the Jaguar pulled up to the driveway, and out into the parking lot 
of the Arcadia Masonic Temple. 
</P>
<P>
The line moved slowly, but it wasn't too cold on a recent evening. A 
horn-and-drum serenade from the high school band practice wafted across Duarte 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
Bee Hsu and Shirley Chan chatted about the price of turkey. They greeted Dana 
Junior High School Principal Joe Fox and his wife, Rosemary, and the 
conversation turned to Human Bingo. 
</P>
<P>
In Human Bingo, they explained, you fill your card by answering questions about 
the other people at a gathering. Each square poses a question about a person's 
background; the player must find a person likely to answer yes and get him or 
her to sign the square. 
</P>
<P>
Who understands or speaks a Chinese dialect? Who makes good German food? Who 
has studied in a school outside the United States? Who is a native of 
California? Who knows the names of 10 countries in Africa? 
</P>
<P>
Human Bingo is an icebreaker; its object is to get people who don't know one 
another and who come from very different cultures to talk with each other. 
</P>
<P>
At the third annual Intercultural Evening in Arcadia, it was working. As we 
moved forward in line toward the name-sticker desk, we could see excited people 
scribbling on the yellow Bingo sheets. No cocktails, no hors d'oeuvres, but 
more than 300 people were talking, many of them, clearly, to people they hadn't 
met before. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, thousands of Asian immigrants have moved to the San 
Gabriel Valley. Many of them live in Monterey Park, which is now more than half 
Asian and gets most of the press, nationally, as the country's first suburban 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
But with its students consistently among the top achievers in California 
Assessment Program scores, Arcadia has drawn a stream of professional, upper 
middle-class Asians, largely Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
If downtown Los Angeles and Monterey Park are the first stop for Asians moving 
to the United States, places like Hacienda Heights and Arcadia, an affluent 
community of just under 50,000, are where they go when they're ready to move 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Often, perhaps because of their insulation by miles and money, these second 
stops are less prepared to welcome new ingredients to the American melting pot. 
These intercultural evenings, a joint project of the Arcadia Unified School 
District and Chamber of Commerce, are an attempt to remedy that. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, dinner was Persian, Chinese and American, served cafeteria 
style. At a table in back, two very different couples, one middle-aged and 
Anglo, one young and Chinese, sat to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Marilyn Dootson live in Bradbury -- in the house, Richard Dootson 
volunteered, in which race car driver Mickey Thompson and his wife were killed. 
Richard Dootson has a real estate business in Arcadia. Xi and Shoping Wang are 
students in Pasadena who live with the Dootsons. The Dootsons call Xi Wang 
"Stanley," a name given him long ago by an English professor in China. Xi Wang 
is a doctoral candidate in robotics at Caltech; his wife takes English classes 
at Pasadena City College. They are from Harbin, in the far northeast corner of 
China, above North Korea. Xi Wang was 4, the youngest of four children in his 
family, when the Cultural Revolution came in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
His father, a college professor, his mother and his oldest brother were sent to 
the countryside to work in the fields. He and the other two children, the 
oldest 12, were left alone in their house. A friend of their mother's came to 
cook for them on weekends; they stored food for the week just by leaving it 
outside in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Xi Wang laughed when he described reaching outside to break pieces off a loaf 
when he was hungry. His father is dead now; his mother lives in Oregon and, 
after last summer's massacre in Beijing, he is unsure of his future. The Wangs 
and the Dootsons, an intercultural household, left early because Xi Wang had to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, in front of welcome banners in five languages, Dana teacher Sherry 
Root and students from Australia, Colombia and Malaysia talked about living in 
America. Later, Angi Ma Wong gave tips on cultural differences in body language 
and how it can be important in business. 
</P>
<P>
Do such experiments as this evening in Arcadia accomplish anything? 
</P>
<P>
Eloise Ward lives in Arcadia and works at a music store on South Baldwin 
Avenue. She was chairwoman of the first intercultural evening two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered to do it because I was afraid -- not afraid so much, but 
ignorant," Ward said. "I wasn't really happy about the changes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When things change dramatically, it's scary. People like to see things stay 
the same. . . . But once you spend time with someone who's different from you 
are, you find out basically at the core, we're all the same, and the 
differences, instead of being strange, become exciting and fascinating. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ongoing process. A lot of us are beginning to be able to be much more 
open."

SEASON'S GREETINGS, SAN DIEGO, FROM . . . ;

'Tis the season of "The Nutcracker," and San Diego County will harvest a good 
crop of them this year, despite the recent cancellation of San Francisco 
Ballet's lavish production. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're looking for less-traditional dance entertainment, you won't be 
disappointed, either. From Palomar College to the North Coast Ballet School, 
plenty of cheer has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"Nutcracker" fans can count on the usual assortment aof home-growns to replace 
the San Francisco production. On Dec. 8, both the California Ballet (the 
granddaddy of "The Nutcracker" crowd) and the American Ballet Ensemble 
(directed by former New York City ballerina Lynda Yourth) unveil their latest 
versions of the enduring Christmas classic. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 19th "Nutcracker" season for the California Ballet, and the San 
Diego-based troupe has its "Nutcracker" magic finely tuned. The only noticeable 
differences from last year's production are the perennial cast changes. 
</P>
<P>
Resident ballerina Denise Dabrowski will take her 10th turn as the dainty Sugar 
Plum Fairy. But Dabrowski is not be the only pink-tutued ballerina tagged for 
the role in this production of the old chestnut. No less than four Cal Ballet 
dancers will alternate as Sugar Plum during the troupe's Yuletide run. 
</P>
<P>
The latest contender to work her way up the ranks is Debra Rumney, a soloist 
scheduled to receive her big chance at the coveted role during the company's 
weekend stint at the East County Performing Arts Center (ECPAC). 
</P>
<P>
Joining the home team again will be two guest danseurs, Otto Neubert (soloist 
with the New York City Ballet) and Mark Lanham (who was sidelined by injuries 
when Cal Ballet danced its season-opener in September). The two will trade off 
as the Cavalier and Snow King both at ECPAC (Dec. 8-10) and again during the 
more ambitious staging at the Civic Theater (Dec. 15-24). 
</P>
<P>
"We have a pretty good stock of men this year . . ." said director Maxine 
Mahon. "We also have Steven Hook doing Snow King and one performance as the 
Cavalier. Denise Dabrowski insisted she wanted to do a Snow Queen (a role she 
hasn't danced in years), so she'll get her chance this time while one of the 
others is doing Sugar Plum." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Cal Ballet's "Nutcracker" will feature a full complement of company 
kids as well as the cadre of dancers who perform regularly with the troupe. The 
Civic Theater run -- always more elaborate and technically sophisticated than 
its ECPAC counterpart, which is a smaller facility -- will feature a live 
orchestra in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
The American Ballet Ensemble got the jump on the "Nutcracker" season during 
Thanksgiving weekend, with performances in Mexicali, Mexico. The production 
moves to the Centro Cultural de Tijuana on Dec. 1-2, before winding up at City 
College for its San Diego run Dec. 8-10, 15-17. 
</P>
<P>
Former Dutch National Ballet dancer Peter Schetters will dance the role of the 
Cavalier, but otherwise it's home-grown all the way for this "Nutcracker." 
Among the new features in this staging are some scenic accouterments to enhance 
the decor. 
</P>
<P>
"Our new grant ($26,000) really helped," said Yourth. "We got some new drops 
for the snow scene and a few other new things. Our dancers continue to mature 
and improve, so that's always changing. We have Christopher MacDougall, 16, 
doing the Cavalier (in some performances), and he's really coming along." 
</P>
<P>
New West Ballet Theatre will mount a "Nutcracker" at El Camino High School's 
Truax Performing Arts Center on Dec. 20-23. This staging of the Christmas 
classic features artistic director Eugenia Keefer (the reigning Sugar Plum in 
this 10-year-old North County-based production), and Paul Giovinazzo (her 
Cavalier for the past six years). James Francis, as Herr Drosselmeyer, is 
another 10-year veteran playing an active role in this incarnation of New 
West's Ballet School's "Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer a name-brand "Nutcracker," you can venture to the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa Dec. 13-17 for the Joffrey Ballet's lavish 
production. This version of the holiday bonbon, staged by the company's late 
director Robert Joffrey, is set in 19th-Century America, but it retains the 
fanciful spirit of the ever-popular fairy-tale ballet. 
</P>
<P>
The dance world's favorite Christmas confection is not the only holiday dance 
event on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar College will say Merry Christmas with a concert that features three 
different performing groups on the same program. The triptych includes a 
"Christmas Fantasy," choreographed by instructor Tom Hansen, and musical 
selections by the Palomar Community Orchestra and the Palomar Chorale. This 
festival of music and dance is slated for a three-performance run at Palomar 
College Theater on Dec. 15-17. 
</P>
<P>
The Palomar dance program presented a series of seasonal vignettes under the 
"Christmas Fantasy" umbrella in 1987, but, as Hansen explained, at least three 
of the pieces have been replaced with new choreography for this concert. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to keep everything light because I firmly believe Christmas is for 
children," said the former Vegas dance maker. "I'll be using familiar Christmas 
music, but I've also snuck in a jazzy number." 
</P>
<P>
The Palomar Community Orchestra, under the baton of Robert Gilson, will begin a 
concert with a musical interlude that includes Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker 
Suite." David Chase and his 90-voice Chorale will perform Bush's "Christmas 
Cantata," and the 35-member dance group (composed of students and community 
kids) will provide the lively finale." 
</P>
<P>
When the North Coast Ballet School took a step toward professional status by 
forming the Gilleen Ballet Ensemble recently, it decided to abandon its annual 
"Nutcracker" in favor of a full-scale production of "La Fille Mal Gardee." 
</P>
<P>
"Just about everybody does 'The Nutcracker,' " said director Kathleen Gillie. 
"We think people are tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
Gillie's unseasonal alternative is based on Sir Frederick Ashton's choreography 
for the 18th-Century classic. "La Fille" will be danced at La Jolla High 
School's Parker Auditorium on Dec. 16-17. 
</P>
<P>
Black Mountain Dance Center will celebrate the season with a student recital, 
titled "Holiday Potpourri of Dance," at Mt. Carmel High School Theater. The 
one-night stand, scheduled for a 7 p.m. curtain Dec. 21, will feature works by 
Misha Morawski, Lani Donohoe, Sylvia Palmer and other members of the school's 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
More happy holiday entertainment for the small-fry set is headed our way, 
compliments of the San Diego Civic Youth Ballet. A new dance work, dubbed "A 
Winter Fantasy," will showcase the youngsters of this Balboa Park-based school 
at the Casa del Prado on Dec. 10 at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed Del Mar Theatre Ensemble is geared to young audiences and 
their parents, but it uses adult performers to create the stage magic. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe's first Christmas offering will include a theatrical dance 
interpretation of "Peter and the Wolf" (narrated by local actress Ann 
Richardson) and other winter stories. A reading of Dr. Seuss' "How the Grinch 
Stole Christmas" is also in the holiday grab-bag running through Dec. 20 at the 
Del Mar Plaza. It opened Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The Yuletide season is traditionally a time for togetherness and family 
entertainment. The members of the San Diego dance community had that in mind 
when they conceived this cornucopia of holiday events.

Navajo Blanket Sold for $522,500: A 5-by-6-foot Navajo chief's blanket, 
possibly dating from the late 1700s, has been sold at auction in New York for 
$522,500, setting a world record for an American Indian artifact. The ivory 
wool blanket, striped in brown, indigo and red, was sold at Sotheby's to an 
unidentified American collector. The previous record for an Indian artifact was 
$115,500 paid for a classic Navajo man's blanket sold at Sotheby's in 1983. The 
sale also set an auction record for a piece of American-Indian ceramics when a 
1,000-year-old classic Mimbres black-on-white picture bowl was sold to a 
European collector for $82,500. A rare 1793 Indian Peace Medal engraved with 
the figures of George Washington and an Indian chief smoking a peace pipe was 
sold for $55,000. ALEENE MacMINN

Stolen Warhol Works Recovered: Amsterdam police said Wednesday that they have 
recovered stolen lithographs by the late U.S. pop artist Andy Warhol worth more 
than $1 million. The 81 works were stolen from a West German gallery near Bonn 
last September. Police arrested a 35-year-old Dutch dealer and two buyers 
Tuesday night after a tip-off that the dealer was selling some of the works in 
a local hotel. They recovered 14 lithographs. The other 67 Warhols were found 
in a house search. Police arrested two Britons and two Yugoslavs, seizing 
firearms and a large amount of cash. ALEENE MacMINN

IRS Seizes Redd Foxx's Home, 7 Cars: Comedian Redd Foxx, who starred in the TV 
series "Sanford &amp; Son," was left with only a bed in his house in Las Vegas 
after the Internal Revenue Service seized his home and seven of his vehicles 
for allegedly failing to pay income taxes from 1983 to 1986. The IRS said the 
seizures were made to pay $755,166.21 Foxx owed for taxes in 1983, 1984 and 
1986. It said Foxx had ignored four payment notices. Prince Spencer, Foxx's 
business manager, said IRS agents told the entertainer he could stay at the 
home until it was sold. Foxx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
1983, citing $1.6 million owed the IRS from taxes before 1983 and more than 
$800,000 owed other creditors. Spencer said Foxx had cut his latest tax bill by 
a few hundred thousand dollars, paying the IRS everything he has been making 
from shows at the Hacienda casino since August. Foxx said he would have asked 
his show-business friends for help had he known the Internal Revenue Service 
was going to raid his home and seize his property. ALEENE MacMINN

Modigliani Painting Sets Auction Record: A Japanese gallery has set a world 
auction record in sterling by purchasing a work by Italian artist Amedeo 
Modigliani for the equivalent of $7.89 million, Sotheby's said. The Fujii 
Gallery paid 5,060,000 in London for "Fillette au Tablier Noir," a painting of 
a girl in a black dress. The previous highest auction price for Modigliani was 
4.4 million in March, 1988, then the equivalent of $7.9 million against a 
stronger dollar. The sale of "Fillette au Tablier Noir" was part of an auction 
of Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture that together brought in 
$104 million. Twenty-two works, including ones by Claude Monet and Paul 
Gauguin, each fetched more than $1.56 million. ALEENE MacMINN

PLEA FOR ORGANIC FARMING IN 'A TOWN'S REVENGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Town's Revenge" combines a history lesson in McCarthyism with an argument 
for organic farming. It's an ambitious if unlikely attempt to illustrate the 
importance of standing up for one's belief. 
</P>
<P>
The "ABC Afterschool Special," written by Bruce Harmon, directed by Helen 
Whitney and airing at 3 p.m. today on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, focuses on a 
rural town in turmoil. Teen-aged Eric (Keith Coogan) is antagonizing local 
farmers with his desire to experiment with natural ways to keep crops free of 
bugs. The farmers, fearing financial losses, prefer their tried and true 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
They're further antagonized when Eric's elderly great aunt, Cecile (Elizabeth 
Franz), returns to town after 35 years to take over her deceased brother's farm 
and gives Eric a chance to put his experiment into action. 
</P>
<P>
Cecile has a double strike against her. She had been driven out of town after 
being targeted by the FBI as a Communist sympathizer during the McCarthy era. 
The town has neither forgiven nor forgotten her. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case in television's short dramas aimed at teens, the 
characters here are one dimensional. The farmers are bully boys, Eric is wise 
beyond his years, Cecile is a noble martyr and Eric's frightened father needs a 
lesson in bravery. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are effective moments. When Cecile tells Eric who Sen. Joe 
McCarthy was, the words have an "I was there" passion that almost transcend the 
proselytizing. LYNNE HEFFLEY

WINTER SALADS; 
</P>
<P>
RECIPES REINFORCE L. A.'S CROSS-CULTURAL APPROACH TO CUISINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GILLINGHAM, Gillingham is a Los Angeles-based food writer and stylist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think America is the melting pot of the world? Then Los Angeles must be its 
salad bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, Asians and Europeans, Easterners, Southerners and other Americans from 
every direction are tossed together into a show of colors that is reflected in 
the way we have learned to cook and eat. 
</P>
<P>
And as comfortable as we have become with crossing cultures in the kitchen, we 
as easily amalgamate our seasons. Between our climate and the availability of 
produce from all over the world, we are as able to eat red-ripe strawberries, 
golden peaches, peppers and potatoes of unimaginable colors and crisp green 
salads in January as we are in June. 
</P>
<P>
A few cross-cultural, multiseasonal salads in point are illustrated here. One 
mixes Japanese with French, in another Thai mingles with Mexican. A New York 
steak sandwich is turned into a salad with an Italian influence and Waldorf 
salad becomes well-traveled with the addition of smoked turkey, 
California-grown Asian pears and Roquefort cheese. Any of them would make a 
fine main dish for a simple holiday meal that will celebrate our complexion, 
climate and crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
STEAK SANDWICH SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1 pound New York or sirloin steak, cut 3/4- to 1-inch thick

</P>
<P>
Brush baguette slices with olive oil on both sides. Arrange in single layer on 
baking sheet. Toast in oven at 350 degrees 3 to 5 minutes per side or just 
until golden. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead and stored in paper bag.) 
</P>
<P>
When ready to assemble salads, carve steak into slices about 1/4-inch thick. On 
each of 4 dinner plates, arrange few arugula leaves, steak slices, 3 baguette 
slices, about 2 tablespoons Mustard Mayonnaise (reserve remaining mayonnaise 
for another use) and 1/4 of Onion Marmalade. Season steak to taste with salt 
and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
With vegetable peeler, shave off curls of Parmesan cheese and scatter over

EASY-TO-MAKE GIFTS THAT ARE STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART AND THE KITCHEN; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAYS: FOODS THAT FREEZE WELL OR DON'T REQUIRE REFRIGERATION MAKE THE SAFEST 
EDIBLE PRESENTS.

A flood of letters overwhelms The Times Food Section this time of year with 
requests for making ahead and mailing edible gifts to loved ones both near and 
far. There's something extra special about gifts of food -- they show 
thoughtfulness and are the perfect addition to a holiday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Foods that freeze well, such as quick breads and muffins, or those that require 
no refrigeration, such as cookies, candies, preserves, sauces and cakes travel 
and store best. They can be frozen or covered tightly and sealed, then 
decorated in festive wrappers that boast the colors of the season. Dress up 
packages with ribbons and holly leaves and include the recipe so the recipient 
can make them next year. 
</P>
<P>
Proper wrapping is essential to ensure the quality of the gift, regardless of 
the type of food that is stored. Without it, it is impossible to preserve color 
or flavor. After consulting several published sources on the subject, The Times 
was able to compile the following suggestions for freezing, storing and mailing 
edible gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a moisture / vapor-proof wrapping paper that is intended for freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When foil is used as a wrapper, heavy foil is preferred. Put foil-wrapped 
bundles in plastic bags for additional protection against punctures or holes in 
the freezer compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wax paper doesn't provide adequate protection and isn't recommended for 
freezing. But transparent plastic wrap, with its tremendous clinging quality 
that eliminates air pockets, is very pliable and an acceptable covering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure all containers are clean or sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't freeze cake batter, cream fillings, puddings and custards, mayonnaise 
or potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wrap cookies, cakes, breads and candies individually in plastic and store 
in airtight containers for maximum freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freeze fragile or irregularly shaped items on a baking sheet, then wrap as 
desired. But do not leave in the freezer more than 24 hours since unwrapped 
goods develop off flavors. A few hours to stiffen should be sufficient for 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fill containers with shredded tissue paper or packing straw to keep fragile 
gifts from breaking. Do not use popcorn or other edibles that may absorb fumes 
during transit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use freezer tape or fabric tape to seal lids of containers that might open 
or spill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep perishable foods refrigerated or frozen until ready to eat. Provide 
instructions for thawing and serving, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Label everything. 
</P>

ABOUT WINE: THIS LOW-KEY, QUIET WINERY PUTS OUT SOME BOLD REDS -- AND ONLY REDS 
</P>

<P>
After you get through reading about the success stories in the wine business, 
about the Gallos and the Mondavis, and after stories of the wealthy who spent 
their millions to create monuments that rival the Parthenon, there is the story 
of the Cutters. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a story that will make you want to give up your comfort zone in La La 
Land, but it is a tale that many people will identify with, and the story has a 
happy middle (there is no ending, yet), which is why it's a good one to tell at 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Andy and Debra Cutter own a winery called Duxoup Wine Works. Duxoup is low-key. 
Make that no-key. 
</P>
<P>
You will not find Duxoup advertised. You will not find any signs tacked to wine 
shop shelves underneath a bottle of Duxoup wine. You may not even find a bottle 
of Duxoup without trying very hard. 
</P>
<P>
The winery is not listed in guide books, nor is it even listed in the Sonoma 
County phone book. The Cutters prefer their privacy, up on the side of a 
mountain northeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Cutter home, there is no television. There is a stereo and a lot of 
classical records. And 13 cats. 
</P>
<P>
Not a drop of white wine is made here. Nor is any Cabernet Sauvignon made here, 
or anything else that a traditional wine collector would prize. But the 
traditional wine collector would be missing out. 
</P>
<P>
Andy and Debra make red wine. Specifically, Gamay. They call it Napa Gamay 
because technically that's what it is. It has no relationship whatever to the 
Gamay Beaujolais of either France or California, and certainly not the way the 
Cutters fashion it. 
</P>
<P>
Andy and Debra also make Charbono and red Zinfandel. And that's it, 2,000 cases 
of red wine. The wines are great. Prices are extremely fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I was managing a series of family companies back in Minnesota, and a 
corporation bought them out, so I had to go look for another job," said Andy 
the other day. At the time, in 1973, wine sounded interesting. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been studying French cooking in Minneapolis with Verna Meyers, and Verna 
told me to go out (to California) and see (wine author) Leon Adams, to see if 
there was a way I could learn wine making. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Leon told me I could go work in Germany and be treated worse than a 
slave, or I could go to France and be treated worse than in Germany, or I could 
stay in California and get a job as a cellar worker." 
</P>
<P>
By chance, Cutter met Chuck Carpy, a partner in Freemark Abbey Winery. Andy, 
who stands 6-foot-2, then weighed about 280. He was dwarfed by Carpy. 
</P>
<P>
Carpy needed someone to hold the door shut on Chardonnay tanks. It required 
someone big; Carpy had been doing the job. Andy was hired. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that was why he hired me," said Andy, who since has slimmed down to 
less than 200 pounds. "I was big enough." 
</P>
<P>
Working at Freemark Abbey, Cutter came to know one of the greatest wine makers 
in California history, Brad Webb, a partner in the winery. He also got to work 
with Freemark Abbey wine makers Jerry Luper and Larry Langbehn, brilliant 
talents in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
Debra, meanwhile, was a single mother raising four children and working at 
Franciscan Vineyards as production wine maker under Tom Ferrell. 
</P>
<P>
Andy left Freemark Abbey after 2 1/2 years and joined Dave Stare at Dry Creek. 
While there he met Debra. They were married in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Cutters also worked as managers at Field Stone winery, and their 
association with consultant Andre Tchelistcheff, probably the state's greatest 
wine maker, helped Andy's depth of wine-making knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The Cutters quit their jobs in 1978 to build a home on a slope at the northern 
part of the Dry Creek Valley. Their design was unique: the house would be hung 
on posts set deep into the earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great design, but it was complicated to build," said Debra. The 
house-building project led to the naming of the winery, which is pronounced 
just like the Marx Brothers movie, "Duck Soup." 
</P>
<P>
As the building project proceeded, and as complications arose, someone would 
ask Andy, "How's the house coming?" Andy would answer, "Easy as duck soup." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Duck Soup was selected as the name of the winery and, swears Andy, it 
was spelled Duxoup because at the time, vanity license plates in California had 
only six letters and he wanted the name of the winery on his license. 
</P>
<P>
Everything at Duxoup is that way, a little hard to buy. There are, for 
instance, 104 barrels in which wine is aged. Most wineries number the barrels, 
for record-keeping purposes. Andy and Debra named their barrels after people. 
One is called Pavarotti (they love opera), one is Uncle Dave (for Dave Stare), 
another is Halley's Comet and others, naturally, are Harpo and Groucho. 
</P>
<P>
"Step over here," said Andy as I toured the place. "And watch your step." I 
looked down and saw that the bricks on which I was walking were not cemented 
together, just stacked one on top of another. 
</P>
<P>
This is because Andy wants a winery with ultimate flexibility, and since he has 
no employees he doesn't have to conform to any Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration regulations. 
</P>
<P>
I noted he had no grape crusher. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to crush grapes if you don't pump," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled the tarpaulin off an open-topped wooden tank of fermenting Napa 
Gamay. The aroma was heady, intensely fruity and filled with scents that, alas, 
will be gone by the time the wine is bottled. 
</P>
<P>
Andy extracts color from the grape skins by pushing down the solid layer of 
grape pulp with a stainless steel, 10-tined gizmo designed for him by a friend, 
Tom Beard. I asked if the gadget had a name. 
</P>
<P>
Andy shrugged and then accepted the suggestion that since it had 10 tines and 
looked like a trident, perhaps it was a deca-dent. 
</P>
<P>
Duxoup's wines are not for the meek. They are bold, rich wines with a level of 
tannin that goes well with hearty, cold-weather dishes like hunter's stew or 
wild duck. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Napa Gamay (just released, $7.50) is a magnificent wine from a great 
vintage that will be truly enjoyable within a decade. Perhaps. It is as inky 
dark as any wine you can imagine, but has amazingly deep fruit and spice. 
</P>
<P>
I first had a wine made like this one day a few years ago after I tasted a 
range of Zinfandels with the late Joe Swan. Swan, a quiet retired airline 
pilot, rhetorically asked if I had paid my dues. 
</P>
<P>
Then he brought out a bottle of a 1970 Swan Gamay. It was dense and wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"That wine came from the same grapes," said Andy, crediting Mike Teldeschi and 
his sons, Gary and Ray, with growing the grapes that make the wine so exciting. 
</P>
<P>
I tasted all the Duxoup Napa Gamays going back to the first, 1981. The oldest 
wine, poured from a magnum, was just beginning to show its finesse, but my note 
sheet uses the word brawny in describing this wine. All the other vintages were 
more youthful, still with lots of time left to develop nuances. 
</P>
<P>
Another great wine is the 1987 Duxoup Charbono ($10), made from grapes off old 
vines in Calistoga that are farmed by Jean Frediani and her son, Jim. The 
opaque wine appears to have the stuffing to age at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The only traditional grape variety the Cutters turn into wine is Zinfandel, and 
it too is made from Teldeschi grapes, which are just across the road from 
Duxoup. I love the coarse, rich, peppery quality of this wine, which sells for 
$8.50. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Cutter if he was a hermit: his place is so hard to find, unmarked, and 
his number isn't even listed in the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we like visitors," he replied, "as long as we don't have to reinvent the 
wheel for them." 
</P>
<P>
And to illustrate the point, literally, he showed me the removable doors to the 
back of the winery that are signed in various colors of ink by dozens of 
visitors over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Just a handful of retail stores carry Duxoup wines, such as Fireside in Santa 
Monica. They're also available at the cafe Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach. Those 
interested in trying the wines may buy by mail from Duxoup, 9611 W. Dry Creek 
Road, Healdsburg, Calif. 95448. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are welcome, as noted, as long as they don't ask for white Zinfandel. 
And as you can imagine, duck artifacts pervade the now-completed and stunningly 
creative home, just up the hill from the winery. 
</P>
<P>
The final word on this place may be seen on the cork that the Cutters use to 
seal their wine. It says Facilis Par Duxoup. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Latin, but it's supposed to say, 'Easy as Duxoup,' " said Andy. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Hess Select Chardonnay ($8.75) -- Donald Hess, the Swiss 
entrepreneur who has owned Mount Veeder vineyard land for a decade, is the 
owner of the most exciting new winery in the Napa Valley, the Hess Collection, 
which formally opened this summer. His Chardonnays and Cabernets are prized, 
and this new wine, a lower-priced alternative to high-priced Chardonnays, is a 
stunning value. The fruit aroma is combined with complex notes normally found 
only in much more pricey wines, and the depth in the finish is remarkable. I 
haven't seen a wine this good in the under-$9 price range in a while. The wines 
is a blend of grapes, some from the Napa Valley, some from Hess' vineyards in 
Monterey county. To paraphrase Yakov Smirnov, what a wine.

<P>
DEAR SOS: Griswold's Candlelight Pavilion in Claremont has superb entertainment 
and cuisine. I have become addicted to an appetizer they serve called smoked 
salmon cheesecake. Any chance of getting the recipe? 
</P>

DEAR MONA: Executive chef Kerry McCain credits the idea for the appetizer 
cheesecake to his brother, executive chef Larry Ross of Fess Parker's Red Lion 
Inn in Santa Barbara. "Although he gave me the idea, I created this recipe and 
am proud to say that it is one of our biggest sellers," McCain said. Enjoy.

DEAR SOS: I am interested in making my own Baklava, if there is a relatively 
easy recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JANE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JANE: Surprising as it may seem, Baklava is simple to prepare. You may, 
however, have to get the knack of working with filo dough because it dries out 
so quickly unless covered with a damp cloth when not in use. Filo is kept moist 
by brushing the layers with melted or clarified butter. 
</P>
<P>
BAKLAVA 
</P>
<P>
2 cups unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
15 to 16 filo sheets (about 1 pound) 
</P>
<P>
2 cups chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
Syrup 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter until foam disappears and butter is clear. Brush bottom of 
13x9-inch baking pan with melted butter. Place 3 filo sheets in bottom of pan. 
Brush each sheet with about 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkle top sheet with 
about 2 tablespoons nuts. Repeat, adding pastry sheets and brushing with butter 
and sprinkling with nuts, ending with pastry sheet. Brush top with remaining 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
Trim dough and tuck edges underneath. Bake at 300 degrees 1 hour or until 
golden brown. Cool thoroughly in pan. Cut into 2 inch diamond shapes. Pour hot 
syrup over cooled Baklava. Let stand several hours or overnight. Makes 12 to 15 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Syrup 
</P>
<P>
2 1/4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar, corn syrup and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring 
occasionally, about 1 hour or until thickened. 
</P>
<P>

and curry powder. Will you provide the complete recipe, please?

DEAR JEANNE: Enclosed is a favorite family breakfast-brunch recipe that I feel 
guilty about making because it is so rich. Can you limit the butter and the 
eggs in this one? 
</P>
<P>
 -- JUDITH, Waukesha, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
CHERRY BRUNCH BARS 
</P>
<P>
1 cup butter

</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1 (21-ounce) can cherry pie filling 
</P>
<P>
Cream butter and sugar, gradually adding eggs and vanilla. Combine flour, salt

</P>
<P>
Note: Drizzle with icing, if desired. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JUDITH: At first, I wasn't sure if I could revise this recipe successfully 
or not. The major problem was the difference in texture between your recipe and 
my attempts at revision. 
</P>
<P>
However, after many tries, I managed to create brunch bars that have about a 
third less calories, half the fat and only one-sixth the cholesterol of your 
bars.

HARVARD-WESTLAKE MERGER IS FOCUS OF LAWSUIT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A MINORITY OF WESTLAKE SCHOOL TRUSTEES JOINS SOME PARENTS IN 
ALLEGING THAT THE PRESTIGIOUS GIRLS INSTITUTION IS BEING GIVEN AWAY TO THE 
ALL-BOY HARVARD CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After voting 16 to 5 to merge with Harvard School, trustees from Westlake 
School adjourned Monday night to Jimmy's restaurant to celebrate a "wonderful 
dream" come true. 
</P>
<P>
"What this is about is creating a wonderful school (that will) set standards 
not just for the West but for the United States," exulted Westlake Trustee 
Sheldon Sloan. "We're going to have a first-class prep school in this town the 
likes of which has not been seen before." 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the festivities at the tony Beverly Hills eatery were a small group 
of trustees who viewed the merger as the death of a dream that was Westlake 
School. 
</P>
<P>
In their effort to preserve the independence of the prestigious Holmby Hills 
school whose graduates include actress Candace Bergen and astronaut Sally Ride, 
opponents of the merger, including two trustees, have filed suit seeking to 
block it. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends that the merger was ill-conceived and was brought to a vote 
without sufficient consideration of the options. The opponents also contend 
that the deal was engineered by a group of wealthy, socially prominent people 
led by Peter and Helen Bing. The Bings, West Los Angeles residents who are 
active in a variety of local philanthropic efforts, have close ties to both 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
A third trustee, David May II, a scion of the department store family, quit the 
board after 24 years as a trustee in protest of the merger, contending that 
Harvard's ties to the Episcopal Church were not compatible with Westlake's 
non-sectarian traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the merger would essentially cede Westlake's $50-million Holmby 
Hills property to Harvard, whose ex officio board president is Frederick H. 
Borsch, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. In their lawsuit, they 
point out that an article in the November issue of the diocese newsletter 
quotes Harvard Headmaster Thomas C. Hudnut as confirming a continued 
relationship with the church in the merged junior and senior high school. 
</P>
<P>
Since the surprise announcement in October that a merger had been agreed upon 
in principle, the Westlake community has been in an uproar. A coalition of 
alumnae, parents and students oppose the deal for reasons varying from a 
preference for single-sex education to a concern that the venerable girls' 
school had underestimated its value and made a bad business bargain. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Harvard parents favor going co-ed, in keeping with a national 
trend among private boys' schools. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeking to block the merger was filed by Westlake parents, and has 
been joined by Trustees Anita May Rosenstein, David May's daughter, and Rodney 
Berle. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom showdown promises to reveal in considerable detail the inner 
workings of a group of people who like to keep their business private, 
particularly the Bings. Helen Bing is a Westlake trustee and benefactor, and 
Peter Bing, a physician, serves in a similar capacity at Harvard, whose campus 
is in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for her thoughts on the merger and her role in it, Helen Bing said: "I 
really don't have any comment to make." 
</P>
<P>
Sworn declarations filed in Los Angeles Superior Court allege that the merger 
was the work of a cabal of Bing associates on the Westlake board, and that 
other board members were unwilling to challenge the deal because of the Bings' 
social prominence and financial power. 
</P>
<P>
According to the declarations, Trustee Sloan is an attorney for the Bings, as 
is Daniel Belin, husband of Trustee Daisy Belin. Helen Bing's personal 
physician, Gary Gitnick, is also a trustee, the documents said. Sloan declined 
to comment on his professional ties to the Bings. Belin and Gitnick could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A letter to the board from David May included in the lawsuit documents notes 
that in 1981 Helen Bing donated the money to buy a home for Westlake Headmaster 
Nathan Reynolds and his family, who had been living in what May said were 
deplorable conditions on campus. 
</P>
<P>
May also noted that Bing had vowed to withdraw her financial support for 
Westlake if she did not get her way about the merger. 
</P>
<P>
A blistering attack on the manner in which the merger was handled is included 
in one letter from May to Helen Bing that is included in the documents. "I feel 
that everything that you and Peter want to accomplish could have been done very 
easily if it was done in a businesslike and tasteful manner that you had every 
right to expect." 
</P>
<P>
May goes on to characterize the handling of the merger as "incompetent, 
lack(ing in) prudent judgment, tasteless, insensitive and heavy-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the same letter, May said two expressions he had never before used 
came to mind in describing the terms of the merger: "male chauvinist" and 
"sexist." 
</P>
<P>
Under the signed merger agreement, the new school will be named 
Harvard-Westlake, the board will be controlled by current Harvard trustees and 
Hudnut will run the school. Reynolds, who is nearing retirement age, will be 
provost. Harvard's Studio City facilities would become the campus for high 
school-age students, and lower grades would be housed at Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sloan and Reynolds used exactly the same words to respond to the lawsuit's 
charges that the merger was engineered by the Bings and boosted by cronyism on 
the Westlake board. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nonsense," the two men said in separate interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan said the real issue -- education -- has gotten lost amid the fight over 
the process, which he concedes was imperfect. "There's nothing nefarious. No 
secret deals. No smoking guns." he said. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Bing is by all accounts a tireless worker for Westlake and a major 
benefactor. "She's an incredible human being," said Sloan. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even as he criticizes the merger in his letters, May describes Helen 
Bing as the school's "most valuable trustee," even without considering her 
financial support. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to serving as a Harvard trustee, Peter Bing serves on the Stanford 
University board and is a director of the Times Mirror Co., which publishes the 
Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bing's mother is Anna Bing Arnold, whose philanthropic activities are 
legendary in Los Angeles. The family fortune came from the New York real estate 
holdings of Arnold's first husband, Leo Bing. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to thwart the merger, the Westlake parents have raised $4.7 
million in cash and pledges, with Trustees Berle, television mogul Aaron 
Spelling and film executive Samuel Goldwyn offering to cover the school's 
deficit for the next four years if the merger is thwarted -- the assumption 
being that Westlake may lose some students if Harvard goes co-educational on 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit questions, however, whether Harvard is actually poised to go co-ed 
on its own, and whether Westlake must immediately decide to merge or be left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
According to a letter from Hudnut to Harvard parents, the Studio City school 
has no timetable to become co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Hudnut estimated the cost of going co-ed without Westlake at $30 
million, and said that if the Westlake merger does not occur, Harvard would be 
back to "square one," faced with the prospect of raising the money, finding 
property and building a second campus.

DISCIPLINED FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS, OFFICER, DISPATCHER SUE LONG BEACH POLICE 
CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police officer and a dispatcher, who were disciplined after their views about 
the Police Department were published in a newspaper, have filed lawsuits 
charging that Police Chief Lawrence Binkley violated their "constitutional 
right of free speech." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Greg Roberts and dispatcher Charles Cobbley were reprimanded for 
writing letters to the Press-Telegram earlier this year. Both men are now 
seeking to clear their records and change the department's practice. The suits 
also seek an unspecified amount in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' lawsuit was filed Tuesday and Cobbley's lawsuit was filed Nov. 3, both 
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Their attorney, James E. Trott, said he plans to file at least three more 
lawsuits on behalf of other officers who were investigated or disciplined for 
comments that placed the department or the chief in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight officers have been investigated, threatened with an 
investigation or reprimanded this year for publicly commenting on the 
department or on sensitive issues. The remarks were made in forums ranging from 
the letters-to-the-editor page to a retirement party. 
</P>
<P>
Binkley has said that officers should have gone through the chain of command to 
air their concerns and complaints. Public criticism, he said, is inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
But the officers complain that their First Amendment rights have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I checked, the American flag was still flying in front of that 
building," said Trott, the officers' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was reprimanded for insubordination and "bringing the department into 
disrepute" after his letter was published Oct. 17. Roberts blamed "incompetent 
police management" for inadequate patrol staffing. In his letter, he did not 
identify himself as an officer. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the letter, Roberts also may have lost an opportunity to work an 
overtime shift, which had been previously approved, according to the lawsuit. 
When he questioned why he was taken off the roster for an overtime shift, "he 
was advised the decision was made by the administration and no other details 
were provided," according to the lawsuit, which also names the city and Police 
Cmdr. John Bretza as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Cobbley was reprimanded for insubordination and violating the department's 
policy dealing with professional journal publications after his letter, which 
criticized police management, was published May 21. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Cobbley specified that he was not speaking as an authorized 
representative of the department but as a private citizen. His lawsuit also 
names the city and Lt. Michael Kunst as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Officers say that the informal gag order is partly a result of the growing 
tension between management and the rank-and-file, who are battling over a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council last week declared an impasse in negotiations, and imposed the 
city's contract offer. But the Police Officers Assn. immediately took the issue 
to court, and the city agreed to delay imposition of the new contract until a 
court hearing Dec. 14.

<P>
Many officers have said they want to be free to express their opinions on 
department issues -- regardless of where the contract negotiations stand. As a 
result of the crackdown, Officer Ray Faraca recently circulated a petition 
advocating "freedom of speech," for officers. The petition has been signed by 
about 260 officers -- more than 40% of the force -- Faraca said. 
</P>
<P>
The petition said police officers "possess the exact same rights and privileges 
that all citizens enjoy and hold so sacred. . . . We can no longer condone the 
department's obsession to become the 'one and only voice.' 
</P>
<P>
"We all gave an oath to serve and protect the public but we did not pledge an 
'Oath of Silence.' " 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Public Safety Advisory Commission, which oversees police safety 
issues, plans to continue its discussion of the department's media policy at 
its next meeting Dec. 13. Several commission members have expressed concern 
that officers' First Amendment rights may have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
Police administrators say officers can be disciplined for being disloyal or for 
violating various policies that, among other things, forbid them from publicly 
criticizing orders they receive. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Police Department, "Officers are free to write letters to 
the editor as long as the position they take is identified as their personal 
position rather than the position of the department," regardless of whether it 
is critical, according to Fred Nixon, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be no discipline taken . . . for a mere expression of an opinion 
or being quoted in the paper or having written a letter to the editor," Nixon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Councilman Les Robbins, immediate past president of the 5,000-member 
union that represents sheriff's deputies, said he knew of no deputy disciplined 
for making statements to the press. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he sides "more with those who advocate First Amendment rights." 
But, Robbins continued, he also tells cadets at his law enforcement agency that 
they can be disciplined for "anything you say or do that can be a disgrace or 
dishonor to the department." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, an attorney who is considered one of the more 
liberal City Council members, has defended Binkley's policies. "I'm not sure 
that I would take the same tack as management," Braude said. "But police is a 
paramilitary organization, and there has to be a special kind of discipline."

THRIFT SHOP RECYCLES LIVES LOST TO ADDICTION; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: ON MOTOR AVENUE NEAR VENICE BOULEVARD, THE OWNER OF THE LEMONADE THRIFT 
SHOP COMBINES REHABILITATION WITH EMPLOYMENT. 
</P>

<P>
Perhaps, just perhaps, if the war on drugs is ever going to be won, it will be 
less because of the efforts of presidents, drug czars, generals and police 
officers than because of the work of people like Joe Zychik. 
</P>
<P>
Zychik has no troops at his disposal, no guns, no helicopters or high-tech 
surveillance equipment. His resources are more limited: back issues of National 
Geographic, old clothes, used furniture, a yellow cockateel, stuffed bears, 
leather bags and a $3,000 monthly budget. 
</P>
<P>
His battlefield is a small curiosity shop on Motor Avenue near Venice 
Boulevard, where he works with nine refugees from the street, all of them 
recovering or attempting to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol, or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
The place is called Lemonade Thrift Shop, and it is the brainchild of Zychik, a 
tall, wiry 44-year-old who for 14 years has fashioned an unusual free-lance 
career in drug counseling and rehabilitation. He works for no government or 
government-funded agency, and he is not aligned with any religious group or 
private charity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no licenses, no degrees, no formal training," he said, but he has 
nonetheless managed to establish a busy practice as a personal counselor 
working out of an office in Culver City, dealing mainly with clients who have 
addictions or relationship problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lemonade, his latest project, opened in August. The name, he said, was 
suggested by a yellowing poster that now hangs in the shop bearing the slogan: 
"When life gives you lemons, why not make lemonade?" 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Zychik offers Lemonade clients a job, some no-nonsense counseling 
and a roof over their heads -- most of them live in an apartment he has rented 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unstructured environment that allows a person to choose his own niche 
and get off the streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the clients help manage the shop and pay Zychik an agreed-upon share 
of their Social Security or general relief checks. These amounts are meager, 
however, and the shop leads a precarious day-to-day existence. 
</P>
<P>
With items in the shop priced very low -- a copy of Harper's History of Human 
Civilization goes for 50 cents, an ornate lampshade for a dollar -- daily sales 
rarely exceed $150. So, it is always a scramble to cover the monthly rent of 
$1,400 and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
But the constant struggle to keep the place afloat seems to have an energizing 
effect on Zychik. He scouts weekend garage sales for goods to sell at the shop, 
schedules pickups, wrestles the furniture into his aging pickup truck, manages 
the inventory and oversees the sales. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, he is talking to parole officers and directors of shelters for 
the homeless, providing counseling to the Lemonade clients, or trying to make 
time for his regular counseling clients at his office a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Zychik's rehabilitation methods are as unorthodox as the shop itself. He 
believes that drug and alcohol abuse are "purely psychological problems rather 
than clinical ones." His counseling steers away from the established medical 
procedures for the treatment of substance abuse. "I just talk to them and make 
them feel that things can be much better for them," Zychik said. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledges that some clients need a more regulated and intensive 
regime than he can provide at Lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of washout in the first 30 days. There is a sense of failure 
when that happens. I think later that I could have salvaged some of them if I 
had more time and money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But for some people, Zychik's low-budget, low-key rehabilitation center is all 
they need to get their lives under control. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Matthews, 30, is one of two men who has been with the shop since it opened. 
Released from prison in January after serving two years for armed robbery, he 
quickly became addicted to drugs. For a while, he said, he lived with a woman, 
believing that "she would let me stay if I got her some dope." 
</P>
<P>
"But that didn't work and when I heard about Joe from a friend of mine, I 
thought it was interesting and I climbed aboard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The initial apprehensions were daunting, Matthews said. "I knew that I was 
going to talk to normal people. They were going to look at me. They would see 
the needle marks on my arm. I didn't know what to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly realized his fears were groundless. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it. These were people like us. It's a whole new life out 
here. I've never smiled so much in my life. I've never said so many hi's." 
Neighbors and customers, he said, "have embraced us, and we should show them 
all the courtesy there is." 
</P>
<P>
Though Matthews said Zychik can be extremely demanding at times, he also gives 
Zychik total credit for his new-found zeal and happiness: "He may get very 
angry at people who don't give their best, but he is a fabulous person. He 
spends a lot of time with us. Stuff like that keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
Zychik said the idea of establishing an independent counseling center struck 
him when some people he had previously counseled offered to help him start a 
"rehabilitation center just beside the street." 
</P>
<P>
He first tried a center similar to Lemonade in Hollywood, but the high crime 
rate in the neighborhood forced him to close. "It helped me to get my feet wet 
so that I was aware of the problems when I started Lemonade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He settled on the concept of a thrift shop, he said, because it was one of very 
few options that didn't require a large investment or a team of skilled 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Zychik knew that he would be "dealing with all kinds of people" and had to 
exercise extreme caution in choosing the right ones to work at the shop. Parole 
officers and a West Hollywood-based center for the homeless have been key 
sources of referrals. 
</P>
<P>
When the first names trickled in, Zychik said, the screening began in an 
atmosphere of skepticism and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"There was total distrust on their part," he said. "They thought I would rip 
them off. I wanted to find out how many lies they would tell, how outrageous 
the lies would be. The paranoia was so deep that it was absurd. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that they were going to enter situations where they had to earn 
their trust, work for sobriety; where they would be expected to deal with 
people, and where they would have to follow a routine." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Harris, a Long Beach parole officer who refers people to Zychik, said 
his "work therapy" is effective because "when people work themselves, it is 
easier to identify the problems they weren't able to handle earlier." 
</P>
<P>
At the West Hollywood Homeless Program, another source of recruits, caseworker 
Rene Feidel also praises Zychik's program, but said that because it lacks 
intensive therapy, it is most appropriate for "those who have gone through a 
formal rehabilitation program but have had a relapse." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alfonso Paredes, a UCLA professor of psychiatry who is involved in chemical 
and alcohol dependency research, warns against generalizations from "anecdotal 
testimonies" like Zychik's. But he notes that "social groups in a drug-free 
environment" can go a long way in the treatment of drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
So far, for a client named Sam, who asked that his last name not be published, 
the Lemonade program is working. Once an established anesthesiology technician, 
his life fell apart early this year. His wife died. He lost his hospital job in 
the shakeout that followed a corporate takeover. He suffered bouts of acute 
depression. His son introduced him to "all kinds of drugs," and he became 
addicted. 
</P>
<P>
Sam found himself slipping into "a street world I wasn't made for," and he 
realized that he was all alone. "All my friends left me. When I asked them for 
help, everyone said no," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he heard of Zychik through an acquaintance, it was the start of the 
strenuous process of bringing life back on the rails. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very tough," Sam said, "but Joe is teaching me how to stay with problems 
and learn from them rather than running away. His counseling is so different. 
He asks you questions about yourself, and you just talk. I can't give him as 
much honor as he deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Zychik said the work comes naturally to him. "I have always believed that life 
can be better than what it is now. . . . I have this strong determination to 
see that this thing is a success for people who really want to change." 
</P>
<P>
It's not all success stories. One client who left the shop after two weeks 
said, "There was a lot of hard work and very little counseling. He (Zychik) 
lacks professionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. Ed, a 50-year-old former homeless heroin addict said: "The 
work is hard and so are the people. But they are kind and nice. I'm fighting 
every day, and every day I get stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Zychik contends that criticism usually comes from people who are asked to leave 
because "they steal from the shop and expect sobriety to be handed to them on a 
platter." 
</P>
<P>
It was in San Francisco in the mid-'70s that Zychik discovered his unusual 
calling: He started by teaching a group of people how to stop smoking tobacco. 
It was there in 1975 that he met his wife, Mary, at a philosophy lecture. 
</P>
<P>
"I was struck by the honesty of his approach to his job," his wife recalled. 
"There was nothing manipulative about it. He's remarkable for his persistence." 
</P>
<P>
Mary said her husband's "sense of compassion" is responsible for his success. 
The Zychiks have been married for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"She's extremely supportive," Zychik says of his wife. "Her sense of humor is a 
big help." 
</P>
<P>
Also supportive are the customers who troop in all day or just stop by the 
window to have a look at the variety of items offered at amazingly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Austin, a regular customer, calls the shop a "place full of good 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Another regular, Bryan Martin, 33, said: "I never forget to check out the place 
on weekends. It is great. I bought a world map for 50 cents." 
</P>
<P>
Asatur Agadian, proprietor of a shoe repair shop next door, is also full of 
praise. "They are really trying very hard to help people. And we should help 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Zychik admits that the shoestring budget can be very frustrating, but he is 
thankful to the people who provide moral or material support. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, I find myself sitting on the streets at night, thinking how rough the 
going is. Everyone at the shop is overworked. If it rains on the weekends, 
there are no garage sales. And then we are dead. I ask myself, 'Why am I doing 
all this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Usually, however, the question is followed by an answer: "The belief that this 
can be done; the feeling that we have already saved the lives of a few people." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemonade Thrift Shop is at 3771 Motor Ave., just north of Venice Boulevard.

<P>
BUSINESS: AN EXECUTIVE CHEF AT A TRENDY SANTA MONICA RESTAURANT WORKED HIS WAY 
UP FROM DISHWASHER AND SERVES AS A MODEL FOR OTHERS PURSUING THE AMERICAN 
DREAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As with many immigrants who enter this country illegally, the only job Martin 
Garcia could find when he arrived 10 years ago from Mexico was that of a 
dishwasher at a new Santa Monica restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Garcia is still at that same restaurant -- the very tony Michael's -- 
but now he is executive chef and senior vice president of McCarty Group 
Restaurants, which owns and operates Michael's and three other restaurants 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to do something with my life," Garcia said. "When I first 
got here, I just wanted to have a job. I wasn't really thinking about the 
future. But now, I work hard because I want to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Advancing from dishwasher to executive chef is analogous to moving from the 
mail room of a major corporation to company president; it's rarely done. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's ascent is even more remarkable because of the obstacles he had to 
overcome: his illegal immigration status, learning a new language and finding a 
way to fit in with classically trained chefs, particularly in a high-profile 
market. 
</P>
<P>
It helped that restaurant owner Michael McCarty has a philosophy of training 
his people and promoting from within. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin is our great success story," McCarty said. "He is a light, a beacon of 
success. We like to promote from within. Each time a space becomes available, 
you look at the next guy in line to promote. He showed the initiative to 
perfect one stage before going on to the next." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said that what Garcia, 29, lacked in experience and formal training, he 
made up with tenacity and an ability to learn quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fast learner," McCarty said. "A good cook is one thing, but a good chef 
is someone who can think and who can manage people. It's the business end of 
the kitchen. Martin is a good chef." 
</P>
<P>
But in a town such as Los Angeles, where restaurants are as popular for their 
celebrity chefs as they are for their food, was McCarty -- himself a celebrity 
chef -- concerned with turning over his kitchen to an unknown? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," McCarty said emphatically. "It was never a risk. We never 
moved him until he was better than the person before him." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia has come a long way since 1979, when he paid a coyote -- a smuggler -- 
$250 to get him across the border from Mexico into the United States to join 
two of his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Los Angeles with only the skills of a farm worker who had toiled 
the fields surrounding his native hometown of Guadalajara. One of 11 children, 
Garcia said he came to the United States because he wanted more out of life 
than what his native Mexico could offer. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was a farmer," Garcia said. "We never went hungry, but I wanted to 
do something else with my life." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of formal training, Garcia moved from dishwasher to head chef 
in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The best training is learning from the bottom up," he said. "It's one thing to 
have your resume say you can do the job, and another thing actually being able 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as executive chef, Garcia manages a $4-million budget for the four 
restaurants and hires and fires personnel. He said he looks beyond a resume, or 
the lack of one, when he evaluates potential employees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to look at the whole person," he said. "You can usually 
tell whether a person can do the job within a couple of days, and whether that 
person is someone who can grow with the company, regardless of their 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's success has become a source of inspiration for others at the 
restaurant, particularly recent immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Gonzalez, from Michoacan, Mexico, has been working as a dishwasher at 
Michael's for seven months. But in that short time, he said Garcia has become a 
role model. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what I want to do with my life, but seeing Martin's success makes 
me believe that I can accomplish something here," Gonzalez said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin, being Latino, has been very helpful," said Luis Campo, a dishwasher 
for three years who is originally from El Salvador. "We don't speak English 
very well, so he speaks up for us when we can't and explains things to us that 
we don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
Juan Bautista, from Oaxaca, Mexico, has moved up from dishwasher to helping to 
prepare food for the chefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin has helped me learn the business, and I think I have a future here," 
Bautista said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the only thing holding Bautista back is his having to keep a second 
job to support his family and not having enough time to take classes to learn 
English more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell all these guys that, if they want to succeed in the United States, they 
are eventually going to have to learn English," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who married his childhood sweetheart and is the father of two children, 
took English classes about five years ago and has a good command of the 
language, speaking with only a slight accent. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's amnesty 
program, Garcia last year received his permanent residency card. He looks 
forward to becoming a U.S. citizen, after fulfilling the five-year permanent 
residency requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be on equal footing with everyone else in this country," he said. 
"Also, my intent is to live here the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia hopes to complete his success story by opening his own restaurant some 
day. But for now, he says he is happy learning about the business and helping 
McCarty branch out. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is not the most important thing to me right now," he said. "I know that 
will come later. I'm happy with what I am doing now, and I'm learning a lot."

HATCHERY FAULTS PUMP FOR FISH KILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON FARLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A missing alarm on a pump at the Fillmore Fish Hatchery contributed to the 
weekend accident that killed 180,000 rainbow trout and sent 20,000 more fish 
coursing into a small creek on a neighboring watercress farm, officials said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The fish were lost when a recirculation pump overheated and failed Saturday 
night, depriving the fish of one-third of their normal water and oxygen, said 
James R. Adams, the hatchery's assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was compounded after suffocated trout piled up on retaining screens 
at the end of the hatchery's concrete-lined fish ponds. The screens eventually 
gave way, causing about 20,000 live fish to be swept downstream. Officials said 
most or all of those fish died. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was discovered Sunday morning. Damage was estimated at $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
The pump was the only one of four without an alarm system that alerts resident 
hatchery workers to take emergency procedures. Adams said it had been running 
round-the-clock since January, but lacked an alarm because it wasn't normally 
used all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we haven't had as much weight on the hatchery grounds to require 
the pump 24 hours a day," said Adams, who has been at the hatchery since 1980. 
"We should have had an alarm system, bottom line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hatchery, one of 21 operated by the state Department of Fish and Game, has 
been raising trout at record levels under a "Trophy Trout" program started in 
January. Annual production was at an all-time high of 410,000 pounds -- about 
10,000 pounds above the norm. 
</P>
<P>
Larger-than-normal fish of up to one pound make up one-third of the fish at the 
hatchery, increasing both the total weight of fish produced and the strain on 
the hatchery's equipment, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Not affected in the accident was next year's distribution from February to May 
of fish to more than 40 lakes, streams and reservoirs in San Luis Obispo, Santa 
Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. However, surplus distribution for 
the end of this year was set back. The trout lost were seven to eight inches 
long and were ready to be stocked. 
</P>
<P>
The pump failure was the first at the hatchery but the second this year in the 
state. A similar incident at a Bishop hatchery killed 65,000 fish in June, said 
a spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
In Fillmore, hatchery workers put in overtime Sunday and Monday, scooping dead 
fish out of the ponds and repairing broken screens. Most of the dead fish were 
buried in a pit on hatchery grounds, although at least three truckloads went to 
neighboring farms to be used as fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers placed sentimental value on the loss of the fish, which they 
raised from eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"We put ourselves into it so much -- it's like losing your kids," said Bob 
Peery, a fish and wildlife assistant.

CITY'S FISCAL CONFUSION SPURS CALLS FOR AUDIT; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET WOES: A $1.4-MILLION REFUND OF MONEY PAID INTO A RETIREMENT FUND HASN'T 
AFFECTED CALLS FOR AN OUTSIDE AUDIT OF OXNARD'S CITY MANAGEMENT.

<P>
Oxnard officials Wednesday announced a surprise find of $1.4 million to bolster 
sagging budget reserves, but that didn't squelch the demand for an 
investigation to determine whether poor management practices caused the city's 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the discovery served to illustrate the confusion surrounding Oxnard's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
City managers say they learned of the windfall Tuesday, when the state notified 
Oxnard that it would receive a refund of some money the city paid into the 
California Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS). 
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked," said Rudy Muravez, Oxnard's Finance and Management Services 
director. "We're not psychics." 
</P>
<P>
However, state officials said they notified the city in February that it might 
get the refund, which stemmed from unexpected investment returns and a 
reassessment of Oxnard's pension needs. 
</P>
<P>
The timing issue is important because in October, the city, beset by financial 
difficulties, cut its expenses by more than $1 million through layoffs and 
service reductions. Muravez said a search through city files Tuesday had turned 
up a letter the state sent in February but no accompanying description of a 
possible surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"The supporting data may be buried under someone's desk file," he said. "We 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for the first time in more than 20 years, Oxnard received a 
$1.5-million refund, $1.2 million of which was put into the general fund, City 
Manager David Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
Mora emphasized that the city had no knowledge of the refund money during the 
last several months of anguished budget discussions and cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"PERS is not in any fashion controlled by the city," Mora said. "It is totally 
state-administered." 
</P>
<P>
The refund probably will go into the reserve fund, Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
Mora said he did not anticipate any restoration of the more than $1 million in 
reductions from this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, however, already is advocating putting some of the 
funds into a street-sweeping program and a police unit that patrols for 
truants. 
</P>
<P>
Maron and council members Geraldine Furr and Manuel Lopez said they were 
pleasantly surprised by the find. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm overjoyed," Lopez said. "We've had so many negative things happen 
recently, it's kind of a welcome change." 
</P>
<P>
But city leaders are still pushing for a management audit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm committed to the audit," Furr said. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting Friday, the City Council will discuss hiring a consultant 
to research how $9 million was sucked from reserve funds during a four-year 
period, precipitating the need for more than $1 million in cutbacks this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Changes are in process," Maron said Tuesday at the regularly scheduled 
meeting. "A management review and audit is being studied. Members of the 
council are aware of the problems." 
</P>
<P>
The management audit should be conducted by a firm that does not presently do 
business with Oxnard and will not enter into any other contracts with the city 
for three years, Maron said. 
</P>
<P>
Maron said she wants the audit to include a special review of development 
projects such as the senior apartment project at South Oxnard Center, which was 
approved by the council last February. The council discovered last week that a 
miscalculation had resulted in the loss of about $372,000 in development fees 
from the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Lopez said he would go along with the audit. Mayor Nao Takasugi 
and Councilwoman Ann Johs were absent, both attending a National League of 
Cities conference in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Chamber of Commerce and the Ad Hoc Citizen Financial Advisory 
Committee pushed for the management investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This committee is almost blind without an audit to make any decision about 
what should be done," committee member Tony Wilson said at a meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which for 12 weeks has reviewed city finances, is to make 
recommendations on how to clear up the budget crisis in January. 
</P>
<P>
A management audit would be aimed at clarifying information to be disclosed by 
the city's annual financial audit. That report is due in December, as is a city 
staff study detailing causes for the city's dramatically flawed misreadings of 
its own finances. 
</P>
<P>
But even before those disclosures are made, some officials and Oxnard residents 
have firm ideas on how to begin cleaning up the city's fiscal mess. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials -- like Mora -- are pushing for a "revenue enhancement" 
measure that would be decided by voters in a June election. Others, like former 
Councilman Michael Plisky, contend that such a tax is not needed, claiming 
sufficient funds could be found by eliminating waste in city management. 
</P>
<P>
But proving either contention may force the city to cross a crucial deadline. A 
management audit could take as long as five months, but the council has only 
until late February to decide whether to place a tax on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Some fear that an audit also will cost too much money. 
</P>
<P>
A management audit could cost $50,000 to $500,000 depending on the scope of the 
study, Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
The simplest type of study would examine the structure of city management, 
determining such things as whether too many or too few employees are reporting 
to one administrator. 
</P>
<P>
However, a complex study also could be performed, one that would go throughout 
the city monitoring workers on the job, Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, consultants would spend one day with a street maintenance crew 
reviewing how employees are scheduled and how they perform their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Another day could be spent with the city manager, keeping track of how he 
spends his time, Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's what it takes to convince people that the organizations and services 
we provide require additional funding, then we ought to do it," said Mora, who 
contends that there is little fat left in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council last week finalized decisions to reduce department budgets and 
eliminate 15.5 city positions, reducing this year's budget by $1 million and 
saving about $1.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions were made on the heels of discoveries that estimates of revenues 
for the 1988-89 fiscal year were about $2 million too high and that the city 
had spent $850,000 more than its budget allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The decreases followed $1.9 million in cutbacks that the council instituted in 
June -- resulting in fewer police patrols and occasionally forcing the closing 
of fire stations on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the council has shifted $167,000 to the Police and Fire departments 
to ease their manpower problems.

CAMARILLO SEEKS POLICY CHANGE ON DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Camarillo this week asked county officials to change their policy 
on development in the rapidly growing Santa Rosa Valley to ensure that money 
for roads, schools and parks is available before builders put up homes. 
</P>
<P>
The request comes in the wake of the refusal by Camarillo, Moorpark and 
Thousand Oaks to pay a combined $12 million assessed by the county to help 
widen major roads through the valley's unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking the county to take a look at this established policy and evaluate 
whether the area can support more development," Camarillo Mayor Sandi Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The actions were sparked by the Caston Trust's proposal to build 280 homes on 
334 acres now zoned for agricultural uses. The proposal is expected to reach 
the supervisors next spring. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors Tuesday took no action on Camarillo's request. Staff members 
are negotiating with the three cities over their refusal to pay the levies for 
Santa Rosa and Moorpark roads. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Maggie Erickson, whose district includes Camarillo, said approval of 
the development could help pay to widen the high-speed two-lane roads. 
</P>
<P>
"The infrastructure in the Santa Rosa Valley needs an infusion of money, and 
some of it could come from this development," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush objected, saying that the proposed development would add too many 
people to an already straining Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a greenbelt agreement with the county, and this plan is in violation," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the question of just how much money developers should be expected 
to pay for roads, parks, schools and other public facilities. The county 
already charges developers about $3,500 per lot for road improvements, such as 
striping and turn lanes, according to County Planner Daniel Price. 
</P>
<P>
But such fees do not go toward such major improvements as widening roads, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To widen seven miles of road to four lanes, the county has asked the Caston 
Trust to pay $4 million of the $24-million total cost. The county intends to 
contribute $5.1 million, and it has asked Camarillo for $5.2 million, Moorpark 
for $6.2 million and Thousand Oaks for $474,420. 
</P>
<P>
But the city of Camarillo says the request is unfair. Development outside its 
boundaries in the Santa Rosa Valley increases traffic on city streets, 
ultimately costing the city money, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"We could tell the county we would like it to contribute $4.5 million toward 
that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said the assessment on the city was out of line 
with its residents' use of the roads. The city also objects to the Caston Trust 
development and its aggravation of traffic problems, he said.

REPLACEMENTS SOUGHT FOR REJECTED SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the East Whittier City School District will meet Friday to discuss 
what books will be used temporarily in place of the controversial "Impressions" 
textbooks, which have been labeled morbid and tainted by some parents. 
</P>
<P>
The district board voted at its Monday night meeting to send the "Impressions" 
series back to the publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston of Canada Ltd. The 
action was taken after a long, closed-door session in which board members 
decided that the publishers breached their contract by sending the district 
books that were different from what they had advertised last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary schoolteachers are currently surveying the libraries and resource 
reserves to find alternate books. 
</P>
<P>
The district is demanding a $160,000 refund from the publisher.

23 PROPERTIES NEAR WILSON HIGH CAMPUS CONDEMNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a 4-1 vote, the Board of Education this week condemned 23 properties near 
Wilson High School to make way for a new science building. 
</P>
<P>
The volatile issue is headed next for court, where a group of homeowners plans 
to battle the Long Beach Unified School District to prevent their homes from 
being razed. The four-acre parcel is being sought to create athletic fields 
that would make room on the main campus for a new science building. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Jerry Shultz, who agreed with the property owners, cast the 
dissenting vote. The plan, he said Wednesday, will create "the most expensive 
soccer field in the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
The area affected is bounded by 7th and 8th streets and Ximeno and Bennett 
avenues, directly across from Wilson High. Most homeowners there say they do 
not want to sell their properties, and several have argued that district 
officials are not offering them fair market value for their properties.

VOTERS LEAGUE SPONSORS HIGHER EDUCATION MEETING IN VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The League of Women Voters will sponsor a meeting Saturday addressing questions 
related to the need for higher education in Ventura County. The meeting, 
consisting of a panel of six speakers, will last from 10 a.m. to noon at 
Community Presbyterian Church, 115 Lincoln Drive, in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers will include Russ Baggerly, a local environmentalist; economist Dick 
Felton; Michael Gonzalez, a counselor at Santa Paula High School; Ron Komers, 
personnel director for Ventura County; Elise Schneider, president of Oxnard 
College, and a representative from Cal State Northridge's Ventura Center. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is part of an ongoing study of the higher-education issue by the 
league. The study does not deal with selection of a Ventura County site for a 
California State University, according to a league spokeswoman.

JUNE VOTE SET ON SCHOOL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Unified School District board decided this week to call for a 
parcel tax election in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The tax on all parcels of land in the city must be approved by two-thirds of 
the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The district decided not to seek an April 10 vote, coinciding with the City 
Council election, because voters would be less willing to tax themselves on the 
date property taxes are due and shortly before the April 15 income tax 
deadline, spokeswoman Hali Wickner said. A June 5 vote, coinciding with the 
state primary election, will give the district more time to plan for the tax, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel tax is a key element in the settlement the district's teachers 
reached after their strike last month. If the tax passes, the teachers will get 
a 3% salary increase in 1990-91 and will not have to teach longer hours.

NEW DATA ON THE ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $35,000 study has found fewer than the expected number of elderly residents 
in Santa Monica who are frail, isolated or at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The study, by Facts Consolidated in Los Angeles, concluded that at any given 
time only 56 elderly residents of the city could be classified as being in a 
life-threatening situation. 
</P>
<P>
"What we thought was a great problem isn't as great a problem as we thought," 
said Leonard Gross, chairman of the city's Commission on Older Americans. "By 
and large, we found that the elderly in Santa Monica are very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Gross said the city provides adequate services for the elderly, but many people 
are unaware of them. 
</P>
<P>
He said the commission will take several months to analyze the data before 
proposing programs to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We have data on the elderly that we have never had before," Gross said. "I 
think we got a hell of a value for our $35,000." 
</P>
<P>
Among the new information is that the largest concentration of people over 60 
years old is north of Montana Avenue, one-third of all households have elderly 
residents and 20% of the elderly population is over 80 years old.

2 HONORED FOR HELPING IN PURSE-SNATCHING INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Gate City Council has given "courageous citizens" awards to John Gip 
and Sandra Hernandez for their part in helping with the capture of a suspected 
purse snatcher earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The awards were presented to Gip and Hernandez "for getting involved" on Nov. 6 
after 86-year-old Elizabeth Minneman's purse was grabbed as she left the 
Hollydale Market. Minneman received several cuts and bruises in a brief 
struggle with the thief. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, 26, who witnessed the incident, started shouting and chasing the 
suspect. Her screams alerted Gip, also 26, who owns the market. Gip chased the 
suspect for several blocks until the suspect gave the purse back. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ron George said: "After running out of gas and energy, the suspect 
threw the purse and its contents back" and ran into a house where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
Gip returned the purse containing $7 and a pair of eyeglasses to Minneman. He 
also showed arriving police officers the house into which the suspect ran. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Chris Dominguez, 27, on suspicion of robbery. Dominguez is to 
be arraigned on robbery charges Dec. 21 in Norwalk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Minneman was on hand Monday night during the council meeting to thank Gip and 
Hernandez. "I'm forever grateful," Minneman said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Gip said, "I just didn't think about it. I just ran after him. 
Then, I got a little nervous because I started thinking, 'this guy might have a 
gun and shoot me.' But, I forgot about it and just kept on running."

<P>
LA CANADA STILL TEAM TO BEAT IN RIO HONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last season was almost too easy. 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada boys' basketball team followed its improbable 25-3 record in 
1987-88 with an identical mark in 1988-89. The Spartans, under Coach Tom 
Hofman, breezed unbeaten through the Rio Hondo League to run their two-year 
league record to 20-0. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, it's going to be a lot more work," Hofman said. "I think we can be 
as good as last year's team by the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"But you don't really know until your team starts playing." 
</P>
<P>
Answers for coaches and fans will be forthcoming this week when Glendale-area 
teams open their seasons in nonleague games and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Every coach, of course, calls his team a contender. 
</P>
<P>
But Hofman, for one, has good reason to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing two-time All-Southern Section center Chad Givens and 
All-Southern Section forward Chris Jones, the Spartans still have talent. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Mieto, a 6-foot-7 center, is the team's only senior -- a pivotal player 
both in position and potential impact. 
</P>
<P>
Mieto will be surrounded by 6-4 guard Jeff Lord, 6-4 swingman Sean Whiting and 
6-0 point guard Jason Berns. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we're a 25-win team this year," said Hofman, whose team will 
open against Saugus in the Saugus tournament. "The experience factor is going 
to play a major role in how well we do. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we'll be right there." 
</P>
<P>
So will Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons, under 12th-year coach John Goffredo, were 17-8 overall and 6-4 in 
the Pacific League, losing in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Paul Matijasevic, a 6-7 center who averaged 10 points and 12 rebounds, 
is expected to lead Crescenta Valley, which opens play on Friday against 
Montebello in the Saugus tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Jacobson, a senior forward, also returns, but the key for the Falcons 
might be Lamar Breeding, a 5-8 senior guard who came up from the junior varsity 
for the final three games last season and led the team in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
With All-Southern Section guard John Hillman and forward Bill Worden returning, 
Hoover might also have a shot at a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman averaged 25 points a game and Worden 16 last season as the Tornadoes 
finished 9-14, 3-7 in Pacific League play. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Kirt Kohlmeier, in his 10th season, will try to blend guard Robert Calvo, 
forward Mike Evans and center Ed Allison with his high-scoring duo. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover begins its season Friday against Marshall in the Hoover-Burbank 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale should improve last season's 8-14 finish and 3-7 record in the Pacific 
League despite a relatively inexperienced team. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guards Brent Overfelt and Brian Porter were only part-time starters, but 
they join 6-6 junior Jason Harper as Dynamiter veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we shoot real well," said third-year Coach Bob Davidson, whose team 
opens against Royal on Friday in the Simi Valley tournament. "But to be 
effective we have to improve our inside game. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we're a lot better than we were last year. We're quicker and more 
tenacious." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola is favored to again win the Del Rey League, but St. Francis should 
contend for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights lost all-league guard Tom Freeman from a team that went 14-10 and 
4-4 in league play. Dominick Mumolo, a 6-2 senior in his third season with the 
varsity, is the team's most experienced player. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights, under third-year Coach John Jordan, open their season on Friday 
against Burroughs in the Hoover-Burbank tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock will be missing Michael Epps' 26-points-a-game average, but Coach 
Bill Whiting said his team has several threats from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"Top to bottom, this may be the best team we've had here since the 1982-83 
season," said Whiting, who has led the Eagles to the City Section playoffs four 
times in the last five seasons. "If we can do anything this year, it's shoot. 
We can spread it around." 
</P>
<P>
Senior guards John Padilla and Ruben Del Los Reyes and senior forward Josh Mann 
lead the Eagles, who finished 13-11 overall and 8-5 in Northern Conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock opens play on Friday against Burbank in the Hoover-Burbank 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin was 14-10 overall, 8-6 in Northern Conference play and narrowly missed 
a postseason berth after losing a league playoff game to Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The loss is still fresh in the mind of second-year Coach Robin Cardona, whose 
team will have to overcome a lack of depth. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Juwan Smith, an All-Northern Conference center who averaged 20 points a 
game, leads a Franklin team that also includes all-league guard Alphonso Pule. 
The Panthers will be bolstered by the addition of Brad Mills, who was 
ineligible last season, and Jose Molina, a good outside shooter up from the 
junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin opened play on Wednesday against Garfield but results of that game 
were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, defending champion of the Northeast League, figures to again be a 
playoff contender. The Barristers, under Coach Henfred Brard, are led by 
all-league guard Hank Hou, who averaged 16 points a game. Marshall opens its 
season next Wednesday against Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Purser, a senior guard who averaged 19 points a game, will be the key 
player for a Verdugo Hills team looking for respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Pater Noster has four returning players from a team that finished 2-17 overall 
and 1-11 in Santa Fe League play. 
</P>
<P>
Second-year Coach Michael Smith does not harbor illusions about his team's 
chances of knocking off Daniel Murphy or defending league champ Cathedral, but 
doesn't rule out a run at third place. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guards Ramy Tardos and Jerome Jaramillo lead Pater Noster, which opens 
play next Friday against Gladstone High. 
</P>
<P>
Flintridge Prep is hoping many of the players that helped the Rebels win the 
school's first Southern Section title in football this season can do the same 
thing on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Rebels were 15-12 overall, 8-2 in Prep League play, losing in 
the semifinals of both the Southern Section and state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Alex Rivera, in his 12th season at Flintridge Prep, has All-Southern 
Section guard David Swayne and all-league guard Greg Grossman back, along with 
center Chris Bisgaard and forwards Shaun Kunasaki and Chaka Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the best all-around teams I've had here," said Rivera, whose 
team begins its season on Friday against Brentwood. "When you have everybody 
back and you were in the semis in state, your expectations are high." 
</P>
<P>
Hopes are also high at Ribet Academy, the co-champion of the Heritage League 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Mike Miller, who led Cathedral to consecutive league 
championships the last two seasons, says this year's Ribet Academy team is 
better than the Fighting Frog team that made it all the way to the Southern 
Section semifinals in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Ribet has two returning all-league players in senior guard Keith Henderson and 
forward Chris Maxwell, but Miller said the pair will have to battle for playing 
time with 6-5 freshman forward Andre English and 6-3 freshmen guard Jason 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Ribet also will benefit from the addition of 6-2 Jaiquin Moore and 5-8 Jamal 
Duncan, both junior transfers from Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to win the CIF and I think we will. . . ," Moore said. "I'm going to 
be extremely disappointed if we don't play for the CIF title."

FLINTRIDGE PREP SCORES BIG, 60-35

The details escape Glen Beattie. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when you coach -- much less watch -- a football team that plays a 
game in which 95 points are scored, well, specifics can be difficult to recall. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is kind of a blur," Beattie said of Flintridge Prep's 60-35 victory 
over Pasadena Poly last weekend that gave the Rebels the Southern Section Large 
Schools Eight-Man Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first Southern Section championship of any kind for Flintridge Prep, 
which opened in 1933 and began playing at the eight-man level in 1974. The 
school has just 300 high school students. 
</P>
<P>
Flintridge Prep played in the last six-man championship game in 1973, but lost 
to Rio Hondo Prep, 39-8. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody just feels real proud," said Alex Rivera, Flintridge Prep's athletic 
director and boys' basketball coach. "Everyone on campus is celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, Flintridge Prep had beaten Poly, 27-6, by keeping the ball 
on the ground. This time the game plan changed as quarterback Chris Bisgaard 
completed 14 of 19 attempts for 347 yards and six touchdowns. David Swayne had 
10 receptions for 238 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 30-27, in the third quarter, Bisgaard and Swayne teamed up for two 
touchdowns during a 23-point surge that took just 1:57 to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great way to finish a great season," said Beattie.

<P>
It took Oscar Perez three journeys to Fresno, but he finally got the state 
cross-country championship he longed for since his sophomore year at Pater 
Noster High. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, a senior who finished second in the state in 1988, held off a final 
surge by El Cajon Christian junior David Soto to win the Division III 
individual state title last weekend at Woodward Park in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Perez led Pater Noster to a seventh-place finish in the Division III race.

Hanging in: Franklin High, the only Glendale-area team still competing in the 
football playoffs, will meet Gardena in a City Section Northern Conference 
quarterfinal game Friday night at Wilson High. 
</P>
<P>
The key to victory for Franklin? 
</P>
<P>
"Our quarterback has to play," Coach Armando Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Panther quarterback Santiago Alvarez completed 20 of 30 attempts for 208 yards 
and a touchdown during Franklin's 27-3 victory over Huntington Park last week. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, however, left the game in the third quarter with a hyper-extended 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez has passed for 3,260 yards and 46 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin defeated Gardena, 34-6, earlier this season in what Gonzales described 
as his team's best game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Over and out: Marshall High's football season came to an end with a 28-6 loss 
to unbeaten Venice in a City Section Northern Conference playoff game at 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
The Barristers finished 5-6 in a season highlighted by outstanding performances 
by quarterback Carlos Gutierrez and wide receiver Miguel Osorio. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, a senior, had the unenviable task of replacing Sid Oxford, last 
season's City Section passing leader. Gutierrez, however, surpassed Oxford 
(1,470 yards) with 1,635 yards and 22 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Osorio, also a senior, had 42 receptions for 748 yards and 13 touchdowns.

EPA SAYS ROCKWELL LAB NEEDS MORE TESTS; 
</P>
<P>
RADIATION TESTING: A REPORT ON THE SANTA SUSANA SITE DISCLOSES THAT ONLY SIX 
SAMPLES WERE TAKEN AT THE 290-ACRE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that soil and ground 
water tests show the Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth presents 
"no public health risk from radiation at this time." 
</P>
<P>
The agency gave that assessment in releasing a report on soil and water 
sampling done last July at the Rockwell International nuclear research site in 
the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"From the levels of contamination detected and their location, it is doubtful 
that contamination has spread off-site," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
But EPA officials were backpedaling slightly by the end of the day and 
predicting that there will be more tests, in part because they failed to test 
one area of known contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The main findings in the report -- the discovery of low levels of radioactive 
tritium in a ground water sample and cesium-137 in soil samples -- had been 
disclosed by EPA officials in September. 
</P>
<P>
But the report revealed for the first time that the July tests were limited to 
only six soil and water samples on the entire 290 acres at Santa Susana that 
have been used for nuclear work. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the report, Gregg Dempsey, chief of field studies for the EPA's 
radiation programs office in Las Vegas, acknowledged that the sampling was 
limited. He said the agency was under a "pretty heavy time constraint" to get 
data on potential hot spots to see "if there was an immediate problem." 
</P>
<P>
But one of these areas, called the radioactive materials disposal facility, was 
not sampled due to a communication mix-up and will probably have to be checked 
on a follow-up visit, another EPA official said late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And Dempsey said he has proposed to EPA regional officials in San Francisco 
that they fund a more complete study, involving more tests of soil, water and 
vegetation samples. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're going to find anything in any of these other areas," he 
said, but "you have to be thorough." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell officials refused to answer questions. But in a prepared statement, 
they said the report confirmed their contentions that "only very minor amounts 
of low-level contamination are present in the soil and water . . . and that 
there is no evidence of it migrating off-site." 
</P>
<P>
The cesium-137 was found in soil near Building 64, where contaminated soil was 
being cleaned up at the time of the EPA visit. Dempsey said the cesium levels 
were far above amounts deposited by fallout from atomic weapons tests, but far 
below hazard level.

VENTURA TENTATIVELY OKS CHANGE IN RENT LAW FOR MOBILE HOME PARKS; 
</P>
<P>
RENT CONTROL: THE VENTURA CITY COUNCIL ACTS TO AVOID A SERIES OF LAWSUITS 
SIMILAR TO ONE IN SANTA BARBARA THAT MAY COST THAT CITY $465,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council gave preliminary support this week to a proposed 
change in local law that would permit the owners of mobile home parks to raise 
rents on individual trailers after they have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
The change in the city's mobile home rent control ordinance was approved in 
hopes of avoiding a series of potentially costly lawsuits by local mobile home 
park owners similar to one in Santa Barbara that has changed mobile home 
ordinances throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted by City Atty. Donald S. Greenberg, the proposed change in the Ventura 
city law would allow the owners of trailer parks to increase rents by either 
15% or $35, whichever figure is largest, on individual units sold to buyers 
outside the seller's immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which still faces final council approval, was approved in a 4-2 
vote Monday night, despite opposition from some mobile home park tenants who 
argued that it erodes city rent-control protections. 
</P>
<P>
While voicing concern for mobile home residents, council members made it clear 
that they felt the overriding consideration for the city is to eliminate the 
threat of lawsuits that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal 
fees and damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're buying our peace," Councilman Richard Francis said. "I think we've 
struck a heck of a deal." 
</P>
<P>
The council vote followed a federal court decision in Los Angeles earlier this 
year that declared a mobile home rent control provision in Santa Barbara 
unconstitutional on grounds that it effectively took away the profits from 
mobile home park owners on sale of property. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial ruling, which has led several California cities to 
dramatically change their mobile home park ordinances, included the award of 
$315,000 in damages and $150,000 in legal fees to the owners of Los Amigos 
Mobile Home Estates. 
</P>
<P>
While some council members held out hope Monday that the ruling might 
eventually be overturned, Greenberg said he had been told that Santa Barbara 
had worked out a settlement that would preclude any appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara City Atty. Steven A. Amerikaner confirmed that his office has 
proposed a settlement to the Santa Barbara City Council, in which the city 
would drop its appeal in exchange for waiving the damages and attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Santa Barbara settlement, the city would have to pay that money if it 
reimposes vacancy controls in the next decade on mobile home parks. Amerikaner 
said no final council action has been taken. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura City Council's final approval of the change in the mobile home law 
is dependent on acceptance of the compromise package by a dozen mobile home 
park owners in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the opportunity to increase rents after the sale of individual 
units, the park owners would have to agree not to mount any legal challenges 
similar to that in the Santa Barbara case. 
</P>
<P>
One exception in the agreement, as worked out by Greenberg, would be the owners 
of Ventura's Marina Mobile Home Park, who already have filed lawsuits in state 
and federal court challenging the constitutionality of the Ventura mobile home 
rent control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they hope the Marina park will eventually agree to a 
settlement. But, they added, a lawsuit by one park is still preferable to a 
series of lawsuits by all the parks in Ventura.

LOCAL SURVIVORS TO BE TESTED ON FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending Division III champion Paramount and La Mirada, the surprise team of 
Division VI, are the only Southeast/Long Beach area teams remaining in the CIF 
Southern Section high school football playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount (11-1) will play Capistrano Valley (12-0) Friday night at the Santa 
Ana Bowl. In another Friday semifinal, La Mirada (9-3) will play host to La 
Quinta (8-4). Both games start at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles city playoffs, South Gate (9-0-1) will be at home against 
Westchester in a Division III second-round game Friday night at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Six area teams were eliminated last week. Poly lost to San Gorgonio, 14-6; 
Wilson fell to Fontana, 28-0; Dominguez was beaten by Mission Viejo, 34-6; 
Valley Christian lost to Tehachapi, 25-24, in two overtimes; Whittier Christian 
was defeated by Bishop, 23-13, and El Rancho was shut out by Upland, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount vs. Capistrano Valley: The Pirates advanced last week by defeating 
Hart, 16-14, on a 56-yard touchdown run by Leon Neal with 3:10 to play. 
Quarterback Jack Manu passed for 131 yards and ran for 126 on 20 carries. 
Top-seeded Capistrano Valley last week beat Santa Ana, 44-12, as quarterback 
Tony Solliday completed 10 passes for 226 yards and Paul Shaheen gained 150 
yards on 13 carries. Paramount Coach Ken Sutch is not overly concerned that the 
game is away from home. "Our team won twice on the road in the playoffs last 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta at La Mirada: La Mirada won its fifth consecutive game last week, 
defeating Western, 14-0, in the quarterfinals. Coach John Mele's Matadors held 
Western to 142 yards and won despite the absence of fullback-linebacker Joe 
Fernandez, who had hurt his back in an auto accident. Replacing Fernandez, Rob 
Hays ran for 64 yards and a TD and Kendall Alexander gained 42 yards. 
Quarterback Chad Drown threw for 130 yards, and Eric De La Cruz caught five 
passes for 94 yards and a TD. Pass-minded La Quinta is coming off a 23-16 
victory over Newport Harbor. Aztec quarterback Richard Weaver completed 17 
passes for 219 yards, and Trent Julian scored twice, the second time on a 
16-yard run that won the game. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester at South Gate: Gary Cordray's South Gate Rams, who last week 
defeated Reseda, 20-19, are 9-0-1 and have gone 24 games without a defeat. They 
were tied, 7-7, by Roosevelt two weeks ago. South Gate depends on running back 
Ivan Wilson, who averages six yards a carry. Westchester (9-2), a good running 
team with a strong defense, will try to avenge a 13-9 loss to South Gate in 
last year's championship game.

<P>
CRIME: MUGGINGS ON THE BALLONA CREEK BIKE PATH IN CULVER CITY ARE DETERRING 
SOME BEACH-GOERS FROM USING IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARAH LIFTON, Sarah Lifton is a free-lancer who lives in Culver City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been half a year since Michael Pohlenz last rode along the Ballona Creek 
Bike Path, but he remembers the occasion as vividly as if it were a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny afternoon in May, he entered the path near Sawtelle Boulevard, 
carrying only a fanny pack with a spare inner tube and some tools. It was a 
route he traveled two or three times a week, from Culver City to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, he had ridden only about 200 yards when he encountered two 
youths standing in the middle of the pavement near Culver Slauson Park. They 
held up their hands and ordered him to stop, and because they were blocking his 
way, he complied. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, there were four more behind me," he recalled. One of the original 
pair demanded all of his money. When Pohlenz explained that he hadn't brought 
any, the youth produced a large tree branch, another revealed a quart beer 
bottle, and those behind him brandished sticks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking, this is crazy, this is absurd," Pohlenz said. He began fumbling 
with his fanny pack, searching for a couple of dollars and some loose change he 
suddenly remembered stowing in it, but his attackers grew impatient. One struck 
him from behind, landing a single sharp blow on his head, arm and back. 
</P>
<P>
Pohlenz relinquished the pack, went home and has not ventured back onto the 
bike path. "I use my trainer (stationary bicycle) or I run," he says. "I feel 
like I lost my bike path." 
</P>
<P>
Police say Pohlenz's experience was far from unique. "Approximately five months 
ago, we had a series of robberies on the bike path between the 405 Freeway and 
Centinela," said David Martinez of the Los Angeles Police Department. Martinez 
is the senior lead officer responsible for monitoring crime in that 
neighborhood. Typically, he said, assailants placed debris, such as broken 
glass, shrubbery or branches, across the path, and when bicyclists would slow 
down, they would approach them with baseball bats or 2-by-4s and rob them. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one incident, the suspects identified themselves as gang members, 
but Martinez said he is reluctant to speculate about gang involvement in the 
other robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded by working a foot beat along the path, confronting possible 
suspects and intensifying their patrols in the nearby Mar Vista Gardens housing 
project, an approach they believe has eliminated the problem. "To my knowledge, 
there hasn't been an incident on the bike path, whether it be a robbery or a 
theft or an assault or anything, in the last several months," he said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, are less convinced that the problem is solved. "It's rough 
down there," said Connie Sellars, a neighbor who has lived in the area for 20 
years and who walks her dogs along the path twice a day. "I have seen rapes, I 
have seen robberies, I have seen them knock a lot of people from their 
bicycles. This whole year has been really bad." 
</P>
<P>
Sellars' daughter, Carmen, a Redondo Beach resident who bicycles the path to 
visit her mother, is among those who have been threatened. "Three fellows were 
standing together," she recalled. "It was close to the freeway underpass, and 
they had a switch-blade knife, and just as I was passing, one of them took it 
out and said, 'How would you like this, lady?' " 
</P>
<P>
When she reported the incident, which took place in June, to the police, she 
says, "They were courteous and explained that they couldn't help me. They 
didn't have enough people to patrol the bike path the way they would like to. 
They as much as said, 'Sorry, stay off the bike path.' " 
</P>
<P>
Martinez acknowledged that the path has been a frequent crime scene. "I hate to 
say yes, it happens every year, but it seems like it does happen all the time, 
primarily in the summer," he said, noting that most incidents seem to take 
place in the late afternoon and early evening. The terrain makes enforcement 
difficult, he said, because it affords predators so many hiding places. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them flee into the project area. Some of them flee down Slauson into 
the apartment buildings," he said, "and it's almost like trying to find a 
ghost." 
</P>
<P>
Detectives believe they have a lead in this year's robberies, and Martinez says 
the bike path is safe for cyclists again. The police recently discontinued 
their foot patrols and are directing their attention toward the overgrown area 
between Culver Slauson Park and the San Diego Freeway, where assailants have 
been hiding. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten hold of Caltrans, and we're working with the park," he said, "and 
we're trying to get that place cleaned up so it isn't an area where they can 
hang out and wait for bicyclists and do their drinking and drugs."

VENTURA MUST SLOW BARRICK IN BOWL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excuse Coach Phil Passno if he's somewhat apprehensive about Ventura College's 
invitation to the Hall of Fame bowl in San Diego on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-year coach is, by all means, excited about the opportunity. 
Especially after the Pirates (7-3) lost their last three regular-season games 
and looked as if they'd be couch-bound rather than bowl-bound. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura struggled after injuries and a drive-by shooting all but decimated the 
squad, but the team got its first break in weeks when the Pirates were selected 
over Cerritos (6-3-1), Fullerton (6-4) and Citrus (6-4) for the right to meet 
Palomar (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
"Things bounced our way, and I'm real happy for us," Passno said. "It's a 
quality bowl. It's an opportunity to make a little money and hopefully put on a 
good show." 
</P>
<P>
But Passno isn't jumping up and down about facing Palomar's Scott Barrick, who 
led the state in passing with 3,225 yards and broke or tied numerous school 
records. A second-team J. C. Grid-Wire All-American, Barrick set a state record 
with 248 completions. He attempted 449 passes, which is second only to Darren 
Kelderman's national record of 452 in 1984 for Iowa Lake. 
</P>
<P>
So it didn't take Passno long to conclude he doesn't want anything to do with 
Barrick (6-foot-2, 200 pounds), who throws out of a shotgun formation most of 
the time. To make matters worse, Palomar sends four targets out on almost every 
down. "I'm leaving it up to our defensive coaches," Passno said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't a bad move, considering defensive coordinator Steve Tobias has 
directed a unit that ranks 13th in the state, allowing 261 yards per game. 
Tobias is impressed with Barrick, as well as receivers Chris Chiarappa (1,282 
yards in receptions) and Eric Hanson (1,004 yards). 
</P>
<P>
"Barrick is a talented athlete, but we'll just go at it and see how we match 
up," Tobias said. "We'll just try to put some pressure on him. If you let him 
stand back there and throw, it'll be a long night." 
</P>
<P>
There have been plenty of long evenings for Palomar opponents. Barrick averages 
45 attempts, 25 completions, and 322 yards a game. He has thrown 21 touchdowns 
and 16 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen anybody like him," Tobias said. "I think it's a great 
challenge for us." 
</P>
<P>
Tobias says the best, and perhaps only defense of Barrick's bullets is 
Ventura's own ball-control offense. "The best place for him is standing on the 
sidelines, watching the game," Tobias said. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore Ventura will attempt to re-establish a once-potent rushing attack 
that was slowed by injuries to Ryan Rapoza and John Johnson. Rapoza, who broke 
a finger, is limited because of a cast but is expected -- along with Ferando 
Green and William Mills -- to provide yardage. Johnson was injured in a 
drive-by shooting two weeks ago and won't return. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Todd Paffhausen, who has thrown for 1,207 yards and 10 touchdowns, 
is healthy again. And, for the first time in weeks, Ventura is able to put a 
healthy defensive unit on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be nice to be able to put our best foot forward," Passno said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is healthy, however. All-American nose guard Eeron Wilson (broken 
arm) and defensive lineman Adam Flores (sprained ankle) are doubtful. Rico 
Jones, injured along with Johnson in the drive-by shooting, will miss the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a host of Pirates return. "The list is long and impressive," 
Passno said. 
</P>
<P>
That also could describe Ventura's string of seven consecutive wins to start 
the season. The Pirates struggled their past three games, but are eager for the 
second bowl bid under Passno and fourth overall. "It's a great opportunity for 
the kids," Passno said. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark College players won't be talking about learning experiences when 
they play Rancho Santiago College in the Orange County Bowl on Saturday at 1 
p.m. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The game is a rematch of the 1988 PONY Bowl, which Rancho Santiago won, 17-10, 
and the Raiders want revenge. Rancho Santiago (9-1) is ranked sixth in the 
state, Moorpark (9-1) is seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago averages more than 400 yards a game on offense. First-team 
All-American Estrus Crayton (6-3, 185) has rushed for 1,340 yards, and 
honorable mention quarterback Scott Wood (6-4, 205) has thrown for 2,082.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
Kwinn Knight's parents must have known they had something special when they 
slipped a win into the spelling of his name. 
</P>
<P>
He's never the biggest guy on the field. He's never the fastest, either. Yet no 
Ventura County high school football player has ever found the end zone as often 
in a single season as Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara High's 37-20 victory over Temecula Valley last week in a Southern 
Section Division VIII quarterfinal was a typical Knight night. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9, 165-pound senior tailback scored three touchdowns to give him 31 
for the season. Knight knifed nine yards up the middle for his first score, 
which gave Santa Clara a 7-6 lead in the second quarter. A one-yard Knight run 
in the third quarter gave the Saints an insurmountable 27-6 advantage and he 
added the team's final touchdown on a 12-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Knight has rushed for 21 touchdowns, caught six touchdown passes 
and returned four kicks for touchdowns. He also has four two-point conversions 
to give him 194 points. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula Valley was braced to contain the passing of Santa Clara quarterback 
Tim Gutierrez, which allowed Knight to spring free for 133 rushing yards. He 
added three receptions for 33 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, who also plays basketball and baseball, is Santa Clara's second-leading 
receiver with 59 catches for 611 yards. He has rushed for a team-high 882 yards 
in 134 carries, an average of 6.6 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has converted Coach Larry Lawrence into a Knight person. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough little competitor," Lawrence said. "He does a little bit of 
everything for us." 
</P>
<P>
Including a lot of scoring. STEVE HENSON

LOSS STIRS PLEASANT MEMORIES IN GARNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven years ago, a Culver City tailback named Rob Garner ran behind two 
behemoth linemen and carried the Centaurs to a 13-0 record and a Northwestern 
Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore Coach Curtis Garner remembers that season well. He began his coaching 
career as the Centaurs' assistant line and special-team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
And that unstoppable force was his younger brother, Rob, currently a Fillmore 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday in the Southern Section Division IX football quarterfinals, the 
Garners watched their defense get dragged across the field by two freight 
trains named Sparks and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks had 241 yards of total offense and four touchdowns and Michael 
Jones rushed for 134 yards to give Montclair Prep a 35-8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran into a good team with two potential Division I players," Garner said. 
"We thought we did a good job preparing our players. We had Montclair Prep's 
offense down cold." 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty frustrating," he added. "We would penetrate past their offensive 
line and they would run you down." 
</P>
<P>
But Montclair Prep's offense was one-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very predictable what they did," Garner said. "One ran right off guard, 
the other left. It was no great mystery. It was a matter of trying to stop 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Frontier Flashes: The Tri-Valley League doesn't have to worry about the 
resurgence of the Fillmore program because the Flashes will move to the 
Frontier League next season. 
</P>
<P>
That means Garner will spend more time watching game films and urging players 
to participate in off-season weight programs and passing leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife knows she'll be seeing less of me," Garner said. "We don't belong in 
the Frontier League. Obviously, the level of competition is much higher. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, more kids will get excited about playing football at Fillmore after 
the success we had this season." 
</P>
<P>
Bowling: Whereas bowl games generate thousands of dollars for Division I 
schools, junior college bowl games are -- not surprisingly -- often billed as a 
learning experience. In that vein, Ventura College (7-3) will get a course in 
budgeting on a shoestring when it travels to San Diego to meet Palomar (6-4) in 
the Hall of Fame Bowl on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is hoping to break even on its expenses for the trip, which involves a 
bus ride and overnight stay. Ventura Athletic Director Jerry Dunlap said it 
will cost the athletic department between $3,000-4,000 for transportation, food 
and lodging for the players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to break even," Dunlap said. "If we weren't staying the night, we 
might make some money." 
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the gate receipts go directly to the athletic committee 
sponsoring the game and the remaining 40% will be divided between the two 
schools. Between 2-5,000 fans are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Add bowling: Ventura is one of five Western State Conference teams that will 
compete in area bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield (8-0-2) will meet Taft (8-0-1) in the Shrine Potato Bowl; L. A. 
Southwest (7-2-1) will meet College of the Desert (8-2) in the Southern 
California Bowl; Valley (5-5) will play Santa Barbara (6-4) in the Western 
State Conference Bowl; and the Orange County Classic will feature Moorpark 
(9-1) and Rancho Santiago (9-1). 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a sign that our conference is tough," Ventura Coach Phil Passno 
said. "It's coming close to being one of the strongest in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Football honors: Tom Briggs of Moorpark College has been named a first-team J. 
C. Grid-Wire All-America at linebacker. One of three linebackers selected, 
Briggs, a 6-foot-6, 230-pound sophomore from Liverpool, N.Y., led Moorpark with 
19 1/2 sacks and an additional 16 1/2 behind-the-line tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark running back Freddie Bradley was selected to the second team in what 
Grid Wire publisher Hank Ives called a remarkably deep year for running backs. 
A Hueneme High graduate, Bradley (6-1, 205) led the state in scoring and rushed 
for 1,266 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Kyron Johnson (5-9, 174) a sophomore defensive back from Ventura 
High, was an honorable-mention choice. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball blitz: The 21st Moorpark College basketball tournament will be held 
at Moorpark, beginning today and running through Saturday. Moorpark (4-2) will 
open against Rio Hondo College tonight at 7. Oxnard College plays San Jose City 
College at 5 p.m., and Ventura plays Pasadena at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The championship game will be Saturday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Coaching change: Scott Randles has been hired to run the Oak Park High baseball 
program, filling a vacancy created when Ron Veres resigned in September. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy was created when Veres resigned as football and baseball coach 
Sept. 6, citing philosophical differences with the administration. 
</P>
<P>
Add coaching: Moorpark High Athletic Director Rich Uphoff will coach the boys' 
wrestling team this season after failing to find a successor to Fred Fredette. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark begins the season with an overnight trip to the Oceanside tournament 
beginning Friday.

GUTIERREZ DIRECTS SAINTS INTO SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loud laughter still punctuates practice. And Tim Gutierrez's letter-perfect X, 
Y and Z receivers continue to spend afternoons running under his passes. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara High is taking no special preparations for Trabuco Hills, the 
defending Division VIII champion and Santa Clara's opponent in a semifinal game 
Friday night at 7:30 at Oxnard High. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the workouts are loose and the spirals tight. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints, who fell in the quarterfinals last year, have learned little about 
Trabuco Hills, prefering to concentrate on what they do best: Let Gutierrez 
wing it. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad strategy considering the quarterback's stature. In all-time career 
passing yardage, the senior ranks fifth in the state and third in the Southern 
Section with 6,930. Gutierrez set a state record last season with a 70.4 
completion percentage. 
</P>
<P>
This year he has a percentage of 63.6%, hitting 189 of 297 passes for 2,618 
yards and 17 touchdowns. Gutierrez has thrown eight interceptions, only one in 
the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
He has also helped a couple of unheralded wide receivers named Jason Daw and 
Paul Muro compile eye-popping statistics. Daw, known as receiver "X" in the 
Santa Clara play book, has a county-high 61 receptions for 1,172 yards. Muro, 
who is receiver "Z," has 54 catches for 809 yards. Tight end Carlos Martinez, 
receiver "Y" and an effective run blocker, has 19 catches for 143 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Daw, a senior in his first year of high school football, has shown steady 
improvement culminating in an 11-catch performance last week. The rangy 6-1 
receiver is especially adept at breaking his route and finding an open area 
when he sees Gutierrez in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Muro, a stocky 5-11 junior who played running back his first two years at Santa 
Clara, is unafraid of catching the ball over the middle. He also starts at 
strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Kwinn Knight is Santa Clara's most experienced and versatile back and 
is a primary reason the Saints average 356 yards a game. Only 5-9, 170 pounds, 
Knight has scored a county-record 31 touchdowns on rushes, receptions and kick 
returns. He also starts at free safety. 
</P>
<P>
Fullbacks Scottie Tripp, a sophomore, and Augie Maciel, a senior, alternate 
every play. Maciel also starts at linebacker in the Saints' 5-2 defense. Mike 
Hager, another two-way starter, is the other linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Two-way lineman Leo Berry is questionable with a foot injury. Rob DeCamp will 
play offensive tackle for Berry and Antonio Gallegos will fill in at defensive 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Saint defenders, seven of whom also start on offense, are saddled with the task 
of containing the varied Trabuco Hills attack. Nose guard Roger Miranda and 
tackles Ted Lawrence and Jack McCormick must pressure Mustang quarterback Tim 
Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, a senior who was an All-Southern Section defensive back last season, 
provides leadership and quickness. He does not pass as well as Dave Lowery, 
last season's Trabuco Hills' quarterback who passed for 3,300 yards, but 
Manning (6-0, 175) makes few mistakes. He has passed for 2,111 yards with a 
completion percentage of 58.3 and he has rushed for 609 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Halfback Pete Burke (6-0, 175) and fullback Ben Rooker (6-3, 215) each have 
about 700 yards rushing. Rooker, healthy after missing five weeks with a knee 
injury, gained 134 yards last week in a 35-21 victory over Cabrillo. 
</P>
<P>
"We rushed for 335 yards last week, which the linemen thought was a lot of 
fun," Coach Jim Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Trabuco Hills is weakest at linebacker and strongest in the 
secondary. "Most teams just don't try to pass against us, although I know that 
won't be the case with Santa Clara," Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Gutierrez is bound to test a secondary that includes Manning and 
returning starter Greg Hughes at safety and cornerbacks Rick Sparks, Jim 
Skidmore and Mike Canett. All five will be on the field much of the game. 
</P>
<P>
So will Gutierrez, Knight and the X, Y, Z receivers, however, a combination 
that Santa Clara hopes spells victory. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (11-0-1) vs. Muir (10-1-1) at Citrus Junior College, Friday, 7:30 
p.m.: The misery Muir causes opponents is matched only by its own. First-year 
Coach John Tyree has had problems breaking his frisky Mustangs, especially 
junior quarterbacks Demetrius Martin and Sedrick Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas started last week for the first time since Muir's loss to Arcadia on 
Oct. 13. The Mustangs whipped San Marcos, 28-0, for their fourth shutout of the 
season, but Tyree didn't credit the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed," he said. "Neither quarterback runs the wishbone 
option well, and that's what we ought to do well. Then we go to a run-and-shoot 
and neither is any good at that, either. I'm disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
Tyree simplified the offense last week, ordering Thomas to hand the ball to 
tailback Sam Williford, who rushed for 194 yards in 24 carries. It was a marked 
increase in workload for Williford, who has only 536 yards in 80 carries all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas (6-2, 210) has rushed for 280 yards and completed 54 of 104 passes for 
874 yards and eight touchdowns. Martin, the better runner, has only 242 yards 
because, Tyree said facetiously, "He's been sacked 100 times." Martin has 
passed for 475 yards and five scores. 
</P>
<P>
When Thomas is at quarterback, Martin plays wide receiver, where he has 10 
receptions for 249 yards and four touchdowns. Thomas has three catches, all for 
touchdowns. Williford is the leading receiver with 25 catches for 447 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Although all the experimentation and turmoil would seem to assure a 
less-than-crisp Muir offense, it also makes it difficult for Thousand Oaks to 
prepare. Will the Lancers see the wishbone, the run-and-shoot, or the I 
formation? 
</P>
<P>
There is more certainty on the other side of the ball, where Muir plays a 5-2 
defense. Nine Mustang defenders made All-Pacific League, including enormous 
two-way tackle Orlando Benn (6-4, 318). There is more size at the other tackle 
in 6-3, 240-pound Moody Mussonga. 
</P>
<P>
Nose guard Reggie Hunt (5-11, 215) leads the team with 147 tackles, 91 
unassisted. Linebackers Paul Joiner and Cassius Conway each have more than 100 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Tyree is reminding them about Thousand Oaks' counter-sweep and reverse plays, 
which the Lancers have used effectively against hard-pursuing teams like Muir. 
Wide receiver Jim Magallanes has 158 yards and two touchdowns on nine reverses. 
</P>
<P>
Magallanes and free safety Steve Rudisill head a secondary that made clutch 
plays late in the Lancers' 18-13 comeback victory over Leuzinger last week. The 
defensive backs will be on the hot seat again against the fleet Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
Lancer tailback Mike Lindsay was slowed by a knee injury and gained only 408 
yards during the regular season but he has rushed for 251 yards in two playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus College, recognized as one of the best football facilities in the 
Southland, has a reputation as a fast field. "It has a crown at midfield that 
gives you the feeling you're running downhill toward either end zone," Tyree 
said.

LOYOLA CAGER OUT FOR REPAIRS TO SHOOTING HAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount basketball team will go into this weekend's Gator Bowl 
Tournament at Jacksonville, Fla., with one of its top guns, in the words of its 
coach, being retooled. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Jeff Fryer broke the fourth metacarpal in his right -- shooting -- 
hand (a bone near the thumb, not his ring finger as earlier reported), but 
things could be worse. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped Fryer will be back in uniform before Oklahoma comes to town 
Christmas week, and for a change Coach Paul Westhead has enough depth at guard 
to consider several lineup variations. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer led the nation in three-pointers while averaging 22.9 points as a junior 
and is scoring 24.5 after two games this season. His hand was injured in 
Saturday's 145-102 victory over Nevada Reno, with Fryer scoring 26 points and 
four three-pointers. Westhead said, though, that Fryer's hard-nosed intangibles 
may be missed more than his scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (the team) at practice somebody's going to have to take the shots, and 
everybody smiled," Westhead said. "Then I added, 'And get the steals and the 
dives and the hustle.' " 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, Fryer has bounced back from previous injuries faster than expected. He 
will miss this weekend's two tournament games and a Dec. 7 contest at U.S. 
International. Depending on medical clearance, he could be back in uniform in 
time to play a Dec. 16 exhibition against Athletes in Action. The Lions' Dec. 9 
game against UC Santa Barbara is improbable, but not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no exact timetable," Westhead said. "I know this -- whenever the 
doctor says he can play, he'll be ready. He's not one of these guys who needs a 
week to get back after he's given the OK. He's always been a quick healer, 
physically and emotionally. He came back from the doctor's yesterday (Monday) 
with a cast and ran around the outside of practice the whole time we were on 
the floor. You hate to lose a guy like that." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead, who was injured as a senior at St. Joseph's University, seemed to 
feel worse for Fryer personally than for the loss to the team. "It's really a 
shame. He's playing very, very well at this moment," Westhead said. "It's 
doubly tough when you're a senior. Every day of practice, every game is 
important to him -- and to us. It's something I really have empathy for. On the 
plus side, hopefully it'll only be a two-week problem, not one of those 
debilitating things that lingers for the whole year." 
</P>
<P>
In Fryer's absence, Westhead has the option of starting junior Tom Peabody at 
forward and shifting Bo Kimble back to guard or starting sophomore Terrell 
Lowery in Fryer's place.

FAMILY LIFE: BEWARE THAT POP GOBBLE-GOBBLEDYGOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pop psychologists remind me of a herd of turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
If you've ever been around a herd of turkeys, you will understand the analogy. 
All is quiet, then off in the distance one turkey will let out with a 
"gobble-gobble!" that will be picked up by another, then another. Like a wave, 
the noise sweeps across the whole herd until the clamor is deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just as suddenly, all is quiet, leaving you to wonder what in heaven's 
name that was all about. The turkey that first hollered may have had a reason; 
his backside may have been caught on the fence. Then, again, he may just have 
been clearing his gullet. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same with the waves of diagnoses and treatment in pop psychology. New 
illnesses or approaches to them pop up with regularity, sweep across the land, 
then disappear. (You may remember primal screaming, Rolfing and curling up into 
a fetal position.) 
</P>
<P>
Before all of this gobbledygook disappears, however, a lot of minds have been 
messed with and a lot of bucks made off books, lectures, workshops, therapy 
sessions, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The latest buzzword is codependency, which I think is more related to the 
turkey with the backside caught in the fence than the one clearing his gullet. 
This hollering has a solid origin. 
</P>
<P>
The term was first used to describe people who have sick relationships with 
sick people: wives or husbands who stay with violent alcoholics or drug 
abusers, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show an astronomical divorce rate after the offending mate cleans up 
his or her act. Quite obviously, then, the non-abuser in the relationship has 
some need for the other to be totally out of control and for themselves to live 
what a therapist friend of mine terms "vicarious lives." 
</P>
<P>
But that narrow (and sensible) definition has now been expanded -- it seems to 
me -- so that we all qualify. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can answer 'yes' to three of these questions, you need these books," 
was the headline in an ad I saw recently pushing about a dozen volumes on the 
subject (average price, $29.95). 
</P>
<P>
I would defy anyone not to answer "yes" to at least three of the 10 questions. 
As a matter of fact, I would be disappointed (although not surprised in these 
times) in someone who answered "no" to couple of them. 
</P>
<P>
Take this one: "Do you find it easier to be concerned about others than 
yourself?" Most religions, I would point out, preach just that. People who 
answer "yes" might be better defined as compassionate or selfless than as 
codependent. 
</P>
<P>
Or, "Do you feel inadequate or guilty when you cannot help someone for whom you 
feel responsible?" I for one feel pretty inadequate when my children are ill or 
hurt, don't you? 
</P>
<P>
Or how about, "Do you have trouble accepting personal criticism?" I know a lot 
of people, including any number of therapists, who would play hell answering 
"no" to that one. 
</P>
<P>
The new definition of "codependency," I gather from the press releases and 
calls I get, now envelops not only extreme cases of sick reliance on a loved 
one's own sickness, but extends to any number of lesser problems that have all 
been lumped together to create what the poppers call "dysfunctional families." 
</P>
<P>
Now, I know there are disturbed families out there, people who physically or 
emotionally abuse each other and anyone else who lives in the same house. And I 
would very much like for those people to get help. 
</P>
<P>
What bothers me, however, rests on another definition. What is dysfunctional? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we all are to a certain extent, but where do we draw the line between 
normal family problems and crises and the need to pack up the family and head 
for the nearest therapist or bookshop? 
</P>
<P>
In the broadest terms, we are all dependent on others -- as they are on us -- 
for many things, including an emotionally healthy life. 
</P>
<P>
For example, our children, husbands and wives are dependent on us for love and 
understanding, and we depend on them for the same in return. And don't forget 
everyday relationships with employers, doctors or grocers. Are they also not 
codependencies? 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that these waves of pop psychology, no matter how well grounded 
initially, are invariably turned into marketing tools for private therapists 
and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there are not altruistic people in the profession, mind you. It's just 
that my observation is, frankly, that most people have all the altruism they 
can afford. 
</P>
<P>
I can remember some years ago attending a lecture by a pop psychologist in San 
Diego. "How many of you consider yourselves happy?" he asked the audience. 
About 80% of the people raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean really happy," he went on. "Gut-wrenching happy. Ecstatic everyday 
happy. Get-up-in-the-morning-God-I-love-life happy, every day of your life." 
</P>
<P>
Only the village idiot could raise his hand at that. 
</P>
<P>
The message was clear. For a few bucks, this guy could put you on the road to 
bliss. 
</P>
<P>
He had The Answer. 
</P>
<P>
They all do. 
</P>
<P>
So, I think for now I'll just skip the question, thank you.

ASK THE VET: SNEEZING CAT MAY SPREAD INFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: In the past week, my two cats have started to sneeze and have runny eyes. 
They both are eating OK but look like they feel bad. My husband and I have both 
had colds recently and I wonder if my cats were able to catch our colds. Is 
this possible? They are both indoor/outdoor cats and have always been very 
healthy. What should I do to treat them? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. John Sharpe, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
A: It is extremely unlikely that your cats got their colds from you because 
most cold viruses tend to be species specific. However, cats do occasionally 
have an organism called chlamydia psittaci, which causes runny eyes and 
sneezing and could be spread to humans. In man, if the organism comes into 
contact with your eyes, it can cause a burning, watery eye irritation. I would 
recommend that you wash your hands thoroughly after handling your sneezing cats 
and try not to let them sneeze into your face. Fortunately, the eye infection 
is treatable with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
You should have your cats examined by your veterinarian to help determine what 
type of infection they may have. It would also be wise to update your cat's 
vaccinations, especially for chlamydia. Your vet will most likely start your 
cats on antibiotics and eye medication to help ease their symptoms and 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
Cats also can get a herpes virus that can cause upper respiratory problems, 
including sneezing. This virus can be spread to people by contact with the 
discharge, and can cause some irritation. If you follow proper cleanliness 
after handling your sneezing cats, your risk for exposure is minimal. In either 
case, there are vaccines available to help protect your cats. 
</P>
<P>
Q: This may be a silly question but can cats or dogs see colors? Our dog 
occasionally watches TV, and I wonder if he can see the colors or is it just 
the motion? 
</P>
<P>
NNS, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A: Cats and dogs do not have the ability to see colors other than black and 
white and the various shades in between. The retina or back part of the eye 
that receives light does not have the proper neuro receivers for sensing color. 
Your dog may be responding to the motion or sounds coming from the television 
when he "watches" TV.

SOCCER FUNDS BORROWED, ACCUSED'S LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The treasurer of an Escondido-based youth soccer organization took about 
$27,000 from the group to help her failing business, an accounting and tax 
service, but hoped to return the money before it was missed, the woman's 
attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The admission came outside the courtroom after Paula Archie, 34, pleaded not 
guilty to 21 counts of forgery, one count of grand theft and one count of 
embezzlement. All are felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Archie's attorney, Michael Berg, said his client took 
about $27,000 from the North County Youth Soccer Assn. and is now "full of 
remorse. She's extremely distraught. No one feels worse than Paula." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer directors of the soccer group, which has 1,800 members, discovered 
the money shortage earlier this month when a check bounced and the group's bank 
told them the account was empty. 
</P>
<P>
Directors thought they had about $50,000 in the bank, and, after their own 
initial investigation, contacted Escondido police. Archie was arrested Nov. 9 
and released after posting $34,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
With Archie sitting at his side in the courthouse hallway, Berg said the money 
was taken to "support a business that was failing. She needed the business to 
pay rent on her house and to care for her son. It was a subsidy of her 
struggling personal business, done in anticipation of making a full and 
complete restitution before people missed the money." 
</P>
<P>
"But it caught up to her too quick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Berg said the only discrepancy his client has with prosecutors is the amount of 
money alleged to have been taken. Although she concedes she took about $27,000, 
the court complaint lists $29,191 in missing funds. 
</P>
<P>
Berg said he could not explain an earlier statement by Escondido police 
investigators that more than $45,000 was missing from the group's bank 
accounts. Police said some of the missing money was cash from snack bar sales 
that were to have been deposited in the organization's account. League 
officials have yet to complete their audit of the books. 
</P>
<P>
The group's funds, which are generated through registration fees, snack bar 
sales and business sponsorships in the community, are spent on trophies, 
uniforms, referees and travel to out-of-town competitions. The organization 
operates on an annual budget of about $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege 21 instances of Archie forging the signature of another 
organization official in writing checks from the soccer group and depositing 
them into her own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very uncomfortable situation for both sides," Berg said. "It was an 
unfortunate decision on her part that the money wasn't repaid in time. But her 
family supports her, she hasn't lost any business clients, and the parents of 
the victims don't really want to see anything really bad happen to her." 
</P>
<P>
John Snow, president of the soccer group, said he would not comment on the case 
on the advice of the group's attorney, who himself was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The soccer season ended Nov. 18 with championship playoffs, and players at the 
time received their trophies thanks to financial contributions from the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Archie was ordered to return to court Dec. 13 for her preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the then-president of the Fallbrook Youth Soccer Program, Joe 
McDowell, pleaded guilty after being accused of stealing about $21,000 raised 
through candy sales. The money was alleged to have been gambled away on horse 
races.

EX-SERVICEMEN ENVISION PACIFIC WARS MEMORIAL ON CAMP PENDLETON SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of ex-servicemen that includes five retired Marine Corps generals 
announced Wednesday a plan to raise $15 million in private donations to build a 
Pacific Wars Memorial on a 35-acre site at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1992, the camp's 50th anniversary, the group hopes to unveil a 
monument, military museum, parade deck and memorial groves as a tribute to all 
branches of the service that fought in the Pacific from World War II to 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this will be as impressive as the Iwo Jima Memorial in Washington, 
D.C., or we won't build it," said Randy Mitchell, a retired Marine major who 
lives in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a museum was explored in 1985, but nothing was done until the base 
commander, Brig. Gen. R. H. Huckaby, resurrected the plan in late 1988 with 
retired Marine Lt. Gen. E. J. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, of Carlsbad, said Tuesday that both Huckaby and Marine Corps Commandant 
Al Gray have approved leasing the property "for a nominal fee" to the nonprofit 
foundation that was formed and licensed with the state to build the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing similar to this on the West Coast," Miller said. "The main 
emphasis is going to be based on integrity." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed memorial on gently sloping land next to the camp's main gate would 
offer a 30,000-square-foot museum of military artifacts and battle displays, a 
library, small auditorium and gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
A national competition probably will be held to seek a memorial design, and the 
foundation also wants the memorial to contain a Pacific Wars Grove of 
vegetation and trees native to the places where campaigns were fought. 
</P>
<P>
The central memorial, easily visible from Interstate 5, "will symbolically pay 
tribute to the servicemen and women who have fought and died to protect the 
freedoms we enjoy in this country," said a report written by Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Miller emphasized that the memorial is meant to honor, inspire and teach the 
military, and inform and remind the public about the sacrifices made in the 
Pacific during World War II, Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
When Huckaby and Miller rekindled the plan, the first move was to create a 
committee of retired Marines in Southern California to serve as the executive 
board of the foundation. Miller is president of the board, to which Huckaby 
named members of his own staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't any money yet, and we haven't designed anything," Mitchell said. 
"We're at the first step, even though we've been working on this for a year." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation will begin seeking corporate and private donations early next 
year. "This will be an international campaign, and will raise money overseas," 
Mitchell said. No government money is being sought, he said.

BATTLE GROWS OVER SCHOOLS' MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE COURTROOM SHOWDOWN PROMISES TO SHOW THE INNER WORKINGS OF A 
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE THEIR PRIVACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After voting 16 to 5 to merge with Harvard School on Monday night, trustees 
from Westlake School adjourned to Jimmy's restaurant to celebrate a "wonderful 
dream" come true. 
</P>
<P>
"What this is about is creating a wonderful school," exulted Westlake Trustee 
Sheldon Sloan, predicting that it will "set standards not just for the West but 
for the United States. We're going to have a first-class prep school in this 
town the likes of which has not been seen before." 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the festivities at the tony Beverly Hills eatery were a small group 
of trustees who viewed the merger as the death of a dream that was Westlake 
School. 
</P>
<P>
In their effort to preserve the independence of the prestigious Holmby Hills 
school whose graduates include actress Candice Bergen and astronaut Sally Ride, 
merger opponents, including two trustees, have filed suit seeking to block it. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends that the merger was ill-conceived and was brought to a vote 
without sufficient consideration of the options. The opponents contend that the 
deal was engineered by a group of wealthy, socially prominent people led by 
Peter and Helen Bing. The Bings, West Los Angeles residents who are active in a 
variety of local philanthropic efforts, have close ties to both schools. 
</P>
<P>
A third trustee, David May II, a scion of the department store family, quit the 
board after 24 years as a trustee to protest the merger, contending that 
Harvard's ties to the Episcopal Church were not compatible with Westlake's 
non-sectarian traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the merger would essentially cede Westlake's $50-million Holmby 
Hills property to Harvard, whose ex officio board president is Frederick H. 
Borsch, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. In their lawsuit, they 
point out that an article in the November issue of the diocesan newsletter 
quotes Harvard Headmaster Thomas C. Hudnut as confirming a continued 
relationship with the church in the merged junior and senior high school. 
</P>
<P>
Since the surprise announcement in October that a merger had been agreed upon 
in principle, the Westlake community has been in an uproar. A coalition of 
alumnae, parents and students oppose the merger for reasons varying from a 
preference for single-sex education to a concern that the venerable girls' 
school had underestimated its value and made a bad business bargain. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Harvard parents favor going co-ed, in keeping with a national 
trend among private boys' schools. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeking to block the merger was filed by Westlake parents and has been 
joined by Trustees Anita May Rosenstein, David May's daughter, and Rodney 
Berle. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom showdown promises to reveal in considerable detail the inner 
workings of a group of people who like to keep their business private, 
particularly the Bings. Helen Bing is a Westlake trustee and benefactor, and 
Peter Bing, a physician, serves in a similar capacity at Harvard, whose campus 
is in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for her thoughts on the merger and her role in it, Helen Bing said, "I 
really don't have any comment to make." 
</P>
<P>
Sworn declarations filed in Los Angeles Superior Court allege that the merger 
was the work of a cabal of Bing associates on the Westlake board, and that 
other board members were unwilling to challenge the deal because of the Bings' 
social prominence and financial power. 
</P>
<P>
According to the declarations, Trustee Sloan is an attorney for the Bings, as 
is Daniel Belin, husband of Trustee Daisy Belin. Helen Bing's personal 
physician, Gary Gitnick, is a trustee, the documents said. Sloan declined to 
comment on his professional ties to the Bings. Belin and Gitnick could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A letter to the board from David May included in the lawsuit documents notes 
that in 1981 Helen Bing donated the money to buy a home for Westlake Headmaster 
Nathan Reynolds and his family, who had been living in what May said were 
deplorable conditions on campus. 
</P>
<P>
May also noted that Bing had vowed to withdraw her financial support for 
Westlake if she did not get her way about the merger. 
</P>
<P>
A blistering attack on the manner in which the merger was handled is included 
in one letter from May to Helen Bing that is included in the documents. "I feel 
that everything that you and Peter want to accomplish could have been done very 
easily if it was done in a businesslike and tasteful manner that you had every 
right to expect." 
</P>
<P>
May characterized the handling of the merger as "incompetent," lacking in 
"prudent judgment, tasteless, insensitive and heavy-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the same letter, May said two expressions he had never before used 
came to mind in describing the terms of the merger: "male chauvinist" and 
"sexist." 
</P>
<P>
Under the signed merger agreement, the new school will be named 
Harvard-Westlake, the board will be controlled by current Harvard trustees and 
Hudnut will run the school. Reynolds, who is nearing retirement age, will be 
provost. Harvard's Studio City facilities would become the campus for high 
school-age students and lower grades would be housed at Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan and Reynolds used exactly the same words to respond to the lawsuit's 
charges that the merger was engineered by the Bings and boosted by cronyism on 
the Westlake board. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nonsense," the two men said in separate interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan said the real issue -- education -- has gotten lost amid the fight over 
the process, which he concedes was imperfect. "There's nothing nefarious. No 
secret deals. No smoking guns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Bing is by all accounts a tireless worker for Westlake and a major 
benefactor. "She's an incredible human being," Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even as he criticizes the merger in his letters, May describes Helen 
Bing as the school's "most valuable trustee," even without considering her 
financial support. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to serving as a Harvard trustee, Peter Bing serves on the Stanford 
University board and is a director of the Times Mirror Co., which publishes the 
Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bing's mother is Anna Bing Arnold, whose philanthropic activities are 
legendary in Los Angeles. The family fortune came from the New York real estate 
holdings of Arnold's first husband, Leo Bing. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to thwart the merger, the Westlake parents have raised $4.7 
million in cash and pledges, with Trustees Berle, television mogul Aaron 
Spelling and film executive Samuel Goldwyn offering to cover the school's 
deficit for the next four years if the merger is thwarted -- the assumption 
being that Westlake may lose some students if Harvard goes coeducational on its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit questions, however, whether Harvard is actually poised to go co-ed 
on its own, and whether Westlake must immediately decide to merge or be left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
According to a letter from Hudnut to Harvard parents, the Studio City school 
has no timetable to become co-ed. 
</P>

STUNT: SUIT OVER BLAST

Producers of the "Airwolf" television series "gambled with Desiree Kerns' life 
and career" by having the stunt woman unknowingly detonate a gasoline bomb in a 
pickup truck while she was in the vehicle, her lawyer said Wednesday during a 
civil trial in San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns, 33, suffered second- and third-degree burns on her face, scalp, neck and 
arm as she leaped from a pickup truck rigged with an explosive device in a 1985 
stunt for the television series. She is suing the show's director, producer, 
stunt coordinator and special-effects coordinator for unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Kerns' attorney, Gerald L. Kroll, told jurors that 
the show's producers were "on a limited budget and running out of time," so 
they set up the dangerous stunt "the cheap and easy way." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the script called for a stunt woman to detonate a smoke bomb, then 
jump out of the truck. Cameramen were to film the truck explosion later, Kroll 
said, when there were no passengers inside. 
</P>
<P>
But to save time and money, stunt coordinator Ron Stein, one of the four 
defendants, decided Kerns would detonate the gasoline bomb while she was still 
in the truck so the shot could be filmed in one take rather than two, Kroll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stein never told Kerns of the change in plans, fearing that Kerns, who 
had little experience with pyrotechnics and stunts involving fire, would refuse 
to perform the stunt. He told her just to "press the button and jump out of the 
truck," Kroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Thomas A. Foster denied that "Airwolf" producers ignored 
safety to save money. Foster said Stein and others discussed the stunt with 
Kerns several times and "she appeared to hear what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
A special-effects technician specifically told Kerns that she would detonate a 
gasoline bomb, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
But when the 20-foot-high fireball engulfed the truck, Kerns was not wearing 
any of the standard safety devices used in pyrotechnic stunts, her attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She had no protective clothing, no fire retardant wig or fire retardant gel 
for her skin. She did not request these things because she expected smoke. She 
had no reason to expect fire," Kroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Kroll said the accident occurred just as Kerns "hit the magic stride of her 
career that stunt people dream of." After seven years in the business, she had 
daily stunt jobs and grossed about $200,000 a year, Kroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, he said, Kerns has not performed any stunt work.

AUTHORITIES GET 2 CONFLICTING CONFESSIONS TO PAINTING'S THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators believe they have one confession too 
many in the theft of a 17th-Century Dutch painting recovered at the apartment 
of two Lancaster men who were arrested for stealing the $18,000 artwork. 
</P>
<P>
The roommates, one of whom is an art student at Antelope Valley College where 
the painting was stolen Nov. 6, have both confessed to taking the painting off 
the wall of the college art gallery and walking out with it, Detective J. 
Siebert said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Siebert believes only one person stole "Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a 
Landscape," painted by Gerard Hoet the Elder before 1700. Each suspect says the 
other is innocent, Siebert said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're probably trying to protect each other," he said. "Both say they don't 
want the other one to get in trouble for something he didn't do. I believe one 
is the thief and the other is an accessory." 
</P>
<P>
Jereld Sharitz, 23, a student at the college, and Timothy Cain, a 27-year-old 
grocery clerk, were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of grand theft. Cain was 
arrested at their apartment in the 43300 block of Gadsen Avenue in Lancaster 
and Sharitz surrendered shortly afterward at the sheriff's station, the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Siebert said he has been notified by the owner's lawyer that the work, which 
was recovered in good condition, is worth about $18,000 -- considerably lower 
than the tentative estimate of $50,000 to $100,000 made by college officials. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies served a search warrant Tuesday afternoon after an acquaintance of the 
suspects told Siebert he had seen the painting in their apartment and 
recognized it from news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Sharitz was released on $1,500 bail, and Cain remained in custody Wednesday in 
lieu of the same bail amount, Siebert said. 
</P>
<P>
The theft last month abruptly ended the college's first major art show "Great 
European Masterpieces," an exhibit featuring 18 paintings owned by Lancaster 
businessman Kenneth McDonald. The show was monitored by a student aide and 
occasionally by security guards. The gallery alarm functions only when the 
building is closed for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Sharitz told investigators he took the painting because he liked it and because 
it was nearest to the gallery entrance, Siebert said. Cain, meanwhile, said he 
stole the painting as a gift for Sharitz, Siebert said. 
</P>
<P>
Gallery director Pat Hinds described Sharitz as a student with a "healthy 
interest in art. I was surprised. He's a very nice person." 
</P>
<P>
Sharitz has been taking courses at the college since 1983, college officials 
said. This semester he is enrolled in a ceramics class taught in a room next to 
the gallery, they said.

4,500-ACRE FIRE HALTED AS SANTA ANA WINDS DIE 
</P>

<P>
The Black Mountain brush fire, which burned 4,500 acres between Rancho 
Penasquitos and Del Mar, was contained Wednesday evening as fierce Santa Ana 
winds finally died down, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By 6 p.m., the blaze that forced thousands of people to flee homes, schools and 
businesses Tuesday afternoon was termed 95% contained and was expected to be 
controlled later in the night. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said brush fires in Santee and on the Mesa Grande Indian 
Reservation that burned a combined 470 acres have been contained. 
</P>
<P>
In the Black Mountain fire, authorities said out-of-town crews, some from 
Laguna Hills and San Bernardino, were sent home by mid-afternoon Wednesday, 
with a skeleton crew of 20 left to control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Residents began returning to homes in the McGonigle Canyon and Shaw Valley 
areas near North City West on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, officials 
said, and owners are being asked to retrieve horses from emergency quarters at 
the Del Mar Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
Officials don't know the cause of the Black Mountain blaze, which began burning 
out of control Tuesday morning near Emden and Black Mountain roads in Rancho 
Penasquitos. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by Santa Ana gusts estimated as strong as 60 m.p.h., the fire quickly 
raced west and threatened homes in a broad area between inland Interstate 15 
and coastal Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Evergreen Nursery on Black Mountain Road lost four structures 
on the 80-acre property, estimating the damage as high as $160,000. A pair of 
trailers in Shaw Valley near Shaw Ridge Road were also destroyed. Three 
elementary schools and Torrey Pines High School were evacuated Tuesday 
afternoon, but despite the scare, the fire claimed no deaths and not a single 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
In Santee, about 300 acres of brush burned before firefighters from San Diego, 
Orange County and other areas helped the Santee Fire Department control the 
blaze late Tuesday night, Santee spokesman Edd Long said. 
</P>
<P>
That fire started Tuesday evening near El Nopal and Magnolia Avenue and swept 
west, extending to the end of Fanita Parkway near Santee Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Three juveniles were arrested in Santee late Tuesday and booked on suspicion of 
starting the fire with a device resembling a flame thrower, the San Diego 
County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire that started on Mesa Grande Road near the Mesa Grande Indian 
Reservation not far from Ramona burned 170 acres before being brought under 
control Wednesday, officials said.

NEW BOARD FACES OLD FEELINGS ABOUT RACE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THREE NEW MEMBERS OF THE CENTINELA VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT 
BOARD WHO SCORED UPSETS OVER SUPPORTERS OF A BLACK SUPERINTENDENT WERE AMONG 
THOSE HEARING COMPLAINTS ABOUT TENSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The traditional political honeymoon for newly elected officials didn't last 
past the swearing-in ceremony in the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after new board members Jacqueline Carrera, Amparo Font and Pam 
Sturgeon took office Tuesday night, more than a dozen parents, educators and 
community leaders took to the podium to complain about racial tension in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the speakers, most of whom were black, indicated they would fight 
any plans that the revamped board may have to force out black Supt. McKinley 
Nash or the minority administrators serving under him. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here primarily to avert a great miscarriage of the educational process," 
said Jose De Sosa, president of the NAACP's California State Conference. "It is 
not our intention to stand idly by when the board takes action that could 
create severe problems in the school district." 
</P>
<P>
Said Nathaniel Jackson, dean of vocational programs at El Camino College: 
"Realize that racism and bigotry have no place when you're trying to care for 
our children. Take the courageous step: Keep your superintendent." 
</P>
<P>
New board members, who deny they have hatched plans to dislodge the Nash 
administration, appealed for calm. Sturgeon sought to assure the audience that 
questions about the new board's commitment to racial equality were rooted in 
false rumors spread during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been accused of many things in my lifetime, but I have never been 
accused of racism and bigotry until I ran for this board," Sturgeon said at one 
point in the nearly five-hour meeting. "I am not a racist. All I'm asking is 
that you give me a chance and I'll give you a chance, and maybe we'll pull this 
district together." 
</P>
<P>
Speculation about a possible administrative shake-up has been strong since the 
Nov. 7 school board election, when Sturgeon and Carrera, both of whom have been 
critical of Nash, beat two incumbents who were strong supporters of the 
superintendent. Font unseated a third Nash supporter but has not voiced an 
opinion on the superintendent, whose $89,000-a-year contract expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The fall campaign was marred by controversy over allegations that white 
teachers working to unseat the board incumbents had also been harassing 
minority administrators appointed by Nash. The charges have caused racial 
tension in the fast-changing district, where more than half the student 
population was Latino, 18.7% white and 17.1% black in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Among the race-related allegations aired Tuesday was a charge by De Sosa that a 
Hawthorne High School teacher gloated to students in class the day after the 
school board election that the new board would remove minority administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne High Principal Ken Crowe confirmed in an interview that a minority 
student in the class and her parents have filed a formal complaint alleging 
that the teacher made racially derogatory comments about black administrators 
who he hoped would be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said he could not release the names of the people involved but said the 
student, a senior, and another member of the class reported the incident to him 
the day it was alleged to have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to see me because they were upset," Crowe said. "It was just very 
racially derogatory stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Tuesday's meeting was the swearing-in of Carrera, Font and 
Sturgeon and the election of new officers by the five-member board. (Board 
members picked veterans Ruth Morales and Michael Escalante as president and 
vice president, respectively, and chose Carrera as clerk.) 
</P>
<P>
Soon after these events had been marked with a pause for fruit punch, coffee 
and cookies, however, the new board found itself embroiled in the race-related 
concerns generated by the outcome of the election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In that contest, board incumbents Ann Birdsall, Aleta Collins, and Herbert 
Bartelt -- all strong supporters of Supt. Nash -- were swept from office. The 
upsets have been attributed in part to the work of the Centinela Valley 
Secondary Teachers Assn., the union that represents the district's 
overwhelmingly white teaching corps. 
</P>
<P>
The union, which Nash blames for the alleged harassment of his minority 
administrators, formally endorsed Carrera and Sturgeon and gave them strong 
campaign support. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, Carrera underscored her Hispanic heritage and sought 
to make clear that she would not be beholden to the teachers union, saying she 
considers herself "a very independent person.'

NEW SITE OKD FOR MONUMENT TO KOREAN VETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A proposed monument to Korean War veterans came one step closer to fruition 
last week when the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Commission gave its approval to 
plans that call for a heavily landscaped monument at a new site, some 300 yards 
from the Korean Friendship Bell at San Pedro's Angels Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great news," said Jack Stites, who heads the veterans group that is 
sponsoring the monument. "It was like a monstrous weight off my shoulders. 
We're well on our way now." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's unanimous commission vote was an important step for the veterans, 
but it is by no means the last hurdle the group will have to jump. 
</P>
<P>
Before construction can begin, three other public agencies -- the Los Angeles 
Recreation and Parks Commission, the state Coastal Commission and the state 
Office of Historic Preservation -- must also approve the monument. Once those 
approvals are obtained, the Cultural Affairs Commission and the Recreation and 
Parks Commission each will review the plans again -- this time for final 
approval before construction begins -- in case any changes have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Affairs Commission's preliminary approval last Wednesday came 
nearly six months after that city board first heard -- and rejected -- a 
different plan for the Korean War memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the veterans group has changed the site of the memorial and its 
design has been altered significantly. The new plan calls for opening up an 
unused entrance to the park along Paseo Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
According to Niki Lupo, the commission's executive assistant, some of the 
changes were instituted by a landscape architect who volunteered his services 
at the request of commissioner Michael Chan. 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioners were just ecstatic about the developments in the site plan," 
said Lupo. The new landscaping "just made a world of difference." 
</P>
<P>
The International Korean War Veterans Memorial -- so named because it will 
honor veterans from 22 countries that participated in the United Nations forces 
-- is proposed for a site near the Osgood- Farley Battery, not far from the 
Korean Friendship Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans initially wanted to place the monument next to the bell, but the 
commissioners rejected that plan, saying the monument would interrupt the 
peaceful atmosphere of the bell. The initial plans called for a central 
sculpture of 12 soldiers in battle atop a granite base, encircled by the flags 
of each nation whose veterans were being honored. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stites, the new plans call for a sculpture of 11 male soldiers in 
battle and a separate sculpture of a female nurse gesturing toward the 
soldiers. (At a previous hearing, the cultural affairs commissioners had 
insisted a woman be included in the memorial.) 
</P>
<P>
The central sculpture will sit atop an earthen berm and will be ringed by a 
horseshoe of low-growing pine trees, Stites said. Two landscaped paths will 
lead to the monument, one from the parking lot next to the bell and another 
from a new, 15-space parking lot that the veterans propose to build off an 
existing road that leads from the Paseo Del Mar entrance to the monument site. 
</P>
<P>
Stites said his group hopes to have all its approvals in time to begin 
construction this spring.

ROCKWELL'S EMERGENCY PLAN CHALLENGED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A JUDGE RULES THAT PLANS FOR DEALING WITH ACCIDENTS AT THE SANTA 
SUSANA FIELD LAB INACCURATELY IMPLY AGREEMENTS WITH AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An administrative judge for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has 
questioned the accuracy of the on-site emergency plan prepared by Rockwell 
International for its Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Peter B. Bloch, in an order dated Tuesday, gave Rockwell 30 days to 
explain why the emergency plan lists local hospitals and fire stations that 
have no arrangements with Rockwell to respond to a radiological emergency at 
the test site in the Simi Hills, where the firm does nuclear research for the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing the order, Bloch affirmed a local activist's contentions that the 
plan inaccurately implies that firm agreements exist between the company and a 
host of off-site agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Donald W. Wallace, head of the anti-nuclear Rocketdyne Cleanup Coalition, told 
Bloch at a public hearing in late September that the plan was "rife with false 
assurances." Wallace said he had checked with some Los Angeles fire stations 
and found they had not agreed to provide ambulance service as the plan 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
NRC inspectors followed up the allegation and reported to Bloch earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
A Rockwell spokesman said the company had not seen Bloch's order and could not 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency plan did not specifically state that there were firm agreements, 
but it listed a host of police, sheriff's and fire stations, and hospitals that 
it said "are supportive in any emergency situation that may arise at the Santa 
Susana site." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch also took issue with the NRC's report on the accuracy of the statement. 
He noted, for example, that NRC inspectors interviewed Rockwell but not 
Wallace. And he questioned a conclusion in the NRC report that the 
discrepancies did not violate NRC rules. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NRC's report, Rockwell has a "verbal agreement" with one of 
the listed hospitals, whose personnel have been trained in treating 
radioactively contaminated patients. But two other listed hospitals merely 
"expressed an interest" in providing such care, the NRC said. 
</P>
<P>
Other "statements related to support from L.A. organizations" were apparently 
copied from versions of the plan that were in effect when Rockwell's plant in 
Canoga Park was under NRC license, the NRC report said. Santa Susana is in 
eastern Ventura County, where Los Angeles agencies normally do not operate. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo accompanying the report, NRC official Gregory Yuhas said it appeared 
Rockwell "did not falsify information . . . though someone reading the plan 
could incorrectly infer that there were direct formal arrangements" with 
"off-site parties." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said it was not clear if NRC officials had considered the possibility 
that Rockwell violated agency rules "by submitting misstatements -- apparently 
negligent or grossly negligent misstatements -- in an application for a 
license." 
</P>
<P>
Ross Scarano, director of radiological safety at the NRC's western regional 
office in Walnut Creek, said Wednesday that Rockwell had sufficient emergency 
response agreements, even though it inaccurately listed some off-site agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But Scarano, backing away from the NRC report's conclusions that Rockwell 
violated no rules, said the commission may yet cite Rockwell for a violation 
after reviewing "what Rockwell gives to the judge." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell filed the plan as part of its request to renew an NRC license for the 
"hot lab" at Santa Susana -- a workshop where nuclear materials are handled by 
remote control. Bloch is the presiding officer in the license case and Wallace, 
a Calabasas resident, is one of several intervenors opposing the license 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell originally sought a 10-year renewal of the license. But in the face of 
flagging business for the hot lab and community opposition, the firm announced 
last month it would seek only a one-year renewal to complete current projects.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING ON PARKLAND AND STREET TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has set a public hearing on a proposed 
ballot measure to fund parklands and streets maintenance for Dec. 12 at 7:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering renewing the tax, which voters have approved by a 
two-thirds margin since 1980. If the council agrees to renew the parcel tax, it 
will be put on the April 10, 1990, city ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The last tax was approved for a four-year period in 1986, when voters agreed to 
pay $74 per parcel with a 4% increase per year. This year residents paid $84 
per parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Director Bill Yeomans said he will probably propose at the public 
hearing that residents pay $88 or $89 per parcel with a 5% annual increase. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel tax pays 60% of the cost of maintaining streets and parklands, 
Yeomans said after the meeting, with the balance coming from the city's General 
Fund.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY CLERK'S SALARY IS INCREASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hermosa Beach's new city clerk will get a 24.5% pay raise, thanks to the old 
city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
At the recommendation of ex-City Clerk Kathleen Midstokke -- who was sworn in 
as a city councilwoman this week -- the Hermosa Beach City Council on Tuesday 
raised the salary for the part-time elective job to $1,245 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk's job, officially vacant now that Midstokke is on the council, must 
be filled within 30 days with an appointee who will complete the remaining two 
years of Midstokke's term. Otherwise, the city will have to call a special 
election in April. 
</P>
<P>
So far, said Midstokke, no applications have been filed, though at least one 
person -- an employee in the Torrance city clerk's office -- has expressed 
interest in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Midstokke, who was the top vote-getter in the recent election of three council 
members, said the clerk's salary hadn't risen since 1988, when her paycheck 
went from $750 to $1,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The council followed her suggestion, backed by City Manager Kevin Northcraft, 
to tie the clerk's salary to that of the deputy city clerk, a full-time city 
employee whose salary rises with the cost of living. The clerk's salary is now 
officially half of the top salary scale for a deputy city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman Chuck Sheldon voted against the raise, arguing that Hermosa 
Beach paid its clerk more than any other city in the South Bay and that "people 
who run for city clerk don't do it for the money." 
</P>
<P>
But Northcraft argued that the raise might help attract candidates for the 
opening.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confessed madam Karen Wilkening was sentenced Wednesday to three years and 
eight months in prison for pandering and conspiring with her former lawyer to 
flee the country to avoid charges of operating a high-class call-girl ring. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez rejected the prosecution's 
request for a six-year, eight-month term for Wilkening, 43, formerly of Linda 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
She was fined $1,500 and given credit for her time in custody since she was 
arrested and extradited from the Philippines in May, where she had lived since 
fleeing a preliminary hearing in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
She also had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice, the same charge 
her former lawyer, Buford Wiley, pleaded guilty to on Oct. 6. Wiley will be 
sentenced Dec. 7 and faces a year in jail and the loss of his license to 
practice law. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkening's attorney, Stephen Carroll, urged that the minimum term be given, 
saying her offense "amounts to essentially a prostitution service." 
</P>
<P>
"The customers were well-placed in the business community," he said. "The 
victims were willing participants, if you can call them victims." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkening has testified before the county grand jury in connection with the 
slayings of 42 women -- mostly prostitutes -- whose bodies have been found 
dumped in North and East County since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her extradition, police said they went to the extraordinary 
effort to locate her in the Philippines because they thought she might have 
information on the serial murders. She has denied any knowledge about those 
crimes or that she even knew any of the victims.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CENTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About two dozen Salvadorans awaiting deportation at the El Centro detention 
center staged a short-lived hunger strike to urge immigration officials to send 
them home, Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The detainees, who officials said were all convicted felons, stopped eating 
their meals Tuesday afternoon, INS spokesman Rudy Murillo said. But most of 
them ended the strike Wednesday night after authorities agreed to book them 
flights to San Salvador on a Salvadoran airline. 
</P>
<P>
American air carriers, which normally transport deportees for the INS, stopped 
flying into San Salvador after recent heavy fighting closed the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the hunger strikers wanted to stay in the United States, and had applied 
for political asylum, but both were rejected. All of the detainees will be 
flown to El Salvador by Friday, Murillo said.

MCENROE OPENS TO MIXED REVIEWS, WINS; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: THREE-SET VICTORY OVER KRICKSTEIN HAS PLENTY OF HISTRIONICS BUT SPOTTY 
PLAY, TOO.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Live from New York, it's "The John McEnroe Show," starring John McEnroe, 
produced and directed by John McEnroe, with special choreography by John 
McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
See John McEnroe lunge for a shot, fall on his chest and lie motionless like a 
human throw rug, then pop right up and offer a biting critique of his serve. 
</P>
<P>
Hear John McEnroe as he berates a linesman: "Are we watching the same match? 
Are we on the same continent?" 
</P>
<P>
Feel the fiery heat of competition that is John McEnroe as he receives a fine 
for unsportsmanlike conduct when he angrily clobbers a ball after what he 
considers a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we doing a Saturday night skit here?" McEnroe asks. 
</P>
<P>
Well, no, just your routine Wednesday night of tennis in the Nabisco Masters at 
Madison Square Garden, where McEnroe dropped the first set and then spent the 
rest of the match polishing up his act. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, McEnroe's 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Aaron Krickstein earned some 
mixed reviews. McEnroe served 10 aces, but he also double faulted eight times. 
McEnroe, who lost his first service game with back-to-back double faults but 
closed out the match with an ace, acknowledged something of an up-and-down 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a little more danger than I wanted to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He found many disturbing elements during the match, beginning in the first set 
when he heard a telephone ring. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to hear that ringing all night?" McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing in the first set, McEnroe halted his service game, glanced at his 
father sitting in the stands and then addressed chair umpire Paolo Pereira. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad is not my coach, so can I ask him what's wrong with my serve?" McEnroe 
said as Pereira smiled. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, after trading insults with a couple of fans, McEnroe found a 
new target for his ire, the electronic machine that calls the service line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never worked," McEnroe muttered to himself. "I'm not paranoid, but that 
machine knows who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein knows McEnroe quite well, having now lost to him each of the five 
times they have played. McEnroe reeled off 11 consecutive points in the third 
set and jumped to a 5-1 lead, although Krickstein said he was not put off by 
the McEnroe show. 
</P>
<P>
"The calls weren't really that bad, and I think he exaggerates things quite a 
bit," Krickstein said. "He maybe does it to stall a little and throw you off 
your timing and maybe he intimidates a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The most intimidating shot in men's tennis, Boris Becker's serve, surely 
affected Andre Agassi, who once went scurrying behind a ballboy in mock terror 
of having to return Becker's booming service. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who won his second round-robin match while Agassi lost his second, 
buffed the teen in pink tights with the painted fingernail, 6-1, 6-3, in 66 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg defeated Brad Gilbert, 6-1, 6-3, in the last match Wednesday to 
join Becker in clinching a semifinal berth. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Becker and Agassi had played each other since the Davis 
Cup semifinal between the United States and West Germany in Munich when Agassi 
lost to Becker after holding a two-set lead. 
</P>
<P>
In this meeting, Becker had seven aces, four of them in succession in one game 
of the second set. Agassi took note. When someone accidently knocked down a row 
of curtains hung on pipes in the interview room, Agassi assessed the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an aftershock of Boris' first serve," Agassi said.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Those who believe that the Heisman Trophy will be devalued Saturday should 
examine the credentials of a leading candidate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What Barry Sanders was to running last season, Andre Ware is to passing this 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Houston quarterback has completed 329 of 527 passes for 62.4%, 4,299 yards, 
and 44 touchdowns in 10 games. He will break two national records set by Jim 
McMahon if he throws four touchdown passes and nets 273 yards Saturday. That 
should be a snap considering that the opponent is Rice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ware is a winner, too, having led his team to an 8-2 record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for someone who threw only 70 passes his senior year in high school in 
an option offense and was recruited by Texas and Texas A&amp;M to play 
defensive back before finding a place in Jack Pardee's run-'n'-shoot attack. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Andre also happens to be a solid citizen who is on target to earn his degree in 
business administration next year, and is in no way responsible for Houston's 
being on probation. . . . And don't blame the poor guy for all those 95 points 
and 1,021 yards the Cougars poured on SMU. He played only the first half. He 
passed for a mere 517 yards and Houston scored only 59 points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other outstanding underclassmen, this 21-year-old junior says he has no 
plans to apply for the NFL draft early, although he has the size -- he's 6-2 
and 205 pounds -- and arm to interest the scouts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You may see him get the Heisman news on the sidelines at Rice Stadium Saturday. 
Kickoff is at 1 p.m., Houston time. Cougar games are known to last more than 3 
1/2 hours, and the awards show starts at 4:30 p.m., CST. Of course, CBS would 
have to make sure it didn't show any of the game in the background. Remember, 
the Cougars are on probation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Get ready for a sitcom about a female sportswriter. Kathy Cohen, who has 
written sports for the Herald Examiner and the South Bay Daily Breeze, sold the 
project to the Fox network. Starring will be Julia Louis-Dreyfuss of "Saturday 
Night Live" fame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: George Seifert and Lindy Infante. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At the centennial celebration kickoff luncheon Tuesday, Giant Manager Roger 
Craig, a former Dodger pitcher, thanked the Los Angeles organization for 
whatever "little success" he has enjoyed in baseball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Dave Anderson became the latest Dodger to switch allegiance 
to the Giants. Maybe the rivalry used to be more bitter. Jackie Robinson was 
traded from Brooklyn to New York, but chose instead to quit baseball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Willie Davis, trim as ever, looks as though he is ready to solve the Dodgers' 
center-field problems next season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Happily posing for pictures was that old infield of Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, 
Bill Russell and Ron Cey, seemingly the best of friends now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates are fooling themselves if they think Walt Terrell and 
Ted Power will solve their pitching problems. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Although the super middleweight limit is 168 pounds, Roberto Duran will defend 
his WBC title at a maximum of 162 against Sugar Ray Leonard. Either would look 
paunchy any heavier. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bob Halloran, president of sports at the new Mirage hotel in Las Vegas, says 
14,700 tickets have been sold for next Thursday's match and that the gate has 
reached $7.7 million. Capacity of the outdoor stadium is 16,305. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The temperature may dip into the low 50s the night of the fight, but it will be 
a lot warmer beneath the ring lights. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Doug Kurtis, a 37-year-old from Detroit, will try to set a world record by 
running his 12th sub-2:20 marathon in a calendar year Dec. 10 at San Diego. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
I've never understood why the NFL doesn't hand out official most valuable 
player and rookie of the year awards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Stella Madrid, a 2-year-old filly entered in the $500,000 Hollywood Starlet 
Sunday, was named after a French movie star of the 1940s. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park and Santa Anita should card more long-distance races on the 
grass. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's time for the heavy-hitting Ruelas brothers, Gabriel and Rafael of the Ten 
Goose boxing stable, to step up in class. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If "The Tommy Lasorda Story" is ever made, Charles Durning should play the 
title role. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hockey has become a major sport in Los Angeles, but I didn't hear a great deal 
of talk about the Mikko Makela trade around town Wednesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The word defense is engraved on the Detroit Pistons' NBA championship rings. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Two Georgia newspapers have narrowed the list of possible candidates for the 
Atlanta Falcon coaching job to 20.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

OKLAHOMA SCORES 97 (IN 1 HALF ) IN VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
Oklahoma missed four chances at college basketball's first 100-point half 
Wednesday night at Norman, Okla., before settling for a record 97 in crushing 
U.S. International, 173-101. 
</P>
<P>
The 17th-ranked Sooners got a career-high 31 points from William Davis, who 
also had 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Davis scored 20 points in the first half as the Sooners built a 97-45 lead. 
That broke the mark of 94 scored last season by Loyola Marymount -- also 
against USIU. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't us tonight. Believe me it wasn't," USIU Coach Gary Zarecky said. 
"It was worse than a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma failed to connect on four three-point shots in the final minute of the 
first half in an attempt to reach 100. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners also set an NCAA record for shots in a game with 147, surpassing 
the 132 by Illinois against Colgate on Dec. 30, 1948. The 173 points were eight 
short of the NCAA record set by Loyola Marymount against USIU in last year's 
181-150 shootout. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Syracuse 108, Cornell 56 -- The top-ranked Orangemen held the Big Red to 
two field goals in the first 10 minutes at Syracuse and handed its Ivy League 
neighbor its worst defeat ever. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Orangemen's 21st consecutive victory over the Big Red, as well as 
the most lopsided in a rivalry that includes two 41-point blowouts by Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Stephen Thompson, who switched from small forward to point guard this 
season, scored 22 points for Syracuse, which began pulling its starters just 
three minutes into the contest. The Orangemen also got 20 points from Derrick 
Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell's previous worst beating was a 51-point loss to Penn in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Duke 102, Canisius 66 -- The Blue Devils bolted to an 11-0 lead and Phil 
Henderson and Christian Laettner paced a balanced attack with 18 points each at 
Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Duke put the game away by outscoring the Canisius, 17-4, over the final 5 1/2 
minutes of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils led, 50-24, at halftime and extended the margin to 42 points in 
the second half. All five Duke starters scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 Michigan 85, Grambling St. 70 -- Sean Higgins scored 16 of his 20 points 
in the second half to lead the 10th-ranked Wolverines past the Tigers at Ann 
Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
It was Michigan's first home game since winning the NCAA championship last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Grambling committed 17 turnovers, and Michigan, after a lethargic start, led 
36-26 at halftime. Higgins scored 12 points in the first eight minutes of the 
second half as the Wolverines opened a 61-45 lead and coasted the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Arkansas 105, South Alabama 90 -- Todd Day scored 28 points and Lenzie 
Howell added 23 to lead the 11th-ranked Razorbacks over the Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
Day also had nine rebounds for Arkansas, and Lee Mayberry had 16 points and 10 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
South Alabama was led by Alex Stanwood, who hit 10 of 11 shots from the field 
and eight of 10 free throws for 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 108, Duquesne 97 -- Huey Smith scored four of his 27 points in the 
second overtime to help the Titans beat the Dukes at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Duquesne's Brian Anselmino forced the first overtime when he made two free 
throws with no time on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Bill Wood tied the score as time expired in the first overtime period 
with a three-point shot. Wood was off balance and guarded by two players but 
was still able to make the shot to tie the score, 97-97. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit took advantage of five Duquesne turnovers in the second overtime and 
outscored the Dukes, 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
Wood also had four points in the second overtime for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan St. 80, Nebraska 69 -- Kirk Manns scored 19 points and Steve Smith 
added 18 at East Lansing as the Spartans beat the Cornhuskers.

Brent Ashton's goal with 11 seconds remaining in regulation Wednesday night 
gave the Winnipeg Jets a 5-4 victory over the New York Rangers at Winnipeg, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton took a pass from Dale Hawerchuk, swung around defenseman James Patrick 
and beat goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck through the pads with a backhander to 
knock the Jets back to .500. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a skating team and we talked about that between the second and third 
(periods). We came out skating and that's the way we play our best hockey," 
Ashton said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers, 3-6-1 in their last 10 games, overcame a three-goal first-period 
deficit and went ahead at 10:32 of the second period when Tomas Sandstrom 
scored his second goal of the game and 14th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Quebec 2 -- Bobby Smith scored two first-period power play goals 
and added an assist as the Canadiens beat the Nordiques at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Smith, Stephan Lebeau, Mats Naslund and Stephane Richer scored for the 
Canadiens, who had a 4-0 lead before the Nordiques scored in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 5, Detroit 3 -- Calle Johansson's goal with 2:53 left in regulation 
spoiled a Red Wing comeback bid at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Johansson beat Detroit goaltender Sam St. Laurent with a wrist shot from the 
slot for the game-winner after Detroit scored three goals in a 3:23 span midway 
through the period to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Burr scored the first two goals for the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 3, Vancouver 2 -- Vincent Damphousse scored at 3:48 of overtime to 
complete a Toronto comeback before 13,434, smallest crowd of the season at the

Strange, but true. Then Carson scored. Then Joe Murphy scored.

And then Monday night, when the teams met for the first time this season, 
everyone involved scored. Carson, Murphy and Petr Klima each had a goal in a 
game that Edmonton won at Detroit, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
For Klima, it was his first since the trade -- in his 13th game for the Oilers. 
He said: "I could say I waited until today. Would you believe me?" 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. But there was a lot of emotion involved in the meeting. 
Especially for Carson, who has been a controversial figure in Edmonton since 
quitting the team on the eve of the Kings' game at Edmonton Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
So how did it go? 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody went after me," Carson told Jim Matheson of the Edmonton Journal. 
"Nobody said unpleasant things. Despite what some people think, I do have some 
friends on that team. Mess (Mark Messier) and Kevin (Lowe) are still friends 
with Wayne Gretzky. But once the game starts, there is only one thing in mind, 
and that is to win." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Carson said he was pleased to have the game behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it's over," he said. "All the interviews, the playing and replaying 
of what went on, it's over now and life goes on." 
</P>
<P>
At least until Jan. 16, when Carson will have to play before the crowd at 
Edmonton. "That will be different," he said. "It'll be a little harder." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI warning that flashes on the screen at the start of home videos probably 
has never given anyone pause. It's about as chilling as the "Do not remove this 
tag" label on mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
But the message comes across loud and clear at the start of the Kings' "The 
Year in Review 1988/89" video. Tough guy Ken Baumgartner, who was traded to the 
New York Islanders Tuesday night, delivers the warning without cracking a 
smile: "Motion pictures and video tapes are protected by copyright. 
Infringement done willfully may result in fine or imprisonment. So enjoy the 
tape. Show your friends. But if they want a copy, let them buy their own." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get Bomber riled over $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
Former Boston Bruin Coach Terry O'Reilly, on whether coaches should be at the 
mercy of star players for their jobs: "A team shouldn't have an untouchable 
player. Look at Pittsburgh. Mario Lemieux has bad habits. You can't discipline 
him. So how are you supposed to keep the other players in line?" 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Coach Gene Ubriaco, who is continually rumored to be gone because 
Lemieux isn't too high on him: "When you're in tough times, you don't cut and 
run. You don't be like a banana republic and change the people in authority 
just because we have some problems. You want to stay a banana republic? Fine. 
We've got a lot of them in the NHL. I'd like to think Pittsburgh's not a banana 
republic. I know it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille of the Kings, who is becoming used to the idea that his name 
will come up in trade talk a lot, has talked it over with new teammate Larry 
Robinson, who played 17 years for the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
Said Robitaille: "His first 10 years in Montreal, they were trying to trade 
him. And his last five, they were trying to retire him. . . . Management has 
talked to me and told me they won't trade me. But isn't it the day after the 
general manager gives you that speech that you're gone?" 
</P>
<P>
Jack O'Callahan, who is working at the Chicago Board of Trade after many years 
as a defenseman for New Jersey and Chicago: "I'm down on the floor, working in 
the pit. It's like being a defenseman standing in front of the net -- a lot of 
pushing, shoving, elbowing, sweating and cursing going on." 
</P>
<P>
Don Cherry, a former NHL coach who is now a commentator for "Hockey Night in 
Canada" on Canadian TV, has long supported Bob Probert's efforts to return from 
his cocaine problems. When asked if he thought the Red Wing players would 
accept Probert, Cherry said: 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt, if he's cleaned up his act, they want him back. They're half 
the team they were without him. They love him. He can play. He is a presence. 
The word around the league is that it was a real shame what he did. But the 
guys on other teams are hoping he comes back. That, I don't understand. I guess 
Bob Probert is the ultimate." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the fans would welcome him back, Cherry said: "I guarantee 
you, the Detroit fans will cheer him. He'll get a standing ovation. No doubt 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
NHL Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Sabres are still the surprise team of the league, leading with 36 
points and a winning percentage of .762 almost a third of the way into the 
season. . . . Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux has the longest scoring streak this 
season with points in 13 consecutive games. Wayne Gretzky has a 10-game streak 
going, during which he has 22 assists. Not coincidentally, the Kings are 
unbeaten in their last seven games. 
</P>

Ron Duguay, released by the Kings this fall, is playing for Mannheim in West 
Germany.

Northwest Valley Conference 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Marc Paez, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 21-3; 1st in league, 10-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Paez is in an enviable position. His toughest job as a 
first-year coach might be finding enough playing time for his many standout 
players. Included in the probable starting lineup are two players who signed 
Division I letters of intent earlier this month: shooting guard Eddie Hill 
(Washington State) and center Trenton Cornelius (Washington). Hill, a good 
perimeter shooter, averaged 12.6 points last season as a part-time starter, and 
Cornelius (6-7) stands as tall as anyone in the area. Andre Chevalier, expected 
to be a catalyst at point guard, is ineligible pending a review of grades. Pat 
McCook, a 6-3 junior guard, has been a pleasant surprise in summer-league play 
and will be a heavy contributor. The summer-league progress of sophomore 
Brandon Martin, the junior varsity MVP last season, has made him a starter at 
forward. Bobby McRae, a starter at forward, has recovered from a broken hand 
suffered in the off-season and needs to provide inside strength. Kenny Collins, 
a junior transfer from league rival Taft, will spell Hill, Chevalier and McCook 
at guard. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Cleveland spent the majority of the 1988-89 season ranked No. 2 in the 
state but was ousted by Fairfax in the 4-A Division quarterfinals last season. 
It was the Cavaliers' first loss at home all season and snapped an 18-game win 
streak. Cleveland will again receive most of its early challenges from its 
preconference tournament schedule and should sweep league opponents for the 
second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bob Johnson, 12th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 13-9; Tied for 3rd in league, 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Granada Hills lost plenty of size when forwards Alvin Brown 
and Joey Rosas graduated but pure speed might compensate. The Highlanders, in 
fact, might be the only team in the league that can run with Cleveland. 
Jermoine Brantley, a 5-11 guard who averaged 10.6 points last year, is a 
three-year starter at point guard and can shoot from the perimeter or drive to 
the basket. Last season, Brantley was better known by the first name of Jamal. 
Aaron Lattimore, a 6-4 starting swingman who also can play effectively inside 
or outside, showed flashes of brilliance last season but needs to be more 
consistent. Osiris Nalls (6-0) has been the biggest eye-opener thus far. "He's 
probably the most improved player we have," Johnson said. Adrian Sellers, a 6-3 
junior, was excelled last season on the junior varsity and should make an 
immediate impact. William Moringlane, a starter on the highly successful 
football team, will return for his third season on the varsity. Johnson says 
that Bryan Martin, quarterback on the football team, could be an impact player 
at swingman, but it is uncertain if he will play. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Johnson says that, essentially, it is Brantley's team. And whether he 
goes by Jermoine or Jamal, he is the key. "It may seem kind of strange for a 
54-year-old coach to just give control of a team to a 17-year-old kid, but 
Jamal is the guy," Johnson said. Granada Hills has the speed, but Johnson isn't 
sure that's enough, especially after the Highlanders struggled to beat Poly, 
66-60, in their opener Monday. "After that game, we're bottom of the barrel," 
he said in reference to the league picture. "We were awful. I don't know what 
we're going to be like or how good we'll be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taft 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Woodard, 9th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-6; 2nd in league, 6-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Taft has front-line height in seniors Jason Deyoe (6-8) and 
Devin Martin (6-7), but a weakness at this juncture is at guard. Replacing 
All-City selection Dedan Thomas was difficult enough, but then Taft absorbed a 
big blow when projected starter Kenny Collins transferred to Cleveland and 
Brandon Bryce, another guard, moved to Northern California. So the Toreadors' 
point guard will be Casey Sheahan, a 6-0 sophomore. "He'll be all right," 
Woodard said. "It's just an experience thing. He'll get better as the season 
moves along." Cornell Hill, a 6-1 junior, will play at off-guard and is easily 
the quickest player on the team, Woodard said. Eric Dafney, the half brother of 
former Fremont High and current UCLA player Darrin Dafney, also will 
contribute. Dafney is an exciting offensive player, but he has a weakness or 
two. "Defense is a rumor right now," Woodard said. "He can't guard his lunch." 
James Yoakum, a 6-1 senior, also figures into Woodard's playing equation. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Toreadors need to grow up fast in tournament play. If they do, 
Taft might be capable of threatening Cleveland and Granada Hills. However, 
Deyoe is the lone returning varsity player, averaging 10.0 points and 7.9 
rebounds. "Right now, I'd say our strength is rebounding," Woodard said. "Our 
weakness is experience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Yutaka Shimizu, 8th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 13-9; Tied for 3rd in league, 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Kennedy lost its best player, Randy Brown, a Times All-Valley 
selection, to graduation. His likely replacement is an All-City player too. 
Garret Anderson, a 6-3 senior, was an All-City baseball player last season and 
one of the best athletes in school. Anderson averaged 14.0 points as a junior 
and will need to boost his output for the Golden Cougars to make a run at 
Cleveland, Taft and Granada Hills. Junior Athesis Harris (6-4), a starter last 
season, would have started at center but is academically ineligible. "We 
weren't big with him," Shimizu said. "Now, we're definitely not big." Beyond 
Anderson, Kennedy is also inexperienced. Three sophomores of similar size will 
see extensive playing time. Kenjuan Casey (6-1), Ronnie Gipson (6-1) and Bobby 
Winn (6-0) have made the team as 10th-graders. Dion Ross, a 6-1 senior, also 
will play. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Each year, Kennedy seems outmanned by at least one team in the league, 
yet Shimizu manages to make the most of what he has, recording upsets along the 
way. This season, however, with his team lacking size and experience, Shimizu 
may be hard-pressed to work his magic again. "We have some players, some senior 
players, who've never played before," Shimizu said. "We're just going to 
experiment with the offensive and defensive combinations and hope that (when 
conference play begins), we've solved some problems." 
</P>

<P>
West Valley League 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike McNulty, 8th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-9; 1st in league, 6-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Even though the Conquistadores have just two varsity players 
back -- neither is a starter -- the team is nonetheless expected to contend for 
the league title. Last season, sporadic play at the guard position hurt the 
Conquistadores' chances of winning the 3-A Division title; they advanced to the 
semifinal round before falling to eventual-champion Fremont. This season, the 
guard tandem of Stephen Lipscomb (5-9) and Todd Orlando (5-10) gives El Camino 
Real a solid 1-2 punch with ballhandling and outside scoring. Allen Chenen 
(6-3), who saw some action last season at forward, returns and must provide 
scoring punch inside. Bertram Mitchell (6-3) is the other returning letterman 
and is also a key offensive focal point. Scott Huse, a forward, will see 
extensive court time after playing last season for the junior varsity, which 
won the West Valley title. Lamont Johnson, a 5-9 senior, will be part of 
McNulty's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: El Camino Real is not especially tall, nor is there any player who 
appears able to take command of a game as last year's 3-A Player of the Year, 
Brent Lofton, often did. "We're awful small for a varsity team," McNulty said. 
And yet, if Lipscomb and Orlando play as well as expected, the team should give 
San Fernando a run for the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dick Crowell, 9th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-13; 3rd in league, 3-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: San Fernando has the most experience in the league, which 
could translate to trouble for the rest of the league. The best news for the 
Tigers is that Russell Baldwin, ineligible last season, is back and ready to 
make everyone aware of just what they were missing. "He's very, very good 
offensively," Crowell said. Baldwin (6-4) has scored 27, 24 and 32 points in 
San Fernando's past three scrimmages. And bad news for the football team has 
meant a boon for Crowell. San Fernando's first-round playoff loss means that 
quarterback Michael Wynn (6-3) and defensive lineman Lance Whitaker (6-7) are 
already out for the team. Both played extensively last season. Marco Renteria, 
a good perimeter shooter and a starter last season, also returns. Errol 
Garnett, a 6-3 senior, was one of the Tigers' top reserves last season. Gerald 
Harris and Gabe Vidana, both juniors, also will contribute. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The addition of Baldwin makes the Tigers an instant contender for the 
league title. Height, comparatively speaking, isn't a problem. "The whole 
Valley is small, there aren't any big teams," Crowell said. "So I like our 
chances against ECR, Chatsworth and Canoga." Any weaknesses? "Quickness," 
Crowell said. "We may have trouble with a Cleveland or Granada because of their 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jeff Davis, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-18; 4th in league, 0-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: After a dismal season, things are looking brighter for the 
Hunters, Perhaps at least in morale and enthusiasm. "We have a lot of 
quickness, a lot of speed and a lot of enthusiasm," said Davis, a longtime 
assistant at El Camino Real. "We don't have a lot of height." Davis might have 
a lot of shooters, though. Marcus Reed (5-9) has been on a streak in recent 
scrimmages, scoring 57 points against Van Nuys last week. Reed is a transfer 
from league rival El Camino Real. Jason Harper (6-0), a projected starter at 
swingman, can also put up points. Shawn Lewis (6-4), a transfer from Chicago, 
is the starter at center. Lindsay Dunbar, a transfer from talent-rich Fremont, 
is the backup point guard. Wendell Simpson (5-6), another guard, has a vertical 
leap of 42 inches, Davis says. Alvin Edington, the City 100-meter C champion, 
also will see plenty of playing time. Damon Smith, a 6-1 transfer from Oakland, 
is critical to the equation. "He's our best rebounder, a very good athlete and 
the key to this team," said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: It might take some time for the individuals to meld, Davis said, 
because so many are transfers, but if they do, he is optimistic. "If we do what 
we do well, we'll be OK," Davis said. "But we have to set the tempo, we have to 
push the ball." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Gary Shair, 26th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-9; 2nd in league, 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The most experienced coach in the Valley has seen better 
days. It was bad enough knowing that he had no returning starters from last 
year, then Shair lost six players to academic eligibility. Shair then hit the 
recruiting trail, combing the Chatsworth hallways and P. E. classes. It will be 
a long season. "We're hurting," he said. "We have nothing coming back." Two 
sophomores, Eric Isaac and Chris Dunbar, are projected starters at guard. 
Delvon Hardaway and Rayna Stewart, two starters from the football team, are 
late arrivals but should be impact players. Eric Berg, Robert Hall, Eric 
Daniels and Darrel Porter also will play, Shair said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: With Canoga Park making improvement in several areas, Chatsworth may 
spend most of the season looking up at the rest of the league. "We've always 
had at least one guy back," Shair said. "We're as down as we have ever been." 
</P>
<P>

Valley Pac-8 Conference 
</P>
<P>
East Valley League 
</P>
<P>
Grant 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Howard Levine, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 17-4; 1st in league, 9-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Lancers lacki a big man but that shouldn't stop them from 
winning another league title. Leading the way are returners Setro Terzian (6.0 
points, 5.8 rebounds), a 6-2 third-year starter who played a role in Grant's 
trip to the Sports Arena two seasons ago, and 6-0 Keith Weinstein (6.7 points), 
Grant's sixth man last season. Both are shooters, especially Terzian, whose 
three-point bombs in early scrimmages have made Levine smile. Weinstein has 
recovered from an off-season knee injury. "Weinstein can light it up," Levine 
said. The point guard is JoJo Halberstad, a 5-10 senior who returns from last 
season. In the front court, Levine will play 6-2 post player Billy May, yet 
another returner. There are high hopes for 6-2 junior forward Rene Delahoya, 
the league MVP on the B team last season. Also down low, look for 6-4 bookends 
Sean McMahon and Brunell Mori. "We go about eight deep," Levine said. "We've 
got some people who can play." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The question is not will Grant win the East Valley League. The 
question is will the Lancers beat rival North Hollywood in their only 
conference showdown Jan. 17 at Grant? Levine hesitates to say whether Grant 
will have the firepower to do so. In the meantime, he says that "we have some 
shooters who want to play hard." The weakness? "Size in the middle," Levine 
said. Still, Grant should have a banner season once again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poly 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jay Werner, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-11; Tied for 2nd in league, 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Three players return from a solid team. The problem is, the 
Parrots lost six players, including all five starters. But Werner said that 
what they lack in on-court experience, they make up for in quickness and speed. 
Running the point is 5-11 Jason Wilson, a senior. Werner also likes three-year 
varsity forward Marvin Perkins (6-1). Rounding out the starting five are 5-11 
senior shooting guard Art Granado, 6-2 senior center Victor Rios and 5-10 
junior swingman Marco Torres. The team lost firepower with the graduation of 
Scott Cooper (19.1 points) and Scott Bruner (15.1). But a good showing in a 
six-point loss Monday to Granada Hills, which is ranked third in The Times' 
preseason Valley poll, gives the Parrots reason for hope. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The team's fortunes rest with the defense, Werner said. Poly employs a 
man-to-man defense and this season's team is better suited for that style than 
last season's. "We'll play better later on," Werner said. Which, he hopes, will 
come in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Alan Bennett, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-12; Tied for 2nd in league, 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Bennett is calling his first season a "rebuilding year to 
build continuity." He has some seniors in his backcourt to help him: Jason 
Gudvi, a 6-1 shooting guard, and Link Polk, a 5-10 point guard. Other seniors 
who will play include 6-0 guard Mark Bird, a ballhandler and shooter, and 6-2 
forward Chris Curry. The remainder of the squad is composed of juniors. A big 
front line includes 6-4 forward Kevin Horton, who "doesn't have much experience 
but is a pretty good player," according to Bennett. Joining Horton is 6-5 
junior Ignaccio Esteeva and 6-4 junior Noah Kirshbaum. Bennett said that his 
regular rotation may run nine deep, but he would like to play all 12 players in 
any given game. "My philosophy is if a kid plays hard in practice, he should be 
given a chance to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Birmingham has the size to challenge for a playoff berth. But Bennett 
downplays such talk. "They're really new to me and we're really behind," he 
said. "We just put in our zone offense and zone defense the other day." The 
coach adopts a wait-and-see attitude: "If we are successful, we won't know 
until January. We're all new." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Larry Link, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league, 1-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Link, in his first season at Sylmar after coaching at 
Hamilton, thinks the biggest problem with the Spartans might have nothing to do 
with basketball. "The tradition at Sylmar is that basketball seems to be a 
brief transition from football to track season," he said. He's out to change 
that -- with the help of 6-1 returning senior swingman Keith Bright and 
possibly 6-4 big man London Woodfin, a football player who has been slowed by a 
tender knee. "We don't have a lot of shooters," Link said. One player who could 
be a surprise package is 6-2 senior forward Donovan Walker, who has 
above-average quickness. Link also said that 6-2 junior Jason Miles is "capable 
of being very good." At point guard, 5-11 senior Chad Gillis is listed as the 
starter. But what Link likes most are his hard-working seniors: guard Jason 
Burd, guard David Salazar and forward Wes Hebner. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The talk from Link is cautious: "We have nice kids. Many are just 
learning the game." The problem, though, said Link, is as much mental as 
physical. "There has to be a tradition for winning," he said, "and they don't 
know what it takes yet. They don't know how to win yet. It's an attitude. But 
we're gonna teach them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mid-Valley League 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Miller, 5th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-5; 1st in league, 10-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: It will be difficult to improve on a flawless league season, 
but the Huskies have the talent to match last year's performance -- and perhaps 
make a serious bid for the 3-A title. Leading the way, of course, will be 6-6 
center Dana Jones (20.1 points, 13.8 rebounds), one of the City's top players 
and who has signed with Pepperdine. Jones will be counted on to rebound, score, 
bring the ball up and block "millions of shots," according to Miller. The 
supporting cast is strong: 6-2 sophomore point guard Robert Hill is very 
promising, while 5-8 backcourt mate Tommy Byrdsong (8.6 points, 4.5 assists) 
moves from point to off-guard, where he will thrive, according to Miller. 
Joining Jones in the front court is 6-3 junior forward Eric Jackson, the league 
MVP of the junior varsity last season. Swingman Duane Braxton (5.7 assists), a 
5-8 sixth man last season, will get plenty of playing time. How deep are the 
Huskies? Harry Marks (14.5 points, 4.5 assists, 2.7 steals), a 6-3 junior 
forward who was first-team all-league last season, might not even start, 
according to Miller. Two more Huskies will see action, including 6-1 off-guard 
Ray Fisher and 6-7 sophomore Tim O'Malley, who is recovering from a back 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Our depth is our strength," Miller said. The coach remains cautiously 
optimistic while staring at a possible outstanding season. "It depends on how 
our chemistry comes together," he said. And another thing to note: "This year 
people are coming after us," Miller said. Still, the Huskies should easily 
distance themselves from the pack. A City title is possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reseda 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jeff Halpern, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-11; 2nd in league, 7-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Last season was Halpern's first losing season in 15 years of 
coaching, and he is determined to make sure it doesn't happen again. How? By 
exploiting the quickness present on this season's team. The team lacks height, 
and what little experience the team has comes from returning all-leaguer Mike 
Basowski (13.0 points), a 6-0 senior guard who is the team's best outside 
shooter. Joining Basowski in the backcourt is 5-11 junior point guard James 
Chen from the junior varsity. Halpern expects big things from 6-2 sophomore 
forward Marquis Burns, who can handle the ball and play anywhere on the court. 
Forming the other end of Reseda's marquee forward tandem is Marquis Wilborn, a 
6-3 senior up from the junior varsity. Last season, Wilborn was called up for 
the playoffs and scored 14 points in a loss to Wilson. Also expected to start 
is senior Mike Hawkins, who was ineligible last season. Reseda, though, was 
hurt by the loss of second-team all-leaguer Mario Jordan and Cleveland transfer 
Antoine Taylor to grades. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Halpern said that he plans to use 10 players and run, run, run, making 
up for a weakness in rebounding. This is one of my best conditioned teams. I 
really pushed it this year. Hopefully, we'll be fun to watch." Reseda doesn't 
figure to challenge North Hollywood, but is a candidate for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monroe 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dennis King, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-14; 3rd in league, 2-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Three starters from a team that finished a game out of the 
cellar last season. King, however, has reason to hope for more this year. The 
returnees are a big reason: 6-0 senior forward Kenyon Wright (11.6 points) 
"shoots pretty well," according to King, and is joined in the frontcourt by 
junior Lodis Woodmore, a 6-2 forward. Joining that duo is senior Jesse Wallace 
(9.1 points, 7.4 rebounds), the quarterback of the football team and a swingman 
who is "not starting yet, but will soon," according to King. The coach likes 
his guards, because he has a "team full of them." At one position will be 
Maurice McIntosh, an all-league player with the junior varsity. Junior Ryan 
Bebe (5-8) will run the point. King likes his ballhandling abilities and his 
intelligence. Seeing time inside will be wide body Ronald Falls (6-1, 205). 
Football player Gerrit Maxwell is a 6-1 forward who plays good defense, 
according to King. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Monroe should improve on last season's mark, but whether that will be 
good enough for a playoff berth is another matter. There is the problem of 
North Hollywood and Reseda. "At this point, I'd put us third," King said. 
"We're not too bad of a shooting team and our quickness is good. Our big 
problem is rebounding. We'll do better. I just don't know how much better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Ken Lee, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-15; 4th in league, 1-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: 
</P>
<P>
Ask Lee what's up at Van Nuys and he'll tell you: "Not our height." He isn't 
kidding. Consider a backcourt of guards Robert McGee, a 5-9 returning senior, 
Russell Nishimoto, a 5-7 junior promoted from the junior varsity, and Sokharith 
Sary, who measures in at 5-5. The frontcourt doesn't get much bigger. Lee will 
go with 5-11 forward James Hooks and Michael Crawford, a promising 6-2 transfer 
from Palmdale. How about quickness? "We scrimmaged Canoga Park," Lee said. "And 
we're not as fast as they are. We have about average speed." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Said Lee: "We lack experience. We lack height." What's left? "We have 
a lot of desire," Lee said. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
COACH: Mac Becker, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-12; 4th in league, 4-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Becker lost his biggest horse, Marcus Littlejohn, but he 
believes he might have a few colts that are ready to step forward. Cleve 
McWright, a 6-5 forward and a part-time starter last season, had 16 rebounds in 
a game against Faith Baptist on Monday and is probably the team's preeminent 
player. "He's good outside and very quick," Becker said. Byron Devers, a senior 
forward, has good scoring touch from the 12-foot range and will help take the 
heat off McWright inside. Om Reeder, a three-year letterman, and Kevin Campbell 
are the starters at guard. Campbell, who starts at off-guard, is the team's 
primary three-point threat. The star on the horizon, Becker says, is sophomore 
Raleigh Henderson, a 6-5 sophomore. "He can play inside and outside," Becker 
said. "All he needs is seasoning." Henderson and Devers were co-MVPs of the 
junior varsity last year. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: If players progress and gain maturity during the preseason, the team 
may make a run at league favorite Wilson. Henderson's emergence might make the 
difference. "He's a very, very good player," Becker said. "And that's right 
now. Next year, we may build the whole team around him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Hector Ornelas, 5th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-17; 5th in league, 1-12 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Things are pretty bleak when the coach is taller than every 
player on the team. Especially when the coach stands a whopping 6-foot-2. Such 
is the case with Ornelas. "We're small," he said. "It could be a long year." If 
the Dons make any kind of move toward improving on last season's mark, senior 
forward Kent Purser will lead the way. Purser, who Ornelas says was the best 
player on the team last season, averaged 18 points as a junior. Yet he is only 
5-11. "When you look at him, you think, 'There's no way he can do it,' " 
Ornelas said. "But he does." The tallest player is Steve Boudreaux, a 6-1 post 
man. "He's our center, if that's what you want to call it," Ornelas said. Two 
players from the football team, Darrell Evans and Joseph Letscher, will 
contribute. Tuyen Tran, a 5-8 point guard who played for the B team last 
season, will start. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Verdugo Hills won two games last season. Bettering that total might be 
difficult. "We're going to have another tough year," Ornelas said. "It all 
depends on how they play together.

THE HOMELESS GET A TASTE OF HAUTE CUISINE

<TEXT>
<P>
Poached salmon with caviar and grilled baby vegetables is hardly a typical meal 
for the homeless families living at the Southeast Emergency Quarters in 
Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But one recent evening, residents dined on this chic cuisine courtesy of chefs 
at the Hyatt Islandia, who had 100 extra servings of fish, vegetables, salad 
and dessert after a large luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, those elegant leftovers would have ended up in the garbage. 
Now, when the chef has extra food, he calls Marie Hinkley and her husband, 
Hank, who deliver unused food from the city's most elegant restaurants to some 
of its poorest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Love's Gift, the nonprofit agency Hinkley founded, distributes about 300 pounds 
of perishable food a week to 20 agencies such as Southeast Emergency Quarters 
that shelter the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"The food is good. It isn't old and it's healthy," said Arlena Foster, the 
shelter's director. 
</P>
<P>
Without twice-a-week contributions from Love's Gift, Foster said, she would 
have to spend more money from the shelter's slender budget to feed the home's 
30 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few blocks away at Christian Mission, men have lined up early in hopes 
of getting an evening meal. The Hinkleys deliver the remaining fish and 
vegetables to the mission's back door, not minding that they have to step over 
broken liquor bottles to reach the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really progressed very fast. I'm pleased," said Hinkley, who founded 
Love's Gift in January after reading about a similar program in Minneapo 
</P>
<P>
lis called "Twelve Baskets." At least 40 other cities across the nation have 
similar food-salvation programs under different names. 
</P>
<P>
Long a restaurant manager herself, Hinkley had seen waste in kitchens. Although 
good chefs try to salvage all they can, they invariably have leftover banquet 
food or other items that cannot be served to regular diners. Though the food is 
untouched, it is often thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
After reading about Twelve Baskets, the former restaurateur said she felt 
foolish for not thinking of the idea herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered why I wasn't doing something like that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before she was. Hinkley left her job as a manager at Cilantros 
Restaurant in Del Mar to start Love's Gift. The only stumbling block to the 
program was lifted in January when a state law removed restaurant liability for 
their donations. Love's Gift made its first pickup in April. 
</P>
<P>
Hinkley works closely with chefs and cooks from restaurants and hospitals 
throughout San Diego. Charles Lewis, executive chef at the Hyatt Islandia on 
Mission Bay, calls Hinkley whenever he ends up with extra meals. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't like to see waste," he said. "To me, food is an art. It's my 
profession. I just don't like to see it wasted. My mother used to tell me that 
wasting food is a sin, and it is." 
</P>
<P>
During weeks when the Hyatt kitchen is bare, Lewis makes 5 or 10 gallons of 
soup for Love's Gift. He'll also cook soup when a mission calls Hinkley because 
it hasn't had food in two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel good just to give something away, even if it's just a few 
rolls and some soup," Lewis said. He became used to donating leftover food when 
he worked at the Hyatt on Union Square in downtown San Francisco. A nearby 
rescue mission often had as many as 900 people lined up for meals, so Lewis 
started donating whatever he had. 
</P>
<P>
Hinkley's service is not limited to gourmet leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
At the Stardust Hotel in Mission Valley, Love's Gift picked up a large bucket 
of fried chicken, some tamales, two bags of rolls and two containers of soup 
after visiting the Hyatt. Hank also visits a produce distributor and French 
bakery regularly for vegetables and bread. Once, a grower in El Centro gave 4 
tons of onions. 
</P>
<P>
The Hinkleys first collection and delivery in April consisted of 20 pounds of 
food. By next spring, they hope to be distributing 2,000 pounds a week on a 
regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing holding them back from collecting more food now is the lack of a 
refrigerated truck -- or any truck, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Each afternoon Hank loads his silver compact car with four plastic coolers to 
hold the fresh fruits, vegetables and entrees offered by the restaurants. He 
often makes two or three trips a day, filling his small car with food and 
delivering it to a few of the agencies that Love's Gift serves. Then he visits 
more restaurants or hospital kitchens and loads up again. 
</P>
<P>
The couple spends about $200 a month on gas. And, although the program has 
about 10 regular volunteers and all the food it can handle, it gets few 
monetary donations to offset the cost. 
</P>
<P>
The Hinkleys may get some county help for the program. In June, the Board of 
Supervisors voted unanimously to support Love's Gift and offer assistance 
through the county Department of Social Services. The local restaurant 
association has also endorsed the work of Love's Gift. 
</P>
<P>
County administrator Georgia Tate hopes the organization can earn a state or 
federal grant to buy a refrigerated truck. She's helping Hinkley send out press 
releases and information about Love's Gift in hopes of getting donations and 
making the public aware of the perishable foods program. 
</P>
<P>
As for Hinkley, she said she eventually hopes to draw a salary for 
administering Love's Gift. Working full time out of her small office in the 
basement of a Point Loma church, Hinkley discusses the program as if it's 
something anyone could -- and would -- do. 
</P>
<P>
"Something needed to be done," Hinkley said simply. "And I knew I could make it 
work."

BUSH MAY SPEED TALKS ON U.S.-SOVIET TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: PRESIDENT ALSO FAVORS OBSERVER STATUS FOR MOSCOW AT WORLD TARIFF AND 
TRADE ORGANIZATION.

<P>
President Bush, in a surprise move that is being readied for his Malta summit 
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, may offer to speed negotiations 
toward a new U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, Administration officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also may tell Gorbachev that the United States, in a shift in policy, now 
favors the Soviet Union's bid for observer status at the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization that administers world trade 
rules, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Both moves would be significant gestures of encouragement for the Soviet 
leader, who has publicly asked that restrictions on U.S.-Soviet trade be 
relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
They also would answer widespread criticism at home that the Bush 
Administration has moved too slowly in helping Gorbachev reform the Soviet 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Administration officials said Bush still does not intend to extend 
most-favored-nation trading status to the Soviet Union until Moscow enacts new 
legislation granting free emigration to Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
But they said the President may tell Gorbachev he is willing to push forward 
negotiations toward a comprehensive trade agreement with Moscow -- even before 
the Supreme Soviet's proposed new emigration law is passed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's on the list of 'possibles,' " said a senior official involved in planning 
the Malta summit. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes under the category of things that they will give a political push 
to," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act, the Soviet Union and 
other Communist countries were barred from most-favored-nation status -- a 
category that imposes relatively low tariffs on a nation's exports to the 
United States -- unless they allowed free emigration by their citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The law was passed in an era when the Soviet government was blocking exit visas 
to tens of thousands of Soviet Jews. During the past two years, however, 
Gorbachev has permitted virtually unimpeded emigration, to the point that the 
U.S. Embassy in Moscow has been swamped with applications for entry to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said last May that he would ask Congress to waive the Jackson-Vanik 
amendment under two conditions: that the Soviet Union formalize its more 
liberal policy in a law and show that it is implementing the freer rules. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III reaffirmed those 
conditions. "Our policy's very clear," he told reporters. "We need that 
legislation before we can actually waive Jackson-Vanik." 
</P>
<P>
At the Malta summit, he added, "There will be a full discussion of the question 
of Jackson-Vanik, the related questions of a trade agreement and related 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Administration is unlikely to conclude a new trade agreement 
before the Soviet emigration law is passed. But by beginning work on a pact 
now, they said, the lag between the Supreme Soviet's action and the actual 
granting of most-favored-nation status could be made shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet and U.S. trade officials already have met to lay the groundwork for the 
negotiations between the two countries. In a two-day session earlier this 
month, they set forth a basic framework for new talks and agreed to continue 
meeting on an informal basis. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't started the negotiations themselves, but they've pretty well 
agreed on the shape of the table," one official said. "The next step is a 
formal mandate for the talks, and that's what they're working on now." 
</P>
<P>
After that session, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said he believed 
that the United States could lower trade barriers against Soviet imports 
"within the next one to three months." Other officials said Mosbacher was 
speaking on the assumption that the Supreme Soviet would pass its new 
emigration legislation this month -- an expectation that turned out to be 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"It should not take more than a few months to negotiate an agreement once they 
get going," Robert D. Hormats, a former assistant secretary of state, said. "It 
can all be done by spring." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Soviet Union's desire for association with GATT, Baker said, "That's 
a matter that will very much be on the agenda" at Malta. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't rule out some form of observer status," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as October, Baker dismissed any discussion of Soviet membership in 
GATT as "premature." 
</P>
<P>
Some Administration officials have argued that association with the world trade 
organization could help the Soviets learn more about the Western trading system 
and how they would have to change their own practices to participate. 
</P>
<P>
For example, officials noted, prices in the Soviet Union are fixed by 
government fiat -- so it is difficult to determine whether the Soviet Union is 
engaging in the prohibited practice of "dumping," or exporting goods at a price 
below their cost. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), the Senate majority leader, and other critics 
have long called on the Administration to grant most-favored-nation status to 
the Soviet Union as a signal of encouragement for Gorbachev's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mitchell renewed that demand and urged that negotiations toward a 
new trade agreement begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"By laying the groundwork now, we will be able to swiftly implement a new trade 
agreement once the political decision to normalize economic relations is made," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also called on Bush to help the Soviet Union attain observer status in GATT. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people are united in support of President Bush as he travels to 
Malta," Mitchell told reporters. His statement appeared to be an attempt to 
walk a fine line between pressing Democrats' disagreements with Bush on 
East-West policy while muting open criticism on the eve of the Malta meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, most Administration experts believe that granting 
most-favored-nation status will not have any immediate major impact on the 
Soviet economy. Instead, the value is likely to be diplomatic -- a public 
demonstration of Western interest in the success of Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"They (such changes as trade status) don't do anything to economic conditions 
in the Soviet Union in the short (term) and midterm," said one official. "They 
are more political statements of support in the West for what is happening in 
the Soviet Union. . . . They just don't do anything to life in the country as 
'Ivan' feels it."

CIA AGENT WHO DEFECTED IS EXPELLED FROM HUNGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Edward Lee Howard, the former CIA agent who defected to the Soviet Union after 
allegedly passing vital U.S. secrets, has been permanently expelled from 
Hungary as a result of the pro-democracy upheaval there and is now in another 
East Bloc country, U.S. sources disclosed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsion has prompted U.S. officials to redouble efforts to apprehend 
Howard, but it is not clear whether those prospects are good. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary revoked Howard's asylum at least a month ago at the urging of U.S. 
officials and over the protests of the Soviet KGB, government sources said. It 
was not known where in the East Bloc he is now living, or whether he is still 
under Moscow's protection. 
</P>
<P>
Howard allegedly told the Soviets key information about CIA operations in 
Moscow, including names of agents and technical equipment being used. He evaded 
an FBI surveillance team in New Mexico in 1985 and then turned up in Moscow. It 
was not clear when he began spending time in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea (for encouraging his expulsion) goes back some months," said a U.S. 
official aware of the effort, "but they (the Hungarians) have acted only in the 
last month or so. Our argument was: 'Here's this guy who cast his lot with the 
Soviet Union but tried to avoid the hardships of Gulag socialism.' 
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose was not to have him turned over to us," the official said. "We 
never thought they would do that." 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of Howard's expulsion came after CIA Director William H. Webster 
made a guarded reference to the case, without mentioning Howard's name, in a 
speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Webster was asked how recent political changes in Eastern Europe have affected 
cooperation between intelligence services of those countries and the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
"I can think of one instance, and I'll not mention a name because it may be 
classified, in which a prominent defector from the United States was finally 
permanently expelled from a bloc country which had provided him comfort and 
sanctuary in the past," Webster said. "And that would have been contrary to the 
wishes of the KGB. So, we are seeing some indications of independence." 
</P>
<P>
Other government sources confirmed that Webster was referring to Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Howard had an important patron in Moscow, Vladimir Kryuchkov, who now heads the 
KGB, and was said to enjoy a comfortable living situation there because of 
Kryuchkov's influence. 
</P>
<P>
But David Wise, a Washington writer and author of "The Spy Who Got Away," an 
account of the defection of Howard, conducted his 1987 interviews of Howard in 
Budapest. Howard is the only CIA agent ever to flee to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked Hungary more than Moscow," Wise recalled in an interview Wednesday 
night. "It was a lot more Western -- the closest he could get to the West." 
</P>
<P>
Wise said that when he interviewed Howard in Budapest in June, 1987, the 
defector planned to spend his summer there. "He has been back there several 
times, including August of 1988, and his wife has visited him there for as long 
as three months," Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's wife, Mary, who lives in St. Paul, Minn., with their daughter, could 
not be reached Wednesday. Wise said he last spoke with Howard by telephone more 
than a year ago but added that he had heard reports of an American encountering 
Howard in Budapest and describing him as "drunk and unhappy." Howard was widely 
reported to be plagued with a drinking problem when he was with the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's true that he is drinking heavily again, that might be a peg for them 
(Hungarian officials) to want him out," Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary was the closest he could get to the West in atmosphere, but he was 
nervous when he was there," he said. He recalled Howard's saying that all it 
would take would be "a hypodermic needle by the CIA and then over the Austrian 
border." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his interviews with Howard, Wise said, the defector was 
protected by both the KGB and local security. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's alleged spying was discovered through the 1985 defection to the United 
States of Vitaly A. Yurchenko, a high-ranking KGB officer who was in charge of 
all operations in the United States and Canada. Yurchenko, who subsequently 
redefected to the Soviet Union, disclosed the existence of a former CIA mole. 
</P>
<P>
Although Yurchenko did not know the man's name, he related enough details, 
including that the mole had been sent on an assignment to Moscow that was 
called off by the CIA, to lead counterintelligence officers to Howard. 
</P>
<P>
However, the FBI, which is responsible for counterintelligence in the United 
States, was not immediately informed of Yurchenko's revelations. Howard, using 
techniques taught him by the FBI when he underwent CIA training for his aborted 
Moscow assignment, then managed to escape an FBI surveillance team and flee to 
Moscow.

COMANECI VAULTS OUT OF ROMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nadia Comaneci, the Romanian athlete who in 1976 earned the world's first 
perfect scores in Olympic gymnastics, has fled her native country, the 
Hungarian government announced. Relatives in this country said they expect her 
to eventually settle in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hungary's official MTI news agency, Comaneci received a three-day 
permit for unrestricted travel within the country Wednesday in Szeged, which is 
about 15 miles from the Romanian border, after crossing into Hungary the night 
before with six other Romanians. 
</P>
<P>
Few details were available about the defection. Comaneci, 27, reportedly told 
Hungarian border guards that it was carried out with the assistance of an 
unidentified Romanian man and that she left behind "a neatly furnished flat, a 
car and financial security for the sake of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports about her immediate destination, although most 
speculation pointed toward Austria. Employees at the hotel in Szeged where 
Comaneci spent the night told United Press International that she left 
Wednesday morning in a car with Viennese license plates. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been expecting her to defect," said Gezar Pozsar, Comaneci's former 
choreographer, who defected to the United States while on a tour in 1981 and 
now operates a gymnastics school in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Pozsar said that he and his wife are waiting to hear from Comaneci and believe 
that she will come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that this is her final destination," he said. "She has good friends 
here among the gymnasts. She also speaks good English and is a very intelligent 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
Pozsar's wife, Maria, who was allowed to immigrate after he defected, is 
Comaneci's second cousin. They saw each other last year at a family reunion in 
their hometown of Onesti, which is in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains 
in northeastern Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"When Maria returned, she said that Nadia was very unhappy. I could tell that 
from looking at the pictures she took. Nadia's face was not smiling." 
</P>
<P>
That same seriousness was also the image that most of the world had of Comaneci 
during the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Four years earlier, the Soviet 
Union's Olga Korbut had tumbled into living rooms via television from the 1972 
Summer Olympics in Munich as a pixie in pigtails. Viewers had to adjust the 
brightness levels on their screens because of her smile. 
</P>
<P>
With the '76 Games, they were captivated by a much different and sober-faced 
young girl. Although she was only 14, Comaneci also was much more technically 
refined than Korbut. No gymnast had ever received a perfect score of 10 from 
judges in the Olympics. Comaneci got seven of them. She also won three gold 
medals on the uneven bars and the balance beam and in overall competition at 
the Montreal Games. 
</P>
<P>
"Nadia changed our sport," said Mike Jacki, executive director of the U.S. 
Gymnastics Federation. "She did everything -- or at least tried to do 
everything -- perfectly, and that was not something you could say for everyone 
in the sport before she came on the scene. Nadia put the emphasis on technical 
mastery." 
</P>
<P>
But performing such difficult moves with so little apparent effort also made 
her seem robotic, an image accentuated by her dark, brooding eyes and her 
stone-faced response even to perfect scores and standing ovations. She looked 
her age only when clutching her ever-present rag doll, trying to hide her 
4-foot-11, 86-pound body behind it during press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Still, television took to her. ABC-TV, which was televising the Olympics, used 
the theme song from a soap opera, "The Young and the Restless," while showing 
highlights of her performances. After that, the song became known as "Nadia's 
Theme." 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning to socialist Romania, Comaneci received a heroine's welcome. 
"Nadia, the Golden Girl of Romanian Sports, a Symbol of the Free Life of Our 
Youth," read the headline in the national sports newspaper, Sportul. She became 
the youngest person in the country ever designated a Hero of Socialist Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Because of injuries and her maturing body, she never again was as successful as 
she had been in 1976, although four years later at the 1980 Summer Olympics in 
Moscow, she won two gold medals and finished second in the individual 
all-around competition. At a ceremony to honor her in Bucharest upon her 
retirement early in 1984, the president of the International Olympic Committee, 
Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, presented her with the Silver Medal of the 
Olympic Order. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that, there had been unconfirmed reports that Comaneci was having 
personal problems, related in part to the defection in 1981 to the United 
States of her coach, Bela Karolyi, and choreographer, Pozsar. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Stabisevski, another Romanian defector who was Comaneci's pianist and now 
teaches gymnasts in Valencia, said that a plan for her to defect to the United 
States was devised while she was attending the World University Games in 
Edmonton, Canada, in 1983. He would not say who was involved in the plan. But 
she said that it fell apart when she refused to go along with it. 
</P>
<P>
"She was afraid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a made-for-television movie in the United States depicted her at one 
point as almost suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the movie at a news conference in Los Angeles during the 1984 
Summer Olympics, which she attended as a guest of the organizing committee, she 
said that she had not seen it but had been told that it was exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
As a successful coach of juniors in Romania and an internationally certified 
judge, she continued to travel throughout the world for the next few years. She 
was in Seoul for the 1988 Summer Olympics, in which some of the women she had 
coached helped Romania win a silver medal in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the last trip she was allowed to take. Jacki said that he inquired 
earlier this year about her availability for a recent tour of the United States 
by Korbut and Mary Lou Retton, the U.S. gymnast who won a gold medal in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the 'three caballeros' in women's gymnastics," Jacki said. "I wanted 
to get them together. But I was told in no uncertain terms by an official from 
the Romanian Gymnastics Federation that it wasn't possible for Nadia to come. 
It wasn't a matter for negotiation. He said that the order came down from above 
him. There was no explanation." 
</P>
<P>
Pozsar said that Comaneci's sudden difficulties with the government stemmed 
from the termination of her relationship with Nicu Ceausescu, the son of 
Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"His mother forced him to stop seeing her," Pozsar said. "Nadia is a very 
popular person in Romania and lives like royalty, but she is only a gymnast. 
She is not a princess. Nicu's mother wanted a princess for him. 
</P>
<P>
"That made Nadia feel like she was in disgrace. The government knew she was 
unhappy and was afraid she would leave. So they stopped her from traveling. 
They put her in a golden cage. 
</P>
<P>
"Nadia is a national treasure, the only symbol of success the country has had 
for the last decade and a half. People there love her like she's their own 
child. Now she's gone. I think that could have a big political impact." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reforms undertaken by other Warsaw Pact nations in recent months, 
Romania has held fast to its rigid socialistic policies. Ceausescu recently 
said that the government would not change until "the beech tree bears apples, 
and the reeds bear flowers."

OFFENSIVE PUSHED SALVADOR WAR TO NEW, BLOODIER LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN SALVADOR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, there was an ominous tip from a factory guard on the northern edge of 
San Salvador: Peasants in civilian clothing and military boots were asking 
directions into the city. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting had all but ceased in rural Chalatenango and Morazan provinces, the 
traditional theaters of the civil war. Then, rebel radios fell silent, a sure 
sign that the long-expected urban guerrilla offensive was about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
By the time 1,500 to 2,000 guerrillas had infiltrated the city, the government 
thought it was ready. Military units had been placed on alert, and President 
Alfredo Cristiani had abandoned his residence. The rebels had lost the 
advantage of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the intensity and duration of the offensive, which started the night of 
Nov. 11, has mocked all official predictions and sent Cristiani's elected 
right-wing government reeling. 
</P>
<P>
After 2 1/2 weeks of fighting, the armed forces hold a tenuous advantage 
against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). But the rebels 
have slipped in and out of the city several times, striking again Wednesday at 
a number of neighborhoods and occupying mansions of the rich. Few here are 
willing to bet that the offensive, or the fierce right-wing backlash it has 
provoked, will soon end. 
</P>
<P>
"The crisis is just beginning," San Salvador Mayor Armando Calderon Sol said. 
"The country has entered a very violent stage." 
</P>
<P>
A right-wing businessman close to the government said: "Things are returning to 
normal. But I'm afraid it will be a normalcy a lot like Beirut's." 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, the Marxist-led FMLN has fought a series of U.S.-backed 
governments to a military standoff in the steamy coastal lowlands and forested 
volcano slopes of this tiny agrarian nation. About 70,000 people have died. 
</P>
<P>
The November offensive has produced neither a decisive popular uprising nor an 
outright military victory. But it has advanced at least two rebel aims: It has 
brought the chaos of the deadlocked peasant war into a city that has more than 
one-third of El Salvador's 5.8 million people -- a situation that, if 
prolonged, could make the country ungovernable; and it has unleashed a 
murderous crackdown that swiftly undermined a decade of U.S. counterinsurgency 
policy and $4 billion in aid aimed at building a political center. 
</P>
<P>
State of Siege 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador today is under a formal stage of siege, dominated by militarists on 
the far left and the far right. 
</P>
<P>
Both armies issued analyses this week boasting of military and political gains. 
Interviews with diplomats and Salvadorans across the spectrum leave the 
impression that the conflict has become even more intractable, with little hope 
for a peaceful solution. 
</P>
<P>
"The army and the guerrillas can both claim victory," leftist politician Ruben 
Zamora said. "And a winner does not negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels' offensive, their biggest of the war, appears to be part of a 
two-track strategy to end the fighting through negotiation or outright military 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
While issuing a flurry of peace proposals throughout the year -- and starting 
negotiations with the government in September -- the FMLN was stockpiling 
thousands of weapons in urban hide-outs. 
</P>
<P>
According to several sources, the stalling of the peace talks and the increase 
of paramilitary attacks on pro-FMLN groups in the capital last month sparked 
the battle plan to action. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas attacked Cristiani's house as the offensive started. Rather than 
focus on military targets, they entrenched themselves in working-class suburbs 
north and east of downtown, handing weapons to anyone who would fight on their 
side. In doing so, they trapped tens of thousands of people in those barrios. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew the robber was going to enter the house, but we didn't know how," a 
senior Salvadoran army officer admitted. "He didn't catch us asleep, but we 
didn't know where he would be coming from." 
</P>
<P>
The army appears to have underestimated the guerrillas' strength. It tried to 
defend the capital with 3,000 soldiers, but they were spread thin. Gradually, 
as simultaneous rebel raids on four other cities bogged down, the government 
brought another 7,000 soldiers to the capital. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the air force began rocketing and strafing the occupied 
neighborhoods -- on the fifth night of the offensive, after what one diplomat 
called "days of massive confusion" -- that the government gained the advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the government's relative ineffectiveness on the ground allowed most of 
the rebels to slip out of the capital after nine days of hard fighting and 
return with a startling siege of the wealthy Escalon neighborhood and the 
Sheraton Hotel two days later. Rebel columns have been moving in and out of the 
capital ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"The army is reacting, not attacking," a Western diplomat said. "The FMLN 
throughout this has dictated the when, the where, the how." 
</P>
<P>
The army has admitted that more than 400 of its soldiers have been killed, 
while it claims to have inflicted heavier casualties on the guerrillas. The 
rebels do not report their losses. Hundreds of civilians have died in the 
cross-fire and air raids. 
</P>
<P>
In its analysis of the fighting, the army said the FMLN has "suffered a 
military defeat . . . the greatest losses of its history." But it conceded that 
"there are still possibilities that (the rebels) can initiate limited 
offensives in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels broadcast a long evaluation claiming that the offensive has brought 
"accelerated political decomposition" to the capital, threatening the future of 
U.S. aid and proving that there can be no peace without serious negotiations. 
"The battle of San Salvador," it concluded, has barely begun. 
</P>
<P>
The war's most important political battles are being fought in Washington. 
Every turn of events in El Salvador is closely watched by an Administration and 
Congress that provide roughly $1.4 million per day in aid to the Cristiani 
government. 
</P>
<P>
American public opinion was shocked by the slayings of six Jesuit priests, 
their cook and her daughter on the fifth night of the rebel offensive -- an 
attack widely viewed as retaliation by a rightist paramilitary death squad. 
</P>
<P>
An army officer said the massacre was more damaging to the government than the 
rebel offensive -- a view repeated by civilians close to Cristiani. It was 
followed by a police crackdown on churches and leftist organizations and by 
legislative approval of a sweeping anti-terrorist law that, among other things, 
would make it a crime to speak in favor of FMLN peace proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptical of Salvadoran pledges to investigate the slayings, Democrats in 
Congress tried to withhold 30% of El Salvador's current $85-million package of 
military aid until next April. The attempt failed by a narrow margin. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Salvadoran government scored a propaganda coup, one that 
might neutralize any more moves to cut U.S. aid. It discovered the wreckage of 
a light plane that crashed with 25 anti-aircraft missiles and other arms that 
were apparently being sent to the rebels from Nicaragua. The missiles -- the 
FMLN has not yet used such weapons -- were an ominous sign of escalating 
warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Because El Salvador is host to the largest U.S. counterinsurgency effort since 
the Vietnam War, the all-out rebel attack has invited comparisons with the 1968 
Tet offensive against the U.S.-backed government of South Vietnam. Tet 
ultimately failed militarily, but it helped turn American public opinion 
against U.S. involvement in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Some Salvadorans prefer to compare the present situation to that of January, 
1981, when the FMLN undertook its so-called final offensive in an effort to 
seize power before Ronald Reagan became President. Despite conditions that made 
El Salvador ripe for revolution then, the offensive sputtered out in a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora, a leftist with ties to FMLN leaders, has spent much of the last two 
years, since he was allowed to return from exile, trying to persuade the rebels 
that political conditions have improved in El Salvador since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Zamora contends, although the FMLN came far better armed this time and 
has sustained its offensive far longer, it failed to spark an insurrection 
because people had become hopeful of a peaceful solution and too weary of the 
war to want to take up arms. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive of the FMLN showed that it is a strong force that cannot be 
defeated militarily," he said. "But at the same time, it became clear that the 
people are not in an insurrectional stage." 
</P>
<P>
The FMLN, which could not find enough people to use all of the weapons it had 
smuggled into town, admitted in its analysis that an insurrection had been 
thwarted. It blamed the government air strikes for intimidating potential 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
But the sheer intensity of the fighting has worked in the rebels' favor by 
aggravating the dismal social conditions that spawned their movement in the 
first place. A decade of massive U.S. aid has failed to close the huge gap 
between rich and poor. Half of all Salvadorans in the labor force lack adequate 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the questionable guerrilla tactic of entrenching combatants in crowded 
neighborhoods and daring the army to blast them out, most people in 
bomb-damaged homes blamed the military for their plight. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a conflict between two armies but between the airplanes and the 
people," said a church worker who treated wounded civilians in the 
working-class suburb of Mejicanos. "For the army in El Salvador, the poor are 
an enemy to be combatted." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the fighting occurred in poor barrios, creating new homeless and 
jobless people whom the state cannot care for. The government has estimated 
$130 million in direct damage, not to mention the loss of foreign investment it 
was courting. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani Hurt 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser in all this could be Cristiani, a wealthy businessman elected 
last March on a protest vote against the troubled economic record of his 
centrist predecessor, Jose Napoleon Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
As with Duarte, U.S. policy-makers invested their hope in Cristiani not only to 
manage the economy but also to rein in death squads and other anti-democratic 
elements of the armed forces. Although founders of his Nationalist Republican 
Alliance ran death squads in the early 1980s, Cristiani, a 42-year-old 
political novice, is described by the U.S. Embassy as a decent man who means 
well. 
</P>
<P>
That moderate image, designed to court favor with Congress, has been severely 
tested by the guerrilla offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani has defended the harsh anti-terrorist law, rejected new peace talks 
with the guerrillas and taken the radical step of suspending relations with 
Nicaragua. In doing so, he has turned increasingly to the army high command for 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
"This is converting him into a dictator, as the majority of the army would 
like," said a businessman who has been consulted by Cristiani. "I don't believe 
he agrees with death squads. In that sense, he's a moderate. But he doesn't 
believe in democracy." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, U.S. officials and Cristiani's advisers credit him with 
freeing some foreigners arrested in the police crackdown and preventing 
less-discriminate military attacks on guerrilla-held barrios. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholic Church officials say Cristiani's biggest test, the investigation 
of the Jesuits' massacre, will depend on who wins a power struggle between 
hard-liners and moderates in the armed forces and his party. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had hoped that an expected Dec. 1 shake-up of the armed forces 
would push out extremist officers. But Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the army chief 
of staff, said Tuesday that there will be no shake-up while the fighting 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
When changes do come, those who fought well could be rewarded. For example, 
Gen. Juan Rafael Bustillo, the hard-line air force chief, apparently has been 
strengthened by his pilots' pivotal role in the recent fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Other features of El Salvador's political landscape will not become clear until 
the urban war fades -- if it does. A dusk-to-dawn curfew is in effect, and 
hundreds of opposition leaders are silenced or in hiding, waiting to see if the 
political center will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest imponderable is the fate of the FMLN. Having endured heavy 
casualties and exposed its carefully constructed civilian-support networks 
without a clear victory, how long can Latin America's strongest irregular army 
fight on? 
</P>
<P>
Behind their accelerated push to end the conflict, according to diplomats in 
Central America, was a feeling among the rebels that the East-West thaw is 
quickly making an anachronism of liberation movements such as theirs. 
Nicaragua's stepped-up support for the FMLN, in this view, could be part of a 
last-ditch effort before regional negotiations oblige a halt to such aid. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, the guerrillas are not likely to disarm and join a system that 
so many Salvadorans consider unjust. Before the Nicaraguan connection hit the 
news, U.S. officials had taken a sobering lesson from the rebel offensive: A 
decade of counterinsurgency had made little progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disaster," a senior official in Washington said. "We knew we had 
problems in El Salvador, but it's worse than we thought." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Doyle McManus in Washington and Tracy Wilkinson in San 
Salvador contributed to this story.

TEEN-AGER ACCUSED OF DROWNING BABY BUT MAY BE FREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON and SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old Garden Grove honor student accused of drowning her newborn baby 
in a high school toilet may not have knowingly killed the child, an autopsy 
revealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mother was booked on suspicion of murdering the full-term, 6-pound 
boy after giving birth in a girls' restroom Tuesday morning, police and 
prosecutors say it may take two weeks to decide whether to bring criminal 
charges against the Vietnamese-American girl, whose culture frowns on unwed 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to early police reports that nobody at the school knew of her 
pregnancy, some classmates at Santiago High School and a guidance counselor 
said Wednesday that they knew she was pregnant. But they said her baggy clothes 
and evasive answers led them to believe that the pregnancy was in its early 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't look pregnant to me," said counselor Carolyn Rust, who called the 
girl in a week before Thanksgiving after hearing rumors of the pregnancy. "I 
thought, the way the conversation went, that she was newly pregnant, a month, 
two months." 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't tell nobody she was pregnant," said classmate Richard Pan, 17. "But 
most of us knew." 
</P>
<P>
The girl's parents did not know, however, and the girl apparently was too 
terrified to tell them, police and classmates said. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary autopsy results confirmed that the baby died of drowning, said 
Garden Grove Police Sgt. Kevin Raney. "There's no indication that she drowned 
it," Raney said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley said prosecutors had ruled out a 
charge of first-degree murder because there is no evidence that the death was 
premeditated. But he said they are considering whether to bring a lesser 
charge, such as second-degree murder or manslaughter. Depending on whether the 
girl knew that the baby would die, Conley added, there may be no criminal 
charges at all. 
</P>
<P>
Several other female students were in the restroom during the birth, but did 
not know what was happening until they heard an infant's cry from behind a 
closed stall door, Raney said. 
</P>
<P>
The students ran to notify the school nurse, but by the time police and 
paramedics arrived, Raney said, the baby was dead. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was taken to UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange and was booked on 
suspicion of murder. She remained in the hospital in stable condition Wednesday 
and was to be transferred to Orange County Juvenile Hall later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's actually to protect her from herself and from her family, because we 
don't know what they will do," Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is taboo in our culture to talk about sex or errors or mistakes that you 
made in your sexual relationships," said Long C. Le, a Vietnamese-born English 
teacher at nearby Fountain Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the tradition of the culture of Vietnam, the parents 
automatically cut off all relations with the girl if they find out she is 
pregnant and not married," Le said. "They usually kick the girl out of the 
house. It's that bad." 
</P>
<P>
The girl this fall had taken the high school's required health education 
course, which includes information on sex and reproduction, Principal Bob 
O'Higgins said. And basic information about sex was taught in her junior high 
school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But a Vietnamese-American classmate -- who had taken the same courses -- said 
Wednesday that she did not know much about birth control, would not know how to 
obtain it, and assumed that the young mother did not either.

THRIFT OWNER CALLED A 'CON MAN';

Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. was a "con man" who 
relied on lies and political influence -- "juice" -- to fool and bully 
regulators in charge of his ill-fated Irvine-based thrift, California Savings 
and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford told an Assembly committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also heard Gov. George Deukmejian's top campaign fund-raiser, Los 
Angeles attorney Karl M. Samuelian, defend his actions as one of Keating's 
attorneys, hired to represent the Arizona businessman's interests before state 
regulators. Samuelian said he recommended the appointment of two successive 
state corporations commissioners -- both of whom subsequently approved the 
sales of high-risk junk bonds by Lincoln's parent corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian, Deukmejian's campaign finance chairman since 1982, also said that he 
represented Keating at several meetings with state regulators. After the 
hearing, Samuelian told reporters that he helped set up meetings between 
Keating and the regulators' boss, Business, Transportation and Housing 
Secretary John K. Geoghegan. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Crawford's blunt remarks about Keating's tactics and demeanor that 
provided the most provocative testimony Wednesday before the Assembly's Finance 
and Insurance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a simple explanation of why Lincoln Savings failed, prompting a 
federal takeover in April that could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, 
Crawford said: "If I had to pick one reason, I would have to say that probably 
the owner was a con man. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a dominant person who believed that he was above the law and 
regulations, that he was powerful and he had the juice and he could win. He 
could fight the regulators, and he did a very good job of it." 
</P>
<P>
When Keating first took over Lincoln in February, 1984, he told state 
regulators one thing but all along planned to do another, Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were going to run a traditional savings and loan. They lied to 
us," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Crawford said, Keating used Lincoln's citizen deposits and sales of 
high-risk bonds as sources of cash for marginal land acquisitions in Arizona, 
Colorado, Texas and Louisiana. Crawford said that when he took over the 
department in 1985, he found that his predecessor had allowed Keating to keep 
the original records of Lincoln Savings in Phoenix, leaving only incomplete 
copies of documents for California regulators in the Lincoln offices in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said he ordered Lincoln's files to be brought back to California after 
he discovered Keating had contributed $50,000 to Arizona's attorney general in 
an uncontested race -- a move that persuaded him that any action by California 
regulators would be resisted by their counterparts in Arizona. He also said 
regulators needed the centralized files to help keep up with Keating's 
financial empire, which expanded from 32 corporations in 1984 to 54 entities by 
the end of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"That was 54 places to hide the smoking gun," said Crawford, who added: "We 
were never on top of the problems of Lincoln Savings. . . . They could write up 
(the value of) their assets faster than you could write them down." 
</P>
<P>
He said the task was made even more difficult by the phalanx of Keating 
employees and attorneys, who overwhelmed understaffed regulators. Crawford said 
he tried to keep tabs of Lincoln with only one experienced examiner and two 
trainees. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Lincoln and American Continental) had a battery of people. They had 48 
CPAs, they had 15 attorneys on staff. I just lately learned they employed 77 
outside law firms," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a Home Loan Bank Board memo that said Keating had attempted to 
have him fired, Crawford said he did not know of any such effort but added that 
he, like federal regulators, felt "beat up" by the Arizona businessman. 
</P>
<P>
'Proof of the Pudding' 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that no one from Deukmejian's office tried to influence his 
handling of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the juice (but) he didn't have it on a direct line from the governor to 
me. I'm still here, and that's proof of the pudding, I think," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), expressed 
concern about allegations that Keating and his associates used political 
connections to influence state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Keating was invited to attend the committee hearing but did not respond, 
Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian fund-raiser Samuelian, however, said he has never contacted the 
governor on behalf of any client. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the governor is concerned, I have religiously for 10 years separated 
my business matters from my (campaign) assistance to the governor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian outlined 1986 and 1987 contributions to Deukmejian's campaign 
committee from Keating's companies, relatives and business associates totaling 
$150,000, plus an additional $100,000 to Republican fund-raising efforts in 
California that Samuelian collected. 
</P>
<P>
However, he denied ever "lobbying" for Keating or his companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We were representing a client as a lawyer, not doing any lobbying work," 
Samuelian said. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Samuelian said he helped set up Keating's meetings in 
February and March, 1988, with Transportation and Housing Secretary Geoghegan, 
a Deukmejian appointee whose agency oversees the state's savings and loan and 
corporations regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian also revealed to the committee Wednesday that he had recommended that 
Deukmejian appoint two former law associates, Franklin Tom and Christine W. 
Bender, as corporation commissioners. The governor named Tom first, and then 
Bender succeeded him. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tom and Bender approved the sale of controversial high-risk bonds issued 
by American Continental and sold through Lincoln's branches. 
</P>
<P>
After Tom left his post as commissioner, he rejoined Samuelian's law firm and 
represented Keating's position in meetings with Bender, his successor and 
former deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Wording Deleted 
</P>
<P>
Also during the hearing, state savings and loan examiner Richard Newsom said 
the state attorney general's office deleted wording in a December, 1988, 
cease-and-desist order against American Continental that could have warned 
investors not to buy the company's high-risk junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Newsom said the wording would have been the "atomic bomb" to end the junk bond 
sales, which continued through early 1989. But, he added, the attorney general 
balked at including the language because his office lacked the expertise to 
defend the state on a court challenge over securities matters. 
</P>
<P>
However, Newsom's testimony was immediately refuted by both Atty. Gen. John K. 
Van de Kamp and an attorney for the Savings and Loan Department. The attorney, 
Shirley Thayer, said she and others in the department made the decision to drop 
the language, not Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President 
Bush had no immediate plans to oust M. Danny Wall, the embattled chairman of 
the office of thrift supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who previously headed the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is under fire for 
not acting on a recommendation by regional regulators to seize Lincoln in 1987. 
The government did not take control of the thrift until last April, and critics 
contend that the delay greatly increased the eventual cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press briefing if the White House planned to fire Wall, Fitzwater 
replied: "No, there's been no consideration of Mr. Wall's tenure. He's serving 
on the (office of thrift supervision) board, and there's been no change." 
</P>
<P>
Calls for Wall's resignation have increased in recent days. On Wednesday, three 
nonprofit organizations -- the National Taxpayers Union, Public Citizen and 
Citizens Against Government -- sent a letter to Bush urging him to oust Wall.

HEALTH ALARM FOR FOSTER CARE; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN: REPORTS FIND FREQUENT CHRONIC PSYCHIATRIC AND PHYSICAL ILLNESSES. 
SYSTEM'S ROLLS ARE INCREASED BY DRUG-EXPOSED BABIES. 
</P>

<P>
In California, children in foster care are 10 times more likely than other 
children to suffer from chronic psychiatric and physical illness and receive 
largely inadequate health care and social services during their years in the 
child welfare system, according to several statewide studies released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The studies also found an alarming increase in the number of infants and 
toddlers entering foster care, with more than 18,000 children under the age of 
3 presently residing in foster homes and shelters, up from 9,500 in 1986. 
Foster care officials blamed the rise partly on a huge jump in the number of 
"crack" or drug-exposed babies in California and an overall increase among 
parents with substance abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, prepared by three nonprofit children's education and research 
groups, painted a grim future for the 67,000 foster care children in the state 
unless drastic improvements are made in their medical and psychiatric treatment 
and millions of dollars are injected into the overburdened child welfare 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"The studies show that in many ways, the state and the counties are parenting 
as badly in their ways as the children's parents did," Sid Gardner, director of 
the Youth at Risk project for California Tomorrow said at a news conference at 
Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. "Entering the foster care system is not as 
strong a substitute for these kids as it should be, and instead of making 
things better for them, it continues their downward spiral." 
</P>
<P>
The three studies were based primarily on hundreds of interviews with foster 
children, social workers, health care officials, lawyers, judges, foster 
parents and others. Besides the huge jump in the state's overall foster care 
population, the researchers found disturbing numbers of children diagnosed with 
mental health problems. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report prepared by the Children's Research Institute of 
California, nine out of 10 foster children ages 3 to 7 studied in San Diego 
County had a history of mental health problems and more than half of the 205 
children living at MacLaren Children's Center -- Los Angeles County's primary 
foster shelter -- were diagnosed in December as having behavioral problems, 
ranging from mild depression to schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the Oakland-based Center for the Vulnerable Child compared Medi-Cal 
records of foster care children with those of other children and found an 
incidence rate of chronic mental and physical illness nearly 10 times greater 
among those in the state's child welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have is children without hope, families without help and service 
agencies that are besieged at this point," said Jean McIntosh, western director 
of the Child Welfare League of America. "And the hope and the help that the 
(service agencies) offer are simply not enough to rebuild the children's 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
It will take millions of dollars to combat the health problems in the foster 
care system, proponents say. Researchers suggested that local welfare agencies 
set up computerized health care services for abused, neglected and abandoned 
children that will enable nurses and social service workers to chart and track 
the children's medical history even when they move to shelters and foster homes 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Neal Kaufman, a pediatrician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center who is working 
with Los Angeles County to tackle the problem, also suggested that all children 
receive an immediate health screening within 24 hours after being taken from 
their home and should get a complete medical evaluation within 30 days after 
leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
Children's group advocates also said that each child placed in foster care 
should be assigned to a designated social worker who is accountable for the 
child's protection, and that special education programs should be designed for 
children in the system. 
</P>
<P>
The studies follow a report issued by a blue-ribbon panel of experts this year, 
which evaluated the health and welfare of California's 7.6 million children and 
gave the state an overall grade of D. 
</P>
<P>
That report, issued by Children Now, stressed that taxpayers will continue to 
pay a high price for neglecting children, who are increasingly failed by a lack 
of preventive services and "face a life of welfare, unproductive work and 
crime."

7-CENT GAS TAX HIKE TO UPGRADE TRANSIT URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Upgrading America's mass transit system, repairing its aging highways and 
reducing gridlock will require an increase in the federal gasoline tax of at 
least 7 cents per gallon, according to a report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year study by the American Public Transit Assn. calls on the federal 
government to boost its annual transportation appropriations from the current 
$3 billion, an amount that has remained unchanged since 1981, to about $11 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Without federal support, in many states there would be no public 
transportation," said Robert R. Kiley, chairman of both the Transit 2000 Task 
Force and New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we can solve the transportation problem in this country until 
we look at it in a national sense," said Carmen E. Turner, general manager of 
the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority who also was a member of the 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
But Transportation Department spokesman Robert Marx said that Transportation 
Secretary Samuel K. Skinner would not support an increase in the gasoline tax, 
currently 9 cents per gallon with 1 cent earmarked for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Skinner feels the same way as the President. No new taxes," Marx 
said. "He has encouraged states to increase their gas taxes and encouraged them 
to use other methods and devices to increase their transportation funding, such 
as toll roads and lotteries." 
</P>
<P>
Kiley noted that the proposed tax hike would require support from both 
Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress and probably could not be 
considered until after the 1990 congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged about what I've heard from Congress," Kiley said. He 
acknowledged, however, that "it's going to be really tough because the 
President said there will be no new taxes (and) I don't think the leadership of 
Congress wants to take the initiative . . . unless they have a clear signal 
from the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Kiley said that virtually all of the proceeds from a gas tax hike would finance 
capital investments, with about half earmarked for maintainence of existing 
facilities and the rest for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Jack R. Gilstrap, executive vice president of the national transit trade group 
and former general manager of the Southern California Rapid Transit District, 
said that the problems with public transportation are nearing crisis 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a difficult time to be talking about tax increases," he said. "But 
there are more and more people becoming aware that the infrastructure of the 
nation is in bad shape, and it's becoming a threat to our economy." 
</P>
<P>
Citing recent suggestions that America's defense spending will be reduced, 
freeing up funds for domestic needs, Gilstrap said that commerce relies heavily 
on efficient transportation.

PRAGUE BASKS IN THE QUIET AFTERGLOW OF SUCCESSFUL REVOLUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly two weeks of raw emotion, a quiet afterglow fell over Prague on 
Wednesday -- the afterglow of success. 
</P>
<P>
It came amid signs that the city was returning to normal. In Old Town Square, 
municipal workers trimmed a large Christmas tree, and nearby, a cluster of 
students drank and listened as a friend strummed a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Gone was the electric sense of anticipation that had characterized the past 
couple of weeks, starting in the mornings and building up to huge 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the few hundred young people in Wenceslas Square had not come to make a 
revolution but to see where one had been made. 
</P>
<P>
The largest crowd in Prague was not demonstrating for freedom. It consisted of 
tourists outside the 14th-Century Town Hall, waiting for the chimes of one of 
Europe's oldest clocks to sound. 
</P>
<P>
People were looking for bargains, not justice. 
</P>
<P>
Wall posters started coming down as teams of students moved through the city 
center wielding solvent and razor blades. They had promised the shopkeepers 
they would clean up, and they were keeping their promise. 
</P>
<P>
The only new posters were in the subway station near the Parliament building, 
where the legislators were meeting in emergency session to consider a draft 
amendment that would end the Communist Party's dominant role. 
</P>
<P>
"Deputies, Vote for the Voters, Not Yourselves," a poster urged. Another read, 
"Communist Party Under the Parliament, Not Parliament Under the Communist 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
The liberty bell put up by the students last weekend was still on a hillock 
overlooking the city, where a 40-foot-tall statue of Josef Stalin once stood. 
</P>
<P>
On a window ledge just off Wenceslas Square, the thousands of candles lighted 
in the days of protest had melted into a great slab of wax. Only one small 
flame flickered. 
</P>
<P>
In a small plaza not far from the opposition Civic Forum's headquarters at the 
Magic Lantern Theater, Jiracek Zdenek was back in business, after a hiatus of 
10 days, doing a brisk trade in lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
In this afterglow of success, there was a new sense of self-confidence, of 
genuine happiness. The people of Prague seemed to walk with a bounce in their 
step. Heads were held high, and there were smiles on faces that for 20 years 
had seemed uniformly glum and downcast. Strangers greeted one another with 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
A student who accidentally jolted a briefcase from the hand of a passer-by was 
told, with a smile, "That's all right." 
</P>
<P>
The longest line in the city center was not for some sought-after consumer 
item. It was outside Civic Forum headquarters, and it was made up of people 
waiting to enlist in the movement for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers recalled that a similar mood accompanied the brief, heady days of 
the 1968 reform effort, the so-called Prague Spring. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are happy, they are nice to each other," a woman commented. "When 
they are frustrated, they are nasty and glum. We've turned human again."

NATO MINISTERS SAY RISKS REMAIN, REAFFIRM NEED FOR STRONG DEFENSE

Defense ministers of the Western Alliance on Wednesday reaffirmed the need for 
a strong defense. They acted at the close of a two-day meeting that concerned 
itself mainly with the rapid changes taking place in Eastern Europe and reports 
of a projected reduction in U.S. troops in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, representing the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, said political developments in the Warsaw Pact countries have 
presented the West with "new opportunities" for forging a lasting peace in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But they added that potential risk is involved, because the Soviet Union has 
retained its military capability. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the commitment to Western defenses was uncertainty about U.S. 
military plans. There have been reports that in the years ahead, the Bush 
Adminstration will reduce by as much as two-thirds its forces in Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sidestepped the issue at a press conference 
Wednesday by promising that the United States would make no reductions without 
consulting its partners in the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The reports of a U.S. troop reduction have confused some allied planners 
because U.S. troop levels are regarded as a bellwether of what will happen to 
their own defense budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult," a Dutch official said, "for us to tell our public that we 
need to keep paying for defense when they hear that the United States is going 
to reduce its forces."

CIVIC FORUM: AN UNCONVENTIONAL -- BUT EFFECTIVE -- ENGINE FOR REFORM; 
</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE OPPOSITION GROUP'S OBJECTIVE IS 'NOT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC 
ABOUT OUR OBJECTIVES,' ITS LEADERS SAY.

<P>
The only requirement for Civic Forum membership, the opposition group's 
spokesman, Jiri Dienstbier, said the other day, is a desire to be rid of the 
constitutional "leading role" of any political party. 
</P>
<P>
By that standard, the entire, Communist-dominated Czechoslovak Parliament 
became eligible Wednesday, when it voted unanimously to amend this country's 
basic law to eliminate the controversial clause that for 41 years has given the 
Communists a monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
That the vote came only 10 days after Civic Forum declared its existence is 
testimony to the effectiveness of what has, virtually overnight, become Eastern 
Europe's fastest-growing and most talked about democratic movement. 
</P>
<P>
It's an amorphous movement -- and not only proud of it but determined to stay 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's growing spontaneously," said Martin Palous, a political scientist and 
Civic Forum adviser during a 90-second "interview" as he raced to meet an 
American diplomat. "I can't tell you how its organized, because it's not 
organized at all. People are forming local centers, and we're putting pins in a 
map." 
</P>
<P>
As much as its leaders joke about their lack of organization, however, they're 
planning a national congress, possibly in as soon as two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
They talk about their objective being "not to be very specific about our 
objectives" -- it keeps everybody on their toes, particularly the 
representatives of the system they're determined to overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
They claim to be political amateurs, but their tactics have so far won nothing 
but praise, even from grudging admirers among their Communist Party 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
"They're using the same strategies against us as we used in 1948," when the 
Communists took over Czechoslovakia, a party activist said to a diplomatic 
acquaintance the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. As far as anyone knows, Civic Forum hasn't shot anyone yet -- which 
makes its record all the more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The group's temporary headquarters at Prague's Magic Lantern Theater attracts a 
constant crush of visitors. On Wednesday, scores were watching a live 
television broadcast from an extraordinary session of the Czechoslovak 
Parliament on one of two outdoor sets. 
</P>
<P>
Others read the latest handbills posted on the theater walls or taped to the 
windows of the clothing store and bookstore on either side. "We Need a Merry 
Christmas With a New Government," read one. 
</P>
<P>
Another steady stream of visitors lined up for free literature. "Though I'm 
Communist, I fully identify with the demands of Civic Forum," said Karel 
Ksandr, 23, who was one of about 50 people queuing up at mid-afternoon 
Wednesday. "It seems that these proclamations truly mirror the ideas of a vast 
majority of people around me." 
</P>
<P>
There are no dues for Civic Forum membership, although there are cardboard 
boxes for donations. 
</P>
<P>
When he announced its formation at a press conference in his living room barely 
10 days ago, dissident playwright Vaclav Havel said that "perhaps something 
like New Forum in East Germany can develop out of this," though he quickly 
added that was probably too optimistic. In fact, the Czechoslovak group has far 
surpassed its East German counterpart, and Havel's comment today seems an 
extraordinary understatement. 
</P>
<P>
While in the broadest sense both Civic Forum and Poland's Solidarity are social 
movements, Czechoslovak activists strongly reject comparison with their 
counterparts one country to the north. 
</P>
<P>
"Solidarity had to struggle not for 10 days but for 10 years," said Dienstbier. 
"And today there are problems whether Solidarity is a trade union or a 
political party. This would certainly represent an obstacle to our main 
objective, which is to establish a real plurality of forces." 
</P>
<P>
"Civic Forum is a very loose grouping -- a broad forum," said Havel. "It is not 
and cannot be a political party." 
</P>
<P>
While it is negotiating with the government over the membership and program of 
a new Cabinet to be nominated by next Sunday, Havel has pledged that "in no 
case" will representatives of the group be directly represented. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum's leaders appear genuinely uninterested in political roles for 
themselves. Their concern is to see the society energized. 
</P>
<P>
Its members scold people who ask them what to do. "We are not your superior 
body," the group said in a statement addressed to burgeoning local Civic Forum 
groups Wednesday. "You yourselves know what must be done today and what should 
be done tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Its own personnel seem to change jobs "from day to day," said a diplomat. "The 
only thing that seems to be at the center is Vaclav Havel. And even he doesn't 
have any formal role. They call him 'chief.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There are a few people on top who consult with a body of about 100 other 
people. And that's it," said Jan Urban, one of those 100 advisers. "It's a 
group of amateurs, most of them dissidents" associated with the Charter 77 
human rights movement here. For example, Urban, a former schoolteacher, was 
fired for refusing to sign a condemnation of the original Charter 77 
signatories and spent the next dozen years tending horses, working in a factory 
and laying bricks. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the scores of volunteers, like Vladimira Zakova, 28, a Russian 
and English translator. "It's just this feeling that we must all do something 
to help," she explained Wednesday, during her fifth day on the job. "Earlier, I 
was just going to the demonstrations. But then I realized that my knowledge and 
abilities could be better used here." 
</P>
<P>
Zakova said she was in the midst of translating an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel 
into Czech when the revolution broke out. Because of her activity, "I'm 
horribly late" with the job. However, she said, "I think this is more 
important. F. Scott Fitzgerald is the only person who would regret this." 
</P>
<P>
Urban describes Civic Forum's decision-making process as "theater revolution. . 
. . People sit in the theater, and they discuss. Then they go into different 
rooms and discuss in committees. They they join together again, discuss some 
more and issue proclamations." 
</P>
<P>
While they may not be practiced politicians, their political instincts have 
been unerring so far. 
</P>
<P>
After the brutal police suppression of a student demonstration on Nov. 17, they 
recognized a political turning point and organized their movement before most 
of the Communist leadership, unaware, returned to town from weekend homes in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
This week, after leading an enormously successful two-hour nationwide strike 
Monday, Civic Forum suddenly called off further demonstrations so as not to 
risk dulling its main weapon through overuse. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with an Italian Communist delegation earlier this week, Havel stressed 
that Civic Forum is not anti-Communist but anti-totalitarian. In fact, he said, 
the group hopes that reform-minded Communists will "rejuvenate" the 
Czechoslovak party. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the group is supposed to move into new quarters arranged by 
Prague's Communist Party leadership. Civic Forum's members were offered space 
in the Palace of Culture -- which, ironically, was the site of a major Prague 
party meeting last weekend. But they turned it down as too far from the center 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the speed with which the democratic revolution here has unfolded, Forum 
activists figure that much work remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"Civic Forum has declared itself a guarantee of holding free elections, and 
under no circumstances will it terminate its own activities unless a free 
election is held," said Dienstbier. 
</P>
<P>
And what role will it play in those elections? 
</P>
<P>
An amorphous one, it would appear. "History began to develop very quickly in . 
. . a country that has had 20 years of timelessness," Havel said earlier this 
week while apologizing to journalists for not offering specific answers to 
questions about the future. "So don't ask more of us than we are capable of 
delivering."

Israeli soldiers shot and killed two masked Palestinians who were throwing 
stones at Israeli cars, the army said. The incidents took place on the main 
highway between Jerusalem and Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. In the Gaza 
Strip, 16 Arabs were wounded by army gunfire, Arab reports said. Palestinians 
in the occupied territories observed a general strike to mark the anniversary 
of the 1947 U.N. vote to partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish states.

O'CONNOR SKEPTICAL OF MINNESOTA CONSENT LAW; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: THE JUSTICE'S COMMENTS MAY PROVIDE A CLUE TO HER TRUE VIEWS. SHE WILL 
HOLD THE PIVOTAL VOTE ON THE ISSUE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the pivotal vote on the abortion 
issue, expressed deep skepticism Wednesday over a Minnesota law that requires 
that both parents of a pregnant minor be notified before she can have an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The law "just doesn't provide for any exceptions," O'Connor complained, even in 
cases where a father had abused his daughter or was long absent from the home. 
</P>
<P>
How could it be in "the best interest of the child," she asked, to force a 
teen-age girl to talk about an unwanted pregnancy with a parent whom she has 
not seen for years? 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota case was one of two teen-age abortion appeals argued before the 
court Wednesday in which the justices must balance the rights of a pregnant 
minor against the interests of her parents. Though the phrase "Roe vs. Wade" 
was notably absent during the two hours of argument, the Minnesota case 
nonetheless may yield an important ruling on the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the court in 1981, O'Connor has never voted to strike down a 
state abortion regulation. As a result, she has not had to say whether in fact 
she believes the Constitution gives women a right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she has pointedly refused to join her more conservative 
colleagues in voting to either overrule or seriously undercut the abortion 
right. Despite much speculation, her true views have remained a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
But if her comments Wednesday are any indicator, O'Connor is leaning toward 
deciding against the Minnesota restrictions. If she votes to strike down the 
law she must give her reasons, and thus may be forced to declare that Roe vs. 
Wade -- the 1973 ruling by the court that established a woman's right to have 
an abortion -- is still valid. 
</P>
<P>
The practical impact for teen-agers may be small. The justices, including 
O'Connor, seemed ready Wednesday to uphold an Ohio law that requires a pregnant 
minor to notify one parent, or to get permission from a judge, before obtaining 
an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have estimated that teen-age girls get nearly one-third of the 1.5 
million abortions performed nationwide each year. Thirty-one states have laws 
on the books requiring that a minor either notify or gain the consent of her 
parents before she gets an abortion. But in most cases the laws are not 
enforced. California law requires a parent's consent, but the state appellate 
court has blocked enforcement on grounds the law is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's law is the only one to require that both parents, even if separated 
or divorced, receive advance notification. A high court ruling striking down 
the Minnesota law while upholding the Ohio law could have the effect of 
clearing the way for enforcement of the laws in many other states. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, an O'Connor opinion nullifying the Minnesota regulation based on 
Roe vs. Wade could mark a key legal victory for abortion-rights advocates. A 
statement from her reaffirming the basic right to choose an abortion would send 
a clear message to lawyers and judges around the nation that Roe is still the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever she decides, the answer probably will not be known for months. On 
Friday, the justices will meet behind closed-doors and cast their votes in both 
cases. If Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a conservative and a critic of 
the Roe ruling, can gain four other votes, he will decide who drafts the 
majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
If Justice William J. Brennan Jr., the senior liberal, can get four votes to 
strike down the state laws, he will be in charge of writing the opinions. If 
O'Connor follows her recent pattern, however, she may stand alone and set forth 
her own views in a separate opinion. 
</P>
<P>
In the Webster case, for example, O'Connor joined with Rehnquist only in voting 
to uphold the Missouri law banning abortions in public hospitals. She refused 
to join his opinion undercutting the decision. As a result, the Webster case 
broke little new legal ground, even though it set off a political storm around 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The two cases heard Wednesday are the only abortion cases now before the high 
court. Last week, attorneys in Illinois withdrew their pending appeal after 
agreeing not to enforce strict abortion clinic regulations. Abortion-rights 
lawyers were delighted because the high court, by siding with the state, could 
have made it difficult for private abortion clinics to gain licenses. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's argument, O'Connor wasted no time in confronting the 
Minnesota lawyer defending the 1981 parental notification statute. 
</P>
<P>
John R. Tunheim, the state's chief deputy attorney general, said that all 
parents, even those who are separated or divorced, can "be very helpful to 
minors in a time of trauma." About 50% of the state's teen-agers live at home 
with both of their biological parents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Put another way, 50% do not," O'Connor interjected. 
</P>
<P>
It "may be true in general," she told Tunheim, that both parents should be 
involved in a pregnant daughter's decision whether to get an abortion, "but 
there might be some circumstances where it would not be in the best interest of 
the minor to tell both parents of her problem." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Benshoof, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the 
two-parent notification rule is "out of step with the reality of family life." 
Because of an earlier court order, the teen-agers were given the option of 
asking a judge, instead of their parents, to allow the abortion, but the 
Minnesota attorneys are seeking to have the notification requirement applied to 
all minors seeking abortion. The only exception would involve incest. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1986 trial, U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop ruled the law 
unconstitutional, but a federal appeals court reversed him last year (Hodgson 
vs. Minnesota, 88-1125). 
</P>
<P>
In the other case, another federal appeals court had struck down a less 
stringent Ohio law. It required that a pregnant girl either notify one parent 
or ask a judge for permission to get an abortion. The appeals court said that 
the law makes it too difficult for the teen-ager to win the judge's consent and 
the state appealed (Ohio vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 88-805).

MX MISSILES TO BE PLACED ON TRAINS, KEPT IN 6 STATES

The Air Force announced Wednesday that 50 MX nuclear missiles will be removed 
from underground silos in Wyoming and placed on trains in six states -- 
Louisiana, Texas, Washington, North Dakota, Arkansas and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement represents the Bush Administration's commitment to push ahead 
with plans to modernize the nation's strategic nuclear missile force, even amid 
projections of Pentagon belt-tightening, heightened prospects for arms-control 
agreements and sweeping changes in the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 missiles -- dubbed the "Peacekeeper" by former President Ronald Reagan 
-- will be placed on 25 trains, each with two MX missiles aboard. The trains 
will be kept on six Air Force bases and moved onto civilian railroad tracks in 
time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has struggled, as the Reagan Administration did, to 
develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear missile to America's arsenal. The 
idea is to make it difficult for the Soviet Union to target U.S. forces and 
thus deter the Soviets from even considering a first-strike attack. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, President Bush opted to move forward with two mobile 
intercontinental ballistic missile systems by putting the 10-warhead MX on 
trains while also building the smaller, truck-based Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the trains will be housed at the following Air Force bases: 
Barksdale in Louisiana, Dyess in Texas, Fairchild in Washington, Grand Forks in 
North Dakota, Little Rock in Arkansas and Wurtsmith in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Ten bases had been under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force did not indicate how many of the missiles would be at any 
particular site.

<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh on Wednesday defended his drive to tighten up on the 
release of information to the press, saying that the Justice Department "leaked 
like a sieve when I got here" and must be forced to speak with "one voice" on 
policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual exchange with reporters, an obviously irritated Thornburgh 
brushed aside complaints that his press restrictions have cut the flow of basic 
public information about department actions, not just leaks about criminal 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"We try as best as we can, consistent with the peculiar responsibilities of 
this department . . . that make us much less forthcoming, much less glib (than 
other Cabinet agencies) about making characterizations, assertions about 
breaking news," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that under his orders, David Runkel, his chief spokesman, has been 
drawing up new "media guidelines," which all of the department units, including 
the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and Marshals Service, will be required to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that his concern over leaks led him to order a department-wide 
review of information policy, which he expects to reduce leaks of pending 
criminal investigations and bring officials in line with his "admonition that 
we speak with one voice on policy matters." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh and Runkel defended the department's new emphasis on already 
existing rules channeling department information through official spokesmen and 
discouraging discussions between investigating agents and line attorneys with 
reporters. In the past, these rules have often been widely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"On policy matters or respecting investigations, agents are not the proper 
people to be discussing those things," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
However, several hours after his spirited defense, Thornburgh ordered the U.S. 
Bureau of Prisons to withdraw stringent limits on press interviews with 
prisoners that it had proposed and which touched off his latest clash with the 
press over information policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal was submitted prematurely and without my personal review," 
Thornburgh said of the prison bureau's rules. They would have restricted press 
access to inmates and allowed wardens to ban reporters who fail to "verify any 
allegations" about federal prisons with "authorized" prison officials. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed limits "will be subject to further review before resubmission," 
Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel said that the new prison rules violated the "no surprises" rule, a 
reference to Thornburgh's order that he not learn of department actions first 
through press reports. 
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed at the briefing that the INS, under its new director Gene 
McNary, had issued rules Monday sharply limiting information that officials 
outside Washington can give to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Anything but the "most routine" information must be cleared with regional INS 
officials and matters "more significant" have to be cleared with the public 
affairs office in Washington, an INS spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh's discussion of the information limits came as he appeared for only 
the second time -- "my irregular unannounced visit," as he described it -- at 
the daily press briefing Runkel conducts. He came to call attention to a 30.6% 
increase in the department's budget for fiscal 1990, according to Runkel, but 
the discussion of press restrictions dominated the session. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated assertions that the new press policies had interfered with the 
dissemination of ordinary, not sensitive information, Thornburgh insisted that 
his concern was with disclosure of information from investigations still under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think somebody might be concerned about the rights of individuals who 
may or may not be charged as the result of an ongoing investigation," 
Thornburgh said. "These are the persons whose concerns we share as well." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he had ordered a number of leak investigations "in hopes that we 
can raise the deterrent factor so people will feel less free to compromise 
investigations and the rights of potential subjects of those investigations." 
</P>
<P>
"You may not like it," the attorney general told reporters, thrusting his open 
hands toward them in a blocking motion. "But to me it is a position not only 
defensible, but it would be indefensible otherwise. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh's orders on restricting information have touched off limits that go 
further than he has discussed. For example, an Oct. 13 memo from an official of 
the office of justice programs informed employees that "unauthorized 
communications with Congress or the news media, particularly those they 
themselves initiate, can place them in a precarious position." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia K. Howard, acting director of the office's unit on congressional and 
public affairs, also said in the memo that employees are required to keep 
records on all outside contacts "covering any official business of the agency."

Suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald pleaded innocent to 107 criminal 
counts filed against him by special tribal prosecutors. But his son, Peter 
(Rocky) MacDonald Jr., who also was to have been arraigned in tribal court in 
Window Rock, Ariz., failed to appear and a prosecutor said he will seek a bench 
warrant for his arrest. Judge Robert Yazzie of the tribe's Window Rock District 
Court released the elder MacDonald on his own recognizance. The charges against 
him include conspiracy, bribery, fraud, extortion and election-law violations.

A judge declared a mistrial in the racketeering case of three 1970s radicals, 
two days after they were cleared of charges of plotting to overthrow the 
government. U.S. District Judge William Young in Springfield, Mass., declared a 
mistrial after the jury was unable to decide whether the group's alleged 
bombing exploits constituted racketeering. Prosecutors claim that Raymond L. 
Levasseur, his wife, Patricia Gros Levasseur, and Richard C. Williams were part 
of a group that took responsibility for a string of bombings and bank robberies 
along the East Coast from 1976 to 1984. Young set a hearing Jan. 5 in Boston, 
when the government will decide whether to retry the racketeering charges.

President Bush signed a $305-billion defense authorization bill Wednesday but 
said he is concerned that Congress is meddling in his role as overseer of 
foreign policy and national security. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he was signing the bill into law "notwithstanding the reservations 
that I have with certain of its provisions," including congressional limits on 
deployment of military personnel overseas and efforts "to legislate foreign 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1990 authorization, which also covers military construction and 
defense-related projects at the Energy Department, gives broad spending 
authority for a variety of projects. 
</P>
<P>
One notable part of the law signed Wednesday reduces funding for research of 
the Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars."

KRAFT SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR SEXUAL MURDERS OF 16 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted serial killer Randy Steven Kraft was sentenced to death Wednesday for 
murdering 16 young men in a 12-year rampage of sexual violence in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 44, insisted he was innocent after Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Donald A. McCartin ordered him put to death in the gas chamber, but relatives 
of victims cried and hugged each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Burn in hell, Kraft!" shouted Darwin Hall, the father of a 22-year-old murder 
victim, as Kraft was led from court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone ever deserved the death penalty, he's got it coming," the judge 
said, recounting the grisly savagery of one slaying which included torture by 
cigarette lighter, castration and mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat here for a year and I didn't see any remorse, feelings or regret," 
McCartin said, calling the crimes "just hard for me to comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, who played with a pen, yawned, laughed and chatted with his lawyer 
during the proceeding, briefly addressed the court after sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not murdered anyone, and I believe a reasonable review of the record 
will show that," said Kraft, a Long Beach computer consultant. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin gave the death sentence for 11 of the murders and consecutive life 
prison terms for the other five. The judge said he did so to keep Kraft in 
custody in the event the death sentences were somehow overturned. 
</P>
<P>
A death sentence is automatically appealed to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was also sentenced to 10 years in prison for three counts of sodomy, four 
counts of mayhem and three counts of great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted Kraft last May 12 after a 10 1/2-month trial and recommended 
the death penalty in August. 
</P>
<P>
The murders Kraft was convicted of committing occurred between 1972 and 1983. 
Prosecutors said that Kraft picked up hitchhikers, gave them drugs and alcohol, 
sexually tortured or mutilated them and then strangled them. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Kraft may be the worst serial killer in the nation's history. 
They have accused him in court papers of 45 murders, including six in Oregon 
and two in Michigan. But they say his victims could number more than 65, based 
on a "death list" found in Kraft's car. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin told Kraft he had received letters from parents whose children were 
missing and wanted to know if there was some way the list could divulge their 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that he was addressing Kraft as an individual and not as a judge, 
McCartin said that if his death sentence appeals fail "you might give some 
thought in your waning moments to helping those people out."

In an attempt to avoid state intervention, eight San Joaquin Valley counties 
have agreed to form a valleywide agency to control air pollution. Fresno County 
Supervisor Judy Andreen announced the agreement at a hearing before the state 
Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Wildlife. The hearing was called to 
consider a proposal by state Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) to require 
formation of a single air pollution control district in the San Joaquin Valley. 
Andreen said the new valleywide agency would replace individual air pollution 
control districts in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, 
Stanislaus and Tulare counties. Andreen said the agency is expected to be 
approved by the member counties by the end of the year.

The Irvine Co. said it will consider moving its controversial Laguna Laurel 
residential project out of Laguna Canyon, marking a possible breakthrough in 
the long-running dispute over development in the environmentally sensitive 
canyon area. The company's new proposal, which calls for the Laguna Beach 
project to be relocated to the city of Irvine if a number of conditions are 
met, was greeted with optimism by some officials who have long sought to derail 
the 2,000-acre residential development. Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, a 
leading opponent, called the proposal a "breakthrough." "Even if this proposal 
itself doesn't work, it can be the basis for other alternatives or 
modifications."

No single cause has been found in the deaths of 400 white pelicans at Crowley 
Lake in Mono County, the state Department of Fish and Game said. The pelican 
deaths, which happened over a two-week period in mid-October, may have been the 
result of changing environmental conditions elsewhere in the West, the 
department said. Starvation was the apparent primary cause of death in half the 
birds examined, but many also suffered intestinal infestations of parasitic 
worms severe enough to kill them. And some of the carcasses taken from the 
eastern Sierra lake contained high levels of mercury in the livers believed to 
be caused by increased exposure to an accumulation in the environment.

Environmental activists and sympathetic politicians rallied to criticize a Los 
Angeles-based company's plans to cut down the world's largest remaining 
privately owned virgin redwood forest. Several dozen demonstrators gathered at 
the Westwood headquarters of Maxxam Corp., which was criticized for 
over-harvesting redwood forests to pay off debt incurred during its hostile 
1986 takeover of the Pacific Lumber Co. At issue is a Humboldt County redwood 
grove known as the Headwaters Forest. The Natural Resources Defense Council, 
Sierra Club, and Assemblymen Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles) and Byron D. Sher 
(D-Palo Alto) said Pacific Lumber Co. has accelerated plans to fell that stand 
and others to avoid restrictions proposed in an initiative they are trying to 
qualify for the November, 1990, ballot. The initiative, called the California 
Environmental Protection Act of 1990, will be the subject of a 
petition-gathering drive starting next week.

ARCHEOLOGY: AS NEW RESIDENTS FLOOD INTO THE ANTELOPE VALLEY, ROGER ROBINSON 
RACES AGAINST TIME TO UNCOVER ARTIFACTS OF THE DESERT AREA'S ANCIENT 
CIVILIZATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty miles west of Lancaster, where the Antelope Valley desert floor slowly 
ascends into the foothills before rising into full-fledged mountains, 
archeologist Roger Robinson spots a 4-inch-high red splotch on the side of a 
nearby rock. 
</P>
<P>
Scurrying down a gully and up the other side to take a better look, Robinson 
finds it is not a random blob but a crude figure of a man, a pictograph that he 
conservatively estimates someone drew with red oxide about 3,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 47, one of only a few archeologists specializing in the Antelope 
Valley, is running out of time, the very thing such artifacts are so rich in. 
The Antelope Valley is enjoying unprecedented population growth, and the 
archeologically significant sites that remain -- no one knows how many have yet 
to be uncovered -- could be lost to development. 
</P>
<P>
During the last 40 years, archeologists have uncovered about 270 such sites in 
the area, ranging from spots as small as an arrowhead to the giant Fairmont 
Buttes project that is half a mile wide by 2 1/2 miles long, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and the students in his field course at Antelope Valley College 
regularly work Fairmont Buttes, which is perhaps 10 years away from being 
engulfed by suburban sprawl, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The student archeologists have uncovered and studied part of a Kawaiisu Indian 
milling area, a large flat rock with numerous soda bottle-size depressions 
where Indians ground acorns with stones to make mash 500 years ago. Indians -- 
Kawaiisus, Vanyumes and other tribes -- flourished in the Antelope Valley from 
prehistoric times until the 1600s, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you stop to consider the juxtaposition of civilization here in the valley 
and then examine the material remains of cultures which have visited this site 
for the last 3,000 or 4,000 years, it's quite humbling," said student Dave 
Burrell, 34. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, just over 16,000 people inhabited the entire Antelope Valley. By 1989, 
thanks mainly to available -- and affordable -- new housing, the number of 
residents soared past 224,000 with little sign of slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural conflict," said Robinson, who has taught archeology and 
anthropology at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster since 1967. "Developers 
are mainly interested in building their houses and making their money. So we 
have to work at making it work." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires that building sites be 
examined for archeological finds. If such sites are found, an archeologist will 
explore them and suggest options to the developer. 
</P>
<P>
The first option is to scrap the building project and leave the site alone, 
something Robinson said is impractical unless it is a large site considered 
important because of human burials or religious significance. Not one site in 
the Antelope Valley has fit into this category in the 23 years he has been 
exploring the desert, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the building site is excavated and its artifacts collected for 
examination elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who picks up about two dozen such jobs a year from developers, says 
he usually doesn't find anything of archeological significance at such building 
sites. He said there isn't much in the Antelope Valley that would hold up a 
developer's plans, except at Fairmont Buttes -- and he is negotiating with the 
landowners to try to preserve that site. 
</P>
<P>
"If the site is a large village where an awful lot of old food processing such 
as grinding or milling has gone on and there have been campfires for hundreds 
of years, you may find a soil color change or vegetation change -- something 
obvious," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if the site is just a little overnight camp where a bunch of guys stopped 
one day and whittled arrowheads, the only indication you might have might be 
some chips of stone on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Because they are easily preserved, the most common artifacts he and his 
students find in the Antelope Valley are tools made of stone. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indians were essentially Stone Age people in technology," he said, "so we 
find a number of different kinds of artifacts made of that material, including 
projectile points, arrowheads, knives, scrapers, awls, any kind of cutting, 
scraping, hacking, whacking tools as well as stone bowls and grinding slabs. 
</P>
<P>
"Records indicate they were a variety of fairly small, loosely organized bands 
of hunters and gatherers that spoke Shoshone Indian dialects. Probably no more 
than 300 to 400 people." Robinson said the pinnacle of Indian dominance in the 
region was in about the year 1600 with a variety of base camps, temporary 
hunting camps and work sites scattered through the valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Excavations in large village areas show us an increase in complexity over many 
hundreds of years, an increase in population and an increase in wealth. This 
wealth is measured largely in terms of shell beads that were used as money in 
one sense, and also as symbols of wealth and success." 
</P>
<P>
That success apparently came through an extensive network of trade and 
commercial relationships that extended to the coast, the San Joaquin Valley, 
the Los Angeles basin, the Colorado River and Mexico. Materials such as salt, 
soapstone, deer hides and asphalt moved along these lines with the Antelope 
Valley being the hub of a large trade network among the various groups of 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
In 1772, the Spanish soldier Pedro Fages, a commander under Portola, and his 
men were the first non-Indians to set foot in the area. They didn't come to 
explore but to intercept deserting soldiers attempting to get back to Mexico. 
They did not find any deserters. 
</P>
<P>
When the Mexican link collapsed because of the Spanish presence, archeologists 
and historians theorize, the trading system -- and the Indians -- began a slow 
decline that culminated in the eradication of the last remnants of the Indian 
civilization by the mid- to late-1880s. This theory is confirmed by records of 
settlers who found Indian wickiups held together with barbed wire stripped from 
nearby fences. Descendants of the local Indians can be found today living in 
the Tehachapi Mountains north of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Vandalism is another continuing problem faced by archeologists in the Antelope 
Valley. Each of the 12 major Indian campsites in the area has been heavily 
vandalized. Most often, the artifacts are dug up and indiscriminately strewn 
about, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was excavating a site with my field class and when we came out one weekend, 
it had been vandalized," he said. He believes artifact hunters looking for 
something to sell are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"In another case, I was at a swap meet and there was a guy who had all kinds of 
artifacts and antiquities. That made me angry, but then I saw human bones, 
which is as against the law as you can get. I called the police." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the half-dozen Antelope Valley archeologists, Richard Norwood, 46, a 
civilian employed at Edwards Air Force Base to classify and study archeological 
sites on federal land, finds regular evidence of vandalism as well, although 
the 301,000 acres of federal government property is posted and fenced. 
</P>
<P>
"People sneak on the base to try and uncover sites," Norwood said. "Bottle 
hunters have gone through a lot of the homesteads, as have people with metal 
detectors." (As Edwards expanded over the years, it has swallowed up homesteads 
of former ranchers.) 
</P>
<P>
"When they loot a site, they essentially make it look like an area that has 
been bombed. You can never replace an archeological site. Once it's gone, it's 
gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood considers the base a rich source of archeological sites -- more than 
1,000 have been identified -- partially because it is a government compound but 
primarily because the base encompasses the dry lakes that are best known for 
space shuttle landings. Thousands of years ago, he said, the lakes were fed by 
running springs and visited regularly by various Indian groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found long-term base camps where people would spend a large portion of 
the year as well as permanent prehistoric settlements that go back 6,000 
years," said Norwood, "making them ancestors of the Indians that roamed the 
Antelope Valley." He has also found food processing areas and hunting camps. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood's best artifact finds -- projectile points, stone tools and an 
occasional stone pot -- are similar to those at Fairmont Buttes. 
</P>
<P>
"They were people very much like us," he says. "There hasn't really been a 
great deal of human evolution in this short length of time. In terms of 
evolution, this is just a drop in the bucket."

Nordstrom (the department store) and Jerry Berns (the real estate broker and 
new-home manager at Mike Glickman Realty) both wait until after Thanksgiving to 
put up their holiday decorations. What a novel idea. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly nine years, Berns has been creating traffic-stopping displays at his 
Sherman Oaks home to celebrate holidays and other special occasions throughout 
the year. Part of their appeal is their enormity. An 11-foot-tall scarecrow 
that acknowledged Thanksgiving will be replaced tomorrow by an equally tall 
snowman perched on an island of snow, along with a huge Star of David. The 
displays cost about $1,000 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of mail, or people ring the bell to say how much they appreciate 
it," Berns says. "I have four garages on my property where I store some of the 
pieces, and I also have more storage off-site. We're always adding to the 
collection because we're always coming up with new ideas."

that and then carve it," he explains. "The snowman took about 50 or 60 hours to

Power of Posters 
</P>
<P>
The signs have been popping up at random around the Los Angeles area, slowly 
working their way into your subconscious, until one day you finally ask 
yourself "Hey, what does this 'Cast of Thousands' mean? Is it a theatrical 
gang? An ad for the Screen Extras Guild? Or an existentialist's attempt at 
humor?" 
</P>
<P>
No, no and no. Cast of Thousands is a band that plays original music on the 
order of Simple Minds, U2, Tears for Fears and Duran Duran. "MTV calls it 
post-modern music," explains band member and keyboard player Sam Mollo. They've 
been together in their current configuration for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
When Cast of Thousands is not playing a gig, such as at the FM Station 
nightclub in North Hollywood, they are busy gluing posters and flyers in 
visible locations, such as freeway underpasses and overpasses, and telephone 
poles. "We've probably put up about 1,500 all over L.A. in the last two months, 
including Sherman Oaks, Encino, North Hollywood and Burbank," Mollo says. 
</P>
<P>
What inspired them to be seen and not heard? "Before Madonna toured, she had 
posters of just her eyes with 'Who's that girl?' written on it. That's what 
we're trying to do. We want to try and get our name around. L.A. is basically a 
heavy metal town so it's hard to stand out," Mollo says. "We'll continue to do 
it for as long as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
While the public may be slowly catching on, some store owners in the Valley 
have already had enough of them. "Those flyers are all over my building," says 
Dave Montez, manager of Tower Records in Sherman Oaks. "It's like street gangs 
who spray their logos. They pasted them on our trash can in such a way that 
it's almost impossible to get them off." 
</P>
<P>
If they're not careful, the band may raise the wrath of thousands. 
</P>

Selling Smell to Men 
</P>
<P>
Men are no longer turning up their noses at the idea of wearing a fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a major season for launching men's fragrances," says Jim Rudd, group 
vice president for Macy's South/Bullock's. Among the fall launches were 
Christian Dior's Fahrenheit, Elizabeth Taylor's Passion for Men, Jaguar, 
Claiborne and Eternity for Men. 
</P>
<P>
Rudd says that men are beginning to stock more than one brand of fragrance, 
just as women may have a daytime and an evening perfume. 
</P>
<P>
Fragrance companies are employing the usual sales gimmicks -- such as free gift 
with purchase -- for male customers. Kimberly Kassner, assistant manager of 
cosmetics for Saks Fifth Avenue in Woodland Hills, says: "Women love all the 
little gifts -- they'll stand in line for them. But if men like a fragrance, 
they'll buy it whether it comes with a free gift or not." 
</P>

Latest Getty Purchase 
</P>
<P>
Drivers making their way in and out of the San Fernando Valley via the San 
Diego Freeway may have noticed a change of names on two of the exits through 
the Sepulveda Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling north, the Chalon Road exit has been renamed Getty Center Drive. And 
traveling south, the Moraga Street exit has been renamed Getty Center Drive. In 
reality, both exits land you on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago, the Getty Foundation interested the city of L.A. in 
changing the exit names. Chalon Road was just an underpass of the freeway. The 
road actually led to nowhere on either side of it. The plan is to extend what 
was the old Chalon Road west up to the new Getty Museum in Brentwood," says Tom 
Kilday, district sign coordinator for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kilday, Caltrans will not change an exit sign without a resolution 
by a local agency, which in this case happened to be the city of Los Angeles. 
The city agreed to the change, and Caltrans agreed to do the work, as long as 
the Getty Foundation paid for it. The cost of changing the signs amounted to 
$15,555 -- a paltry sum for the Getty -- and the new signs were erected in 
mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
"The new exit names are almost like an advertising type of ploy," Kilday says. 
"But to get there, you'll have to get off at Getty Center Drive, and in both 
cases you head south and then cross under the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean it's time to buy a new Thomas Guide? 
</P>

KOREATOWN BRIGADE PAINTS OWN SLOGANS IN ANTI-DRUG EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying their complaints about an "eyesore" apartment house have been ignored, 
residents of a Koreatown neighborhood have taken to painting graffiti on the 
property to draw attention to their plight. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to do it, but it was kind of a last resort," said a neighbor, 
who did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The abandoned apartment house at 553 S. St. Andrews Place, known as The Towers, 
has become so notorious for drug dealing and prostitution, neighbors said, that 
some of them have dubbed it "the apartment building from hell." 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, the neighbors thought the problem was solved. After 
complaining to police and city officials about illicit activities there, a 
fence was erected around the building. The fence, however, was crushed last 
month in a Los Angeles Police Department raid, and now, said one neighbor, 
"we've got the same situation we had before. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to a point where all the complaining in the world doesn't seem to do 
any good," said Steve Callis, who lives next door to the building. 
</P>
<P>
And so, with brushes and paint, several of the neighbors last week executed a 
sneak attack, painting protest slogans such as "Same Drugs, New Location" and 
"Do What You Gotta Do LAPD" on the front of the ornate, 70-year-old building. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't something that any of us would have ever thought we would have 
engaged in," said a member of the graffiti brigade who insisted upon anonymity, 
"but sometimes extreme circumstances call for extreme measures." 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the department was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
"The claim that we're somehow responsible for transients coming back in there 
is something new to me," said Sgt. Ron Batesole, who heads community relations 
for LAPD's Wilshire Division. "If, indeed, we're responsible for the damage 
they say, then we're not averse to sitting down face to face with the people 
who are complaining and discussing it." 
</P>
<P>
Batesole added that officers have made numerous arrests for drug offenses and 
prostitution at the property in response to complaints by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said the situation has gone from bad to worse since a new owner 
bought the building in February and began getting rid of the remaining tenants 
with the aim of developing the property. 
</P>
<P>
Since the last tenants moved out three months ago, neighbors said, the building 
has been overtaken by transients, including drug dealers, who have continued to 
live there without water or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"They come out to the street at night and put their stuff (drugs) under the 
bushes, and sell to people driving through," said Josephine Torino, 73, who has 
lived in the neighborhood for 40 years. "It all happens around that building." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Building and Safety in August ordered the owner, real estate 
broker Jeng Chi-Li, to erect the fence to keep transients away from the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
But residents say the calm did not last long. 
</P>
<P>
"There may have been a few nights you could call normal," Callis said. "A few 
transients continued to slip in, and we kept complaining, until the police came 
and raided the place." 
</P>
<P>
He and others said that officers arrested four people at the property in 
October, and that in the process of entering the grounds, trampled the fence in 
two places, making it easy for trespassers to climb through. 
</P>
<P>
"They talk about a drug war, and this is an instance where we feel like the 
victims," Callis said. "After the raid, the word spread quickly that The Towers 
was available again as a free place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
As an attention-grabber, the graffiti appears to have accomplished its aim. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Department of Building and Safety officials ordered the owner to 
secure the fence, and building inspector Mike Lee said officials will seek the 
owner's permission to have city workers paint over the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
For some neighbors, the graffiti removal can't happen soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Would-be renters take one look at that mess on the building and just keep 
going," said Jean Fisher, who manages some apartments across the street. 
"Nobody wants to live in a neighborhood where there's graffiti."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMUNITY COLLEGE STAFF, TEACHERS TO GET 
RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community College District on Wednesday approved pay raises of 
8% for its teachers and from 8% to 12% for clerical, maintenance and other 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The increases will be retroactive to the start of the school year. They will 
boost the pay of full-time faculty members to between $25,231 and $50,058, 
depending on experience, education and position, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Trustees President Lindsay Conner said he was delighted that the 
agreements were reached without a strike. But trustee Hal Garvin, the lone vote 
against the raises, warned that the nine-college system could soon face a 
debilitating budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"It pains me very much to vote against faculty pay raises because they are not 
overpaid. But I thought 6% would be stretching it as much as possible," Garvin 
said. Conner said cutbacks in administrative costs would help finance the 
agreements.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators say they have one confession too 
many in the theft of a 17th-Century Dutch painting recovered at the apartment 
of two Lancaster men. 
</P>
<P>
Jereld Sharitz, 23, an art student at Antelope Valley College, where the 
painting was stolen Nov. 6, and Timothy Cain, a 27-year-old grocery clerk, were 
arrested Tuesday on suspicion of grand theft. Both confessed to taking the 
painting, "Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a Landscape," by Gerard Hoet, Detective 
J. Siebert said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They're probably trying to protect each other," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DELAYS TRIAL ON REDISTRICTING LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a possible settlement in the offing, a federal judge Wednesday 
indefinitely put off the start of a trial on a lawsuit accusing Los Angeles 
County supervisors of drawing their districts in such a way as to preclude the 
election of a Latino to the county board. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon delayed the trial after a private meeting 
with attorneys in the case. The move follows Tuesday's vote by supervisors to 
consider a settlement of the suit filed by the U.S. Justice Department and two 
civil rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
None of the parties would comment on the possible settlement, which reportedly 
calls for consolidating portions of Supervisors Ed Edelman and Pete Schabarum's 
districts to create a predominantly Latino district east and southeast of 
downtown Los Angeles.

36 ARRESTED IN L.A. PROTEST OVER EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-six people were arrested Wednesday at the Federal Building in downtown 
Los Angeles while protesting U.S. support for the government of El Salvador, 
the second such demonstration and mass arrest there in a week. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the Rev. Jesse Jackson offered his support to local opponents of 
the Salvadoran government, who said they received death threats this week. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at the Central American Refugee Center and priests at La Placita Church 
said the threatening letters, which arrived Monday, were signed by a group 
calling itself "The Catholic Anti-Communist Movement." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks, Los Angeles-area opponents of the Salvadoran 
government have held more than a dozen marches, sit-ins and candlelight vigils 
to protest the assassination of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador and 
continuing political violence in the Central American country. 
</P>
<P>
Written in scrawled handwriting on notebook paper, one of the the letters 
declares in Spanish: "All of you will die because you are part of the 
(guerrillas). Just like they are destroying El Salvador, you will be 
destroyed!" 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday at La Placita Church, Jackson linked the 
violence in El Salvador to the Los Angeles death threats, which named Father 
Luis Olivares and other clergymen at La Placita as potential victims. "Today, 
priests are being killed in El Salvador and threatened in Los Angeles," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also reiterated his calls for an end to U.S. military aid to the 
Salvadoran government of Alfredo Cristiani and for negotiations between the 
government and the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
"We have blood on our hands," Jackson said. "The American people do not know 
that it is on the basis of our military aid that death squads kill people" in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The Cristiani government, which is supported by the Bush Administration, has 
denied that its armed forces killed the Jesuit priests. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council members Michael Woo and Richard Alatorre were among 
half a dozen civic and religious leaders who attended the afternoon press 
conference. Some of the religious leaders, including the Rev. James Lawson of 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, were arrested earlier in the day 
during the protest at the Federal Building on Los Angeles Street. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators first gathered at the west entrance of the building, which they 
blocked in last week's protest, but found the area taped off by officers of the 
Federal Protective Service. The group then moved to the building's south 
entrance on Temple Street, where some protesters chained themselves to the 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested, including actor Martin Sheen, were cited for trespassing and 
released, according to Mary Filippini, a spokeswoman for the Federal Protective 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Sheen was among 64 who were arrested in last week's protest. 
</P>
<P>
Two more protests are planned for the coming week, at the Federal Building in 
Westwood and at the Salvadoran Consulate in the Westlake area, said Mary Brent 
Wehrli of the Southern California Interfaith Taskforce on Central America, 
which helped organize Wednesday's demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares said his church will continue to support such protests despite the 
latest threatening letters. He and other activists in Los Angeles first 
reported receiving death threats in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Steve Spear of the Los Angeles Police Department's criminal 
conspiracy section said several individuals, all Salvadoran residents of Los 
Angeles, have been "looked at and scrutinized" in the investigation of the 
earlier and recent threats, but that no charges have ever been filed and no 
arrests are imminent.

A COP'S BEST FRIEND DIES IN LINE OF DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hawthorne Police Officer Dave Harris wept over the death of his partner 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is a dog handler in one of Hawthorne's four canine units, and his German 
shepherd Urko was run over by a car driven by a robbery suspect fleeing police 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The car, traveling about 60 m.p.h., struck the dog at the intersection of 130th 
Street and Hawthorne Boulevard, went out of control and crashed, authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dog's back was broken and he died a short time later at Coast Animal 
Hospital in Hermosa Beach, police said. The suspect was not seriously injured 
and was arrested at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also was uninjured, but distraught. 
</P>
<P>
"He was much more than just a pet," Harris said Wednesday. "He's your partner, 
he's a friend, and you couldn't ask for anything more." 
</P>
<P>
Urko's death in the line of duty came on the same day the department held a 
memorial service for another one of its dogs, which died recently of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In the ceremony on the front lawn of the police station on 126th Street, about 
100 mourners gathered to honor Iox, who had been with the department for more 
than seven years and had been retired in September because of his illness. 
About 20 canine handlers from police departments as far away as San Bernardino, 
along with their four-legged partners, lined the street that had been blocked 
off to traffic. Iox's handler, Officer Chet Wojciechowski, delivered a simple 
eulogy for a dog that understood only commands uttered in German. 
</P>
<P>
A similar ceremony is planned for Urko next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave . . . needs lots of support right now," Sgt. Rick Shindle, head of the 
Hawthorne canine unit, said of Harris. "That's what's nice about canine 
handlers from the other cities being here. They support each other. They know 
what it's like to lose a partner like that." 
</P>
<P>
Officers say the use of dogs in many departments has added a new element of 
camaraderie to a job in which officers must have confidence in the strength and 
ability of a partner. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 33, a nine-year veteran of the department, said Urko died trying to 
protect him. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that took the dog's life began in Lakewood, when a 20-year-old 
suspect allegedly stole a car from a motorist at a gas station at gunpoint. The 
suspect led police on a chase through several cities. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and Urko, responding to a call for backup units, went to 130th Street 
and Hawthorne Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and another guy and our partners blocked the streets with our cars," Harris 
said. "I saw the suspect coming at us real fast, and I saw that he wasn't going 
to stop. So I went back to my car to get my dog out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
When he opened his car door, Urko leaped out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was all keyed up," Harris said. "He jumped out of the car looking for a bad 
guy, and when he realized there was no bad guy out there, he turned around to 
come back to me. And that's when he got hit." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said he was about 10 feet away from Urko when he was struck.

"I ran over to my dog, and he just kind of looked up at me," Harris said, his 
voice breaking. "I went and got a blanket . . . and one of my partners took us 
to a 24-hour emergency clinic.

<P>
"On the way there, he just kind of picked up his head and looked at me like he

In the meantime, the police chase continued for another 10 blocks before the 
suspect lost control of the vehicle and it overturned, colliding with another

Richard Garcia was booked on suspicion of robbery and causing injury or death

TRW TO DONATE $1 MILLION FOR MATH, SCIENCE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about a projected serious shortfall of well-educated workers by the 
year 2000, TRW Inc., the Redondo Beach-based producer of aerospace and 
automotive products and information systems, announced Wednesday that it will 
donate $1 million over the next 10 years to help establish a special math and 
science high school on the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus. 
</P>
<P>
Called the California Academy of Mathematics and Science, the comprehensive 
high school is a joint project of the California State University system and 
the Long Beach and Compton school districts. Scheduled to open in the fall of 
1990, it will draw students from throughout the Los Angeles Basin, 
concentrating in particular on women and minorities. Teachers will be recruited 
from local school districts, universities and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State officials said the school will be the first of its kind in the state, 
offering accelerated math and science courses as part of a comprehensive high 
school curriculum that could enable students to enroll as college sophomores 
upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to make an investment in my company's future," Edsel D. Dunford, 
executive vice president and general manager of TRW's space and defense sector, 
said at a news conference at the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
The high school's basic funding will come from the state, which finances 
kindergarten- through-12th-grade education on a per-pupil basis. TRW will 
provide $100,000 a year over the next decade, and academy officials said they 
are counting on receiving similar donations from other local aerospace, 
engineering and computer firms to help offset the higher costs of running a 
specialized school. 
</P>
<P>
Academy Principal Kathy Clark said the four-year high school will offer 
educational experiences that are difficult to obtain at regular high schools, 
including opportunities to collaborate on research projects with university 
faculty and work-study relationships with "mentors" in private industry. All 
students will study biology, chemistry and earth sciences each year, another 
departure from the typical high school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
The academy initially will recruit from 60 schools in the Torrance, Inglewood, 
Lawndale, Los Angeles, Compton and Long Beach school districts. Clark said the 
school will aim for a student body that is 60% to 70% black and Latino. It will 
open with 100 ninth-graders and have a total enrollment of 500 by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation -- which has been a problem for the Los Angeles County High 
School for the Arts, the only other countywide specialized high school -- will 
be provided to the academy, she added. Students must arrange their own 
transportation to the arts school, located on the Cal State Los Angeles campus. 
</P>
<P>
The math and science academy had been controversial because of the Compton 
school district's fears that it would drain away its best students. But academy 
officials agreed to draw no more than two students from each school except with 
the school district's approval and to recruit students who may lack good grades 
but who show potential. 
</P>
<P>
California State University Chancellor Ann Reynolds said American students lag 
behind their counterparts in most other industrialized nations in math and 
science ability and that the record is particularly dismal among women and 
minorities. Last year, for instance, the nation's colleges and universities 
produced only one black and three Latino Ph.D. holders in math, Reynolds said. 
By the year 2000, the nation faces a shortage of 500,000 math and science 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that junior high school is where most students lose interest in the 
subjects, Reynolds said, "We're very eager to correct the lost momentum in 
science and math education in this country."

SPEEDERS READ AND WEEP IN TEST OF RADAR DEVICE ON BUSY GRIFFITH PARK BLVD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Los Angeles residents who like to drive fast: Watch for the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Those big-screen radar devices that have been popping up in suburban 
communities to inform drivers of their excessive speed made their Los Angeles 
debut Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Griffith Park Boulevard, a busy strip of roadway referred to by irate 
neighbors as the "Silver Lake Freeway," City Councilman Michael Woo and Los 
Angeles traffic officers tested one of the new "speed controllers" as skeptical 
neighbors looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Basically a big speedometer, the device is designed to discourage speeding by 
posting radar readings of how fast cars are going as they approach the device. 
</P>
<P>
Speeds will flash on a screen in 12-inch, bright yellow digits for motorists 
and the world to see. Occasionally, traffic officers will be there too, Woo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of citations issued has increased in the San Gabriel and San 
Fernando valleys, where the device has been in use since September, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living near Griffith Park Boulevard and Scotland Street -- where the 
$1,800 device clocked speeds -- voiced doubts Wednesday about whether it would 
solve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
When a traffic signal was removed from the intersection almost 20 years ago, 
more than a mile of uncontrolled roadway on Griffith Park Boulevard was left 
open to shortcutting motorists on their way to the nearby Golden State Freeway 
or downtown by way of surface streets, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Deacon, 77, who has lived on Scotland Street more than 30 years, 
complained that, because of rushing traffic, residents no longer can get safely 
in and out of driveways and side streets along Griffith Park Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Deacon said that when neighbors requested that the signal be reinstalled, she 
was told by city officials that the amount of cross traffic at the corner 
"didn't warrant a signal." 
</P>
<P>
"The point of having signals and stop signs and officers is to keep the traffic 
moving. No one cares about us. During rush hour, we wait 10 minutes for a 
chance to drive across the street or get out of a driveway." 
</P>
<P>
The new device may decrease the general traffic speed, she said, but it will 
not break up the rapid flow of cars the way traffic signals would. 
</P>
<P>
During the evening rush hour, between 5 and 6 p.m., about 1,000 cars pass 
through the intersection, said Zaki Mustafa, an engineer assistant for the 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who lives a half-mile from the roadway, said his office eventually will 
buy a "traffic controller" device to be permanently posted at the intersection. 
Woo added that he is encouraging the city to purchase devices for each of the 
15 council districts. 
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour trial Wednesday, five motorists were ticketed for speeding, 
Central Traffic Division Sgt. Ronald Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were citing them, they asked what was going on," said Officer Mike 
Widder. "Because of everyone who gathered around, the people who sped by said 
they couldn't see their speeds on the computer sign."

MCENROE A WINNER IN RETURN TO MASTERS; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: THREE-TIME FORMER CHAMPION DEFEATS AARON KRICKSTEIN IN THREE SETS IN 
FIRST APPEARANCE SINCE 1986.

<P>
Showing flashes of his brilliance of yesteryear, John McEnroe returned 
victorious to Madison Square Garden and the Masters tennis tournament Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander at times showed perfect recall of his glorious past, complete 
with temper tantrums, as he defeated Aaron Krickstein 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 in the 
round-robin portion of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, defending champion Boris Becker faced Andre Agassi and Stefan 
Edberg played Brad Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
But it was McEnroe's stage, and he put on a starring performance, hitting 
seemingly impossible volleys, delicate drop shots and precision groundstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the demons that have accompanied his brilliance throughout his career also 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
After Krickstein jumped out to a 2-0 lead to begin the match, McEnroe suddenly 
looked like the man who won this season-ending tournament three times, the last 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He won 14 of the next 15 points, including love games in the fourth and fifth 
games. He held a love-30 lead on Krickstein's serve when he went to the net, 
punched a loose forehand volley wide, then yelled, "Is that phone going to ring 
all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe complained about a noise that no one else, completely engrossed in the 
action on the court, remembered hearing. 
</P>
<P>
He lost the next point when he sailed a forehand long, then turned and talked 
to the crowd at his end of the court. The next point was won by Krickstein when 
McEnroe netted a backhand volley. 
</P>
<P>
Although McEnroe captured the next point to pull to deuce, the spell of 
terrific tennis had been snapped, his concentration gone. Krickstein held 
serve, broke McEnroe at 30, then held at 15 to grab a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe staved off a set point to hold in the ninth game and broke Krickstein 
in the 10th. But Krickstein broke right back in the 11th game, then held to 
grab the first set. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, McEnroe continued his game-long dispute with the officials 
over line calls, and included himself in his vocal outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, John," he pleaded after hitting a simple forehand volley into the 
net. "All right. Beautiful," he screamed when his third double-fault of the 
match slammed into the net. 
</P>
<P>
After the fourth game, which ended on Krickstein's seventh ace of the night -- 
a serve McEnroe thought was out -- McEnroe grabbed a ball and angrily slammed 
it to the other end of the court, earning a Code of Conduct warning from the 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
Though whining over the many calls he felt the officials missed, McEnroe lifted 
his level of play and won 10 of the last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
It was McEnroe's first Masters appearance since 1986, when he suffered a 
first-round loss to Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
The round-robin continues Thursday when Ivan Lendl plays Krickstein, McEnroe 
meets Michael Chang and Agassi takes on Gilbert. On Friday, Edberg plays 
Becker, Lendl plays McEnroe and Chang plays Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
Each player receives $15,000 for qualifying and $30,000 for each round-robin 
victory. The winning semifinalists collect $60,000 each and the champion an 
additional $150,000. A player who wins the title undefeated would pocket 
$315,000.

A full share for the World Series champion Oakland Athletics was worth a record 
$114,252.11, and a share for the losing San Francisco Giants was worth 
$83,529.26, the commissioner's office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The players' pool from the playoffs was $12,110,808.77, up from the previous 
record of $11,969,881 set last year. The players' pool comes from the first 
four games of the playoffs and the first four games of the World Series.

OWNERS TALK TOUGH, THEN ACT DIFFERENTLY

It doesn't jibe. It doesn't figure. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's owners have created a state of confusion and contradiction again. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, their new negotiating team is opening collective bargaining 
talks with a proposal that would restrict free agency, eliminate arbitration 
and impose a modified salary cap. That's a dramatic cutback in player rights, 
an unwinding of the clock that may be supported by a spring lockout, a measure 
of the owners' commitment to it. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there they are again, going bananas in the marketplace, 
treating free agency as they did in the late 1970s and early '80s, when it was 
their new toy. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking here about Rickey Henderson or Kirby Puckett or Robin Yount. 
Three-million dollars a year for a legitimate superstar can be chalked up, in 
some shocking measure, to normal escalation. 
</P>
<P>
Three-million for Mark Langston or Mark Davis can help put a pitching staff in 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking here about: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The St. Louis Cardinals giving $6 million for three years to Bryn Smith, 
who won 10 games last year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Boston Red Sox giving $6.4 million for three years to Tony Pena, who 
drove in 37 runs last year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New York Yankees giving $5.7 million to Pascual Perez, who won nine 
games last year, has had problems with drugs and sometimes can't even remember 
how to get to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Insanity? 
</P>
<P>
How about the Pittsburgh Pirates giving Walt Terrell $3.6 million for three 
years, even though he was 18-34 in the last two seasons? 
</P>
<P>
Or the Texas Rangers giving Gary Pettis $2.66 million for three years, even 
though he drove in only 18 runs last year, one with his annual home run? 
</P>
<P>
There's more, but the trend is clear, and the questions beg to be asked. 
</P>
<P>
Where's the restraint? 
</P>
<P>
Where's the cutback that the owners seem to deem so necessary as reflected by 
their collective bargaining proposal? 
</P>
<P>
Is that just a sham? 
</P>
<P>
Do they know no middle ground? 
</P>
<P>
Or does it always come down to a choice between collusion or polluting the 
salary structure? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wild scene," Dodger owner Peter O'Malley agreed. "I don't know where 
the storm is going to take us or where it will end, but you've got to stay in 
the race. You can't stick your head in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, as much as O'Malley and others believe there is need for change 
in the system, the competitive environment is difficult to ignore, though they 
all did for a time and are still getting the bills for collusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you can say you're not going to pay $3 million a year or $2.5 million a 
year, but salaries continue to escalate, and if you're going to compete on the 
field, you have to compete in the market," said General Manager John Schuerholz 
of the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how strong your farm system is, at some point you're going to 
have to deal with a free agent, either one of your own or someone else's." 
</P>
<P>
And at some point, Schuerholz added, the process has to change or the game will 
devour itself. As it is, there is already dissension. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Bronfman, owner of the Montreal Expos, who have already lost Perez and 
Smith and are about to lose Langston and Hubie Brooks, said Wednesday that his 
fellow owners are acting like "damned fools," making it impossible for clubs in 
smaller markets to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Added Claude Brochu, the club president: "Bryn Smith is a good, average 
pitcher. That's what he is, a .500 pitcher. If you triple his salary, it's not 
suddenly going to make him a 20-game winner." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but a lot of clubs seem determined to test the theory. 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, undermine the theory behind their collective proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of three starting pitchers as free agents doesn't tell the whole story 
of the Expos' decimation. 
</P>
<P>
It may be recalled that they traded another starting pitcher, John Dopson, to 
Boston for shortstop Spike Owen before the 1989 season, then traded three 
pitching prospects to the Seattle Mariners for Langston in May. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in addition to the departure of Langston, Perez and Smith, the Expos are 
about to lose Brooks, generally their most consistent run-producer. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Buck Rodgers, swallowing the developments at his Yorba Linda home, has 
yet to take arsenic along with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, the strength of our organization is pitching," he said. "We've 
lost a lot, but what we're talking about is replacing a couple of 10-game 
winners (Perez won nine, Smith 10 and Langston 12). We're not hurting that 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
"We have six pitching spots open now, but we have some young pitchers who may 
have replaced some of those people anyway. I'd rather push a young arm than 
pump up an old one." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Montreal rotation includes Dennis Martinez, Zane Smith and a 
series of question marks. One, Mark Gardner, was the American Assn.'s pitcher 
of the year in 1989. Mel Rojas, Howard Farmer and Brian Barnes, the NCAA 
strikeout leader at Clemson in 1987, will be given the chance to make the jump 
from double A. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take work, it's going to take patience, but by the end of the 
season I think we can be decent," Rodgers said. "No one is going to pick us to 
win a pennant, but no one picked us in '87 and we won 91 games. There's no 
sense crying about it. I think we can still be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
More than in the area of pitching, however, the Expos have been hurt most, 
Rodgers said, by a depleted inventory. They have nothing to trade for the 
left-handed hitter they needed so desperately down the stretch in '89. 
</P>
<P>
"No free agents want to come to Montreal," Rodgers said. "None want to go to 
Cleveland. There are 15 or 16 clubs who have no chance of signing a (quality) 
free agent, and that puts more emphasis on trading and makes it that much 
harder to trade. 
</P>
<P>
"On top of that, we really lack the inventory now. We can't take a pitcher and 
get the hitter we need. I think I'll take a deck of pinochle cards to Nashville 
(and the winter meetings) next week. I don't think we'll be doing anything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Yount has returned from a vacation in Hawaii, where the tug of war for 
his services continued. 
</P>
<P>
Yount vacationed with longtime Milwaukee Brewer teammate Paul Molitor and close 
friend Bob McClure, a former Milwaukee teammate now with the Angels. While 
Molitor attempted to talk free agent Yount into staying with the Brewers, 
McClure tried to sell him on the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed to have come down to that: either Milwaukee or Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a surprise if Yount went anywhere else, though it is said that he 
wants to be sure McClure will still be here before agreeing to an Angel 
contract. He is watching how the Angels handle McClure. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there has been nothing to watch, agent Alan Meersand said. 
</P>
<P>
The club has had no negotiations with McClure, who earned $275,000 last year, 
one of the Angels' best investments. McClure, 36, was 6-1 with a 1.55 
earned-run average and three saves. He restricted left-handed hitters to a .155 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
A more practical complication in Yount's possible departure from Milwaukee 
involves $5 million in low-interest loans that he received from the Brewers for 
investment in Arizona land. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball frowns on a player switching teams while indebted to his previous 
team. Any offer to Yount will have to include a payoff of the loans. 
</P>
<P>
Add Yount: Fred Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers, flew to 
Phoenix Wednesday to meet with Robin and Larry Yount, who handles his brother's 
negotiations. Claire was not available for comment, but Larry Yount said that 
Robin has an interest in any club he is talking to. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Rona has refused to comment on his resignation as executive director of 
the owners' Player Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
However, the initial portrait seems accurate, a variety of baseball sources 
say. Rona was unhappy with the increased role of attorney Charles O'Connor in 
preparations for the collective bargaining talks, and unhappy with the pressure 
he was receiving from some owners to allow O'Connor to serve as lead 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to build a better relationship with the union, and Barry 
represented a bridge to collusion," one executive said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words: baseball burned its bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Utility infielder Dave Anderson, who made $420,000 while hitting .229 in 140 
at-bats with the Dodgers last year, is guaranteed $1.1 million by the two-year 
contract he signed with the San Francisco Giants Tuesday. Anderson will receive 
a $100,000 signing bonus and salaries of $450,000 in 1990 and $550,000 in 1991. 
He can also make another $200,000 in appearance and award bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
His departure enhances the chance of young shortstop Jose Vizcaino to stay with 
the Dodgers in a utility role and means that Mike Sharperson is almost certain 
to stay, joining Mickey Hatcher and Lenny Harris as utility infielders. Hatcher 
and Harris can play the outfield as well. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Robert Fraley said that Anderson had an obvious tugs of emotion and 
loyalty at the thought of leaving the team that brought him to the majors, but 
that the Dodgers "wouldn't offer any security (in the form of a multi-year 
contract), so there was no real decision for him."

EARLY START PERPLEXES COACHES; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: POSTSEASON TOURNAMENT, EXAMS PROMPT OPENING OF PAC-10 CONFERENCE 
SEASON IN NOVEMBER.

<P>
It's not just the holiday season that seems to start earlier every year. So 
does the Pacific 10 Conference basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
It's still November and UCLA will play Washington tonight in Hec Edmundson 
Pavilion while USC opens at Washington State in Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
Why so early? 
</P>
<P>
When the Pac-10 voted to add a postseason tournament, it lost a week for 
conference games. For the last three seasons, leftover games were played in the 
week before Christmas. But those dates, in some cases, conflicted with final 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
So, in the spring of 1987, conference athletic directors voted to play the 
games, starting this year, in the first weekend in December. 
</P>
<P>
Two other conference games are scheduled for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Only California and Stanford, which were scheduled to meet Saturday but decided 
to move the game to the last week of the season, will not open conference play 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a difficult time to start the conference season, particularly for 
a new coach with a new team," said Washington Coach Lynn Nance, who was hired 
by the Huskies last April after leading St. Mary's to a 25-5 season and the 
championship of the West Coast Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Nance is one of three first-year Pac-10 coaches to make conference debuts 
almost before they have had time to meet their players. 
</P>
<P>
Two other newcomers -- Bill Frieder of Arizona State and Jim Anderson of Oregon 
State -- will oppose each other tonight at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
For ASU, the conference opener is also its season opener. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us coaches like to play league games this early," UCLA 
Coach Jim Harrick said. "But you do what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Next season, Pac-10 games are scheduled for Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
One obvious solution to the problem, of course, would be to discontinue the 
postseason tournament. That possibility, supported by the coaches, will be 
discussed at league meetings Dec. 7-10 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
This season's conference tournament will be played March 8-11 at Tempe, Ariz., 
but the Pac-10 has not yet committed to a tournament site for 1991, conference 
spokesman Mike Matthews said.

NEWSWIRE: EAST GERMANS TEST FOR DOPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany is stepping up doping controls and has begun testing athletes for 
banned performance-enhancing drugs during training, the official news agency 
ADN said. 
</P>
<P>
ADN said that the country's leading sports doctors met with East German 
reporters after a two-day symposium to inform them of the new regular tests for 
detection of banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports figures and trainers must be made aware that doping is not the proper 
means to enhance performance, and that hard training cannot be substituted by 
something else to achieve top performances," ADN quoted the doctors as saying. 
"Now tests are being conducted and positive results will be made public." 
</P>
<P>
After denying for years Western newspaper reports that some East German 
athletes were using drugs, East Germany earlier this month admitted that 14 
athletes had failed drug tests last year.

Free agent Walt Terrell, a right-handed pitcher, agreed to a three-year, 
$3.6-million contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell, expected to be the Pirates' third starter behind John Smiley and Doug 
Drabek, was 15-10, 15-12 and 17-10 for the Detroit Tigers from 1985-87, but was 
18-34 the last two seasons. He split the 1989 season between the San Diego

NOTHING CAN DENY JIM PALMER RIGHTFUL PLACE IN HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Baseball Hall of Fame ballot arrived Wednesday, and there was Jim Palmer's 
name on it. Once I checked to make sure he hadn't been nominated for the 
announcers' wing, I put my X next to his name. He belongs the first year he's 
eligible. He belongs on every ballot. His numbers (if not his play-by-play) 
speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer will be the first Hall of Famer most of you have been privileged to see 
in his underwear, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Get to know your Hall 
of Famers. Sportswriters routinely see future Hall of Famers -- also Larry 
Sheets -- in their underwear. When we say we know the players, warts and all, 
we mean that literally. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer is basically wartless. He won 20 games eight times. He won three Cy 
Youngs. He was 268-152 with a 2.86 earned run average. He gave Earl Weaver 
heartburn. He was never, ever, ever dull. He graces larger-than-life 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
Every player with his larger-than-life credentials is in the Hall of Fame, and 
Palmer, who played a role in nearly every great Orioles moment, will be, too. 
Make your reservations for Cooperstown now. 
</P>
<P>
And yet he's not the most obvious choice this go-round. I would rate Palmer 
among the top six or seven pitchers of his generation -- mid-'60s to mid-'80s 
-- along with Sandy Koufax, Tom Seaver, Bob Gibson, Juan Marichal, Steve 
Carlton and Nolan Ryan. But Joe Morgan, who also comes eligible this year, 
might be the best second baseman ever. 
</P>
<P>
The sabremeticians and other baseball nuts who spend quality time alone in 
their one-room apartments, stocked only with a calculator, batteries and a 
dog-eared Baseball Encyclopedia, suggest that Morgan is even better than Rogers 
Hornsby. 
</P>
<P>
The only Hornsby I ever saw was Bruce, and he couldn't turn the double play. 
Morgan, I saw. On a team featuring Johnny Bench and Pete Rose and Tony Perez 
and George Foster, Morgan was, in his best years, without peer. In the other 
years, he was merely great. He was the heart of any team he ever played on. 
Numbers (a .271 lifetime batting average, 268 homers) don't begin to describe 
Morgan's value, but he did routinely walk 100 times a year, score 100 runs a 
year, hit as many as 27 homers a year, stole 50 to 60 bases a year. And he was 
even better than the sum of his parts. 
</P>
<P>
OK, Morgan and Palmer. Seal the envelope and mail it in? 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in my first as a voter, I wrestled with the concept of what 
constitutes a Hall of Famer. (Forget character. Babe Ruth drank too much; Ty 
Cobb was the most hated man in the game. So don't tell me that Gaylord Perry 
doesn't belong because he found creative uses for hair cream.) The strict 
constructionists argue that only those players who fit in comfortably with, 
say, Ted Williams and Willie Mays belong. 
</P>
<P>
I tend to agree, and yet, as I did last year, I've decided to lengthen the 
list. Why? Because if Don Drysdale is in the Hall of Fame, then Perry should be 
in there, too. If Stan Coveleski belongs, so does Ferguson Jenkins. If Johnny 
Mize is in there, Orlando Cepeda belongs. In fact, in Cepeda's case, you can 
make a decent argument that his statistics are comparable to Willie McCovey's. 
</P>
<P>
That's my list -- Palmer, Morgan, Perry, Jenkins and Cepeda. You can vote for 
10, but I'm stretching the point only so far. I left off Jim Bunning, a good 
pitcher who won 224 games and who has a lot of support among voters. I left off 
Ken Boyer and Ron Santo, both good third basemen who drove in a lot of runs. I 
left off Dick Allen and Vada Pinson, who each started fast but faded. I left 
off Bobby Bonds, who was Hall-of-Fame potential anyway. I left off Tony Oliva 
despite his three batting titles. I left off Maury Wills even though he 
probably helped change the face of the game. I left off Jim Kaat, who won 283 
games over -- get this -- 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Perry won 314 games, with 300 being a reasonable benchmark for greatness. He 
won the Cy Young in both leagues. Over 22 years, Perry had an ERA of 3.10. He 
wasn't Koufax. He wasn't Palmer. He was close enough. All Jenkins did was win 
20 games seven times, six in succession, pitching too much of the time in 
Wrigley Field, which should entitle him to some kind of award. He was 284-226, 
and if you're wavering, keep thinking Don Drysdale, Don Drysdale, Don Drysdale. 
</P>
<P>
Cepeda won't make it. He won't make it because he played in the shadow of Mays 
and McCovey, and he won't make it because he went to jail after his career had 
ended, and he won't make it because he's a close call anyway. But he hit over 
.300 nine times, drove in 100 or more runs five times and 90 or more nine 
times, hit at least 25 homers eight times. He was an MVP and an 11-time 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Carl Yastrzemski made it on his first try, with fewer homers per 
at-bat than Cepeda, with only six years batting .300 and seven years with 
90-plus RBI. 
</P>
<P>
In Baltimore, Cepeda's fate is of little interest this year. All eyes will 
naturally be on Palmer. This won't be a nail-biter, folks. He's a sure thing. 
The only question is whether Earl Weaver will introduce him at the induction 
ceremony. That sure gets my vote.

RAIDERS' ALLEN RETURNS TO PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marcus Allen returned to practice Wednesday, which means that the Raiders will 
activate him this week against the Denver Broncos or next week against the St. 
Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
At what position? 
</P>
<P>
"Marcus is a halfback," Coach Art Shell said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has said he doesn't want to play fullback alongside Bo Jackson any 
longer. The question is, how much will Allen play after partially tearing a 
ligament in his right knee and sitting out the last seven games? 
</P>
<P>
And at 29, his $1.1-million contract expiring, will Al Davis sign him again? 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Jackson, who has been increasingly banged up the last two weeks, 
went on the injury list. He is listed as probable with a bruised knee. Jackson 
has been held to 54 and 64 yards the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
Also returning to practice was receiver Sam Graddy. To make room, the Raiders 
waived running back Derrick Gainer and safety Derrick Crudup off their 
developmental squad. MARK HEISLER

KINGS HOPE MAKELA IS RIGHT CHOICE; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: TWO-FOR-ONE TRADE FOR ISLANDER WINGER COULD FILL A NEED ON THE GRETZKY 
LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The search continues for a winger answering the general description of Jari 
Kurri to play at the right hand of Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Mikko Makela, a right winger from Finland who has been playing for the 
New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Makela was acquired by the Kings late Tuesday in a trade that sent defenseman 
Ken Baumgartner and center Hubie McDonough to the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
No one is saying that Makela is as good as Kurri. But he's 6-feet-2, 193 
pounds, quick and plays that quick-passing European style that Gretzky likes so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is well into his second season with the Kings and has yet to settle 
upon a right winger who works as well with him as did Kurri, his longtime 
partner with the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
After practice at the Culver City rink Wednesday afternoon, Gretzky said that 
he had not been in on the negotiations for this deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Makela," Gretzky said. "I've only seen him play a couple of times 
a year. But I've talked today with a couple of guys who say he has a great deal 
of talent." 
</P>
<P>
Makela hasn't shown much this season. He has appeared in 20 games, posting two 
goals and three assists. In his 307 NHL games -- over five seasons -- he has 95 
goals and 124 assists for 219 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Makela is big, he has strength and size, and he also has speed," Coach Tom 
Webster said. "He does more things offensively than Mikael Lindholm (the 
Swedish forward who started the season on Gretzky's line). Lindholm (who was 
optioned to New Haven, the Kings' American Hockey League affiliate) is more of 
a checking kind of a guy. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try Makela on the line with (Mike) Krushelnyski and Gretzky against the 
Oilers, spotting him with Mike Allison. I think that will help Allison, who has 
had trouble with injuries in the past, and it will give him time to come in 
slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Makela, 24, hasn't been getting much ice time. He has been scoreless in his 
last six games, has not scored a goal since Nov. 2 and was scratched for 
Tuesday night's game against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
So the trade gives three young players a chance to play more. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgartner, 23, had played in only 12 games this season. As the eighth or 
ninth defenseman for the Kings, he had one goal and 28 penalty minutes, in 
keeping with his role as one of the Kings' tough guys. Drafted by the Buffalo 
Sabres in the 1985 entry draft, Baumgartner was traded to the Kings in January 
of 1986 for Brian Engblom and Doug Smith. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough, 26, is in his rookie season. He had appeared in 22 of the Kings' 24 
games. He had three goals and five assists. After signing as a free agent in 
October of 1987, McDonough led New Haven in scoring last season. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said that he was sorry to lose McDonough and Baumgartner, adding that 
the Islanders had been very enthusiastic about getting Baumgartner. 
</P>
<P>
Islander General Manager Bill Torry said: "Coming off all the injuries to our 
defensemen, we need to add some strength and aggressiveness back there. . . . 
(Baumgartner) is aggressive and fiery, and those are qualities we can use right 
now."

INNOVATION: BIOTECH ALONE CAN'T SOLVE WORLD HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The image of a Third World child so weakened by hunger that he can't even brush 
the flies away from his lips has unfortunately degenerated into a media cliche. 
Turn the page or change the channel and you can't avoid the image. But that 
cliche starkly highlights what will be one of the most bitter North-South 
conflicts over the role of technology in feeding the starving masses -- a 
conflict where there are no heroes and no villains, only trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict centers on the unnatural potential of agricultural biotechnology. 
Simply twiddle with a few genes, and the potential is that vital crops such as 
rice and sorghum can become astonishingly more drought tolerant, pest resistant 
and nutritionally enhanced. Agricultural bioengineers can craft crop to climate 
and to taste. They can engineer special microorganisms to help nourish and 
protect both the plants and the soil. Although genetically re-engineering 
agriculture has proven more difficult than many scientists had anticipated, no 
one questions that critical breakthroughs are just a few splices away. 
</P>
<P>
Organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation have taken the lead in 
bringing this technology to the Third World. "Our focus has been on the 
potential for genetically engineered crop plants," says Robert Herdt, director 
for agricultural sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Although no crops have yet been released, Herdt anticipates genetically 
engineered, disease-resistant rice to be introduced within five years. Work in 
genetically enhanced sorghum, cowpeas, cassava and other crops is also under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"The Third World is still ignorant of this technology," Herdt adds. "They feel 
that there is a magic bullet out there that is being kept from them." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the great promises of biotechnology is that there will be this second 
'Green Revolution' and that all the world's hunger problems will be 
eliminated," says Jack Doyle, director of the Agriculture and Biotechnology 
Project at the Washington-based Friends of the Earth. "The battle in the future 
will be how it's packaged: Is it put in a seed? Or does it just become part of 
a process?" 
</P>
<P>
But people are kidding themselves if they think that any biotechnology package 
offers the solution to the challenge of world hunger. No matter how it's 
designed, this biotech package has enormous political, economic and 
environmental implications for both the Third World and the industrialized 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, most of these implications are unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
In America, environmental activists like Jeremy Rifkin have successfully 
challenged the mass release of genetically engineered organisms into the 
environment. In West Germany, the Greens have similarly blocked agro-technology 
research initiatives. Their rationale is simple: We don't know what impact 
these newly engineered organisms will have on the ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Benign? Perhaps -- but their environmental impact could also range from 
nuisance to catastrophe. Genetically engineered high-yield plants could become 
aggressive weeds; microbial organisms designed to protect crops could evolve 
into parasites that irrevocably destroy the soil. 
</P>
<P>
"Microorganisms can move as easily across national boundaries as radiation," 
Doyle notes. 
</P>
<P>
So Third World deployment of biotechnology, these environmentalists argue, can 
have global repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
Most responsible scientists dismiss these eco-disaster scenarios as fantasies 
of the uninformed. "When people are starving, they aren't about to not grow 
food because of someone's hypothetical hazard," says Ron Davis, a professor of 
biochemistry at the Stanford Medical Center who does biotechnology consulting 
in India. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many responsible scientists do acknowledge that the large-scale 
release of a broad variety of genetically engineered plants and microorganisms 
is far more likely to evoke unintended ecological consequences than the 
controlled cultivation of two or three re-engineered plants. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the potential of biotechnologies as consistent with the concerns of 
environmental problems rather than counter to those concerns," says 
Rockefeller's Herdt. "But there can be problems." 
</P>
<P>
So should the West encourage the full-scale, no-holds-barred development of 
agricultural biotechnology in the Third World and risk environmental problems 
for everybody? Or does the West encourage a more moderate approach to the 
technology while millions more starve each year? 
</P>
<P>
"That confrontation may occur in China and India," says Herdt. "Rice will be 
the first issue." 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the Third World technology question was nuclear proliferation. In 
the 1990s, will that technology question be the proliferation of genetic 
engineering? 
</P>
<P>
But even if you completely ignore the environmental concerns, the biotechnology 
challenge for the Third World and the industrialized nations is daunting. "The 
risk with genetically engineered plants may not be ecological so much as 
economic," Friends of the Earth's Doyle says. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle points out that introducing high-yield plants into agricultural economies 
could accelerate the Third World's trend to mass urbanization -- the Shanghais, 
Calcuttas and Sao Paulos all bloated with too many people competing for too few 
resources within an infrastructure that's already perilously overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
This urban hypergrowth was one of the unanticipated consequences of the first 
Green Revolution. It is not at all impossible that the wrong biotech package 
may further undermine the fragile family farming economies of the Third World 
and leave it even more dependent on the West. Even if biotechnology delivers 
abundance, the Third World may end up trading famine for pestilence. What's 
more, biotechnology can't erase all the political and economic problems 
associated with food distribution -- which many experts assert is the real 
cause of world hunger. 
</P>
<P>
The picture is not unrelentingly bleak. There are movements for "sustainable 
agriculture" that blends biotechnology with economically pragmatic agricultural 
policies. Yet these are all evolutionary approaches that take time -- time that 
millions of people do not have. 
</P>
<P>
Does biotechnology have the potential to raise the standard of living and the 
quality of life in the Third World? Undeniably, yes. Is there also the very 
real possibility that the technology can also make a bad situation even worse? 
Absolutely. The trade-offs between economics and ecology in agricultural 
biotechnology will be one of the most painful issues between North and South as 
we enter the 1990s.

WORKING 7 TO 5 -- FOUR DAYS A WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: COMPANIES ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO A COMPRESSED WORKWEEK TO MEET 
POLLUTION LAWS AND TO RECRUIT WORKERS.

<P>
While most of her friends will be at work this Friday, Barbara Davenport plans 
to do her Christmas shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport, a payroll coordinator at Builders Emporium's corporate headquarters 
in Irvine, will be able to avoid the weekend crush thanks to a company program 
allowing her to work a four-day week. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of working Fridays, she shops, travels or runs errands. "And sometimes 
it is great to have a day to do nothing but maybe read or sew," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The day off, she said, is well worth waking at 4:30 a.m. four days a week so 
she can put in a 10-hour workday. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport is one of thousands of Southern Californians who log their 40 hours a 
week in an untraditional way. 
</P>
<P>
Pushed by air quality regulations and other concerns, companies increasingly 
are compressing workweeks for some or all of their employees from five 8-hour 
days to four 10-hour days or even three 12-hour days. Others are offering a 
three-day weekend every other week to employees who put in 9-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
Industry flirted with the alternative workweek in the early 1970s, in response 
to the gasoline crunch. But as the crisis faded, firms slid back to the 
five-day routine. 
</P>
<P>
Interest is reviving in Southern California now largely because of a new 
regulation of the South Coast Air Quality Management District requiring the Los 
Angeles Basin's 7,000 largest employers to take steps to eliminate one of every 
three potential car trips to work during the morning rush hours. Car-pooling is 
one option. Another is having employees come to work less frequently and stay 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping to unclog the smog-filled Los Angeles Basin, shortened 
workweeks are credited with improving morale, reducing turnover and 
absenteeism, and aiding worker recruitment in the region's highly competitive 
employment market. 
</P>
<P>
But employers also say a compressed workweek can cause fatigue, hinder 
communication between employees on different schedules and create headaches 
with client firms and customers who expect companies to be open regular hours. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Builders Emporium, a home improvement chain, other companies that 
recently have initiated or expanded compressed workweek programs to reduce 
commuter trips include the Norwalk facility of Bechtel Corp., the San Francisco 
engineering and construction company; Delco Remy, an Anaheim battery 
manufacturer; Avco Financial Services, an Irvine-based financial services 
institution, and Chevron USA, at its refinery in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District is in the early stages of evaluating a 
compressed week. Beth Louargand, deputy business manager, said although it 
would not be feasible for teachers to change their hours, she believes that 
many employees in payroll, accounting, maintenance and other support positions 
-- who number in the thousands -- could do so. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 food preparation workers and 150 school police officers have been on 
a four-day schedule for several years, she said, and another few dozen people 
in various departments have been added to the program recently. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just taken our first baby steps," Louargand said. 
</P>
<P>
Compressed workweeks are generally viewed as an employee benefit, although 
under most plans the number of hours worked remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating one daily commute per week "saves wear and tear on the car and 
body, and it feels like a holiday," said Tim Trujillo, vice president of 
administration at Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics in Santa Ana. The firm's 600 
employees have been on a four-day week for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo said turnover and absenteeism have dropped because workers often use 
the extra day off to attend to family and other personal demands. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD says cutting a day out of the workweek can help companies achieve a 
quick reduction in automobile trips at no additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
And commutes are getting longer, employers say, as workers move outside 
metropolitan Los Angeles and Orange Counties to grasp more house for their 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Quiroz, who moved from Whittier to Vista in northern San Diego County to 
buy a house on two acres of land, travels 75 miles to her secretarial job at 
Delco Remy in Anaheim. So she is particularly grateful to be one of four 
employees at the plant who are trying out a four-day workweek. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tolerate the commuting by having the extra day off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Long commutes were part of Chevron's motivation in July when it put 375 people 
on 12-hour shifts operating its El Segundo refinery. The company is about to 
test an alternative workweek that could be applied to the refinery's office, 
engineering and maintenance staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Humphries, manager of human resources at the refinery, which employs 
1,100, said the program is being adopted "primarily to try to ease the commute 
for our employees. We found more and more of our employees were living greater 
distances from the refinery to find housing they could afford." 
</P>
<P>
Humphries said the program, along with an expanded company van service, also 
coincides with AQMD's campaign to clean the air in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
John Dunlap, director of public affairs for the AQMD -- which has put its own 
staff on a four-day workweek -- said the compressed workweek programs are an 
effective pollution control measure. 
</P>
<P>
District regulations require companies to submit draft plans to reduce 
commuting trips. Although all of the plans will not be in hand until late 1990, 
"we are already seeing that more of the larger companies are embracing 
compressed workweeks," Dunlap said. Of the 200 employer plans that so far have 
been entered into the AQMD computer system, about 50 show interest in trying a 
compressed workweek, according to the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly Don Torluemke, president of Ekistic, a Los Angeles consulting firm 
helping employers comply with AQMD regulations, estimates that of the 700 
companies he has worked with in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino, more than half are considering adopting a compressed workweek and 
about 25% already have done so. 
</P>
<P>
One obstacle to the shortened workweek is that state law requires companies to 
obtain a vote of approval from two-thirds of affected workers before requiring 
employees routinely to work more than eight hours a day without overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than shorten the workweek, many employers prefer to give employees 
"flexible work hours" so they can create individualized time schedules within 
the traditional eight-hour work day. 
</P>
<P>
But other companies like Fluorocarbon, a Laguna Niguel-based manufacturer of 
rubber moldings and other industrial components, have had a four-day workweek 
many years and swear by it. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Churm, the company's chairman and chief executive, said about 2,000 of 
the company's 3,400 employees in the United States and Europe have Fridays off, 
although the sales and service staff are available to deal with customers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best advantages of the four-day workweek, said Churm, is that "it is 
a wonderful way to recruit people. If we are trying to hire machinists and 
someone else is, we always wind up getting the guy because he likes the 
four-day workweek." 
</P>
<P>
Rita Brohman, a traffic management consultant who works for clients of Ekistic, 
said a four-day workweek sometimes exhausts employees in physically demanding 
jobs, reducing productivity. But she said there has been clear improvement in 
the productivity of 30 employees in accounting, payroll and management 
information systems at Builders Emporium's Irvine headquarters since they 
switched to a compressed week 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Brohman said white collar workers find that when they work more consecutive 
hours, "It is much easier to keep going and finish a project -- especially when 
you know a three-day weekend is coming up."

Lin Defers Taking Position on Bid: Lin Broadcasting Corp. said its board 
deferred taking a position on a revised $3.4-billion offer from McCaw Cellular 
Communications Inc. for a controlling interest in the company. Lin has already 
reached an agreement with BellSouth Corp., the regional telephone company based 
in Atlanta, for a merger of their cellular interests. That proposal is being 
presented to Lin shareholders for a vote Jan. 12.

SHEARSON DEMOTES PRESIDENT IN REORGANIZATION; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: SOURCES SAY THE TROUBLED FIRM IS CLOSE TO SIGNING UP A SIZABLE NEW 
INVESTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Battered by market weakness and its own blunders, Shearson Lehman Hutton 
announced Wednesday a reorganization that will demote Jeffrey B. Lane, the 
investment firm's current president and chief operating officer, and elevate a 
cadre of younger executives. 
</P>
<P>
The regrouping apparently makes Richard S. Fuld, 43, the leading candidate to 
eventually become Shearson's next president. Fuld has been head of Shearson's 
taxable fixed-income unit and becomes head of the capital markets group, 
overseeing worldwide trading and research. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shearson is also close to arranging a sizable new investment in the 
firm, according to Wall Street sources. Such an investment -- expected to total 
hundreds of millions of dollars -- would remove a threatened lowering of its 
credit rating that has hung over its head for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
The management reshuffle, which was expected, was designed in part to broaden 
the number of top executives overseeing Shearson's far-flung operations. 
Recently, only Lane and Chairman Peter A. Cohen have stood at the pinnacle of 
the organization; Cohen has said the arrangement has hurt the flow of 
information within the firm and contributed to some of its difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"You've basically had Cohen and Lane running the whole show; you're going here 
from two guys at the top to five," said Alison Deans, analyst for Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co. "I think they'll have a better feel for what's going on under 
them now." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the organization will be divided into four units -- 
trading, retail brokerage, money management, and investment and merchant 
banking. Sherman R. Lewis Jr., a Shearson veteran, will head investment and 
merchant banking; Hardwick Simmons, now chairman of the retail brokerage arm, 
will become its president; while Lane, the current president, will head the 
money-management department and other subsidiary operations. 
</P>
<P>
Other key players will be a triumvirate that will run merchant and investment 
banking under Lewis: J. Tomlinson Hill, Michael D. Madden and Mel A. Shaftel. 
Another executive with a reduced role in the shuffle is Herbert S. Freiman, who 
had been chief of the trading and related operations and will now head a 
committee that reviews use of the firm's capital in deals. 
</P>
<P>
While Shearson Chairman Cohen seems momentarily firmly in command, that may 
change if Shearson is not able to engineer a turnaround soon. "I think a lot of 
people still have questions about that," said analyst Deans. 
</P>
<P>
One former high-ranking Shearson executive described Fuld, the heir apparent as 
president, as "a hands-on, very, very tough kind of guy. Apparently they now 
feel they need more of that kind of approach." 
</P>
<P>
The executive also said the three heads of Shearson's investment and merchant 
banking unit are "three very willful guys," who have had differences in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization was forced by a series of embarrassments and difficulties 
over the past year that has depressed Shearson's profitability and net worth. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson was forced to fire the president of its Boston Co. unit when it was 
disclosed that the money-management firm overstated its income by $30 million. 
Shearson wrote off $100 million of its investment in MCorp., a troubled Texas 
financial concern. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson's efforts to diversify from a vast retail stock brokerage -- the 
nation's second largest -- into a full-service firm have not been completely 
successful; Shearson has had mixed results, for example, in its drive to become 
a leading takeover deal maker. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding these setbacks has been the stock market's worsening outlook and 
the slowdown in some types of corporate takeovers. Shearson earlier this month 
announced that it would lay off 800 employees and cut commission compensation 
to brokers for the first time in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Outsiders speculated that the new investor in Shearson may buy a block of newly 
issued Shearson stock and perhaps also up to 20% of the stock now held by 
American Express Co., the company's largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
American Express has publicly said it wishes to reduce its current 61% stake in 
the company to 50%, partly to reduce the damage that the Shearson stake has 
recently done to its net earnings. At 50% ownership, American Express would no 
longer be required to carry the Shearson results to its bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Any investment would also be done with the consultation of which owns a 13% 
stake in Shearson. Nippon's investment, made in April, 1987, came on condition 
that American Express wouldn't lower its investment in Shearson below 40%. 
</P>
<P>
If no additional capital is received, the company's debt would likely be 
downgraded by Moody's Investors Service, a move that would cost Shearson 
millions in additional interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson last year earned $96 million on revenue of $10.5 billion. Between 1983 
and 1988, its net profit margin declined to 0.9% from 9.4%.

ICAHN ASKS OK TO ACQUIRE 25% OF USX CORP.; 
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVERS: THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THE CORPORATE RAIDER HAS ASKED TO INCREASE 
HIS STAKE IN THE OIL, GAS AND STEEL CONCERN.

<TEXT>
<P>
Investor Carl C. Icahn disclosed Wednesday that he is requesting federal 
approval to acquire at least 25% of USX Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn revealed that he 
was seeking permission from the Federal Trade Commission to increase his stake 
in the Pittsburgh-based oil, gas and steel concern. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Trade Commission antitrust clearance for such an acquisition is 
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. 
</P>
<P>
According to the SEC filing, which was released after the stock market closed, 
Icahn owned nearly 34 million, or 13.26%, of USX's outstanding shares of common 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, known for his past corporate takeover attempts, also owns Trans World 
Airlines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
USX finished down 12.5 cents at $33.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC document noted that last November, Icahn made a Hart-Scott-Rodino 
filing indicating his intention to acquire more than 15% of USX's voting 
securities "and, depending upon market conditions, more than 25%" of its voting 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
But because his group did not acquire in excess of 15% within a year, a new 
filing is required to permit acquisition above 15%, said the filing, known as a 
13-D. 
</P>
<P>
USX spokesman William Kessler said the company was aware of Icahn's filing but 
had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
He said Icahn made similar requests in late 1987 and late 1988 but never 
boosted his stake to the amount requested within the allotted year. "This is 
the third time he's filed," Kessler said. "This is a renewable thing."

Commodities Probe Widens to S&amp;P 500 Pit: Federal authorities probing 
trading abuses at the city's commodity exchange reportedly have expanded the 
investigation to include stock index futures trading at the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange. Six traders from the Merc's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures 
pit received subpoenas earlier this week to testify before a federal grand jury 
regarding trades they made during the 1987 stock-market crash, according to a 
story in the Wall Street Journal.

Nikon Not In Perkin-Elmer Talks: Nikon Corp. said it is not in talks and has no 
plans to acquire Perkin-Elmer Corp.'s semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
division, although it was in such talks earlier this year. The Japanese camera 
maker said it broke off talks in part because of concern about American 
reaction to another Japanese company buying a key U.S. technology firm. 
However, Perkin-Elmer is having difficulty finding a U.S. bidder for the unit, 
one of the few U.S. firms that produces equipment for manufacturing computer 
chips.

Hertz to Pay for Car Sale Fraud: Hertz Corp. agreed to pay up to $3 million in 
settlement costs for illegally selling used rental cars without telling buyers 
the vehicles were salvaged wrecks. Hertz offered to repurchase up to 753 cars 
and pay civil penalties and investigative costs. The 753 cars were shipped from 
throughout California to County Auto Pool, a private car auctioneer in Chula 
Vista. County Auto Pool was named along with Hertz as co-defendant and both 
agreed to the settlement without admitting any wrongdoing.

LOTTERY PREPARES TO GO WITH A WINNER ON AD ACCOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dailey &amp; Associates seems to have won the lottery -- again. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles ad agency, which has created California Lottery ads for the 
past three years, was all but handed the $50-million annual account again on 
Wednesday for another four years. 
</P>
<P>
After a competitive review, the lottery staff has recommended the agency to the 
Lottery Commission -- a move that virtually assures that the ad firm will 
retain the high-profile business. The lottery board will make its final 
selection next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to stay with Dailey was based on their understanding of the 
lottery's challenges as a corporation and the agency's competitive cost 
proposal," said Susan Clark, director of lottery's marketing division. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey may be best known for creating the lottery "Sweet Dreams" campaign that 
features the song "Dream a Little Dream of Me." The various ads show snippets 
of people ranging from truck drivers to executives who fantasize about winning 
the big prize. The agency says it will stick with that familiar campaign 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Retaining the lottery business sent a sigh of relief Wednesday throughout the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we've won the biggest account of the year," said Phillip Joanou, 
chairman and chief executive of Dailey. "And it also means we haven't lost the 
biggest account of the year." Joanou said that 30 of his ad firm's employees 
work on the account. "If you lose an account like that, you have a lot to deal 
with." 
</P>
<P>
The review wasn't prompted by any unhappiness between the lottery and its 
agency. Rather, because the lottery is a state-run operation, all of its 
suppliers must be reconsidered every few years. Among the Los Angeles agencies 
competing for the business were Chiat/Day/Mojo and BBDO. Executives from both 
firms declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Joanou, whose agency also creates flashy ads featuring Lindsay Wagner for the 
Ford Dealers Advertising Assn. of Southern California, said the lottery has 
become a much more complex piece of business than it was just a few years ago. 
That's because the lottery has added numerous "Scratcher" games in its bid to 
increase business. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the lottery's most popular game, Lotto, saw somewhat 
disappointing sales this year. Sales of Lotto tickets in 1989 were "a little 
bit flat," said Carolyn Walker, a spokeswoman in Sacramento for the lottery.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc., a diversified energy and natural resources group, said 
Wednesday that it will launch a major restructuring and sell up to $1.5 billion 
in assets, the second time this year the company has taken steps to push up its 
stock price. 
</P>
<P>
In May, apparently feeling that Wall Street was not fairly valuing the company, 
Freeport took on a heavy debt load to buy back more than 20% of its stock. 
Freeport is active in sulfur, oil, gas and copper. 
</P>
<P>
Under the restructuring, Freeport said it will seek buyers for its 61%-owned 
Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co. affiliate, certain nitrogen fertilizer facilities and 
a 25% interest in South Korean fertilizer producer Namhae Chemical Corp. Over 
the past several years, Freeport said it has received a dividend of about $2 
million annually from Namhae. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it will focus its core business on phosphate fertilizer, oil 
and gas, and a copper and gold discovery in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the company bought back 15.6 million shares.

GLENFED SELLS $350 MILLION IN LOANS TO MEET NEW RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Federal Bank's parent company said Wednesday that it has sold $350 
million in loans for an $85-million after-tax gain to help the Glendale-based 
thrift meet tougher capital requirements that take effect Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Glenfed Inc. said it would also set aside $30 million, to be subtracted from 
its fiscal second-quarter earnings, to cover potential bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision earlier this month announced the new 
requirements, which call on thrifts to maintain a higher amount of capital to 
protect against losses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not smart or stupid," Michael Abrahams, a thrift industry analyst for the 
Los Angeles investment firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., said of 
Glenfed's actions. "There's no choice." 
</P>
<P>
The new rules require thrifts to maintain capital equal to 3% of assets as of 
Dec. 7. Half of that must be tangible assets, such as cash and securities, but 
the remainder may be in the form of "goodwill," the value of an institution 
over and above its tangible assets. However, starting in 1992, savings and 
loans must begin replacing goodwill with cash, and in 1995, only cash will 
count. 
</P>
<P>
A separate formula under the new rules determines the amount of capital needed 
based on the riskiness of a thrift's investments. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said as many as 800 S&amp;Ls nationwide may fail to meet the 
toughened standards. Those institutions would be forbidden to expand and would 
have to submit detailed business plans to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
After allowing for the increase in loan-loss reserves, Glenfed will apply the 
remaining $55 million in gains from the loans' sale to retained earnings, Chief 
Financial Officer David Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Glenfed's stock fell 75 cents Wednesday to close at $16.38 a share, a 52-week 
low, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift earned about $19.6 million in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, down 
about 38% from $31.4 million a year earlier. Glenfed had about $24.7 billion in 
assets as of Sept. 30.

HOME FLOODING TRACED TO LEAK FROM RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sam Soon's golden retriever began digging in the mushy flower beds in 
early November, Soon first noticed that his house seemed ready to set sail. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, four houses away, Alex Tenorio first spotted water 
bubbling from a crack in his driveway and pooling around the morning newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The two men didn't know that they shared a common problem: the earth under 
their houses had become a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
Each complained to City Hall, where officials told them to call a plumber, 
which they did. Tenorio even had to throw in a pair of Lakers tickets to 
persuade one plumber to come on a weekend. But the plumbers could find no 
leaks, nor did Tenorio find any clues when he crawled in the muck under his and 
his neighbors' houses. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Soon called Councilwoman Judy Chu who, in turn, persuaded city 
officials to take a closer look as walls in the houses seemed to shift, 
ceilings started to crack and doorways jammed. 
</P>
<P>
"It became obvious," City Manager Mark Lewis said, "that it was a bigger 
problem than somebody's drain backing up." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, divers in the nearby Garvey Reservoir found at least part of the 
answer to the mystery of why more than a dozen houses appeared as if they might 
float from their hillside perches: a 1-foot-wide, 6-foot-deep hole in the 
bottom of the 41-acre reservoir, which sits in a huge bowl and overlooks the 
western San Gabriel Valley city. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish to say that this hole we found in the reservoir lining 
doesn't have something to do with the problems of the houses," Charles E. 
Nichols said Tuesday as he surveyed the vast, newly empty reservoir from its 
rim. He is chief engineer of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, which operates the 35-year-old reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, despite several weeks of finger-pointing from Monterey Park 
residents and officials, the water district had been reluctant to accept that 
the reservoir was directly connected to the flooding of the Fulton Drive 
neighborhood of single-family houses. The reservoir is located uphill and about 
1,000 feet east of Fulton Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very uncommon. We've never had this situation before," said district 
spokesman Bob Gomperz, shortly before the hole was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
During the last week, the district had even undertaken "water fingerprinting 
tests," Gomperz said, to see if reservoir water matched the water in the yards 
of the houses. But those tests were inconclusive and became moot once the hole 
was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the discovery Monday, the water district had begun draining the 
reservoir, which is covered by a heavy, black liner that floats on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, the 70-foot deep reservoir had been drained nearly dry so that 
additional inspections could be conducted and repairs could begin. The water 
from the reservoir, one of eight in the district and a major source for 
drinkable water in Los Angeles County, was diverted to other parts of the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
It could take three months to complete the inspection and repairs, which chief 
engineer Nichols called expensive and complicated. Because rainy, cooler 
weather has arrived, it will be less of a problem that the reservoir can't be 
used for some time, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
The repairs will involve using huge air pumps to inflate the floating liner, 
one of the largest of its kind in the world. Also, small bulldozers and paving 
equipment may have to be used to repair the reservoir bottom, which is coated 
with a layer of asphalt over a 10-foot-thick clay liner. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Monday, the City Council unanimously called for the water district 
to determine the cause of the hole and the cracks radiating from it. 
</P>
<P>
The council also requested the district to cover all the expenses to the city 
and homeowners as a result of the leak and to take over the water-pumping 
operation at five homes. The city began pumping water away from the homes' 
foundations after residents complained at a council meeting. Since there have 
been no full structural inspections of the houses, no one knows what the 
long-term effects of the flooding will be. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council voted to hold discussions on the possible relocation 
of the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter that had been prepared for mailing to the water district just 
before the hole was discovered, City Manager Lewis complained of the "extremely 
dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
Tenorio, 47, invoked the collapse of a dam in Baldwin Hills 26 years ago as he 
sloshed through the mud and water around his garage Tuesday. In the 1963 dam 
collapse, portions of a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power dam gave way, 
and 290 million gallons of water and debris cascaded into a neighborhood. Five 
people were killed, 64 residences destroyed and many other houses were severely 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got these vivid memories of that," Tenorio said. "We just know that in 
layman's terms that if you're sitting on a sea of mud and you get a little 
quake, something's got to give. That hillside is going to come down on me." 
</P>
<P>
But Nichols said the Baldwin Dam collapse could not be compared to the 
situation at the Garvey Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"This was never a life-threatening situation," he said. "Even had this been 
allowed to go unattended . . . I doubt it would have developed into anything 
like (Baldwin Hills). We're very aware of our obligations and responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to help them and, at least for now, get rid of the immediate nuisance 
from outside their doorsteps," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the water district hand-delivered invitations to residents of 
Fulton Drive asking them to attend a community meeting on Saturday at 10 a.m. 
at the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he said the district has maintained constant contact with the 
Division of Safety of Dams in the state Department of Water Resources. 
</P>
<P>
But even beyond these assurances, city officials say they want a full 
accounting of what happened and what the district will do to ensure safety in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty concerned," Councilwoman Chu said at Monday night's meeting. "Why 
wasn't this detected earlier?" 
</P>
<P>
And Councilman Barry L. Hatch said, "We need to have the reservoir removed. . . 
. Our residents come first. Whatever caused the crack, it's going to happen 
again. Let's be firm in our demands." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Lewis said the city wants the district to conduct an "a full 
environmental impact statement to assure us and the residents that the 
reservoir is a safe project and that it can be rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't make any sense to do any repair unless they look at the underlying 
geological problems of what caused the crack," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
City and water district officials have raised the possibility that the Whittier 
earthquake in 1987 and one centered in Montebello in June may have contributed 
to creation of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Soon and Tenorio walked around Soon's swimming pool. At one point 
in recent weeks the pool had overflowed because of the influx of underground 
water. "Sam's wife has been worried sick," Tenorio said. "At night we can't go 
to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Their worries -- along with the sounds of water pumps the city has installed 
around their houses -- interrupt their sleep, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, when Tenorio's wife rises in the middle of the night from their water bed, 
the sloshing sound frightens him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the house is sliding," he said. "If it wasn't so tragic, it'd almost 
be funny." 
</P>

TEACHER CRITICIZES NEGATIVE REFERENCE IN ARTICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was delighted to see the article on Oct. 22 describing Teri Uyemura's 
classroom written by (Times Staff Writer) Denise Hamilton. It was especially 
nice to see because I am also a teacher at Washington Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
I liked the way she captured the flavor of the classroom, and some of the 
descriptions of the students were very honest. However, there was one sentence 
that bothered me. It said "Unlike some of the other teachers they have for 
electives, Uyemura commands students' respect." 
</P>
<P>
I teach typing, which is an elective that many sixth graders take. I know the 
computer, art and music teachers quite well. None of us were contacted or 
observed by Hamilton. I wonder why she feels students do not respect us. I have 
invited her to my classroom. 
</P>
<P>
I look forward to more articles about Washington but hope that negative 
statements are eliminated unless they are based on fact.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DIAMOND BAR; 
</P>
<P>
GROUNDBREAKING FOR ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A groundbreaking ceremony will take place at 8 a.m. today for the extension of 
Chino Hills Parkway through the city. 
</P>
<P>
The extension is expected to ease the traffic flow from the east. The road was 
the pivotal point in an out-of-court settlement between Diamond Bar and San 
Bernardino County in which the city promised to remove barricades on Grand 
Avenue by September, 1990, in exchange for the county's help in building other 
roads to siphon off Grand Avenue traffic through Diamond Bar. San Bernardino 
also paid $1.2 million for traffic signals and road improvements in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The county had sued the city earlier this year, claiming the barricades -- 
erected amid concerns that a single road through Diamond Bar would exacerbate 
traffic problems -- illegally obstructed a public right of way. 
</P>
<P>
The groundbreaking ceremony will be at the intersection of Phillips Ranch Road 
and Scenic Ridge Drive.

ENTREPRENEUR DISHES UP LUNCH WITH A SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fed up. That was Stephen Bagish after nine months of lunching with the only 
other person in his small downtown office. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a nice guy," Bagish says. "But every day? No way." 
</P>
<P>
Especially since just heartbeats away -- he could see them from his skyscraper 
windows -- toiled hundreds, thousands, maybe millions of others just like him: 
young, single, energetic, charismatic -- and eager to meet someone new. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't it be nice to have their phone numbers?" Bagish recalls thinking. "To 
go out with someone new for lunch, right near where I work?" 
</P>
<P>
And then the Brilliant Idea Light clicked on in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Bagish left his job as a video distributor, donned his gray 
flannel suit and stood in swarming lunch crowds at 3rd and Hope streets. For a 
week, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., he handed out leaflets touting Lunch With Someone 
New as "the first lunch companion service designed to help you make new 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
It's sort of the Pet Rock of dating services: low-tech, low-key, low-cost -- 
but high-concept. 
</P>
<P>
And perfect, Bagish predicts, for the '90s, when people will resist mechanized 
and impersonal in favor of small and face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
"My service pairs people for a friendly lunch -- not for love or sex. It's for 
people who are tired of the meat-market approach," Bagish says. "Most people 
who hear about it are amazed that no one thought of this until now." 
</P>
<P>
Bagish, 29, a sometime journalist, jazz musician and entrepreneur, has tried 
six jobs in the last three years -- all while waiting for the Brilliant Idea. 
And this may be it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley Rose, an attorney, likes the notion. He read Bagish's leaflet, thought 
it was "a fabulous business concept" and decided to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
Was it great? "The beauty of it," Rose says, "is that you don't expect great. 
For $15, you expect to maybe make a new friend at lunch, to have a good time. 
That's exactly what it was." 
</P>
<P>
What about romance? "If the chemistry's there, I wouldn't rule it out." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Garrison's first date didn't show up. But it didn't matter, the 
marketing assistant says, because she bumped into an old friend and they had 
lunch. At least she got out of the usual dull routine. And as she puts it, 
"There's something magical about standing there in a sea of people, waiting to 
meet someone you've never seen before." 
</P>

Garrison's second date was "hysterical," she says. "He tells me on the phone 
that he's six feet tall, mustached and has dark hair. I'm downstairs in the 
lobby, when I see this guy who matches. He's adorable. I think: 'This is it, 
Mom and Dad, worry no more.' I'm smiling, licking my lips, waiting for him to 
say hello. But he passes me by, staring at me like I'm crazy. Meantime, I see 
this other fellow outside, kind of the same description, frantically, 
fumblingly looking for the entrance. He was OK, but I liked 'Choice A' better." 
</P>
<P>
Though it was not a match made in heaven, she'd do it again, she says. So would 
Patrick Grannan, a securities fraud lawyer. His date didn't produce fireworks 
either, he says, "but it was a fun thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Bagish says he's earned about $500. But he has 50 clients lined up and 
ready to lunch, and he expects business to grow so much that he'll be able to 
sell franchises. When he sews up downtown Los Angeles, he says, he'll move to 
other steel-and-glass-canyon spots, like Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," he says. "Working people everywhere are bored with lunch."

MAGAZINES: SIFTING THROUGH THE DIRT ON GARBAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hi. Welcome to City Hall," New York City's sanitation commissioner wrote in a 
note to newly elected Mayor David Dinkins. "By the way, you have no place to 
put the trash." 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the opening anecdote in Newsweek's Nov. 27 cover story, "Buried 
Alive, the Garbage Glut: An Environmental Crisis Reaches Our Doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
But even as trucks begin to haul the million-plus copies of that news weekly 
off to sanitary landfills, the December Atlantic Monthly is arriving in 
subscribers' mailboxes with an article that takes a substantially different 
view of trash -- even though the author was a source for the Newsweek piece. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of strong-stomached students, author William L. Rathje, an 
archeologist who heads the Garbage Project at the University of Arizona in 
Tucson, has rummaged through garbage cans and excavated dumps across the 
country, weighing and evaluating their contents. 
</P>
<P>
His conclusion is that "a great deal of mythology has built up around the 
modern landfill. We have stuffed it with the contents of our imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be," he argues in the Atlantic, "that the lack of reliable information 
and the persistence of misinformation constitute the real garbage crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Rathje's article offers a surprisingly fascinating look at "the solid waste 
stream," from the Bronze Age, when the city of Troy rose 4.7 feet per century 
on layers of its own pottery shards, through relatively modern times, when 
American cities had to figure how to dispose of hundreds of thousands of dead 
horses each year. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular assumptions, the situation now is no worse than it has ever 
been, Rathje contends. And in advancing that view, he takes on other "myths" as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Plastics, for instance, aren't nearly as serious a waste problem as people 
think, he writes. Squashed flat, old bleach bottles and fast food trays don't 
take up much space, and they don't leach pollutants into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some of the stuff we toss out with a sense of righteousness, 
believing that it will promptly go back to nature through decomposition, 
clutters dumps for decades. For example, Rathje's crews have found "mummified" 
corn husks deep beneath the rubbish piles and decades-old newspapers that 
remain perfectly legible. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, plain old paper is a much bigger problem than plastic, he writes, 
pointing to the millions of tons of old phone books that lie in landfills "like 
geological strata." 
</P>
<P>
While few experts would argue with Rathje's credentials as a garbologist, many 
might find him off target in his hip-shooting analysis of broader environmental 
and cultural issues. 
</P>
<P>
His dismissal of the pollution potential of mass burn incinerators seems 
slightly cavalier, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
And one suspects he has become a bit too attached to the pretty mosaic of 
rubbish he must dig through when he dismisses as "nonsense" the 
environmentalist arguments that excessive packaging is being shoved down 
consumers' throats by a marketing mentality gone haywire. 
</P>
<P>
American consumers "as a practical matter depend on the product identification 
and convenience that modern packaging allows," he writes. But do we really 
depend on that shrink wrap over those little cardboard boxes over those plastic 
pump gizmos to get our toothpaste? 
</P>
<P>
Rathje believes that 'the biggest challenge we will face is to recognize that 
the conventional wisdom about garbage is often wrong." He pokes fun at the 
"vivid imagery relating to volume," that traditionally supplants hard figures 
in reportage of how much garbage we produce. 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek, a reliable fount of conventional wisdom, fell right into line, with 
standard-issue newsweekly statistics telling us that Americans yearly throw out 
enough trash "to spread 30 stories high over 1,000 football fields, enough to 
fill a bumper-to-bumper convoy of garbage trucks halfway to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
By picking through these two articles, however, readers will scavenge enough 
good information to make them start rethinking their disposable society. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important thing they'll learn is what Rathje's crew learned in 
interviewing Americans about their trash disposal and recycling habits. Most 
citizens sounded wonderfully community-minded in their self evaluations, but 
were pessimistic about the big picture because they believed their neighbors so 
resistant to environmental enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
By comparing people's trash with their interviews, however, Rathje found that 
"the most accurate description of the behavior of any household lies in that 
household's description of the behavior of the neighboring household." 
</P>
<P>
A Snap at Nancy, a Glimpse of Cooke 
</P>
<P>
The December Washingtonian, which contains former White House Chief of Staff 
Don Regan's pay-back review of Nancy Reagan's new book, is reportedly as 
popular this Christmas as Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
But readers relying on photocopies of the piece to find out how Nancy's 
apparent obsession with astrology virtually ruled the President will miss other 
dirt in same issue. 
</P>
<P>
In "Driving Mr. Cooke," a former chauffeur of Jack Kent Cooke, who owns the 
Washington Redskins and the Los Angeles Daily News, reveals what he says it's 
like to work for a man who firmly believes that he's a millionaire because 
almost everyone else is stupid; deems Windex and paper towels too expensive for 
washing the windows of his limos, and verbally abuses many of the people he 
gathers around him. 
</P>
<P>
The writer "got to see the advantages of power and money up close." The reader 
does, too. Also some of the possible pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Help for Devotees of Classical Music 
</P>
<P>
Highbrow music aficionados still mourning the death of radio station KFAC have 
a new magazine to guide them if they want to switch to the compact disc player. 
</P>
<P>
Classical magazine makes its debut in December, and if the 96-page premier 
issue is an indication, it should help soothe the pain folks feel about what's 
happening with classical music in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine is built around an established publication called The Stevenson 
Classical Compact Disc Guide, which catalogues "nearly every classical disc on 
the market," along with quantified ratings of those recordings, based on 
reviews in publications ranging from High Fidelity to the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
This is pure utilitarian stuff -- column after column of small type 
black-and-white print filling the back half of the publication. 
</P>
<P>
The front of the New Jersey-based magazine is devoted to longer reviews of 
discs, books, videos and stereo gadgetry; news briefs from the world of 
classical music, and a feature: in this case, an annoyingly self-conscious 
profile of the intriguing 18-year-old Japanese violin prodigy Midori.

TAPER, TOO ANNOUNCES 1990 SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New plays, a revival and a special engagement of the Taper's Improvisational 
Theatre Project (ITP) will constitute the 1990 season at the Mark Taper Forum's 
experimental Taper, Too. 
</P>
<P>
John Steppling's "The Thrill" (Jan.23-Feb.18), to be co-directed by the 
playwright and Taper associate artistic director Robert Egan, is described as 
"a story of tawdry love in a shopping mall with characters whose vulnerability 
and dreams are sometimes masked by emotional brutality." 
</P>
<P>
Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" will be revived by director Joseph Chaikin from 
March 6-April 1, while Tony Kushner's work-in-progress "Millenium Approaches," 
a play about Roy Cohn to be produced in association with San Francisco's Eureka 
Theatre (it was given a reading in the Taper's current Taper Lab '89 New Work 
Festival) will run May 8 to June 3. Oskar Eustis is the director. 
</P>
<P>
The ITP's "Robinson and Crusoe" by Nino D'Introna and Giacomo Ravicchio 
(translation by Shem Bitterman) will be staged by Peter C. Brosius April 10-21. 
This is a musical piece for children age eight and up that originated at 
Turin's Teatro Dell'Angolo and is being offered exclusively to Taper, Too 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper, Too is at 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East (under the John Anson Ford 
Theatre) in Hollywood. Subscriptions are $36 for the three adult plays and an 
additional $4 (for kids) or $8 (for adults) for the ITP production (213)

NO YAMS IN KAREN FINLEY'S 'LONG DAY'S JOURNEY' FOR THE '90S; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: 'THE THEORY OF TOTAL BLAME,' OPENING TONIGHT AT LACE, IS HER FIRST 
ATTEMPT TO SET HER IDEAS IN A FORM OTHER THAN PERFORMANCE ART. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a solo performance artist, Karen Finley had the gross-out honed to a fine 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
Other performance artists may have played with their food onstage, screeching 
ad nauseam about this and that. 
</P>
<P>
But Finley's sobbing spoken arias about sexual abuse, or her father's suicide, 
or the status of American women -- sometimes performed while she poured a can 
or two of yams down her backside -- got her a kind of attention not often seen 
in performance-art circles. 
</P>
<P>
Now Finley has moved on and is presenting her first group work, a play called 
"The Theory of Total Blame," opening tonight at LACE. 
</P>
<P>
Just slightly less rude than her solos -- the piece has little nudity and 
food-play but is as foulmouthed as the rest of her work -- "The Theory of Total 
Blame" is Finley's first attempt to set her ideas in a form that is something 
more than performance art. 
</P>
<P>
Casting herself as an alcoholic mother in a family of grown-up sons and 
daughters who have traipsed home for Thanksgiving, she presents a household of 
emotional cripples: 
</P>
<P>
* A sepulchral, possibly comatose, offstage father (played by Finley's 
real-life husband, Michael Overn). 
</P>
<P>
* A wildly delusional daughter (played by dancer-lighting designer Carol 
McDowell) and her drug-dealing husband (Tom Murrin). 
</P>
<P>
* A son who has just returned from a 10-year-long Tibetan pilgrimage (Chazz 
Dean) to avoid dealing with his father's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
* Another son (Gary Ray) who is fascinated by all things military and is 
thankful he can have sex "as long as it's with total strangers and I don't have 
to see their faces." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the story of a family that's returned to the kind of games and systems 
of behavior that they used as children and still use as adults," says the 
33-year-old Finley. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of the characters has a personal anger, a certain emotion that's never 
been touched. That's the saddest part of it. Each character's crisis reveals 
something missing, a lack." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, those who have seen Finley's solos, like her recent "Constant State 
of Desire," already know that the family is her basic dramatic battleground. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been dealing with the family so long in my solo work, it just made sense 
to bring one onstage directly," she says, explaining that her idea was to write 
"a 1990s version of 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow the fact of it being a play makes everything more accessible. People 
can hear things they can't hear or don't want to hear in a performance." 
</P>
<P>
Finley hasn't always been so user-friendly. At one New York performance of 
"Constant State of Desire" a few years ago, she came close to hitting a 
spectator in the eye with a flying piece of glass from a plate she threw on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
And raw meat, animal blood, ketchup, and Jell-O still play key roles in her 
solo work. 
</P>
<P>
But Finley now seems to be looking for something a little more substantive than 
the blatant sensationalism she has been known for. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to feel that the performance art tradition I had come from had stopped 
being shocking," she says, explaining why how she came to her notorious 
yam-show. "Lots of artists like Vito Acconci in his 'Seedbed' or Chris Burden 
had done similar things. So I was partly making fun of that tradition. People 
forget that when I poured the yams on myself, I said 'And I have a master's 
degree in art!' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Finley now seems to glow when she mentions that several people have 
brought their own parents to see her show. "My own personal life," she says, 
"is normal to the point of being boring." 
</P>
<P>
Each of her siblings -- she is the oldest of six -- is "an intense 
overachiever": a banker, broker, doctoral candidate, lawyer and poet. Her 
mother is the vice president of a finance company; her father, a salesman and a 
musician, died when she was 21. 
</P>
<P>
"Many writers have used personal experiences from their own lives. There's 
nothing wrong with it. My father did commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"But just because I talk about rape doesn't mean I've been raped too. The 
references that I make to my own life I transform; I take artistic liberties 
with in the same way other artists do. Joyce used autobiography; so do many 
comics. Look at Phyllis Diller and Fang. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think I could put out a call out to Central Casting for someone to 
play me in my own work."

'SALESMAN' STAR PHILIP BAKER HALL SUFFERS DETACHED RETINA, IMPERILING 
PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A detached retina suffered by the lead actor in the Los Angeles Theatre Center 
production of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman" put the play's run in 
possible jeopardy Wednesday as the performer, Philip Baker Hall, underwent 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Diane White, LATC's producing director, said the retinal detachment was 
discovered by Hall's physicians Tuesday night -- an evening when the play, 
which opened last month and is scheduled to run until Dec. 10, was dark. 
</P>
<P>
White said the situation could become more critical if Hall is unable to return 
for a daytime performance today or the next scheduled evening performance 
tonight. She said the company does not include an understudy for the Loman 
part. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bushnell, the center's artistic director and director of the production, 
read Hall's part of Willy Loman at a daytime performance for school children 
Wednesday morning. No Wednesday evening performance was scheduled. White said 
she was not certain at which hospital Hall's surgery was being performed. 
</P>
<P>
White said that if Hall cannot return, LATC may try to identify local actors 
who have played the role elsewhere to see if they can step in on short notice. 
White said Hall's doctors could not predict how early he might return. ALLAN

'SEX/LOVE/AIDS' MAKES STATEMENT AT NEWPORT MUSEUM; 
</P>
<P>
ART: TIM MILLER'S PERFORMANCE PIECE CHRONICLES THE IMPACT OF AIDS ON HIS ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The AIDS crisis, which has resulted in "the loss of what's increasingly looking 
like a whole generation of American artists," has helped redefine the artist's 
role in society and caused a major shift in the nation's arts community, says 
Los Angeles performance artist Tim Miller. The shift has occurred in the 
content of artworks, said Miller, who will take part in the "A Day Without Art" 
nationwide observance with a free performance of "Sex/Love/AIDS: Stories From 
Life" at the Newport Harbor Art Museum at 3 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The work, representing Miller's first performance in Orange County, is drawn 
from three autobiographical pieces from the last six years and will focus on 
his life as a gay man in the era of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"If your friends are dying, it certainly changes the theoretical underpinnings 
of your work," said Miller, a Whittier-born artist who attended school in La 
Habra through the 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 31, who became a leading figure on New York's performing-arts scene 
before returning to California 3 1/2 years ago, has since taught performance 
art at UC Irvine and is well aware of Orange County's virulent anti-gay 
faction. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly has been interesting recently, what with the Irvine election (in 
which the city voted to remove protections for homosexuals under a new human 
rights ordinance) and the NEA's treatment of work having to do with AIDS," he 
said, referring to the National Endowment for the Arts' new amendment that 
forbids "obscene" works that do not meet high standards. 
</P>
<P>
"As an artist dealing with material from my life as a gay person as well as 
political material relating to AIDS . . . I'm sort of a real ripe target," said 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller praised the Newport Harbor Art Museum for taking active part in "A 
Day Without Art." "It's a spunky, pushy museum," he said. "They take risks 
curatorially, and this fits right in with that." 
</P>
<P>
Maxine Gaiber, the museum's public relations officer, programmed Miller's 
performance. The museum is willing to risk presenting an openly gay artist amid 
the recent controversies in Orange County "because (the AIDS epidemic) is an 
important issue and no matter where we were located, we would do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS has devastated the art community and we owe it to our fallen comrades to 
participate and to give hope to the people still struggling," said Gaiber, a 
former education curator. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of contemporary art right now is being devoted to the AIDS situation. 
Also, we have a wonderful trustee that is willing to stand behind it." 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Eugene C. White, an Irvine attorney, is underwriting the museum's 
participation in "A Day Without Art." 
</P>
<P>
"A museum of contemporary art has to be on the forefront, artistically and 
culturally," said White, who supports the Costa Mesa-based AIDS Services 
Foundation. "That involves taking risks." 
</P>
<P>
Today, artists are also taking a more active role in the political or social 
realm by marching for AIDS research funding or donating sculpture for AIDS 
benefit exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
"Bianca Jagger would come to your opening and that was considered cool," Miller 
said. "Now it's cool to do what Leonard Bernstein did" when the conductor 
declined a national arts award to protest the retraction of endowment funding 
of an AIDS-related exhibit in New York. The funding was eventually restored for 
the show, but not for the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's action is "something that hasn't happened since Lena Horne refused 
to sing at a White House gala to protest the Vietnam War. Artists are realizing 
they have power, that they can use their impulses to change things or comment 
on things they don't like," said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS isn't alone in increasing artists' activism, Miller said. "Ten years of 
conservative Presidents," for instance, has contributed. But the epidemic has 
had a profound impact. 
</P>
<P>
The art world trend toward greater social awareness parallels a similar 
evolution in Miller's own work -- an evolution that will be evident in his free 
performance at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Piecing together parts from his performance pieces "Buddy Systems," "Some 
Golden States" and "Stretch Marks," all of which mix confessional monologue 
with music, slide projections and abstract movement, the work will also 
incorporate new material to link each segment. 
</P>
<P>
"It forms an interesting time line showing the different ways I've dealt with 
AIDS in my work, from the kind of late adolescent selfserious optimism of 
'Buddy Systems,' to the first brush with the reality of AIDS in 'Some Golden 
States' to a more politicized take on the subject in 'Stretch Marks.' It's like 
a journey away from a youthful romanticism and towards activism and the world 
and a more practical, hopefully more adult approach."

O.C. SCHOOLGIRL MAY NOT HAVE MEANT BABY TO DIE

A 15-year-old honors student accused of drowning her newborn baby in a school 
restroom toilet may not have knowingly killed the child, according to an 
autopsy report issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The mother was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the death of 
the baby, a full-term boy weighing 6 pounds, after she gave birth in a girls 
restroom at Santiago High School Tuesday morning, but police and prosecutors 
say it may take two weeks to decide whether to bring criminal charges against 
her. The girl is a Vietnamese-American, and her culture censures unwed mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary autopsy results confirmed that the baby was not premature and that 
drowning was the cause of death, Garden Grove Police Sgt. Kevin Raney said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no indication that she drowned it" intentionally, Raney said. "She 
delivered into the toilet. The indications are that the baby drowned in the 
toilet." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to early reports that no one knew about the girl's pregnancy, several 
classmates and a guidance counselor at the school said Wednesday that they had 
known. But they said the her baggy clothes, silence and evasive answers to the 
counselors' queries left them believing that the pregnancy was in its early 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them had tried to help her, but what they told her to do was the one 
thing she apparently could not bring herself to do: tell her parents. 
</P>
<P>
One schoolmate, a Vietnamese-American who asked not to be identified, said she 
approached a relative of the girl about six weeks ago after noticing the 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'You've got to do something, you've got to tell (her) parents,' " 
the classmate said. The relative, the classmate said, responded that "they'd be 
mad for the rest of their life." 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't tell anybody she was pregnant," said schoolmate Richard Pan, 17, 
"but most of us knew." 
</P>
<P>
When the rumors reached counselor Carolyn Rust a week before Thanksgiving, she 
called the girl, a sophomore, into her office. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't look pregnant to me," Rust said. "I thought, the way the 
conversation went, that she was newly pregnant -- a month, two months." 
</P>
<P>
Rust said she urged the girl to tell her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"She was afraid. But every kid is afraid. Her reaction wasn't any different 
from any other kid's reaction . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'You have to tell your parents,' Rust said, "and I explained all 
the reasons. Could she do it? If she couldn't do it, I said I would be happy to 
have her parents come in, or go to her home with her. . . . She never came 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The veil of silence kept adults in the dark. The girl's parents did not know 
until they were contacted by police, authorities said. The parents could not be 
reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley said prosecutors will not charge 
the girl with first-degree murder because there is no evidence of 
premeditation. But, he said, prosecutors are considering lesser homicide 
charges such as second-degree murder and manslaughter. If evidence suggests 
that the girl did not know the baby would die, Conley said, there may be no 
criminal charges at all. 
</P>
<P>
Several other female students were in the restroom at the time but did not know 
what was happening until they heard an infant's cry from behind a closed stall 
door, Raney said. 
</P>
<P>
The students ran to notify the school nurse, but by the time police and 
paramedics arrived, Raney said, the baby was dead. 
</P>
<P>
The girl had "lost a lot of blood," Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs said. 
"She could easily have died. She's not a big person in stature." 
</P>
<P>
The girl, who is in protective custody, was reported in stable condition 
Wednesday night in a guarded room in the maternity ward at UCI Medical Center 
in Orange. She was to be transferred to Orange County Juvenile Hall today and 
will remain in protective custody, Gibbs said. One of authorities' fears is 
that, should she be released to her parents, she may run away. 
</P>
<P>
Unwed mothers are considered an acute embarrassment among many Vietnamese, who 
prize virginity. 
</P>
<P>
"It is taboo in our culture to talk about sex," said Long C. Le, a 
Vietnamese-born English teacher at Fountain Valley High School nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the tradition of the culture of Vietnam, the parents 
automatically cut off all relations with the girl if they find out she is 
pregnant and not married," Le said. "They usually kick the girl out of the 
house. It's that bad." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Pan, who is also Vietnamese-American, agreed. "Usually the girl gets 
kicked out of the house or they'll make her marry the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Le said young Vietnamese-Americans are torn between the conservative sexual 
mores of Vietnam and the permissive ones of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The older Vietnamese are not changing as fast as their children are," Le said. 
"That's why we have a conflict." 
</P>
<P>
The girl completed the high school's required health education course this 
fall, Santiago Principal Bob O'Higgins said. The course covers sexuality and 
reproduction, among other topics. She also had attended Garden Grove junior 
high schools, where more basic information about sex is taught, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Vietnamese-American schoolmate, an 18-year-old senior, said Wednesday 
that she had taken the same courses and that she herself did not know much 
about birth control, would not know how to obtain it, and that she assumed that 
the young mother did not know these things either. 
</P>
<P>
"Our parents don't teach us about sex," the schoolmate said. "All they teach 
you is to be a good kid." 
</P>
<P>
The young woman said she went home Tuesday and told her mother about what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"She said: 'That's why you have to be careful with the guys.' She said, 'Don't 
make us feel ashamed.' " 
</P>
<P>
The baby's supposed father, also a Santiago High sophomore, has been 
interviewed by police, and a blood test has been taken to confirm paternity, 
Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the police investigation did not address Vietnamese cultural attitudes 
about sex, since that was not considered germane. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see a cultural issue at all," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was described as shy, studious and well-liked but as someone who had 
few close friends and who kept her troubles to herself. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just extremely shy," said Bob Crabb, one of her teachers. "She would 
barely look up -- only when spoken to." 
</P>
<P>
"She was a good kid, terrific grades, a neat kid," Rust said. "But she never 
talks. No in-depth kind of conversations. I drew everything out of her that I 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Rust and school officials said they were dismayed that they had been unable to 
prevent such a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
O'Higgins said the district has been discussing whether to adopt a peer 
counseling program, and he said the sex education program will be re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to put things in 'the appropriate' grade level," O'Higgins said, "but 
in some cases, obviously, it's never soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that sex education "is a sensitive issue in any culture," he 
said, "and we're a school of mixed cultures." 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of Santiago's 1,830 students are Latino, 30% are Vietnamese, 25% 
Anglo and 5% are members of other ethnic groups. "We have 30 languages spoken 
somewhere on campus," O'Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Higgins told the students Wednesday morning about what had happened. Students 
and teachers said that all day, no other subject was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Crabb, who had had the mother in a journalism class last year, tried to explain 
to his psychology class why reporters and television cameras were invading the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of a weird situation," he told them. "I've been your age before. 
. . . I've heard of girls getting pregnant and girls having abortions, but I've 
never heard of anything like this. 
</P>
<P>
"The most amazing thing was that she needed some help and guidance, and didn't 
get it." 
</P>
<P>
A girl in the front row responded: "I don't think she meant to do it. I think 
she was just scared." 
</P>
<P>
Police and prosecutors could remember no similar case in Orange County, 
although they said that teen-age mothers have abandoned their babies and have 
been prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"If the person leaves the child outside to die, that would be murder," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Conley said. "If a person not using good judgment leaves the child 
by a dumpster with no intent to kill, that could be a form of manslaughter or 
child endangerment."

IRVINE CO. WOULD CONSIDER RELOCATING CANYON PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
The Irvine Co. said Wednesday it would consider moving its controversial Laguna 
Laurel residential project out of Laguna Canyon, marking a possible 
breakthrough in the long-running dispute over development in the 
environmentally sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s new proposal, which calls for the project to be relocated to 
the city of Irvine if a number of conditions are met, was greeted with optimism 
by some officials who have long sought to derail the 2,000-acre residential 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, a leading opponent of Laguna Laurel, 
called the proposal a "breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited, and I think there are some real possibilities in this," Gentry 
said. "Even if this proposal itself doesn't work, it can be the basis for other 
alternatives or modifications." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of moving Laguna Laurel, however, hinges on a number of 
political and financial conditions, said Gary H. Hunt, the company's senior 
vice president. A key condition would be the willingness of the city of Irvine 
to accept 3,200 new residential units, the size of the proposed project. 
Without committing themselves to specifics, Irvine Mayor Larry Agran and City 
Manager Paul Brady Jr. both said that the city would be open-minded about 
discussing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certainly willing to consider any proposal for scaling down or relocating 
portions of Laguna Laurel as part of an overall program to save and gain open 
space for the city of Irvine, mainly Laguna Canyon," Agran said. "The real 
question is whether this can be done without inflicting a burden on Irvine 
residents." 
</P>
<P>
Brady added that "the bottom line is how valuable to all of us is the 
preservation of Laguna Canyon. If both of us (Laguna Beach and Irvine) can play 
a role in doing that, and the developer can get a return on the investment, 
maybe it's something that can work." 
</P>
<P>
But Brady cautioned that it would be "premature" to respond to the specific 
conditions laid down by the Irvine Co. in its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
As originally proposed, Laguna Laurel would be built on about 2,000 acres in an 
unincorporated area at the northern end of Laguna Canyon Road, east of the city 
of Laguna Beach off the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Although the site is not within the city limits of Laguna Beach and two-thirds 
of the acreage would be reserved as open space, Laguna Beach residents have 
claimed that the development would become an environmental curse for the 
coastal community. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been under heavy attack in recent weeks, with opponents holding 
marches and vigils outside Irvine Co. officials' homes and staging a massive 
protest march that drew more than 7,000 people up Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach residents further contended that the Laguna Laurel development 
would destroy the rustic quality of Laguna Canyon and worsen traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Before its latest proposal, the Irvine Co. had made no public suggestion that 
it would consider any site other than the acreage at the mouth of Laguna 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Wednesday, Irvine Co. vice president Hunt wrote Gentry about 
the possible "Irvine alternative" to building in Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . If the City of Irvine would seriously entertain your proposal that it 
accept the residential and commercial components of this project . . . we 
believe it is an idea worth exploring," Hunt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry confirmed that in private talks with Irvine Co. executives, Laguna Beach 
officials had proposed moving the project "farther out into the canyon" and 
possibly to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said there were four conditions necessary for the "Irvine alternative" to 
proceed: 
</P>
<P>
* That the city of Irvine, within the next 45 days, "formally agree . . . to 
the concept that it will identify and allow to be built a planned residential 
community consisting of 3,200 residential units on up to 400 acres of Irvine 
Co. land in the city limits. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
* That "the transferred project would be built on a site acceptable to us and 
not currently zoned or identified for development." 
</P>
<P>
* That the city of Irvine agree "to a processing schedule which would assure 
final project approval within 16 months. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
* That the city of Laguna Beach "would be responsible for all costs associated 
with the planning, filing and subsequent processing of the project. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said he did not know how much expense Laguna Beach would incur under 
Hunt's proposal. But he said the city would readily consider paying for some of 
the processing costs in exchange for moving Laguna Laurel out of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"The city will do what is fair and just to provide for the possibility of a 
transfer," Gentry said. "Our city is not just saying 'not in my back yard.' 
We're saying, 'let's work together to solve this problem so that everyone can 
win.' " 
</P>
<P>
Agran added that Irvine "has always been concerned about the Laguna Laurel 
project because of its adverse impact on the city as well as because of its 
devastation to Laguna Canyon. . . . I think what has happened here is that the 
city of Laguna Beach and the Irvine Co. have worked in good faith to develop at 
least the outlines of a proposal for more general consideration, and I think it 
is almost a duty on our part to give consideration to what they worked out." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that Irvine and Laguna Beach could schedule a meeting "within 
a week" to discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal was discussed in a meeting Wednesday between officials of the 
Irvine Co. and Laguna Beach, the third time that the two sides have met since 
an environmental impact report was issued in the fall. As a result of an 
earlier meeting, Irvine Co. officials offered to sell Laguna Beach about 270 
acres of the project for $38 million in return for the city's acceptance of the 
rest of the development and for the city's support of the proposed San Joaquin 
Transportation Corridor, a tollway that would cut through Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The tollway, like Laguna Laurel, has been strongly opposed by Laguna Beach 
officials because of its possible impact on the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach City Council rejected the offer and countered that it would 
purchase the acreage for $30 million if the Irvine Co. would move the project 
closer to Irvine, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine City Manager Brady said Wednesday that the mayors of Irvine and Laguna 
Beach would meet "as quickly as possible -- within days" to discuss the Irvine 
Co.'s proposal. He said the earliest that the Irvine City Council could 
consider the proposal would be at a meeting on Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to sit down with our neighbors in Laguna Beach," Brady said. "To find 
400 acres not already committed in Irvine is something we have to look at. It 
has to be a win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said he thought a key ingredient of arranging any swap with Irvine would 
involve open space. He said Irvine might consider annexing the Laguna Laurel 
project site area and then setting it aside as open space. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic decision for Irvine is to trade open space," Gentry said. "Is it of 
benefit to them to have some land in the canyon, closer to the ocean? I would 
think they would annex the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Huggins, a Laguna Canyon Conservancy member and executive director of the 
Nov. 11 anti-Laguna Laurel protest march, said Wednesday that he was 
"pleasantly impressed" by the Irvine Co.'s proposal. But he added, "I hope it 
is sincere, and not just a tactic or a delay."

O.C. JUDGE BACKED FOR U.S. BENCH; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: LEGAL COMMUNITY AND CONGRESSMEN APPLAUD SEN. PETE WILSON'S 
RECOMMENDATION OF GARY L. TAYLOR FOR FEDERAL JUDGESHIP IN SANTA ANA.

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Gary L. Taylor, the overwhelming favorite of 
the local legal community to become a federal judge in Santa Ana, was 
recommended Wednesday by Sen. Pete Wilson for the coveted lifetime post. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's selection by Wilson (R-Calif.) was celebrated by Orange County judges, 
lawyers and congressmen, who had mounted a strong campaign to see that a local 
person got the judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who has introduced legislation aimed 
at building a larger, permanent federal courthouse in Orange County, said he 
was "delighted" with Wilson's choice. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a long-standing agitation for more Orange County representation 
on the state and federal benches," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just part of the growing pains we're experiencing. Orange County has 
grown from a suburb to a major metropolitan area in a very short time. It's 
time the county is taken seriously. It's a world-class area economically, 
politically, demographically." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor emerged months ago as the leader among a group of candidates for the 
plum post of U.S. district judge. The effort to bring him to Wilson's attention 
was fueled by local bar associations, which want to increase Orange County's 
presence in state and federal courts in California. 
</P>
<P>
Many local lawyers and judges have felt that Orange County has unfairly 
languished in Los Angeles' shadow and has been slighted when judicial 
appointments have been passed out. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Malcolm, secretary of the Orange County Bar Assn., said Taylor "will 
make Sen. Wilson proud." 
</P>
<P>
"As a judge he's very patient, congenial, well-organized and highly academic," 
Malcolm said. "Personally, he's warm and upbeat at all times." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 50, of Villa Park, a third-generation Orange County resident, has 
several steps to go before he can take the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's move Wednesday was essentially a recommendation to President Bush, who 
is responsible for nominating a candidate for a judicial vacancy. Taylor must 
still endure a background check by the FBI, an evaluation by the American Bar 
Assn. and interviews by the Justice Department before Bush can nominate him. 
Then he is subject to approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee and 
confirmation by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor must also survive a tiff between the White House and Senate Republicans, 
who have objected to Bush's insistence that senators submit three candidates 
for judicial vacancies. Confirmation of several other nominees was stalled last 
week in a dispute over that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
It remained an open question whether Wilson will have to submit additional 
names for the judgeship, which pays $89,500 a year. A pay-raise package 
approved by Congress last week will increase the annual salary to $96,600 in 
February, 1990, and $124,400 in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor declined comment on his selection, saying he had been asked not to 
discuss it. But U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, a Los Angeles federal 
judge who agreed to commute to Santa Ana until a replacement was chosen, 
praised Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's splendid," Letts said. "I'm delighted it is he. I like him. I think it's 
important to appoint someone who's a known and respected name in Orange County, 
and Gary Taylor is certainly that. He's well-known and he commands respect." 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, Taylor would join U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler in 
the 22-month-old federal courthouse in Santa Ana and Letts would return to Los 
Angeles. Of the 12 federal judges chosen by Wilson for seats in the sprawling, 
seven-county judicial district that includes Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
Taylor would be only the second to come from Orange County. Stotler was the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor spent 20 years in private practice in Newport Beach, specializing in 
business litigation, before he was appointed to Superior Court by Gov. George 
Deukmejian in June, 1986. Much of his time off the bench is dedicated to 
lecturing and writing about business law, and he publishes a monthly business 
litigation newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Santa Ana High School and UCLA School of Law, Taylor describes 
himself as an enthusiastic traveler, swimmer, biker and gardener. He is an 
elder in the First Presbyterian Church of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wenke, Taylor's former law partner, praised him as the "perfect 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a beautiful person," Wenke said. "He's got just the right temperament to 
be a judge. He loves the law. He's got a great mind. It's just thrilling."

SANTA ANA BRUSHES OFF 'REMBRANDTS' 
</P>

They scrawl on lampposts and on doors, on drainage channels and on bus benches. 
They are dogged, irrepressible and armed -- with aerosol paint. 
</P>
<P>
To date this year, graffiti artists have covered an estimated 788,492 square 
feet in the city -- the equivalent of a 25-mile-long wall 6 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
With sandblasters and thousands of gallons of paint, Santa Ana wages a daily 
war against the illicit artists whose creations mark their territory, declare 
their romances, proclaim their superiority or simply give vent to artistic 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
But as fast as the city crews can work, the graffiti reappears. On Wednesday 
morning alone, the city received 36 calls in five minutes about graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more graffiti Rembrandts than there are graffiti removers," said 
Gilbert Sepeda, a supervisor for the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, for example, the department received a call from a woman on 
Glenwood Place asking if they would remove graffiti near her house. City 
workers removed it that day, said Larry Christian, maintenance manager. Three 
days later, more graffiti appeared. On Monday, the city had to repaint the wall 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the city will spend $600,000 to pay employees and a private 
contractor to sandblast and then spread about 5,000 gallons of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Some sections of Santa Ana are hit harder than other neighborhoods, especially 
those with active gangs, Christian said. There, the work ranges from mere 
scribbles to elaborate block letters to colorful renditions of cartoon 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
City inspector James M. Trujillo said some spray painters put considerable 
flair into their creations, such as the painter near Centennial Regional Park 
who flaunts his gang's name by working in English script and then bordering the 
black insignia with red paint. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some guys who do such a beautiful job that I hate to take it off," 
Trujillo said. "It makes me want to find some of these guys and hire them to 
work for the city. They're wasting their talents on spray paint." 
</P>
<P>
And then there are areas plagued by youngsters who want to emulate gangs by 
spray painting. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell they have no idea what they are doing. They spray in all the 
wrong colors," Trujillo said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has one full-time worker who removes graffiti from walls 
facing main streets, Christian said, and it plans to hire three more this year. 
It also uses a private contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, city residents pay about 15 cents a month as part of their water bills 
for this graffiti removal, Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
Although graffiti is considered a misdemeanor in the city and is punishable by 
a fine or a maximum one-year jail term, graffiti artists are persistent, Sepeda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"One time we removed some graffiti at 9:30 in the morning," he said. "Two hours 
later, the graffiti was back with even more signatures."

RAID AT DAYWORKER SITE ANGERS OFFICIALS;

<TEXT>
<P>
Immigration agents apprehended 37 illegal immigrants in separate raids near a 
dayworker pickup site Tuesday, triggering strong criticism from local officials 
who complained that the raids undermined the city's policy of encouraging the 
workers to gather there. 
</P>
<P>
Four immigration agents apprehended the men, all Mexican nationals, as part of 
a sweep through Laguna Beach and El Toro. More than a dozen of the men, who had 
congregated on Laguna Canyon Road at a pickup site sanctioned by the city, were 
taken into custody. Some of the men had tried to escape by climbing aboard a 
city bus, said Ron Rogers, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said all 37 waived their right to a hearing and agreed to be voluntarily 
deported to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
A group of men who tried to escape by climbing aboard a city bus were taken off 
the bus by agents, said Ron Rogers, a spokesman for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. Rogers said all 37 waived their right to a hearing and 
agreed to be voluntarily deported to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
City officials immediately denounced the raid, which they said took them by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other cities in Orange County that have called on INS agents to clear 
their streets of illegal aliens, Laguna Beach has gone out of its way to find a 
suitable pickup site for the workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We send these people down there and all of a sudden the INS makes a sweep," 
Police Chief Neil Purcell said Wednesday. Purcell noted that sporadic raids 
would make dayworkers scatter to spots throughout the city instead of remaining 
in one central area. 
</P>
<P>
"If the INS doesn't come back for weeks or months, it doesn't do anything 
anyway except make our problems worse down here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Just three weeks ago, the City Council agreed to spend nearly $9,000 to make 
the site safer for workers and motorists. After Tuesday's raid, officials fear 
that the dayworkers may leave Laguna Canyon Road and filter into residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the 10:30 a.m. sweep, a police officer had instructed several 
dayworkers soliciting jobs on Coast Highway to move to the site on Laguna 
Canyon Road, Purcell said. The city has discouraged the workers from gathering 
on Coast Highway because of complaints from residents. Now, officials fear, 
their credibility may be irreparably damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd been slowly making some progress, trying to build up this trust and 
rapport with the dayworkers," said Purcell. "Now when we tell them to go out 
there, they're going to say, 'No, you're just trying to get us out there so 
they can sweep us up.' " 
</P>
<P>
INS officials have no obligation to give local law enforcement agencies advance 
warning of raids. However, they do not routinely check for green cards at 
pickup sites that have been designated by the city, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe they (Laguna Beach officials) have designated a site. If they 
have, they haven't told us," Rogers said. "It's just like we tell L.A.: We're 
not going to go in there and make raids at your hiring halls, but beware, your 
employers must abide by the law" by verifying that the employee has a green 
card (work permit). 
</P>
<P>
However, Laguna Beach officials said they had a tacit agreement with the INS. 
Although agents have been in town several times, Tuesday's sweep was the first 
on Laguna Canyon Road, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disappointed because it's not a solution to this complex social 
problem," said Mayor Robert F. Gentry. "I could understand if there was a lot 
of illegal activity, but what you've got basically is a group of young men 
trying to eke out a living to support their families. I understand the charge 
of the INS, but they are disrupting what we've done." 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant-rights activists were also critical of the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the INS is feeding into very strong anti-immigrant sentiments," said 
Father Jaime Soto, Episcopal vicar for the Hispanic community for the Catholic 
Diocese of Orange County. "Whether it be in Laguna or (wherever) it is 
disruptive to the efforts of the communities who are trying to address the 
needs of their residents." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Wheeler, an attorney for the Los Angeles-based National Center for 
Immigrants Rights' Inc., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, the thing that concerns me is they (agents) are going into an area 
that has been designated by the city, who in turn is trying to remedy the 
problem with day laborers trying to secure part-time work," Wheeler said. "I 
can't help but wonder if in the end, they will really solve any problem."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 
</P>
<P>
FIREWORKS DECISION WILL GO TO VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The battle over the possible banning of fireworks continues in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to rescind an ordinance banning 
fireworks that was passed on Sept. 12. The move was prompted by a referendum 
drive mounted by a citizen's group opposed to the ban. 
</P>
<P>
The council must now decide whether to hold a special vote in March to let 
residents decide if fireworks should be banned, or hold the referendum later 
during a primary or a general election. 
</P>
<P>
A special March election would cost the city about $38,000; a June or November 
vote would cost about $13,000, said City Clerk Mary Lou Morey. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 3,734 signatures needed to qualify the referendum have been 
certified by the city clerk, they are being reviewed by the Orange County 
district attorney's office, since 11 of the petition circulators were not 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Zoellner, leader of the citizen's group against the ban, urged the 
council to place the issue on the November ballot, saying that a June vote 
would be ill-timed because it would all but cancel this year's fireworks 
fund-raising hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"The 29 organizations who have permits to sell fireworks will be in limbo," 
Zoellner said. "Let these organizations have the chance to make the money they 
need to make." 
</P>
<P>
Emmett Fennimore, a resident involved in fireworks fund-raising for more than 
25 years, also spoke out against a June vote. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I can sell fireworks if I have to wait until the June election 
to find out if I can have them at all," he said. GREG HERNANDEZ

CITY TO PAY $3 MILLION TO SETTLE CRASH SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance carriers for the city have settled a lawsuit arising from a 1986 
traffic accident by paying $2.1 million to one severely crippled motorist and 
$1 million to another who suffered brain damage, attorneys said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Both motorists had sued the city and each other in the wake of the June 14, 
1986, accident at Greenville Street and Sunflower Avenue, an intersection on 
the city's boundary with Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Orlowski, 28, of Fountain Valley can barely move his arms and legs from 
injuries he sustained after he failed to see a stop sign while headed south on 
Greenville and was struck by Ronald Sevilla, who was eastbound on Sunflower. 
</P>
<P>
Ned Reilly of Santa Ana, an attorney for Orlowski, contended in court that the 
intersection had been notoriously unsafe for years. He said the stop sign, 
which has since been replaced by a traffic signal, was blocked from view by a 
utility pole and that street lighting was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The trial began Sept. 5 in Superior Court. The jury decided about a month later 
that Orlowski was 56% at fault in the accident while the city of Santa Ana was 
44% at a fault. New proceedings to decide the damages are expected to conclude 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said he was able to win the $2.1-million settlement for Orlowski even 
though the man had pleaded no contest to drunk-driving charges arising from the 
accident. Reilly said he was able to show that while the man's blood alcohol 
level was nearly double the legal limit when tested two hours after the 
accident, he was sober at the time of the collision. Orlowski had just consumed 
the alcohol and it had not yet entered his bloodstream, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the man's severe injuries, which continue to worsen, the settlement 
represented a way to protect the city's insurance carriers from having to pay 
an even larger damage verdict in the future, said Phil Eaton, a private 
attorney representing Santa Ana on the case. 
</P>
<P>
"With the nature of the injuries to Mr. Orlowski, they would rather settle than 
run the risk of a runaway verdict," he said. He said testimony indicated that 
the crippled man's costs for care could run $87,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Love of Los Angeles, who represented Sevilla, said they were pleased 
about the verdict. CHRIS WOODYARD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANNEMEYER TO SEEK AMTRAK WASTE TANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outraged to learn that Amtrak is dumping raw sewage on tracks in his district, 
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said Wednesday that he will try to 
persuade Amtrak to install waste tanks on trains that do not have them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody minded more than a hundred years ago when it mixed with 
the buffalo waste out there on the prairie, but in urbanized America we will 
not tolerate it," Dannemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak officials said earlier this week that its "Desert Wind" train, which 
runs between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, probably dumps raw sewage in 
Orange County and elsewhere along its route. The train is equipped to discharge 
untreated sewage converted into a clear liquid whenever the train hits speeds 
of 30 to 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer said that while he expects Amtrak officials to say they don't have 
the money to add waste tanks to existing trains, he will try to find it in 
Amtrak's budget rather than seek new congressional appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said he and several other 
congressmen already are sponsoring legislation introduced by Utah lawmakers 
that would ban Amtrak's sewage dumping. Similar legislation died in committee 
last year, Cox said. "It's hard to imagine why we couldn't get legislative 
agreement in short order. . . . I didn't know that it was happening in Orange 
County. But now I have a personal interest in flushing this thing out, no pun 
intended." 
</P>
<P>
And Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who sits on the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee, said he will "pursue whatever action is necessary" to 
end the practice. 
</P>
<P>
Added Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove): "I think now that this issue has 
hit Orange County, you'll see the front five (the county's five-member 
congressional delegation) say, 'Let's do something about it.' . . . The modern 
world has caught up with the railroads." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), the fifth member of the county's Washington 
delegation, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak officials have estimated that it would cost $300 million to add holding 
tanks to its older trains. Newer railroad cars, such as those used on Amtrak's 
San Diegan trains that run through Orange County, have holding tanks that are 
pumped out at stations. 
</P>
<P>
The issue first came up locally Monday when Dana W. Reed, a member of the 
Orange County Transportation Commission, requested that the panel's staff 
investigate whether such dumping occurs here. While interested in stopping the 
practice, Reed was also seeking ways to increase pressure on Amtrak to improve 
service locally. 
</P>
<P>
Several states, including Florida and Utah, have filed lawsuits against Amtrak 
over the dumping, and the California Legislature has asked Congress to 
intervene to ban it. 
</P>
<P>
In the Florida case on Wednesday, a judge refused to grant a mistrial after 
Amtrak said all of the defense witnesses would invoke the Fifth Amendment 
protection against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Robert Perry gave the defense until this morning to find 
substitute witnesses. The defense has indicated it may rest its case without 
calling any witnesses. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

BALBOA ISLAND FERRY FARES GO UP A NICKEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning Friday, it will cost an extra nickel to ride the Balboa Island Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
Foot passengers will now be charged 25 cents, and the fee for a driver and a 
car will go up to 65 cents. Children's fares remain 10 cents, and those under 5 
ride for free. 
</P>
<P>
According to ferry officials, this is the first increase in six years and will 
help meet the high cost of operating the ferry, which includes fuel, upkeep and 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
There are also plans to eventually replace the 30-year-old ferries with new 
ones, officials said.

<P>
BIG LOTTO WINNER PICKS UP FIRST CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing near a long banner that declared his "big win," a Laguna Beach service 
station manager received his first installment from California Lottery 
officials Wednesday at the Circle K market where he bought the winning Lotto 
ticket on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The $64,000 check was the first of 20 annual payments that Edward Schwartz, 42, 
a 20-year Laguna resident, will receive toward his $1,567,250 win. 
</P>
<P>
"At first you don't believe it," Schwartz said. "It took a while to set in . . 
. You don't know what to think." 
</P>
<P>
He said he got up that October morning at 4 a.m. and went to a Chevron service 
station that he manages and checked his numbers in the newspaper. Once he 
realized that he had won, Schwartz telephoned the Lottery recording to double 
check. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me at a quarter to 6 and I could tell by his voice that he was 
probably serious," said Marlene Locke, Schwartz's longtime girlfriend. "I could 
hear his heart beating through the phone . . . I wanted to scream, I was 
euphoric." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the California Lotto games began more than two years ago, Schwartz 
said, he has spent about $50 a week on lottery tickets. Every Wednesday and 
Saturday he buys four $5 cards, fills them in with birthday and anniversary 
numbers and also buys a $5 "quick pick" card, letting the computer pick the 
numbers. Like any devout Lotto player, he keeps his numbers top secret, but it 
was a random quick pick that made him his fortune, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really thrilled for him," said Locke, an account executive for Orange 
County Magazine. Locke and Schwartz have lived in their house on a ridge above 
Laguna for 17 years. Schwartz is hard- working and deserves the money, she 
said. "Really, his only vice is the Lotto. It was his thing . . . I call him 
the Laguna Lotto Guru. Everybody's calling and asking what the magic (system) 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Schwartz was handed his check a man walked by with a handful of 
Lotto tickets. "Do me a favor and bless these," the man said to Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said he and Locke don't have any big plans for the money. "We'll 
probably buy a new couch and some new blinds for the house, nothing 
extravagant." However, Locke said they have had plans to remodel their house 
for some time and now they can do it all at once, instead of bit by bit. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Schwartz nor Locke are planning to quit their jobs right away, but 
Schwartz said he might retire in three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my job and I like the people in Laguna." Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Amin, manager of the Circle K where Schwartz buys his tickets, said the 
store's Lotto business has about doubled since the big win. "Everyone asks, 
'Who's the big winner?' " he said. "They all want to know if it was a local 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Amin said Schwartz had only $15 on the day he bought the winning ticket and 
asked Amin to pick up the other $10 so he could play all of his numbers. But 
none of the tickets Amin bought were winners. 
</P>
<P>
Locke said she never plays the Lottery, Enbut she might start. "I'm thinking 
about it," she said. "Then we can be a two-Lotto-winning family." 
</P>
<P>
Although Schwartz said he wouldn't necessarily recommend that people play 
Lotto, he did note, "If you don't play, you can't win."

City Atty. John Witt on Wednesday recommended that the City Council oppose San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric's proposed merger with Southern California Edison 
because the deal "is not in the best interests" of San Diegans. The merger 
would also have an impact on several South Orange County communities. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum circulated Wednesday, Witt suggested that the merger would 
eliminate local utility jobs, damage San Diego's civic pride and hurt the 
environment. He also maintained that the proposed merger would not produce rate 
reductions promised by the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric serves about 60,000 customers in the South Orange 
County cities of San Clemente, Dana Point, Laguna Beach and San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council, which has held five public hearings on the merger, 
is expected to take a stand for or against it during a 2 p.m. hearing today. 
Utility company representatives have claimed that San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor and council members already oppose the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at both companies Wednesday contested Witt's claim that the merger 
would hurt San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe the merger is in the best interest of the people of San 
Diego," said Karen Hutchens, SDG&amp;E's manager of governmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's wrong," said Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps, who argued that the merger 
would bring the promised rate reductions -- and that they would "far exceed" 
the negative economic effect of any SDG&amp;E job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Witt also is seeking City Council approval to start court proceedings to 
determine whether SDG&amp;E needs council approval to transfer city-granted 
franchise agreements to Edison. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities have maintained that, under state corporation law, the proposed 
merger would not constitute a transfer. However, earlier this year, Witt 
advised council members that SDG&amp;E needs permission to transfer the 
franchises to Edison. 
</P>
<P>
If the city does sue to settle the franchise question, SDG&amp;E might steer 
more than $20 million in annual franchise fees to an escrow account "until the 
matter is settled," Hutchens said. Hutchens said council members must consider 
"the risk to the city if they do (go to court) and have to make up for a $20 
million hole in their budget." 
</P>
<P>
While the franchise disagreement will likely end up in court, it could be some 
time before any legal action occurs. "It's a matter of timing," Hutchens said. 
"And the transfer issue clearly isn't ripe" for legal action, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an escrow account would "signal SDG&amp;E's intention to 
play hardball," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers 
Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. However, Shames, who has 
urged council members to oppose the merger, suggested that SDG&amp;E could risk 
alienating the public by halting the payments.

2 HOUSES ARE DAMAGED BY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wind-whipped fire Wednesday caused extensive damage to one house and moderate 
damage to another before Orange County firefighters doused the flames. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at 8:19 a.m. and caused about $130,000 damage to the house 
at 10381 Perdido St. in an unincorporated county area between Anaheim and 
Stanton, county fire spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was believed to have been caused by lint buildup in a clothes dryer. 
Resident Tom Riley discovered the fire, and he and his wife, Hilaire, managed 
to escape unharmed, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
Winds gusting up to 35 m.p.h. blew embers onto the house next door, starting a 
fire that blew out windows and charred one wall, causing about $12,000 damage, 
authorities said. It took about 25 firefighters 30 minutes to extinguish the 
blazes, Cha said.

TERMITE WAR HEATS UP IN BUENA PARK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Ebeling, author, inventor, university professor and bug assassin, 
unveiled Wednesday his latest weapon in the never-ending war against termites 
and other creatures that can burrow into wood and destroy entire houses. 
</P>
<P>
It's called Thermal Pest Eradication, and it uses heat to literally melt 
termites away. Ebeling says it's the most effective nontoxic way of killing 
drywood termites, carpenter ants and powderpost beetles. Along the way, the 
process knocks off other nuisances such as cockroaches, flies, fleas, ticks, 
spiders, moths and silverfish, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On a small, ranch-style house here, Ebeling and Isothermics Inc., the company 
which owns the licensing rights to the process, demonstrated what officials 
described as an environmentally safe anti-pest method to a group of about 50 
government representatives, pest exterminators and the owner of a termite 
infested condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Using propane heaters and tenting to raise the temperature of the house to 150 
degrees, Ebeling, a professor emeritus of entomology at UCLA, set out to cook 
more than 50 test termites. The heat melts a protective coating on a termite's 
body and breaks down internal membranes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've checked this out four times, and this thing works," said Kenneth L. 
Bourgeois, one of the pest-exterminator representatives, as the four-hour 
process began. "They're going to be crispy critters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough. At the end of the demonstration, the termites were pronounced 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Linford, president of Isothermics, proudly proclaimed that the 
process will "revolutionize the fumigation industry. . . . It's the only proven 
nontoxic method of pest extermination for complete structures." 
</P>
<P>
Other nontoxic alternatives, such as electrocution and liquid nitrogen freezing 
of insects are not as effective on entire structures, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Isothermic officials said they are hoping that the state's Structural Pest 
Control Board will certify the method as a primary extermination process. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being nontoxic, the thermal method takes about a fourth of the time of 
chemical fumigation, said Isothermics spokesman Chris Wildermuth. Of the more 
than two dozen houses in which the method has been tested, no bug 
reinfestations have occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The heat does not affect the house or furnishings, but some objects, such as 
candles and cosmetics, should be removed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The thermal method can cost between 140% and 160% more than chemical 
fumigation, said James L. Marks, a representative from Orkin pest control. He 
said for a "single residence it's cost-prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
Isothermics officials disputed that figure, saying the cost is no more than 10% 
greater than chemical fumigations. Industry experts agree that the price will 
drop as the process becomes more widely accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Berck, a member of the Seaside Village Condominium Assn., said she was 
impressed with the demonstration and would recommend the thermal pest 
eradication method to her association. Association officials are seeking a 
nontoxic method because some residents of the 286-unit condominium are allergic 
to chemicals, she said.

TOP TAILBACK LEAVES IRVINE FOR TUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shad Vickers, one of the top running backs in the South Coast League, has 
transferred from Irvine High School to Tustin. He will be eligible to compete 
on the school's track team this spring and on the football team next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers, a 5-foot-10, 170-pound junior, rushed for 787 yards and six touchdowns 
for Irvine this season after moving from wide receiver. As a sophomore, he 
caught 16 passes for 302 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers moved to running back in Irvine's final game against El Toro as a 
sophomore and rushed for 158 yards in a 27-26 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers finished third in the 330-yard low hurdles in the league finals as a 
sophomore and is expected to be among the top competitors in the event this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
"He enrolled on Monday and was in our sixth-period football class that day," 
Tustin Coach Marijon Ancich said. "I guarantee you, he's one of the fastest 
guys around." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Terry Henigan said he learned that Vickers was leaving Irvine 
before the Thanksgiving holiday, but did not speak to him before he left. 
</P>
<P>
"He's living with his grandfather, who is his legal guardian," Henigan said. "I 
wasn't surprised that he left. I wish the best for him. He's been a super 
two-year starter for us who competes as hard as anyone I've coached. 
</P>
<P>
"You never like to lose a player like Shad. He's a tough kid who plays hard."

<P>
TENNIS: LAGUNA HILLS' TOP SINGLES PLAYER ALSO EXCELS IN THE CLASSROOM.

LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jenny Marques, No. 1 tennis player at Laguna Hills High School, is worried. 
</P>
<P>
After missing most of the preseason with stress fractures in both legs, she was 
undefeated in Pacific Coast League play and carries her 30-3 record into 
today's Southern Section round-of-16 match against Jennifer Wall of Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
But Marques has never made it past the Southern Section preliminaries, and her 
legs have been hurting of late. At last weekend's National Indoor Championship 
in Overland Park, Kan., Marques lost in the round of 32 of the girls' 
18-and-under division and withdrew from the consolation matches. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding her concerns is the application deadline for schools in the 
University of California system, which is today. Initially, Marques was mainly 
interested in out-of-state colleges. But after talking to coaches from 
California and UC Irvine during the past weekend, she changed her mind and set 
out to write an application essay -- Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm doing anymore," Marques said. "I'm so confused. If I can 
just get this essay finished tonight, get it all set and find my SAT scores . . 
. this has just been a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go somewhere where I am challenged, not only from outside 
competition, but every day by my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Marques said the deadlines and pressure of aptitude testing has taken its toll. 
"I was talking to a girl at the nationals and she said she got a 680 on the 
SAT," Marques said. "I said, 'Oh that's so good, on what section?' and she said 
she meant the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"She thought she was going to get a full ride to Pepperdine. I couldn't help it 
-- I just looked at her and said, 'Are you serious?' " 
</P>
<P>
Grades, however, have not posed a problem for Marques, who has taken advanced 
placement English and history for three years, and ended her junior year with a 
combined 4.06 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Since she plans to major in pre-law and attend college on a tennis scholarship, 
Marques has known for several years that she would need to excel in the 
classroom as well as on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Marques has been the Hawks' top player since her freshman year, when she had a 
63-5 record and helped the Hawks to a 19-1 record. As a sophomore, she was 
undefeated (60-0) and led Laguna Hills to the Southern Section 3-A 
championships, where the Hawks lost in the final to San Marino. Last season, 
she posted a 54-0 record, and Laguna Hills, which has been league champion for 
five consecutive years, lost in the Southern Section semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hodges, who coached at Laguna Hills until this year when he left for the 
baseball coaching job at Saddleback Community College, says Marques thirsts for 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"Jenny is very serious about what she does," he said. "She's very committed to 
improving her game, and yet sees the other side of what's important, and that's 
to enjoy her high school years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, when you're that talented, tennis can get in the way of other good 
things. But Jenny has a great ability to seemingly balance the two." 
</P>
<P>
Besides honing her tennis skills, Marques tries to fit in as many outside 
activities as possible. 
</P>
<P>
She is active in the drama club. Last year, she played the leading role of 
Emily in the class production of Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." She is a peer 
adviser for the senior class, a member of Students Against Drunk Driving and 
participates on the mock trial team that competes against other Orange County 
schools twice a week. She also is active in the California Scholarship 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy doing all the other things," Marques said. "Tennis is enough to keep 
me busy. Sometimes it gets overwhelming, but I'm in mock trial because of my 
interest in law, I enjoy acting, and the others are so I can get that seal -- 
graduate at the top of my class."

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOKMAY SCORING POINTS WITH COACH, NOT FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Listening to Don May talk about his abilities as a basketball player is, for 
the first 15 or 20 minutes or so, a humorous experience, something from the 
Woody Allen school of ego slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the worst athlete on the team," said May, a 6-foot-8 backup center at UC 
Irvine. "There's not even a doubt about that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If I wasn't tall, there's no way anyone would have me playing basketball. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"You could find 40 people at this school who are better basketball players than 
me. Really. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
As May says these things -- in a matter-of-fact, almost apologetic manner -- 
you initially chuckle, as he does, but then you start to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Is this just a 19-year-old kid with a severe case of self-doubt? Or is May 
really as bad as he says? 
</P>
<P>
And, if the latter is true, what's he doing playing for Irvine anyway? 
</P>
<P>
It's a question often asked -- by Irvine boosters among others -- of Anteater 
Coach Bill Mulligan. But Mulligan defends May on all accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Rod Palmer, the team's workaholic, May has the Anteaters' most 
inspirational work ethic. Or at least Mulligan hopes it proves inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
"If our two redshirt freshmen (Rick Swanwick and Jeff Von Lutzow) had his work 
ethic, they could be tremendous," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan also says May always does what is asked of him -- a popular attribute 
of any coach. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys follow their game plan," Mulligan said. "He follows our game 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night against Stanford, May's game plan was to help guard Adam Keefe, 
the much-heralded 6-9 sophomore forward and former all-everything at Woodbridge 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Although Keefe scored 20 points -- 14 in the second half -- in the 70-57 
Stanford victory, May managed two steals, once stripping the ball from Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to play hard," May said. "Adam Keefe is strong and smart. 
That's a tough combination to deal with. I tried as hard as I could, what more 
can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan points to one more thing -- May is a fine student. 
</P>
<P>
May, a Big West Conference scholar-athlete who has a 3.3 cumulative grade-point 
average, will receive his undergraduate degree in economics in June, after 
three years in college. 
</P>
<P>
Next fall, May will begin work toward a master's in business administration, no 
doubt completing it before his athletic eligibility runs out after the 1991 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, May's performance in the classroom is not important to May's 
courtside critics, of which, he says, there are many. Monday when Mulligan gave 
May the signal to enter the game, several people sitting behind the Irvine 
bench booed. 
</P>
<P>
"I got booed last year, but it was the mocking, cheering kind," May said. 
"Actually, it was fun. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But now? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, after the game (Monday) night, Coach (Mulligan) had a lot of people 
approach him and ask why he plays me," May said. "It kind of bores me. I'm sick 
of all these people who think they're coaches. I mean, don't boo me. It's Coach 
Mulligan's fault that he couldn't recruit a player better than me. Boo him, not 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan recruited May, on a recommendation of a friend, out of Amos Alonzo 
Stagg High School in Palos Hills, Ill., a suburb of Chicago. May, whom Mulligan 
considered a long-term project, was redshirted his freshman year in 1987. But 
last year, he received some playing time, a total of 89 minutes -- "garbage 
time," May said -- in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Although May's 1988 statistics were anything but spectacular -- he took only 
six shots from the field, scoring on three, and had a season-high of three 
points against Utah State -- he earned the highest mark on the team Saturday in 
the season opener against the University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
That mark came not on points -- he scored only one -- but on Mulligan's overall 
plus-minus system of grading, one that considers the finer intricacies of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"He busts his tail," Mulligan said. "Sure, he has some physical limitations. He 
has to get stronger and stay in the weight room. But he's smart. Right now he 
plays on intelligence and hard work. I think by next year, he'll be a very good 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Olson, Irvine's sports information director, said: "He's a late bloomer, 
that's what he is. He's not like a geeky-looking guy. He's got a good build. If 
he keeps working in the weight room, next year he should be a lot stronger. And 
he has a killer instinct." 
</P>
<P>
When May is told of these remarks, he grins and grimaces. On one hand, he seems 
to enjoy putting down his abilities -- perhaps to soften the blow of others' 
criticism -- but a moment later, he is vehemently defending the amount of 
playing time he receives. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are some people on this team who think they can play ahead of 
me," he said. "I don't have a problem with that at all. I like playing. A lot. 
And I'm fighting for every minute I can get." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what he thinks of his own abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his work ethic, May adds another dimension to the Anteaters: a sense 
of humor. Last year, he was a leader of the Anteaters' bench antics. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the antics, he says, were based on superstitions, so carrying them out 
successfully were imperative for victory. Well, at least that was the idea. 
</P>
<P>
They included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Choosing one player to touch Mulligan's head during each timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trying to push assistant coach Mike Hess over and on top of Mulligan during 
timeout huddles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, during Irvine free throws, a player was to rub the head of the player 
to his right, shake a towel with his left hand, and if the free throw was made, 
everyone threw their towels as high as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked," May said. "We shot 80% (from the foul line)." 
</P>
<P>
May said this season the antics have stopped. "I sit too close to Coach now," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The result? In two games, the Anteaters are 0-2 and have made less than 55% of 
their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although the Stanford game was not a good one for Irvine's basketball team, 
halftime was happy time for the water polo team. It was honored with a special 
presentation because of its victory at the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championships Sunday at Indianapolis. Led by Dan Smoot's five goals, Irvine won 
the national championship -- its third overall -- with a 9-8 overtime victory 
over two-time defending champion California, which entered the tournament as 
the top-ranked team. In the final season poll this week, Irvine, which finished 
27-6 overall, was named the nation's top-ranked team. . . . Also honored at 
halftime were Brigid Stirling and Buffy Rabbitt, who gained All-American honors 
at the NCAA cross-country championships two weeks ago. As a season-capper, 
Stirling and Rabbitt competed at The Athletic Congress national championships 
last Saturday, finishing 25th and 26th, respectively.

WITH VETERAN LINEUPS ALL AROUND, SUNSET RACE SHOULD BE TIGHT AGAIN

Last season, Huntington Beach, Ocean View and Edison high schools tied for 
first place in the Sunset League basketball race. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Sunset League basketball fans, get ready to kiss your sister again 
because the race doesn't figure to be too much different this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Any of five teams can finish in the top three," Marina Coach Steve Popovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Popovich says the league has more returning players than ever 
before. Edison, Marina, Ocean View and Westminster each has three starters 
back. 
</P>
<P>
With all the parity, successful teams will have to stay healthy and be 
consistent, Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be like the ACC or the Big East where every night is a major 
game," Harris said. "If you're not ready to play, or you have a guy hurt, or 
you have health problems, or just an off night . . . It's going to be very 
interesting. You have to be up twice a week, for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Marina and Edison have the edge on paper. Marina, with the state's best big man 
-- 6-11 junior center Cherokee Parks -- is a league front runner. So is Edison, 
which has the height to contend with Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers can go 6-10, 6-5 and 6-4 across the front line. The big man is 
senior Bill Martineau, who averaged 12.8 points and 7.6 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
Don't count out Huntington Beach. With four starters gone, who should drop into 
Coach Roy Miller's lap but transfer student Mustapha Abdi, a 6-4 forward. Abdi 
averaged 17.7 points for Savanna last season, but increased that to more than 
30 points in Savanna's two playoff games. He was the only sophomore to make the 
Times' all-county basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
He teams with senior Stephen Lucas (6-7) to give the Oilers height and power up 
front. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View has the league's best guard in 6-2 1/2 Greg Evans, who has signed 
with Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley figured to have experience at both guard spots. But new coach 
Gordon Billingsley will be without guard Doug Weaver for the entire season. 
Weaver, one of the county's best football receivers, had knee surgery two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Mike Merli (6-4), who led the Barons last year with 16.4 points a game 
and 7.3 rebounds, returns for his senior season, along with guard Derek 
Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
EDISON -- If you want to find Edison this year, look above the rim. The 
Chargers have exceptional height and experience at all positions. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be the best team I've had at Edison," said Coach Jon Borchert, who 
is starting his seventh season at Edison. His team will be strong on the 
boards, but it remains to be seen how well the players will work together, 
Borchert said. 
</P>
<P>
Martineau and 5-11 guard Tom Tyler, all-league selections last season, are 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Martineau, a force inside, has developed some moves but has been bothered by 
back trouble. "He is one of those kids who has just steadily improved through 
high school," Popovich said. "If he can solve his injury problems, he is a real 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Thobe, a 6-5 forward who averaged more than six points and six rebounds 
last season, is the third returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
Borchert says Brandon Jessie, a 6-4, 200-pound sophomore forward, has the 
potential to be an all-county player. Dan Lovelady (6.8 points), a 6-2 senior 
guard, and Todd Smyser, a 6-3 junior, are returning lettermen. 
</P>
<P>
FOUNTAIN VALLEY -- The Barons have some size but not much experience or depth. 
Merli and Corcoran will form the team's nucleus. There are no other returning 
lettermen. Merli, a senior forward, averaged 16.4 points and 7.3 rebounds last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the varsity are forwards Erik Zellmer and Kevin Volpe, and 6-5 center 
Adam Ziebarth. Team strengths are speed and perimeter shooting. Billingsley, 
who spent 11 years as a varsity assistant at Fountain Valley, replaces Dave 
Brown, now the athletic director and boys' basketball coach at Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH -- The league's surprise team last season, Huntington Beach 
will be in contention again because the Oilers have two of the strongest 
forwards in the county -- Abdi and 6-4 senior Stephen Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who averaged 11 points and seven rebounds last season, is the team's 
only returning letterman. Still, Coach Miller is confident he can go nine deep. 
</P>
<P>
"Last season we played a power game and relied heavily on inside play," Miller 
said. "This year will require more motion in the offense and we should have 
more consistent shooting from outside." 
</P>
<P>
MARINA -- Last year, Parks was a hub with few spokes, but this season Marina 
has some experienced players to complement him. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Boyd, who transferred from Mater Dei and was eligible for the last three 
games, returns for his senior season. A good shooter, Boyd (6-0) will provide 
leadership as a point guard, Popovich said. Starters Darren Fields (6-3) and 
Thi Nguyen (5-10) also return, along with lettermen Sean Haselrig (6-2), Brant 
Shelor (6-5) and Tuan Nguyen (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings are quick, can use big and small lineups and are counting on the 
experience gained from last season's tough schedule. 
</P>
<P>
OCEAN VIEW -- The team's scoring powers, guard Mike Frohn and Times' all-county 
center Todd Norman, have graduated from a 19-9 squad. Their supporting cast 
returns, however. Point guard Evans should improve upon last season's 10.6 
scoring average. Starters Darren Ernst (6-6) and Jim Gwaltney (6-4 1/2) also 
are back. Together with junior letterman Marcel TenBerge (6-7 1/2), they give 
the Seahawks some size up front. But don't mistake TenBerge for Norman. His 
game is still developing. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries have hampered the Seahawks so far. "We haven't had a day where all 11 
guys were healthy -- ankles, broken noses, flu, walking pneumonia," Harris 
said. "I hope it's not characteristic of the team. I hope we get it out of the 
way early." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harris III, the coach's son, was one of the team's top eight players, but 
he broke his foot in a scrimmage this week and will miss at least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
WESTMINSTER -- What kind of squad will the Lions' have this season? 
</P>
<P>
First clue: The five projected starters are all three-point shooters. Second 
clue: only one of them is taller than 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster is going to have trouble improving on last season's last-place 
league finish. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Coach Dick Katz is confident in his team's shooting ability and 
thinks his squad could be a spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Mitch Okur (5-5) and Mike Murphy (6-0) and center Eric Wilkins (6-3) 
return. Of the three, Okur was the leading scorer with a 7.6-point average. 
Katz is expecting strong contributions from seniors Dave Rall (6-1) and Eden 
Yawata (5-9).

Holmes &amp; Narver Services Inc. announced that it has been awarded contracts 
in Egypt and Saudi Arabia worth a total $137 million. 
</P>
<P>
The largest of the new contracts is a $66-million, three-year renewal of an 
existing contract for maintenance and operation of a large power plant and 
water desalination facility in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes &amp; Narver Services also won a four-year, $43.5-million extension of 
its contract for logistical support of the Egyptian Sinai bases and outposts of 
the Multinational Force and Observers -- the peacekeeping force established in 
the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Under that agreement, the company and its joint operating partner, CARE 
Services of Cairo, operate and maintain living quarters, community facilities, 
communications equipment and roads at two large base camps and 24 observation 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
The third contract, also granted jointly to Holmes &amp; Narver Services and 
CARE Services, is a $28-million agreement for maintenance of aircraft and 
aircraft weapons systems supplied to Egypt by the U.S. Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The pact, which also calls for Holmes &amp; Narver to train Egyptian personnel 
to maintain the equipment, is for three years with options for two successive 
one-year renewals. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes &amp; Narver Services is a subsidiary of Holmes &amp; Narver Inc., a 
major engineering, design and construction project management firm.

3 GROUPS URGE BUSH TO DISMISS THRIFT OFFICIAL

Three public interest groups Wednesday called for the resignation of M. Danny 
Wall, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that President Bush had 
no immediate plans to oust the embattled chairman of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The National Taxpayers Union, Public Citizen, and Citizens Against Government 
joined the chorus of groups and individuals seeking Wall's resignation because 
of his role in the failure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. The three 
nonprofit organizations sent a letter to Bush urging him to oust Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Wall may have cost citizens of this country more than any other political 
appointee in history," James Davidson, chairman of the National Taxpayers 
Union, said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who previously headed the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is under fire for 
not acting on a recommendation by regional regulators to seize Lincoln in 1987. 
The government did not take control of the thrift until last April, and critics 
contend that the delay greatly increased the eventual cost to taxpayers. The 
failure could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press briefing if the White House planned to fire Wall, Fitzwater 
replied: "No, there's been no consideration of Mr. Wall's tenure. He's serving 
on the (OTS) board, and there's been no change." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater did not elaborate on the statement. Nor did he mention earlier 
comments by Bush, who indicated in a recent interview that he would ask Wall to 
resign if it were determined that a lack of aggressive action by regulators 
contributed to the nationwide thrift crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Wall's agency, however, said studies showed that it had saved taxpayers between 
$6 billion and $8 billion last year by selling failed thrifts rather than 
liquidating them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to know the findings of independent research support our contention 
that the record number of cases we resolved in 1988 will mean substantial 
reductions in losses and ultimately savings to the taxpayers," Wall said in a 
statement.

Yes, They May: May Co. has announced plans to open a three-level 
150,000-square-foot department store at MainPlace/Santa Ana by spring, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The store -- which will be the fourth anchor for the Santa Ana mall -- will not 
be a replacement for the 140,000-square-foot May Co. store at the City mall in 
nearby Orange. "At this time, we plan to keep (that) May Co. open," said Ed 
Mangiafico, chairman of the May Co. Southern California division. 
</P>
<P>
MainPlace will also be adding between 20 and 30 smaller retail shops, for a 
total of about 35,000 square feet.

POP BEAT: T.S.O.L. REUNION THREATENS TO DIVIDE; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERT: FOUNDING BASSIST MIKE ROCHE IS AT CENTER OF STORM GATHERING AROUND THE 
SHOW FEATURING ORIGINAL MEMBERS. TWO CURRENT GROUP MEMBERS OBJECT. 
</P>

<P>
One night of punk-rock nostalgia is threatening to splinter T.S.O.L. just when 
the band's future as a hard-rock contender seems most promising. 
</P>
<P>
Founding bassist Mike Roche once said that performing on stage with T.S.O.L. in 
its tumultuous early days was like standing in the eye of a hurricane. Now 
Roche is at the center of a storm that is gathering around a Dec. 29 reunion 
show at the Celebrity Theatre in which he and the three other original members 
of T.S.O.L. will play together for the first time since 1983. That show has 
created a crisis between Roche and two other current members of T.S.O.L., who 
object to the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
Roche, 28, is the only link between the punk band that emerged from Huntington 
Beach and Long Beach in the early '80s and the current T.S.O.L. (True Sounds of 
Liberty), which since 1984 has been honing a brand of hard rock influenced less 
by punk than by blues and heavy metal. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Roche said in a recent interview, he had turned down 
lucrative offers to re-form the original T.S.O.L. because his focus was 
strictly on the current band. But strife between Roche and his current band 
mates, singer Joe Wood and drummer Mitch Dean, boiled over in a bitter argument 
that aborted a national tour during mid-October. Roche said the loss of tour 
income prompted him to accept a promoter's standing offer to reunite the 
original T.S.O.L. lineup for one night (the other original members are singer 
Jack Grisham, guitarist Ron Emory and drummer Todd Barnes). 
</P>
<P>
Now, with Wood and Dean opposing Roche's decision to play the reunion, the 
nostalgia show stands as a barrier to reconciliation within the current 
T.S.O.L. While this turmoil goes on, a strong new T.S.O.L. album, 
"Strangelove," sits ready for release by Enigma Records in February. The 
question now is whether the reunion show and the underlying internal problems 
it has brought to a head will touch off the second major shake-up in T.S.O.L.'s 
10-year history, just as the band approaches its best opportunity yet to leap 
from cult status into the commercial mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Roche said that money -- and, in part, revenge -- was his first motive for 
agreeing to reunite with the other original members of T.S.O.L. He said he was 
left in a financial lurch when Dean and Wood, after only two shows, flew home 
from a national tour following a "vicious" argument in Berkeley. Besides 
counting on the money from touring, Roche said, he had been relying on the 
cross-country trip as a way to stay clear of drugs -- a personal problem that 
he acknowledges has been a source of T.S.O.L.'s internal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"That tour was desperately important to me," Roche said, and without it, he 
seized upon a reunion of the original T.S.O.L. as his quickest way to raise 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Roche said, he has come to believe that playing the reunion 
actually could be financially harmful to him if it costs him his place in the 
current T.S.O.L. "There's no way this show is going to earn me near the amount 
of money I can make in my band (the current T.S.O.L.) And there is no way I can 
get the satisfaction my band (gives). Not to mention the future. 
("Strangelove") is the bomb. It's got hits on it. It's the best we've ever 
done. This is the blockbuster for us, if there's ever going to be one. This is 
so untimely for me. It's almost suicide." 
</P>
<P>
But Roche said he will go through with the reunion, costly as that could prove 
to be for his long-term interests. For one thing, he said, the show at decade's 
end will give the original T.S.O.L. the big send-off it never had when it broke 
up acrimoniously in 1983 (Grisham and Barnes left the band then and were 
replaced by Wood and Dean). Roche said there is "poetic justice" in playing a 
show at the end of the '80s with the band members who launched T.S.O.L. as 
teen-aged punk rockers back when the decade began. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Roche said, far from doing any harm, a one-night reunion can only 
heighten interest in the current T.S.O.L. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm completely in my right to do the show. It's a (matter of) 
principle now. Is my existence in the new T.S.O.L. so fleeting and futile that 
doing or not doing this show can make or break the band? If they're adamant 
about leaving me out and moving on, if that's where our friendship is, I don't 
care to play with them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews, Wood and Roche both expressed a mixture of anger over the 
past and hope that they still can find their way to a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"If he does the (reunion) show, it doesn't necessarily mean he won't be in the 
band," Wood said. "I would rather have him with us." Still, Wood said, Roche's 
involvement in the reunion would pose a stumbling block to reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
What bothers Wood and Dean more than the reunion itself, Wood said, is that 
Roche scheduled it without consulting them, then decided to go ahead with it 
despite their objections. The reunion issue, Wood said, has become the focus 
for other underlying strains within T.S.O.L. -- with drug abuse the key problem 
to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said that he was deeply involved in hard drugs until he quit two years 
ago. "Every day, I'm a phone call away from going out and screwing up my life," 
he said. "I can't be around the drugs any more, for my own health and my own 
career." Roche and Dean both said in recent interviews that the collapse of 
T.S.O.L.'s tour in mid-October increased their resolve to overcome substance 
abuse problems, and that they have stayed away from drugs since then. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do anything to make this band work," Roche said -- except cancel the 
original T.S.O.L.'s reunion. "I'll be ready to play, ready to work and tour -- 
and I'll be clean. If that's not good enough, I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zoto, manager of the current T.S.O.L., said Tuesday that he has been 
staying in phone contact with Roche, Dean and Wood in hopes of mending the 
rift. An attempt is being made to draw up a new, written partnership agreement 
that would form the basis for the three members continuing as a band, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if this (reunion) show is a nail in the coffin, but it doesn't 
help matters," Zoto said. "The show is one of a series of a year's worth of 
stuff that has built up and is boiling over the pot right now. Not doing the 
show might put the lid on the pot." 
</P>
<P>
Dean and Wood, meanwhile, were planning to play a T.S.O.L. show of their own at 
the Green Door in Montclair on the same night that Roche is scheduled to play 
with the original T.S.O.L. Wood said that an alternate bassist will fill in for 
Roche. "It's a chance to give Mike the opportunity to see that the band will 
play" with or without him, Wood said. "It's not permanent or anything, but we 
will do it." 
</P>
<P>
However, Patrick Bacich, booking agent for the Green Door, said Tuesday that he 
is canceling the club's T.S.O.L. show. "I wasn't aware the other (original) 
T.S.O.L. was playing the same night," he said. "I don't think it's practical. 
Even current T.S.O.L. fans would probably go to the other show because it's 
going to be a once-in-a-blue-moon thing. I have a feeling this date was booked 
to spite the original T.S.O.L. I don't want to be any part of that. That's 
getting into some weird territory." 
</P>
<P>
Turning from T.S.O.L. infighting to T.S.O.L. music-making, a tape of 
"Strangelove" that Roche played during an interview at his Long Beach apartment 
backed up the members' conviction that it is not only T.S.O.L.'s best album, 
but a potential hit. 
</P>
<P>
The songs are highly melodic and observe contemporary hard-rock conventions, 
which bodes well for commercial acceptance. But the performances preserve, and 
even intensify, the realism and gritty immediacy that has been T.S.O.L.'s 
hallmark. Guitarist Marshall Rohner's playing is magnificent -- fiery and free 
from heavy metal's whining, squiggly lined guitar cliches. Wood, whose bluesy 
growl was limited in the past, has taken a quantum leap as a vocalist and is 
now a striking singer who brings a much-expanded range to bear along with the 
emotional intensity that he always has possessed. 
</P>
<P>
If T.S.O.L.'s members need any extra incentive to reach their goal of emerging 
from the band's crisis intact, reconciled and drug-free, the reason is in their 
own record's grooves.

CHINESE BOOKS DONATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Lions Club International in Taipei, Taiwan, have donated about 
700 Chinese books to the South Pasadena Library. 
</P>
<P>
"The books have been circulating like crazy," children's librarian Maida Wong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-American Club of South Pasadena helped to arrange the donation, 
according to Lisa Yang, one of the club's directors. The Lions gave the 
Chinese-American Club about 2,000 books, and the group donated some of the 
fiction, nonfiction and children's books to the library. The remaining 1,300 
books, she said, will probably be used by the club's Chinese language school in 
South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the gift, the library on Nov. 18 held a demonstration of Chinese 
brush painting and an exhibition of Chinese paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Taipei Lions donated 10,000 Chinese books to the Monterey Park 
library, resulting in a controversy over whether the public library's 
foreign-language collection would overshadow the English-language books. In the 
case of South Pasadena, Yang said, the community and library were pleased to 
receive the books.

COMPARING CALIFORNIA STUDENT FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Education for the first time last spring tested the 
physical fitness of fifth-, seventh- and ninth-graders. State Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig said the scores for the nearly 800,000 students surveyed 
confirmed experts' hunches that most California children are woefully out of 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
The physical education tests are the newest addition to the California 
Assessment Program, which annually evaluates the state's students in academic 
areas. As with the academic exams, results of the physical education survey are 
intended to provide a way to assess schoolwide performance; individual scores 
are not released. 
</P>
<P>
The test was developed by the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, 
Recreation and Dance. There were four mandatory exercises: sit and reach, 
sit-ups, pullups and mile run. A fifth test, of body composition, was voluntary 
and not all students participated. The results were compared against a minimum 
fitness standard for each grade level. Listed below are average percentages of 
students in each grade level who met the standard in four or more areas, three 
areas, two areas, one area and none. 
</P>
<P>
Not all schools in California participated in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Here are state averages:

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign Aid 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 310 to 107, the House passed a bill (HR 3743) appropriating $14.8 
billion in U.S. foreign aid in fiscal 1990, $4.7 billion in military 
assistance, $3.2 billion in economic aid and nearly $7 billion for other 
programs designed to further U.S. policies around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
The bill had been stripped of provisions that caused President Bush to veto an 
earlier version of it. For example, it no longer earmarked $15 million for a 
U.N. population-control fund, said by critics to finance forced abortions and 
sterilizations in China. It retained a ban on foreign aid being used to induce 
recipient countries and persons to carry out illegal activities to further U. 
S. policies abroad. But this response to the Iran-Contra scandal had been 
softened enough to satisfy Bush's complaint that it infringed on a president's 
authority to conduct foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.) said the bill "reflects the priorities of 
the Bush Administration in providing assistance to our allies." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jim Moody (D-Wis.) criticized Bush for blocking aid to U.N. 
population-control programs, saying that the President was playing "a symbolic 
game of vetoing money that does not, in fact, go for any abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

El Salvador 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 194 to 215, the House refused to consider an amendment withholding 
aid to El Salvador because of the murders there of six Jesuit priests, their 
housekeeper and her daughter in mid-November. Some backers of the amendment 
blamed the massacre on "death squad" activities that were unchecked by the 
rightist government of Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani. But they 
acknowledged that they could not prove their accusation. 
</P>
<P>
This vote occurred during debate on HR 3743 (above). The amendment sought to 
delay until next April the release of 30% of $85 million in military aid 
earmarked for El Salvador in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) said the Salvadoran government must understand 
"that events like last week's barbaric killings will put U. S. military aid in 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bud Shuster (R-Pa.) said, "There is absolutely no credible information 
to indicate who perpetrated these dastardly deeds of murdering these priests." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the House to consider the amendment withholding 
military aid to El Salvador.

Catastrophic Care Repeal 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 55 to 346, the House refused to salvage a new law designed to 
ensure Medicare participants against potentially ruinous doctor and hospital 
bills, and other runaway medical costs. The Senate, by non-record vote, went 
along with the House decision to scrap the catastrophic care program, which was 
considered landmark legislation when enacted last year. 
</P>
<P>
The program fell out of favor on Capitol Hill after the Medicare beneficiaries 
who were to pay for it objected to the cost. It was financed by higher premiums 
and an income-tax surcharge paid by those with enough means to owe taxes. The 
repeal bill (HR 3607) was sent to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting no wanted to repeal the 1988 Catastrophic Coverage Act.

RELAXED DANA POINT THRONG RAISES $200,000 FOR INTERVAL HOUSE 
</P>

It was as unpretentious as it gets at $150 a pop at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there were a few ball gowns that cost as much as condos. And yes, a 
couple of floor-length furs swooshed around the auction tables, competing for 
light with this or that outsize gem. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly the crowd at the Interval House's 10th annual auction ball was toned 
down, relaxed, festive. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of ourselves as a family," said Mary Walton, executive 
director of Interval House, a crisis shelter for victims of domestic violence, 
serving women and children from Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, that extended family numbered 420 people. Guests arrived 
early for a champagne reception and silent-auction bidding. On display near the 
check-in desks were architectural renderings of a proposed new facility for the 
shelter -- an expansion project begun with some of the benefit's proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Armstrong, chairman of the capital campaign drive, estimated the total cost 
of construction at $2 million. "We're just getting started (with the drive) 
tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also hovering near the drawings was Michael Woodley, an architect with Kaufman 
&amp; Broad, the firm that donated the shelter plans and has worked extensively 
with Interval House to upgrade its facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We really like this group, and obviously this is a very worthy cause," said 
Woodley as Walton linked arms with him and smiled. "This is just another stage 
of involvement for us." 
</P>
<P>
That very worthy cause was up about $200,000 after the ball, according to 
Cynthia Courtney, event co-chairwoman, along with Walton, Carol Anne Williams 
and Isa Smashey Rogers. Courtney said about $150,000 of the proceeds will be 
used for operating costs, with the remaining $50,000 going to the building 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Interval House has temporarily housed about 3,000 women and children since it 
was founded in 1980. When the new facility is completed, the shelter will have 
56 beds, according to Adele Faulkner Quinn, a board member and facilities 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn and others mentioned several prestigious awards the shelter received in 
the last year as confirmation of their work -- and a boon to fund raising. 
Among the honors Interval House received as it rounded the corner on its first 
decade: a Department of Justice award for outstanding volunteer legal aid 
programs, a governor's award for outstanding work with victims of crime and a 
Disneyland community service award. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels really good to get those kinds of awards because it says that (we're) 
a solid, legitimate group . . . doing a job that needs to be done," Walton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, dinner was followed by testimonials from women who 
have "graduated" from Interval House, a live auction, then dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The event was dubbed "Le Bal du Bicentenaire" and touted as an "official French 
Bicentennial celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were the consul general of France, Gerard Coste, and his wife, 
Naomi; former California governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, and actors Beverly 
Garland and John Schuck. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending: Harlene and Michael Goodrich, Charlene Robinson, Patsy Lopez 
and David Neill, and Tak and Karen Toda (she in a 70-year-old kimono).

DEBUTANTES CELEBRATE AT DANA POINT, IRVINE BASHES

Coming out, Newport style: 
</P>
<P>
It was a big weekend for coastal debs, beginning with a Friday night bash at 
the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point for 23 Newport Harbor area debutantes. 
</P>
<P>
Donning white gowns and opera-length gloves, the young ladies were feted at the 
Children's Home Society's 36th annual Debutante Ball, a $100-per-person benefit 
that raised an estimated $75,000, according to Newport Harbor Auxiliary 
president Marilyn Read. 
</P>
<P>
The bash began before sundown with the girls posing for pictures in the 
ballroom. After the portrait session and a pre-party party, the debs joined 
their parents, escorts and friends -- a total of 485 guests -- for cocktails 
under the stars in the Ritz courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before dinner, guests were seated in the ballroom to await the entrance 
of each snowy-clad deb as she glided in on the arm of her father, promenaded 
the dance floor and stepped on stage. Master of ceremonies Per Tembler handled 
the introductions. 
</P>
<P>
Ball host James Spradley Jr., president of the Children's Home Society of 
California, described the 98-year-old society's programs, which include 
adoption services, counseling, day care, foster family care and child advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
After a dinner of fettucine with prawns and filet mignon with three peppercorn 
sauce, the debs danced with their dads and gentleman callers to the sounds of 
Barry Cole's orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Debutantes du jour: Elizabeth Anne Bastiaanse, Hilary Weathers Benedict, Lisa 
Jennifer Bhathal, Jennifer Jean Brunson, Dorothy Bristol Dunlap, Suzanne Lyn 
Emerson, Michelle Marshall Fay, Melinda Ann Hovee, Michele Christina Hughes, 
Melissa Suzanne Ingold, Michelle Anne Johnson, Diane Elizabeth Mallos, Kathleen 
Margaret Nutt, Molly Marie O'Neil, Dona Kristina Ring, Rachel Beth Robboy, 
Jennifer Bridget Smith, Traci Lynn Warmington, Lydia McKenzie Welton, Wendy Ann 
Werner, Allison Christine Root, Celeste Tuttle, Rika Michelle Yano. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 22 more teens debuted at the 29th annual Debutante Ball hosted by 
the Newport chapter of the National Charity League. 
</P>
<P>
The setting was all romance and elegance in the ballroom of the Irvine Hilton, 
dressed up for the night with lilies, roses and magnolia blossoms, Greek 
columns and Doric pedestals, pepper trees and eucalyptus branches. 
</P>
<P>
Five hundred guests paid $75 each to attend the party, which was not a 
fund-raiser but "a reward to the girls for their years of service," said 
committee member Sharon Henwood. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 young women presented in a pre-dinner ceremony have given a total of 
3,700 hours of community service, Henwood said. National Charity League is a 
nonprofit organization of mothers and daughters who donate time and raise money 
for groups such as Special Olympics, Meals on Wheels, senior citizen centers 
and other philanthropic and cultural programs. 
</P>
<P>
Making their formal society debut at the dinner-dance were: Nicole Renee 
Balding, Marla Suanne Coon, Sienna Curci, Kelli Ann Dobbs, Amy Therese Dreyfus, 
Katherine Ann Gfeller, Sara Elizabeth Guggenheim, Heather Kristine Hanes, Amy 
Elizabeth Irvine, Julie Johnson, Angela Karen Kendall, Suzanne Lorraine Kengla, 
Elizabeth Ann Lockie, Sara Ann Lucas, Molly Elizabeth McCray, Amy Bryant Nott, 
Amy Lynn Rich, Karen Ann Robison, Cynthia Lynn Rohan, Shannon Terese Roys, 
Cameron Gail Tingler, Jill Heather Wood.

Question: Why does a person who has had mono have to be careful about taking 
part in athletics? Wouldn't exercise help speed up his recovery? Yet doctors 
discourage this. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Patients with infectious mononucleosis have an enlarged spleen, which 
may be subject to rupture. Therefore, they should not take part in contact 
sports until the spleen has been returned to normal.

CAL POLY MEN CAGERS AIM TO RETURN TO WINNING WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two straight losses to NCAA Division I opponents, the Cal Poly Pomona 
men's basketball team hopes to get back on the winning track against two lower 
division teams tonight and Saturday at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who lost to Southern Utah State and UC Berkeley to drop to a 1-3 
record, meet Pomona-Pitzer at 7:30 tonight and UC Davis at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
Both games are at Kellogg Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona-Pitzer, a Division III team, takes a 1-3 record into the game. Davis, a 
Division II squad, is 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos were soundly defeated by their Division I opponents, dropping a 
112-94 decision to Southern Utah and falling 95-72 against California. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Broncos have received outstanding play all along from 6-6 forward 
Terry Ross. The junior scored 20 points and grabbed eight rebounds against 
Southern Utah and added 20 points and 11 rebounds to lead the way against 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which does not have a senior in its opening lineup, will also start 
juniors Ken Scalmanini (6-4) at forward, Rafael Vargas (6-7) at center and 
Chancellor McCobb (6-3) at guard and sophomore D. J. Norman (6-1) at the other 
guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will face a Pomona-Pitzer team that is also struggling. The 
Sagehens, defending Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
champions, won their season opener over Swarthmore of Pennsylvania, 66-62, but 
have lost their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
The Sagehens are paced by 6-2 senior guard David Todd, who averages 18.7 
points. Davis, Pomona's Saturday opponent, is sparked by junior forward Matt 
Cordova. The 6-3 Cordova averages 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team will attempt to remain undefeated 
when it meets UC Santa Barbara at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Poly Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona will take a 3-0 record into the game. Santa Barbara is 2-0. The Broncos 
defeated Santa Barbara, 66-60, last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who reached the NCAA Division II final last season, will be facing 
their second straight Division I opponent. Pomona defeated Weber State, 70-68, 
in its last game. 
</P>
<P>
The victory over Weber State was a milestone for Pomona coach Darlene May, who 
record the 400th victory of her college career. May, in her 16th season as a 
college coach, has a 400-91 record -- a brilliant winning percentage of .815. 
That also tied her for fourth with Joanne Bracker of Midland Lutheran on the 
list of all-time women's leaders in wins. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, Pomona has been led by 6-2 senior forward Niki Bracken. An 
All-America selection last season, Bracken scored 22 points and grabbed nine 
rebounds against Weber State. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bracken, the Bronco starters are juniors Kelly Connelly (6-1) at 
forward and Stephanie Coons (5-11) and Denise Ogburn (5-5) at guard and senior 
Marcine Edmonds (6-1) at center. Pomona also has an impressive freshman in 
reserve in 6-2 center Danielle Carter, an All-CIF performer at Fontana High 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara will counter Pomona with good size on its front line including 
6-4 sophomore center Susie Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus College in Glendora will play host to the eight-team 1989 California 
Community College State Women's Volleyball Tournament that starts Saturday in 
the school's gym. 
</P>
<P>
Games will start at 9 a.m. Saturday and 9:30 a.m. Sunday. Admission is $5 for 
adults and $3 for students and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The double-elimination tournament will include four teams from Northern 
California and four from Southern California. First-round pairings have yet to 
be determined.

A Sheriff's Department anti-gang unit investigating a series of killings and

Firestone Park area. 
</P>

Deputies with the Operation Safe Streets anti-gang squad investigating a series 
of drive-by shootings beginning last April made the arrests, Deputy Dean 
Scoville said. He said six gang members were arrested on charges of possessing 
illegal weapons -- including AR-15, AK-47 and Tec-9 assault rifles -- and that 
other charges may be added.

A Van Nuys pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a U.S. Postal Service 
van when he walked in front of it, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Cuba, 56, of Van Nuys was pronounced dead at Valley Presbyterian 
Hospital shortly after the 7 p.m. accident Wednesday at Sepulveda Boulevard and 
Gilmore Street, Officer Ed Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
The van's driver, a Postal Service employee whose name was not released, was 
not cited, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said the victim was trying to cross Sepulveda at Gilmore Street, where 
there is no marked crosswalk. A witness told police that Cuba stepped into the 
street without looking and was immediately struck by the van, which was 
northbound on Sepulveda at about 30 m.p.h., Burns said.

CITY SUES ST. JOHN FOR $388,920 OVER MISSING TASK FORCE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Accusing Juanita St. John of "fraud and deceit," City Atty. James K. Hahn filed 
a lawsuit today to recover $388,920 in city funds paid to the African trade 
task force she headed. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court, alleges that St. John and unnamed task 
force members breached four contracts with the city dating back to 1985 by 
using city funds for improper purposes, failing to maintain accurate books and 
records, and failing to make any accounting to the city for its expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
St. John and the others never intended to honor the terms of the contract, the 
suit alleges, but instead "had a secret intent to use the funds for their own 
purposes or in violation of the contracts." 
</P>
<P>
St. John, a friend and business associate of Mayor Tom Bradley, is the subject 
of a number of investigations for her handling of the city funds, which the 
mayor helped secure for the task force. Bradley, who helped create the task 
force and was a member of its advisory board, was not named in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
City auditors have said that the task force owes the city more than $260,000, 
but Hahn sued today for the full $388,920 paid to the task force since 1985, 
saying the group had never made a proper accounting for any of the money. 
</P>
<P>
St. John has maintained that she can account for the funds.

Nadia Comaneci, the Olympic gymnastics champion who defected from her native

"As far as I know, she is probably in the U.S. Embassy in Bern," Bela Karolyi

"She is waiting to get some travel papers," said Karolyi.

MUTINEERS CLAIM SEIZURE OF PHILIPPINE AIR FORCE HQ

Mutinous troops claimed today to have seized the headquarters of the Philippine 
air force and appeared to be in control of two broadcast stations in a bid to 
topple President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
The government called on all mayors to mobilize local police forces to defend 
the Aquino administration. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional radio appeal, in which he said he was on his knees, Manila 
Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin urged his countrymen "to support the duly 
constituted authority." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how widespread the mutiny was or whether it had 
the power to topple the government. Loyalist troops took up positions around 
the palace, where Aquino has her residence and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos said the coup attempt began when two companies 
of mutinous Marines tried to enter Villamor Air Base, headquarters of the 
Philippine air force, in the southern suburbs of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed that they were blocked by loyalist troops. But air force troops who 
had been guarding the gate left about 2 a.m., and the mutinous marines took 
over security at the base perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that no shots had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
One marine captain, who refused to give his name, said about 2,000 troops are 
taking part in the mutiny. Air force troops sealed off the adjacent domestic 
airport and refused to let passengers enter the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Two truckloads of soldiers, wearing white bands and carrying red flags, were 
seen entering the government radio and television station and the adjacent 
private ABS-CBN station at about 2 a.m. They appeared to be mutineers. 
</P>
<P>
At the state television station, scattered shooting broke out. Soldiers kept 
reporters away from the area, and it was impossible to determine whether 
mutineers or government troops were in control. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers who entered the state-run station were wearing the same white 
armbands and carrying the same red flags as the mutineers at Villamor. The 
significance of the red and white colors was not immediately apparent.

A police officer whose slaying of a black suspect set off three days of rioting 
took the stand at his manslaughter trial today and said he fired because the 
man was bearing down on him with his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned my body to face the motorcycle. He just came straight at me with a 
tremendous noise," said Officer William Lozano. "He was just aiming at me. I 
was just able to turn my body, draw my gun and shoot." 
</P>
<P>
The five-year veteran of the Miami Police Department said he thought he was 
going to die and was briefly in shock.

After recovering, he said, he found no vital signs when he checked on the 
motorcyclist. He said he noticed the man's injured passenger and radioed a

and killed the motorcyclist, Clement Lloyd, 23, on Jan. 16, sparking three days 
of rioting in the community's black neighborhoods. The passenger, Alan

JAPANESE FIRM PAYS RECORD $48.9 MILLION FOR A PICASSO

<TEXT>
<P>
A Japanese real estate tycoon paid $48.9 million today to set a world auction 
record for a painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
But Picasso's "Les Noces de Pierrette" fell short of expectations that it would 
replace Vincent Van Gogh's "Irises" as the world's most expensive painting. 
</P>
<P>
Art experts had predicted that the auction, conducted simultaneously in Paris 
and Tokyo by a satellite link-up, would break the 1987 Van Gogh record of $53.9 
million. The Picasso becomes the world's second most expensive work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, Tomonori Tsurumaki, representing his firm, Nippon Autopolis Co., 
plans to make the painting the centerpiece in an auto racing theme resort in 
the mountains in southern Japan. He will pay a total of $51.35 million when 
auctioneers fees of 5% are added to the hammer price. 
</P>
<P>
Paloma Picasso, the artist's daughter, told reporters she was staggered at the 
price. "It's an extraordinary sum; I don't know what my father would have 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
The auction price of Picasso's work has exploded. Today's sale was the third 
time this year one of his works has topped $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Les Noces de Pierrette," painted in 1905 soon after Picasso arrived in Paris 
from Barcelona, is a figurative work from Picasso's blue period showing a 
harlequin blowing a kiss to a newly wedded bride. 
</P>
<P>
The painting reappeared at a Stockholm exhibit last year after being missing 
for several decades. Some thought it had been lost or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding at today's auction rose rapidly to $42.6 million when a buyer in Paris 
hesitated. The Frenchman's final bid of $46 million was topped by Tsurumaki's 
final offer of $48.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
French film star Alain Delon embraced the disappointed Frenchman as applause 
broke out at the end of the auction. 
</P>
<P>
Delon said he was mandated by a Japanese friend to bid up to $32 million "but I 
didn't even have a chance to put my hand up." 
</P>
<P>
A Paris appeals court Wednesday rejected a last-minute attempt to halt the sale 
by the sister of a man who sold the painting to Swedish banker Fredrik Roos, 
who owned it until today. Valerie Goulet claimed her brother did not have the 
right to sell the painting.

Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that mistrust between East and 
West was crumbling before the pressure of democratic change. 
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to reforms sweeping Eastern Europe, Gorbachev and Italian 
Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti called in a joint political declaration for 
democracy in every society. 
</P>
<P>
"In some countries an in-depth and courageous revision of both domestic and 
foreign policies is under way, and changes toward democracy are taking place," 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the pressure of these factors, the curtain of mistrust between the East 
and the West is crumbling," the declaration added. 
</P>
<P>
It was signed after talks between the two leaders on the second day of 
Gorbachev's visit to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, as he entered the talks in the renaissance Villa Madama overlooking 
Rome, Gorbachev told reporters his reform of Soviet society was facing great 
difficulties and he appealed for more cooperation from the West so military 
expenditure could be cut. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he would step up the pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
He said: "Now we are going through the most difficult phase because we have 
entered a period which I would call one of profound transformation. Not 
everything is going easily and there are difficulties, but there are no roads 
for turning back. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to forge ahead and step up the pace of reforms."

President Bush said today he and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet 
off the coast of Malta not as traditional adversaries but as envoys for 
"positive, productive change." 
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a powerful, historic opportunity," Bush said during a ceremony in the 
wind-swept White House Rose Garden marking his departure for the first summit 
between the two superpower leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev confer Saturday and Sunday on American and Soviet warships 
off the coast of Malta in the Mediterranean for what officially has been 
described as informal talks designed to give the two leaders a chance to assess 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gorbachev and I are not in some kind of competition," Bush said of the 
Soviet leader, whose flare for the dramatic has put him at the center of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"This meeting represents a point of departure, the beginning of a process as 
full of promise as any that we've known," said Bush, who initially sought to 
downplay expectations of what he called the "non-summit summit." 
</P>
<P>
"Given the remarkable and rapid change in Eastern Europe, our meeting will be 
yet another important step in this long but hopeful journey toward a Europe 
that is indeed whole and free," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who planned an early evening departure aboard Air Force One, 
stressed his support for Gorbachev's program of reform, even as he hailed the 
changes sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"America understands the magnitude of Mr. Gorbachev's challenges and let there 
be no misunderstanding, we support perestroika," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's send-off ceremony was attended by nearly 300 Administration officials 
who filled the Rose Garden under blue skies and brisk winds. 
</P>
<P>
As he left after the six-minute speech, Bush told reporters: "I'm ready for the 
meeting. I'm ready and confident." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a Cabinet meeting called to preview the session, Bush said he was 
confident that "Gorbachev is looking at the meeting very much the same way we 
are." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he received a full report Wednesday night from Canadian Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney on his own meetings in Moscow last week with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney told reporters Gorbachev isn't looking for "miracles" from Malta but 
deserves help from the West such as observer status at world trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in an interview Wednesday with newspaper correspondents that was released 
today by the White House, said the unfolding changes in the once hard-line 
Communist states in Eastern Europe have given "more of an urgency" to the 
meeting since he first proposed it in July. But he insisted, "There's been no 
change, in my view, as to what this meeting is to be about." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the United States had sent Gorbachev the message that it wants no 
surprises at Malta, Bush said: "We've sent the message that we don't think 
there are going to be any.

General Mills and Nestle S.A. said today they will start up a joint venture to 
market breakfast cereals. 
</P>
<P>
Under the letter of intent, the two food companies will star "Cereal Partners 
Worldwide" in Europe, then take the cereals around the world, except the United 
States and Canada. The companies will share equally in the ownership of and 
investment in the new joint venture, which will have its headquarters in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Bruce Atwater, chairman and chief executive officer of 
General Mills, and Helmut Maucher, managing director of Nestle, said 
ready-to-eat cereal is one of the most attractive and fastest-growing major 
food categories in the world. Consumer demand is growing in response to 
increased interest in foods that emphasize health, nutrition, convenience and 
value, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Through a strategic alliance that combines the cereal expertise and technology 
of General Mills with the local marketing expertise and sales distribution 
systems of Nestle, we believe we can accomplish collectively that which would 
be much more difficult to accomplish individually: to become a major 
competitive force in the development of worldwide breakfast cereal markets 
within the next decade," they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is intended to be a well-defined and longstanding successful 
relationship."

President Bush has selected Houston as the site of the next economic summit for 
the seven major Western industrial countries, White House sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
They said the summit, with the United States as host, will take place next 
July. 
</P>
<P>
"It is expected to be announced tomorrow," said one White House official, when 
Bush will be in Malta for his first summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Chronicle reported today that the summit would take place July 7 to 
9. 
</P>
<P>
Bush indicated during last July's economic summit in Paris that he would like 
to see Texas be host to the gathering of industrial nations, even though it can 
have sweltering heat at that time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, a native of Connecticut, moved to Houston after World War II and made his 
fortune in the oil business. 
</P>
<P>
The summit, which rotates among the participating nations, was last hosted by 
the United States in 1983 in Williamsburg, Va.

Kim LeMasters, the boyish-looking executive responsible for the CBS television 
schedule, resigned today as president of CBS Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
A successor was expected to be named shortly. 
</P>
<P>
The network currently is in third place in the prime time ratings, as it was 
last season and the previous season. LeMasters, 40, took over his present job 
in 1987, when CBS already was on the way to the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
LeMasters, who has worked for CBS for most of his career, said he was leaving 
to go into business for himself. At CBS, LeMasters developed a number of the 
network's top shows, including "Dallas," "Magnum, P.I.," "Knots Landing," 
"Falcon Crest" and "Newhart" and oversaw the launch of "Frank's Place," "Murphy 
Brown," "Designing Women" and "Wiseguy." 
</P>
<P>
He also was responsible, as head of entertainment, for bringing the 
much-acclaimed miniseries "Lonesome Dove" to the small screen.

PALMER OF 'TODAY' TO RETURN 'ONLY YESTERDAY'

John Palmer, ousted earlier this fall as news anchor for NBC's "Today" show 
after seven years, has signed with King World to be host of a syndicated 
program to be launched next fall called "Only Yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
The program will be produced by former ABC News executive Av Westin. 
Salespersons are already crisscrossing the country on behalf of "Only 
Yesterday" for King World -- syndicators of such blockbusters as "The Oprah 
Winfrey Show" and "Wheel of Fortune" as well as a revamped (by Westin) "Inside 
Edition." 
</P>
<P>
Local sources who have seen the demonstration film say "Only Yesterday" 
resembles Linda Ellerbee's "Our World" program for ABC News a couple of seasons 
back, featuring nostalgic looks back at several major news stories each day -- 
followed by updates from participants. Westin produced "Our World" at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
The weekday show will be ready for stations in September. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year in a still-debated move to attract a younger audience, NBC 
News Senior Vice President Dick Ebersol forced Palmer to switch jobs with "NBC 
News at Sunrise" anchor Deborah Norville. That turned out to be the first of a 
series of moves that shortly after the first of the year will have resulted in 
the departures from the show of not only Palmer but also longtime anchor Jane 
Pauley, who has been replaced by the self-same Norville. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Alice Williams reportedly is a leading candidate -- if she wants the job 
-- to replace Palmer on "Sunrise," when she returns from a pending maternity 
leave early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, who got a multi-year contract, with options, from King World, 
reportedly chose "Only Yesterday" over several attractive options, including 
the chance to be an anchor-correspondent for NBC-owned WTVJ in Miami, in part 
because it allows the family, which includes three small children, to remain in 
New York.

BERNSTEIN TO PLAY BOTH SIDES OF WALL

Leonard Bernstein will conduct Christmas performances of Beethoven's Ninth 
Symphony on both sides of the Berlin Wall in celebration of universal 
brotherhood, it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Carson, a spokesman for the conductor-composer, said the first concert 
will be held at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a World War II ruin in West 
Berlin, on Dec. 23 and the second will be held Christmas Day at the 
Schauspielhaus theater in East Berlin. Both are near the Berlin Wall, which 
until recently divided the city. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the concerts originated with Bernstein after the wall was opened 
by East German authorities and East Germans streamed into West Berlin, Carson 
said. Bernstein has conducted peace concerts in Hiroshima, Japan, Warsaw and 
other cities in the past several years and has been active in efforts to end 
world conflict. 
</P>
<P>
He has organized a multinational orchestra and chorus to perform the Beethoven 
work, which has a thrilling choral finale known as the "Ode to Joy." Although 
most of the musicians will be from the Bavarian Radio Symphony, there will be 
players from New York, London, Paris, Dresden and possibly Leningrad, 
representing both West and East Germany and the four Allied powers that 
occupied Berlin after World War II, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein sent word from his home in Connecticut that the celebration was 
inspired by "Schiller! Beethoven! Freude (joy)! Bruder (brother)! Freiheit 
(freedom)!" 
</P>
<P>
"It's all coming true! Hooray!" he said.

She told the coordinator that if they wanted her they could come to Sheridan,

Luke and Matt Goss of the Bros pop band settled a libel lawsuit Wednesday with 
a newspaper they claimed had suggested that they took heroin. 
</P>
<P>
The People, a tabloid weekly, agreed to pay the 21-year-old twins a six-figure 
sum and publish an apology in next Sunday's paper, prosecutor Richard Hartley 
said. Hartley said the exact amount would not be disclosed, but six figures in 
British pounds is the equivalent of at least $160,000. The brothers, avid 
campaigners against drugs, testified at a libel hearing that articles in the 
newspaper in September, 1988, spoiled their "squeaky clean" image in the eyes 
of their mainly teen-age fans.

Comedian Red Foxx once made $4 million a year but lost the money in lawsuits 
and broken deals and because he failed to heed the IRS, according to voluminous 
records in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS stepped in Tuesday and raided Foxx's home in Las Vegas, seizing his 
property -- including furniture, cars and jewelry he was wearing -- for failure 
to pay $755,166 in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Foxx was left with an empty house, which the government says it will sell if he 
doesn't settle the tax debt in 30 to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Foxx was one of the top-paid performers in the United States in the 1970s. He 
currently works as a comedian at the Hacienda Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, 
earning $20,000 a week. He said Tuesday the $20,000 has gone to the IRS the 
past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
His manager, Prince Spencer, said Foxx was paid $500,000 for his role in the 
current film "Harlem Nights." Foxx vowed to bounce back from Tuesday's seizure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll make it," he promised. "I got good friends." 
</P>
<P>
The $755,166 Foxx owes the IRS does not include interest and penalties. Court 
records show Foxx also owes state taxes in California and New Jersey.

<P>
Strange carded two eagles, five birdies and two bogeys on the par-72, 
6,847-yard Kingston Heath course to tie the record set by Gary Player in 1970 
and tied by Ronan Rafferty of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"A course record is very nice, but it doesn't mean you have the tournament 
won," Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased. It's always nice to get off to a good start. I drove well 
today and made some nice putts." 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of Strange's round came when he sank a 9-iron from 140 yards for 
an eagle at the 365 yards par-4 second hole. 
</P>
<P>
Australian PGA champion Peter Senior and three of his compatriots, Lucien 
Tinkler, Brett Ogle and Jeff Woodland, had rounds of 66 to keep the pressure on 
Strange. 
</P>
<P>
British Open champion Mark Calcavecchia was one shot further back at 67, tied 
with Australians Tony Wolsey and Steven Bann, after beginning a roller-coaster 
round with a bogey at the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
He had two other bogeys on his card but also shot eight birdies, including five 
in six holes from the fourth to the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Masters champion Nick Faldo of Britain was three shots off the lead after a 68, 
four better than three-time champion Greg Norman, who had a disastrous 
triple-bogey in his round of 72. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Calcavecchia was angered by slow play in near-perfect 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Many players took more than five hours to complete the 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Calcavecchia said. "If it had been windy, it would 
have taken six hours.

Former Stanford and San Jose State Coach Jack Elway is among 77 people who have 
applied for the job as Northern Arizona's football coach, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-member search committee started reviewing the applications Monday, and 
officials said Wednesday that a new coach could be named as early as this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy occurs because Larry Kentera announced Nov. 7 that he is resigning 
after his fifth season. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Jurich, Northern Arizona's athletic director, said that among the people 
who have applied besides Elway are USC defensive coordinator Chris Allen; 
Arizona defensive coordinator Larry Mac Duff; former NFL quarterback John 
Hadel, now a receivers coach at Kansas; Arizona State receivers Coach Don 
Bocchi; Western New Mexico Head Coach Bob O'Mera; West Virginia defensive 
coordinator Bob Shaw, and Boise State defensive coordinator John Gough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a really strong field," Jurich said. "I think it's a credit to 
the university that we can attract those kinds of people."

Rookie Billy Joe Tolliver will probably be the San Diego Chargers' starting 
quarterback instead of Jim McMahon in Sunday's game against the New York Jets, 
Coach Dan Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's ineffectiveness in recent weeks was not a factor in the decision to 
change quarterbacks, Henning said Wednesday, nor was a wrenched knee that 
McMahon suffered during the Chargers' 10-6 loss at Indianapolis last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The move was prompted instead by Henning's desire to give Tolliver another 
chance to show what he can do in a game before the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I'd say it's going to be Billy Joe," Henning said of his 
quarterback situation. "I told him . . . that if he looks prepared (in 
practice), then he would start. 
</P>
<P>
"(McMahon) probably still gives us our best chance to win, but by the same 
token I think Billy has come along in the last three or four weeks. We need to 
find that out, and if he does well enough in the game, we'll give him a good 
dose of it. If he isn't as effective, we'll pull him out and wait for another 
time to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether Tolliver or McMahon starts, Henning said the rookie from 
Texas Tech will see some playing time Sunday when the Chargers (4-8) host the 
Jets (3-9) at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.

DESORMEAUX SETS RECORD WITH WIN 547

Jockey Kent Desormeaux eclipsed a 15-year-old record for most winners in a year 
when he won his 547th race of 1989 in the fifth race today at Laurel Race 
Course. (See Jim Murray, C1.) 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, 19, surpassed the mark set by Chris McCarron in 1974 with a 
three-quarter-length victory aboard a 2-year-old filly named Gilten, an even 
money favorite in a field of 14. 
</P>
<P>
The record-setting ride came on Desormeaux's 2,129th mount of the year. 
McCarron needed 2,199 mounts to set the record. 
</P>
<P>
The record fell after Desormeaux moved Gilten to the lead on the far turn and 
held off long-shot Brown Bear through the stretch for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, a native of Maurice, La., had tied the mark in the fourth race with 
his second mount of the day after 13 consecutive rides without a winner over 
parts of three racing days. 
</P>
<P>
After leading the nation in total victories in 1988 and 1989, Desormeaux had 
pulled to within one victory of the record Sunday when he won the fourth race 
at Laurel aboard Horse Talk. He then went 0-for-5 Tuesday and missed with his 
first ride today. Laurel was dark Monday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
To equal the record, Desormeaux moved Lucked In up between horses on the far 
turn, continued the rally on the outside and drew clear in the final furlong to 
post a 1 1/4-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux shook his fist in victory as he crossed the wire of his record-tying 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux won 450 races two years ago and was the recipient of the Eclipse 
Award as the nation's outstanding apprentice. He won 474 races last year.
