OFFICIALS SAY FLU VACCINE MAY NOT MEET DEMAND; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: TWO OF THE FOUR LICENSED U.S. MANUFACTURERS HAVE RUN OUT, AND THE 
OTHER TWO REPORT ONLY A LIMITED SUPPLY IS IN STOCK.

<P>
A dwindling supply of flu vaccine this year could mean that not everyone who 
wants a flu shot will get one, health officials report. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four licensed U.S. manufacturers producing this year's influenza 
vaccine have run out of vaccine, and the other two companies report a limited 
supply in stock. 
</P>
<P>
In California, some county health departments, clinics and individual 
physicians have depleted their supplies and will probably be unable to obtain 
more from the manufacturers, said Dr. Loring Dales, chief of immunization for 
the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're out, you're out," said Sandy Ross, immunization project 
coordinator for the Department of Health Services in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said clinics in the San Diego area began running short of the vaccine 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not completely out yet, but what we're telling the community is, it's 
one day at a time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the vaccine will be available today, but in very limited supply, at 
clinics in El Cajon and Pacific Beach. She said the vaccine is in short supply 
in San Diego County because of the "overwhelming response" from the public in 
asking for flu shots. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a potential we face every year," she said, "but this year, we started 
running out much sooner than anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Health Department officials, however, report that they still 
have flu vaccine available. 
</P>
<P>
"We have plenty of vaccine," said Chuck Alexander, who directs distribution of 
the county's vaccine. "We have to be somewhat conservative with it, but we've 
been giving it out to whoever wants it." 
</P>
<P>
Dales said about 20% of county health departments in the state have run out of 
the vaccine, which immunizes against three strains of influenza: A Shanghai, A 
Taiwan and B Yamagata. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Orange County report that they have enough vaccine to hold public 
immunization clinics within the next few days, but supplies are not expected to 
hold out much beyond that time. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, health officials report that demand for vaccine has 
increased from 16,000 doses provided last year to 21,000 doses so far this 
year. Riverside officials this week borrowed 1,000 doses of vaccine from the 
San Bernardino Health Department, which has not experienced a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"We've certainly had a bigger response to our flu clinics this year than we 
anticipated," said epidemiologist Randy Regester of the Riverside County Health 
Department. "It hasn't been critical, but we have had to borrow some doses in 
order to complete this season's immunization program." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, more people have sought flu shots this year than ever before 
from the Department of Public Health, but supplies have been ample to meet 
demand, said Sue Hyatt, public health nurse. 
</P>
<P>
The department administered 12,500 shots at 18 clinics held around the county, 
she said. Public Health also distributed vaccines to many of the county's 
nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt said Thursday that the department has about 150 doses remaining, which it 
will continue to offer at its regular public health clinics until the supplies 
run out. 
</P>
<P>
Because leftover flu vaccine cannot be saved and used the following year, 
manufacturers are faced with the difficult task each year of guessing how much 
vaccine will be needed, Dales said. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to gauge how much to make," he said. "Some years they make too much. 
Some years they make too little. This is one of the years where they didn't 
make enough, but they came close." 
</P>
<P>
The manufacture, packaging and shipping of large quantities of flu vaccine 
takes several months, according to the vaccine makers. By the time the existing 
supplies could be supplemented, the current flu season would be well under way. 
</P>
<P>
Flu vaccine is designed each year to protect against particular strains and 
should be administered in November and December to be most effective, Dales 
said. It takes two to three weeks for the vaccine to produce immunity. 
Influenza, which is spread by droplets coughed or sneezed into the air, usually 
hits full force in December, spurred by holiday travel. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is recommended for people who might suffer serious consequences if 
stricken with flu. Health-care workers are also encouraged to be immunized to 
halt the spread of illness among their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Flu causes fever, headache, muscle ache and fatigue but can lead to additional 
complications among the elderly and individuals with immune-system disorders. 
About 20,000 Americans die each year from influenza. 
</P>
<P>
Health clinics and physicians place their orders for vaccine early in the year 
and must estimate how much they'll need. 
</P>
<P>
The county attempts to order enough vaccine to meet the needs of individuals 
who are at particular risk for serious complications from the flu and may be 
unable to afford a shot from a private physician, Alexander said. A shot costs 
about $15 to $30 from a private practitioner, clinic or hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Individual physicians may still have plenty of vaccine available. According to 
a spokesman for one manufacturer, Connaught Labs Inc., vaccine supplies sold to 
public health departments are usually depleted quickly while supplies in 
private physicians' offices and clinics dwindle gradually. 
</P>
<P>
Supply "would vary from physician to physician," Dales said. "But if (private 
doctors) have run out, it would be difficult to get any more." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next week, state officials will transfer supplies of flu vaccine from 
counties with an excess to those experiencing a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"Some counties have scheduled (immunization) clinics and have had to close 
them," Dales said. "We hope next week to gather up vaccine from some clinics 
that came out ahead and shift the vaccine to the other counties so they can 
hold makeup clinics."

CENTRAL LIBRARY: CHECK IT OUT; 
</P>
<P>
A SURPRISE DONATION IS A CHALLENGE TO ALL ANGELENOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rather fabulous gift -- part challenge grant -- has put the Los Angeles 
Central Library -- one of the jewels of the city -- in the spotlight again. 
That's good. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million donation -- to defray some of the expense of improving the 
library -- comes from philanthropist Mark Taper. Four years ago the historic 
Central Library was devastated by fires, more than 400,000 books needed to be 
replaced and modernization was urgently needed. Now the empty, still 
fire-damaged building at 5th and Flower streets is scheduled to reopen when a 
major $221-million expansion and restoration project is completed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
That will be a milestone, but more work will need to be done. A library is an 
ongoing learning laboratory, and learning all one needs to know in a place as 
diverse as Los Angeles can be an expensive proposition. Preschoolers are 
introduced to the Central Library, which is housed in temporary quarters at 433 
S. Spring St., with puppet shows and story hours. Young adults are attracted to 
the video and audio collections. 
</P>
<P>
Many users come simply for the joy of learning. Immigrants can learn English in 
the new Language Learning Center, which was funded by the Southern California 
Gas Co. They can use computer terminals, audiocassette decks, videocassettes 
and books available in 28 languages. They can also borrow from the extensive 
collection of foreign-language publications. Businesses also depend on the 
library. The patent collection, for instance, which was replaced after the 
fires, is heavily used. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Library circulated 800,000 books and answered 10 million reference 
calls in the year before the fires. After the arsons, generous corporations and 
individuals contributed to a special fund to replace the burned books. 
Additional donations will be needed to anticipate new multicultural demands, 
provide special programs and change from old paper services to new library 
technology. The Taper donation, in part a challenge grant, should encourage 
others to give.

Mark Taper Foundation -- A recent $1-million grant to the Los Angeles Central 
Library was made by the Mark Taper Foundation, as reported in a news article 
that appeared Nov. 27. That article and an editorial that appeared Nov. 30 also 
referred to the grant as a donation from financier and philanthropist Mark 
Taper. Although Taper is the sole contributor to the foundation, it was the 
foundation that provided the grant.

DOWN BY FOUR, KINGS GET POINT ACROSS ON ROAD 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tornado swept through here early this week and an earthquake has been 
predicted for early next week. 
</P>
<P>
For the visiting Kings, disaster seemed to beckon everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
On land. In the air. Even on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
While it certainly doesn't rank with the tragedies of the real world, the Kings 
were looking at a little disaster of their own when they fell behind the St. 
Louis Blues, 4-0, after two periods Thursday night at St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Kings put together their biggest rally of the season to eke out a 
4-4 tie before a sellout crowd of 17,982 and then hopped on their plane to 
return home atop the Smythe Division by four points over the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Eight days on the road produced only a 1-2-2 mark, but a gain of one point in 
the standings for the Kings, who come back with a season mark of 16-6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel we were down and pouting after the second period," goalie Kelly 
Hrudey said. "We felt we would work hard and see what came of it." 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey was also the goalie Sunday when the Kings tied the Quebec Nordiques, 
4-4. 
</P>
<P>
That night, the Kings twice blew two-goal leads and acted as if they had lost. 
</P>
<P>
This night, it was St. Louis that had the blues after taking a seemingly secure 
lead on home ice, where the club had gone 7-0-2 in its first nine games as the 
Blues got off to the best start in their history. 
</P>
<P>
But they are 0-1-2 at home in their last three as their overall record has 
dropped to 15-7-3. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if the Blues had snapped out of it when Gino Cavallini scored his 
sixth and seventh goals, Brett Hull his league-leading 25th and Dominic Lavoie 
his first, all in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille, back from a four-game suspension, started the Kings' comeback 
with his 10th goal 55 seconds into the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Then came, perhaps, the crucial play. 
</P>
<P>
With Robitaille in the penalty box on a double minor for high-sticking, Bob 
Kudelski controlled the puck near the boards on the left side and whipped it to 
John McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre, 21, in only his sixth game as a King after joining the club in a 
trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs for Mike Krushelnyski, had yet to score. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving the puck, he found himself alone at the red line. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought somebody would be there," he said, "but nobody was. I started 
thinking about what I was going to do as I skated from the red line. I thought 
of something by the time I got there." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't too complicated. He just banged the puck through the pads of goalie 
Vince Riendeau. 
</P>
<P>
That almost wasn't enough as the puck hit the left post. But it ricocheted into 
the net, putting the Kings back by two goals with 2:08 gone in the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
It got tougher when Tomas Sandstrom had to leave 16 seconds later with a 
contusion of the back, the result of sliding into the net. 
</P>
<P>
He never returned, but the Kings did after holding the Blues scoreless in the 
double minor. 
</P>
<P>
When John Tonelli put in his own rebound for his fifth goal at the 6:39 mark, 
the margin was down to one. It was Tonelli's 800th career point. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky tied the score at 16:33 on a power play, scoring his 16th goal 
from the middle of the right circle, the puck flying past Riendeau on his stick 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had their chances to break the deadlock. Gretzky had the puck on a 
two-on-one near the end of regulation play, but couldn't get it past defender 
Jeff Brown. 
</P>
<P>
And at the end of the overtime, Paul Cavallini fired from the left circle, but 
Hrudey deflected the puck with his left pad. 
</P>
<P>
And that was that. Nobody won. 
</P>
<P>
But try telling that to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Marty McSorley suffered bruised ribs and left the game in the second 
period. . . . The Kings fired Marcel Comeau, the coach of their New Haven 
Nighthawk farm team. The American Hockey League club has struggled to an 8-13-4 
start. Garry Unger, assistant coach of the Phoenix Roadrunners, the Kings' 
other minor league affiliate, was named New Haven's interim coach. "It was a 
real good team on paper," King General Manager Rogie Vachon said, "but for some 
reason, they couldn't win." . . . Defenseman Bob Halkidis, sent to New Haven 
for conditioning as the final step in his recovery from off-season shoulder 
surgery, has been assigned to Phoenix after clearing waivers.

A showdown between undefeated teams wasn't the only thing that went out the 
window when the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants both lost Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Jerry Izenberg of the Newark Star-Ledger might have had some fun with 
a matchup of 11-0 teams. 
</P>
<P>
After the Giants beat Detroit two weeks ago, Izenberg wrote: "To (the Giants), 
reaching for (their) 10th victory in 10 starts, the Lions were simply that 
undigested piece of boiled beef which nestles next to a molar and must be dealt 
with before you can go out and pick up your date on prom night or the summer's 
last mosquito, which doesn't have the sense to know it should have been dead a

Trivia time: Who holds the National League record for home runs allowed in one 
season? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to it: High school football fever gripped Inyo County last Friday as 
Bishop Bronco boosters buckled up for the long trek to their second-round 
playoff game against Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Inyo Register ran a public service item under the headline, "How 
to get to Valley Christian." It began: 
</P>
<P>
"CERRITOS -- For those of us who live in the Owens Valley, it is rare, and 
probably desirable, that we do not often get to go to the crazy world of 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Add Bronco boosters: Valley Christian 24, Bishop 6. Take Artesia Boulevard back 
to Studebaker Road., turn left and follow Studebaker back to Alondra. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tell him to his face: Heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield played the role of 
honorary special teams captain for the Atlanta Falcons during a recent game 
against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
After the Eagles won, 24-23, Holyfield visited their locker room and signed 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle safety Andre Waters wasn't pleased -- or impressed. He told Len 
Pasquerelli of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution: "Hey, he was on the 
Falcons' side. Mike Tyson's my man." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, right: Wednesday, the skies opened and the World League of American 
Football unveiled its first team, the Orlando Thunder. 
</P>
<P>
Outlined against the team colors of lime green, royal blue and white, and the 
helmet logo with its ominous blue cloud and lightning bolt, Tustin banker Raj 
Bhathal, the Thunder's owner, actually said: "Owning a team in this league 
might be better than being in the NFL."

TV-RADIO: STICKING TO BASICS MIGHT STILL PAY OFF IN FUTURE OF CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable television showed tremendous growth during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, the little network that could, went from slo-pitch softball to NFL 
football and major league baseball. Turner Broadcasting became a major player 
as well, and regional sports networks, such as Prime Ticket, started popping up 
around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
This has all been a boon for the public. Sports viewing went from a weekend 
activity to an everyday ritual. 
</P>
<P>
But the underlying fear was that maybe all this was too good to last, that 
greed would take over in the '90s and viewers would have to pay considerable 
sums of money for events they have been getting for a nominal monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
Well, today we bring you some good news: Pay is not the way. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's what a number of top cable executives, in Anaheim this week for 
the three-day Western Cable Show, are saying. 
</P>
<P>
Pay services, such as SportsChannel, are struggling, while basic services such 
as Prime Ticket -- those you get as part of your basic monthly bill -- are 
thriving. 
</P>
<P>
Economics and the genius of Bill Daniels, the father of cable television, have 
set the tone. Basic cable, as Daniels always advocated, seems the way to go for 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels owns Prime Ticket and several other regional networks, some of which 
make up the Texas-based Prime Network, which is jointly owned by Daniels and 
TeleCommunications, Inc. (TCI). 
</P>
<P>
Prime Network is only one year old, but already it reaches 22 million homes 
through 16 regional cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
It is more than twice the size of SportsChannel America. In the past year, 
SportsChannel grew from 7 million subscribers to 9.5 million. Prime grew from 
16.5 million to 22.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity in Los Angeles is far greater. Prime Ticket, which offers Lakers, 
Clippers, Kings and Pacific 10 Conference sports, has 4.2 million subscribers, 
including those in Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel Los Angeles, which lost the Clippers to Prime Ticket but still 
has non-King hockey and lots of college sports, has about 100,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Why the big difference? Simple: One is a basic service, the other a pay 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket actually is not free. Cable operators pay a per-subscriber monthly 
fee -- anywhere from 10 cents in Arizona and Hawaii to as much a $1 -- to the 
network, and that cost is passed on to subscribers in their monthly bills. 
</P>
<P>
It averages out to about 75 cents per subscriber per month. Multiply that by 
4.2 million, and you're talking about $3.15 million each month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SportsChannel, which costs roughly $10 per month, brings in about $1 
million each month from subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Now factor in Prime Ticket's higher advertising rates -- because of its larger 
audience -- and the disparity grows. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel executives claim their appeal is to the fanatic who simply can't 
get enough sports. For example, there will be 215 college basketball games on 
SportsChannel this season. 
</P>
<P>
The SportsChannel people also say they are positioned for the future, that 
eventually basic services will be forced by economics to convert to a pay 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
But John Severino, president of Prime Ticket, and Ed Frazier, president of 
Prime Network, dispute this. 
</P>
<P>
"You may see a few more selected pay-per-view events," Severino said, "but the 
way we do business now is the way we will continue to do business for years to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
Said Frazier: "We can make more money by charging less. It's as simple as that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what the viewers want, and it's what we want. Now we have to educate the 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
For years, sports teams have seen pay TV as the pot of gold at the end of an 
already money-filled rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers and the Angels, for example, haven't had great success in pay 
TV. They tried pay-per-view and, after that failed, went the SportsChannel 
route with moderate success at best. 
</P>
<P>
"Many teams wrongly think that they must be on a pay service for two reasons," 
Frazier said. "One, they think that's the way to make the most money to offset 
their rising costs, and, two, (they think) that showing home games on a basic 
channel will hurt attendance at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's been proven that there is actually more money in basic cable. And 
we've taken surveys that indicate televising home games does not hurt 
attendance." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, when Frazier was president of Home Sports Entertainment, a 
Texas regional network, he had Gallup survey subscribers determine if 
televising Texas Ranger home games affected attendance. 
</P>

"We asked: 'Are you attending fewer Ranger games now that you can watch home 
games on HSE?' What we learned was, 11% said yes, they were attending fewer 
games, but 22% said they were attending more. We viewed that as a positive 
result."

Prime Ticket, launched in 1985, has made great strides in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, there were Laker and King telecasts and not much else, at 
least not much quality programming. 
</P>
<P>
But now, through its affiliation with the Prime Network, which provides 
national programming, plus the development of its own programming, Prime Ticket 
has become a winning ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"Press Box," the half-hour local sports news program that began in October, and 
the two-year-old "It's Your Call," with host Bill Macdonald, are examples of 
the kind of programming Prime Ticket is able to develop through its financial 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, advertising provided only 15% of Prime Ticket's revenue, but 
that has grown to about 50%, and Severino's eventual goal is 80%. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers are attracted to regional networks such as Prime Ticket because of 
the home-team appeal, which national networks can't offer. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal for viewers, besides the obvious one of lower cost, is also 
convenience. Pay-per-view events and monthly pay services require a conscious 
effort. The customer has to order the service. 
</P>
<P>
With basic cable, it's basic: Just turn on your set.

basketball team, but the 49ers hope to make the most of it when they tip off 
tonight at 7:30 against sixth-ranked Stanford at University Gym.

Stanford lost to Tennessee, 95-80, Sunday at Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
"Thinking about it, to get (to the top), it looks steeper and higher than it 
did last year," Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I look at the media 
guides and think, 'How are we going to beat these teams?' " 
</P>

Stanford center Trisha Stevens, who had not practiced or played since surgery 
on both knees last April, scored 28 points against Tennessee. Julie Zeilstra 
added 17 points, Sonja Henning 15.

Desk of Memories: What was the best gift Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) ever 
received? "The desk that was used by my father when he was ambassador to the 
Court of St. James," he told Business Week, "and then was used by my brother 
John in his Senate office, and by my brother Robert in his Senate office, and 
is now with me in my Capitol Hill office . . . it provides a presence of my

Misfortune: Federal law officials in Chicago looking into the disappearance 13 
years ago of a multimillionaire candy heiress may be close to new clues. A body 
believed to be that of Helen Vorhees Brach will be exhumed and genetically 
tested, officials said Thursday. Brach controlled a $21-million fortune when 
she disappeared Feb. 17, 1977, and may have been buried in a shallow grave in a 
forest preserve south of Chicago. "We have fresh information that came out of a 
separate investigation," said one official. Once a hat-check girl in a Florida 
nightclub, Brach married chocolate king Frank Brach in 1951 and inherited his 
fortune when he died.

accepted the lost aviator's papers from Radcliffe College. The ceremony this

$200,000 from his parish to support a lavish lifestyle. The Father Philip 
Magaldi, former head of St. Anthony's parish in North Providence, R.I., was 
closed-mouthed after pleading innocent to charges of embezzlement, larceny and 
forgery. "A 'no comment' is not necessarily an admission of guilt," he said.

"Twin Peaks" stars Kyle MacLachlan (Agent Cooper) and Lara Flynn Boyle (Donna) 
were spotted shopping in Santa Monica recently. And, no, they weren't stocking 
up on doughnuts and berry pies. They were in Na Na buying practical items for 
MacLachlan: A pair of Doc Marten shoes, some E.G. Smith socks, surplus long 
johns, T-shirts and cotton sweaters. Boyle was more adventurous. She bought a 
Na Na cat suit.

A CAUSE TO SHOP: "In my 22 years as a designer, I've never seen Seventh Avenue 
come together so enthusiastically as a group for one cause," says Donna Karan, 
a co-chairman of 7th on Sale, the three-day shopping extravaganza that starts 
today in Manhattan. Proceeds benefit the New York City AIDS Fund, which seems a 
particularly apt cause for the fashion industry to support. The list of 
designers who have died of the disease is long: Halston, Willi Smith, Angel 
Estrada, Perry Ellis; and in Los Angeles, Rick Beach, Antony Moorcroft and John 
Leitch of Axis. Others widely rumored to have died of the disease, though 
officially friends and associates have denied it, are Patrick Kelly, Giorgio di 
Sant'Angelo and Isaia. The sale includes over 100 designer booths at the 69th 
Regiment Armory. And items account for more than $4.5 million in merchandise, 
some marked below wholesale prices. The Council of Fashion Designers and Vogue 
magazine, which is underwriting the event, were near their $1-million goal long 
before the sale began today. A gala $1,000-per-seat preview dinner last night 
raised more than $800,000 and more than 13,000 tickets for the sale at $10 each 
sold out last week.

WHEN HARRY MET ALEX: The stylish jazz pianist Harry Connick Jr. is being 
accompanied by Alexander Julian on threads. For his current tour, Julian put 
Connick in a charcoal blazer, navy-striped pants and a white button-down oxford 
cloth shirt (open at the neck) and the band in double-breasted, glen plaid 
suits and the trio in shades of navy. "It's a swinging look," says Julian. At 
opening night of his two-week run last Friday at the Lunt Fontanne Theatre in 
New York, Connick was so keyed up over his wardrobe he had Julian stand and 
take a bow from the audience.

BEAUTY PARLOR GOSSIP: Donna Mills has joined the growing list of film 
celebrities to shed long hair for short. Beverly Hills stylist Allen Edwards 
describes the cut as having "a '60s feeling." It tapers from short in back to 
jaw-length around the face. The retro aspect gets an assist from short, wispy 
bangs and a slightly layered, back-combed crown. How does Mills look without 
her long, wavy Hollywood hair? "More defined," Edwards says. "This brings out 
her bone structure." 
</P>
<P>
NECKTIE PARTING: L.A. neckwear designer, collector and historian Stephen 
Sotnick's garage has become so overstuffed with his rare collection of some 
3,000 vintage ties that he has decided to make a donation to the Costume 
Council at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art after the L.A. County Museum 
turned down his offer. Sotnick says he will be cataloguing more than 100 ties 
(10 examples from each decade since 1890) and delivering them to the Met by the 
end of the month. The rarest of the offering will be a group of neckties from 
1935 to 1942 "the most influential period of neckwear history," according to 
Sotnick.

MUSEUM BUYS EARLY PAINTING BY EL GRECO; 
</P>
<P>
ART: SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART ALSO ACQUIRES PIECE BY 17TH-CENTURY SPANISH 
STILL-LIFE PAINTER JUAN SANCHEZ COTAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Museum of Art has purchased an early painting on copper by El 
Greco titled "The Adoration of the Shepherds" and a religious painting on 
copper titled "St. Sebastian" by the renowned 17th-Century Spanish still-life 
painter Juan Sanchez Cotan. 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Steven Brezzo said Thursday that the museum paid "in excess of 
half a million dollars" for the El Greco and "under a hundred thousand" for the 
Sanchez Cotan. Both paintings were purchased from dealers in New York, 
according to Nora Desloge, the museum's curator of European art. 
</P>
<P>
Desloge said the works were paid for with acquisition funds accumulated from 
endowments sales over the past few years of "minor works" that had long been in 
museum vaults. 
</P>
<P>
The El Greco, dated 1572-74, has been installed for public view in the museum's 
"Mr. and Mrs. Watler Fitch Jr. Memorial Gallery" of Old Master paintings. The 
Sanchez Cotan, from about 1604, will not be displayed for at least two months 
because it needs cleaning and reframing. 
</P>
<P>
Both works complement major paintings by the same artists already in the San 
Diego museum's collection: El Greco's "The Penitent St. Peter," a large 
portrait of the saint in prayer from 1596-1600, the peak period of the artist's 
career, and Sanchez Cotan's "Quince, Cabbage, Melon and Cucumber," 1602, a 
painting that is known as one of the earliest still-life images done in Spain. 
(Only two other works by Sanchez Cotan are in collections in the United 
States.) 
</P>
<P>
Desloge said the El Greco has been on the market for at least three years, but 
the museum took time to consider the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't thought previously about (purchasing) this sort of small work," 
Desloge said; the El Greco measures just 9 1/2 inches by 7 3/8 inches, and the 
Sanchez Cotan is just 5 inches by 4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"When two copper works became available, it made them much more sensible for 
us," Desloge said, adding that the works will be installed together in a 
vitrine case. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a chance for us to enrich what we already have," she continued. 
"These works relate to two of the most important works in the museum's 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that both are of the highest quality. 
</P>
<P>
"People often think an important painting is a big painting. But exquisite, 
marvelous objects are often small." 
</P>
<P>
The El Greco is a rare and highly prized early work according to art historian 
William B. Jordan, a leading scholar in Spanish art and one of the organizers 
of the "El Greco of Toledo" exhibition shown at the National Gallery of Art in 
Washington and other museums in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the painting very much, I've always loved it," Jordan said. "That 
little picture belongs in a collection that has a painting of the type people 
expect" of El Greco, Jordan said, "like the one at the San Diego museum." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said the work was done in Italy by the Greek-born, 16th-Century master 
best known for his Expressionist religious paintings done in Spain during the 
late 16th and early 17th centuries. It was likely done in Rome at a time when 
the artist officially called himself a "miniature" painter, which means that 
his trade was to do small works and illustrations rather than large portraits 
and other major religious works. El Greco's large-scale mature style developed 
later, particularly after he moved to Toledo, Spain, in 1577. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout his career, El Greco repeated himself often," Jordan said, noting 
at least three other versions of the "Adoration of the Shepherds" known to 
scholars. The largest is a work belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch in England, 
which is the same composition but about 4 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego work shows hints of El Greco's mature style. A rich surface of 
brushwork and El Greco's luminescent colors already are in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Copper works by El Greco are very rare, Jordan said, although paintings on 
copper were common at the time and throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"They tend to be extremely prized by collectors because they don't have to be 
flattened and relined like paintings on canvas, and they don't split like 
paintings on wood. The paint also becomes translucent, the copper gives 
luminosity to the paint," Jordan said. "Connoisseurs love them." 
</P>
<P>
Desloge said Jordan, who works as an independent curator and consultant from 
Dallas, was the first to recognize the Sanchez Cotan painting as a work by the 
Spanish master. It was recently sold at auction in New York to the New York 
dealer who sold the painting to the museum, and at the time was identified only 
as being by a Flemish master. 
</P>
<P>
Desloge said the museum was aware of the painting at the time, but could not 
risk buying it until it was confirmed by Jordan and other scholars that it was 
a Sanchez Cotan. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum is not in the position to take a risk," she said.

for such displays. Sure, he cared about the turtles as much as any kid 
Wednesday night at the San Diego Sports Arena, but he maintained his critical 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
Let others rush the stage, eager to press turtle flesh. He kept his loyalties 
hidden, much like his Ninja Turtle underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Fortified with a pizza dinner -- a turtle favorite -- washed down with a glass 
of milk in a Ninja Turtle glass, Granberry headed out with dad and stepmother 
in tow to see "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Coming Out of Their Shells 
Tour." 
</P>
<P>
The show runs through Sunday as part of a nationwide concert swing. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the album has gone double platinum -- proof that almost anything 
bearing the likeness of the Ninja Turtles will sell like crazy. In their case, 
green begets green. 
</P>
<P>
To this savvy veteran of the turtle movie, as well as cartoons and video games, 
the plot that rounded out the raucous songfest held few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"Shredder will fall down," Granberry said of the turtles' arch-enemy, at the 
beginning of the second act. 
</P>
<P>
He was right. 
</P>
<P>
"The turtles always win." 
</P>
<P>
In this too, he was right. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with the Turtles, plot is not as important as execution. Granberry may 
have known the outcome, but that hardly kept him from staring with rapt 
attention at the antics on stage for roughly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Most impressive to this critic was confetti, blasted from big guns by 
Shredder's evil minions. 
</P>
<P>
"Fun," he said, bending down to collect a small, purple shred of the stuff to 
take home. And the Turtles' tossing of plastic pizzas at eager kids in the 
audience produced an appreciative -- but envious -- smile, for he would have 
loved one of those, too. 
</P>
<P>
As for the actors in this shell game, all turtles may be equal, but some are 
more equal than others -- at least in Granberry's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
He gave all the credit to the turtles' success to the green fellow with the 
blue bandanna, Leonardo, a stuffed replica of which he purchased at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the best. He did it all," he said, clutching his stuffed Leonardo, 
which he later took to bed, but not before donning his Ninja Turtle pajamas and 
slipping dreamily into his Ninja Turtle sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances are at 7:30 p.m. Friday, noon, 4 and 8 p.m. Saturday and 2 and 6 
p.m. Sunday at the San Diego Sports Arena, 3500 Sports Arena Blvd., 278-TIXS.

A. R. GURNEY CHOOSES GLOBE IN GUILD DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playwright A. R. Gurney, forced to choose between the Dramatists Guild and San 
Diego's Old Globe Theatre, has resigned from the guild and from his post as 
guild secretary. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was the contract for his new play, "The Snow Ball," scheduled to open 
at the Old Globe on May 9. The Dramatists Guild had called for a boycott of all 
members of the League of Resident Theatres that refused to adhere to a 
guild-proposed standard minimum contract 
</P>
<P>
with all playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hall, managing director of the Old Globe as well as president of the 
LORT, had adamantly rejected the guild proposal in an Oct. 11 letter. 
</P>
<P>
Gurney decided to sign with the Globe and resign from the guild. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't ask me to resign," Gurney said by phone from his New York home. 
"But they let me know that they could not approve of my relationship with the 
Old Globe since the Old Globe was not prepared to give certain rights to other 
playwrights that they had given to me. To make it easier for them, I resigned 
rather than force them to kick me out." 
</P>
<P>
He indeed would have been ousted, confirmed Peter Stone, president of the 
Dramatists Guild, from his New York office. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had not resigned, there would have been a very strong expulsion. Here is 
a man who was as responsible as anyone else for the conception of the contract, 
was in on all of the discussions, who had as much to do with it as anyone I can 
think of, who signed the letter (to the LORT theaters threatening the boycott), 
and, when it came to endangering his own production, had not the courage to 
stand with his fellows. It's not a very attractive spectacle." 
</P>
<P>
Stone said he saw only one clause in Gurney's contract, but that it alone made 
the contract unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
It was the so-called "assignment clause," which specifies who has the right to 
determine who will produce a future commercial production of a show that 
originated at a LORT theater. The official position of the guild is that a 
playwright, alone, should assign those rights. Theaters negotiate the 
assignment clause on a case-by-case basis, with better-known playwrights such 
as Gurney being given more of a say in future productions. 
</P>
<P>
In Gurney's contract, he and the Old Globe would share the assignment rights. 
This was unacceptable to Stone for two reasons: because Gurney would not have 
total control, and also because the clause made it clear that other playwrights 
might not receive even as much control as Gurney got, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gurney speculated that a theater's ultimate fear in giving the assignment 
clause away to a new or unfamiliar writer is that a playwright might elect to 
hand the next production over to his own mother. 
</P>
<P>
But Stone said theaters also could act irresponsibly, assigning the rights "to 
Saddam Hussein" or to someone who might cheat the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
The Globe's Hall defended the theater's right to help choose a play's future 
producers: "When we're investing a half a million dollars in a production, you 
expect you'll have some say in its future. You never make that money back in a 
nonprofit theater. The only hope is to make it back in a commercial 
production." 
</P>
<P>
For Gurney, it was a question of divided loyalties in a painful internal 
struggle that the Globe ultimately won. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an argument of two rights, and I got caught in the middle. It's never 
pleasant to be in exile. I feel sad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dramatists Guild members "believe very strongly that they want to bring the 
moment to its crisis. I felt equally strongly that I had certain loyalties or 
obligations that I couldn't deny. (Old Globe Artistic Director) Jack (O'Brien) 
and I had been working on this for over a year. I couldn't walk away from it. 
And the contract that was proposed to me was eminently fair." 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe premiered two of Gurney's plays, "Another Antigone" and "The 
Cocktail Hour." Although "The Snow Ball" will actually debut at the Hartford 
(Conn.) Stage in February, it will be a co-production with the Globe, which has 
handled all of the negotiations on the project. Hartford is also a member of 
LORT, an association of 68 nonprofit theaters that also includes the Mark Taper 
Forum in Los Angeles, the South Coast Repertory Theatre in Costa Mesa and the 
La Jolla Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Globe is free from any similar battles for the rest of the winter 
season, Hall said. Every other playwright is either signed or, like August 
Wilson, is not a member of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hall said he is planning to meet with representatives of the guild in 
New York in about two weeks to talk to them in "a nonnegotiating form." 
</P>
<P>
"I am anxious to do this," he said. "My first response for the Globe is that 
I'm very happy about this result (with 'The Snow Ball'). But, as the president 
of the league, it's not helpful to have any antagonism. I feel the playwrights 
are getting caught between two principles, and it causes me concern for the 
future of playwrights and LORT theaters."

Auction News: An auction of antiquities Tuesday night in New York toted up $6 
million in sales for Hesperia Arts Auction Ltd., an auction house recently 
formed by Bruce McNall, owner of the Los Angeles Kings and a longtime collector 
of coins and antiquities. Only six of 74 items offered failed to sell, but the 
top piece, a Greek bronze mirror valued at as much as $1 million, sold for 
$605,000. CLAUDIA PUIG

Director Must Pay: A Greek court has fined director Costa-Gavras $10,000 for 
defaming extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen during a television talk show. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial Le Pen sued the Greek-born director of the political 
thrillers "Missing" and "Z" for remarks he made in March about Le Pen's past, 
his personal life and his wealth. Le Pen sued both the director and the show's 
host who, he said, should have immediately forced the director to temper his 
remarks. Le Pen, president of the anti-immigration National Front, has lost 
numerous defamation suits and has been fined for racist and anti-Semitic 
remarks, according to wire reports. CLAUDIA PUIG

JAZZ NOTES: NEW SOUNDS AT THE LISTENING POSTS;

THE BILTMORE CONVERTS TO A SOFT FORMAT; CENTRAL PARK WEST EXPANDS ITS JAZZ 
POTENTIAL,

The jazz clubs come and go, not talking of Michelangelo but of be-bop, 
standards and great lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Going tonight is the Grand Avenue Bar of the Biltmore Hotel, where a 
performance by Brian O'Rourke (piano), John Leitham (bass) and Kenny Dennis 
(drums) is the setting sun of that room's four-year policy of presenting name 
jazz artists. Monday, the bar ensues its new schedule of "soft jazz" duos and 
trios that are designed to serve as backgrounds for conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Coming, not necessarily in the bar's place but certainly a boon for Westside 
listeners, is the adding of a bevy of first-class vocalists, pianists and 
bassists to the bistro fare at Central Park West, 11604 San Vicente Blvd., 
Brentwood. Music began at the restaurant Thursday with the duo pianist Tom 
Garvin and bassist John Heard. Ruth Price, who provides a similar service to 
Giorgio's in Long Beach, is booking the room, and working, there, too. She 
appears tonight and Saturday with Garvin and bassist Tom Warrington. 
</P>
<P>
"I went in and talked to owner Reto Ryffel and he got really excited," Price 
says of how things got under way. "He let me build a stage and pick the sound 
system and everything. I'm just hoping it's going to be good. You never know 
until it starts, but it feels good." 
</P>
<P>
Music at CPW runs from 9:30 p.m.-12:30 a.m., Thursdays-Saturday, and 7:30-11:30 
p.m., Sundays. A $5 cover charge is imposed, though there's no cover with a 
dinner purchase. Also on the schedule: singer Fatima Guedes with Billy Childs 
(piano) and Tony Dumas (bass), this Sunday and next; and Mike Wofford (piano) 
with bassists Warrington, Heard and Monty Budwig on Dec. 6-8, respectively. On 
Dec. 7-8, Price will sing too. Information: (213) 207-9998.

Those Benefit Birthday Gals: For the second year in a row, Ellen Cohn, vice 
president of the Chase Music Group record label, and Jeri Nelson, saleswoman 
for Precision Sound, an independent record distributor, are celebrating their 
mutual birthdays by holding a benefit Tuesday at Bon Appetit in Westwood. 
Keyboardist Dan Siegel, drummer Alphonse Mouzon and guitarist Carl Verheyen 
headline the evening whose proceeds go to Haven Hills, a shelter for abused 
women and children in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a story in the paper about a hotelier in Woodland Hills who works in 
conjunction with Haven Hills and who was providing rooms to abused women who 
were referred by the facility," says Cohn, who turns 33 on Tuesday. "I thought 
that was a great idea and it spurred me to want to help." 
</P>
<P>
Donation: $15. Information: (213) 208-3830. 
</P>
<P>
Just Out: According to sax master Sonny Rollins, one fan of the newly released 
"The Complete Dean Benedetti Recordings of Charlie Parker" (Mosaic), the 10 
LP/7 CD package containing 278 previously unheard solos, is alto wizard Jackie 
McLean, who early in his career strongly emulated Parker before developing his 
own sound and style. "Jackie doesn't like to talk about Bird, he doesn't want 
to be associated with Bird since he was so much in the past, but he raved about 
this (set), so it must be smoking," Rollins says. "I'm also anxious to hear 
it," the tenorist adds. 
</P>
<P>
Airwave Alert: Bernie Pearl returns to Southland radio, hosting "The Blues Roll 
On," Sundays, 9-11 p.m., on KCRW-FM (89.9), beginning Dec. 2. Pearl is well 
known for his "Nothin' But the Blues," which, until it left the air recently, 
was heard on KLON-FM (88.1) for about a decade. . . . Branford Marsalis, who 
leads his quartet tonight at UCLA's Royce Hall and Sunday at the Wadsworth 
Theater, is the in-studio guest this Sunday on Tom Schnabel's "Sunday Brunch," 
airing 11 a.m.-12:30 p.m. also on KCRW. 
</P>
<P>
Rim Shots: A tribute to the Pacific Jazz record label, which helped launch the 
West Coast Jazz movement in the '50s, will highlight KLON's fourth annual 
Christmas Party. The bash, which begins at 8 p.m. Dec. 15 at UCLA's Wadsworth 
Theater, Brentwood, will feature the current quartets of saxmen Gerry Mulligan 
and Bud Shank and a re-assembling of drummer Chico Hamilton's late-'50s chamber 
jazz quintet, with reedman Buddy Collette and cellist Fred Katz on board.

TUNESMITHS CROON THEIR OWN CREATIONS

On stage at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, Allan Rich was recalling the advice he 
kept getting as a struggling songwriter. "Allan, don't write ballads!" he kept 
repeating like an industry mantra. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get 'em placed anywhere anymore!" 
</P>
<P>
That's counsel he and most of the other writers on the bill at the fifth annual 
Salute to the American Songwriter program Wednesday have ignored, and 
profitably. 
</P>
<P>
It was virtually a Salute to the Contemporary American Love Ballad, with such 
adult-contemporary song factories as Rich ("I Don't Have the Heart"), David 
Foster ("Glory of Love"), Tom Snow and Barry Mann ("Don't Know Much"), Charles 
Fox ("Killing Me Softly") and Jeff Silbar ("Wind Beneath My Wings") on hand to 
make a stab at crooning their own creations. 
</P>
<P>
These writers, who rarely get a chance to be on stage, were almost invariably 
enjoyably hammy, and though many of them proved quite capable vocalists, the 
irony inherent in the occasional top tunesmith's not being able to carry a tune 
made even weaker moments diverting. Plus: Only on this occasion can one go to a 
hall usually reserved for classical pieces and hear an earnest, full-band 
rendition of the theme from "The Love Boat." 
</P>
<P>
Ideological or non-love songs and singer-songwriters were under-represented. 
Filling both niches was Jackson Browne, with "World in Motion" as one of his 
two choices. Country's Dwight Yoakam also turned in an all-too-brief, two-song 
acoustic turn, and '60s folk-rock figure P.F. Sloan ("Eve of Destruction," 
"Secret Agent") made an exceedingly rare appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The long evening was capped after midnight with a lifetime achievement award to 
-- and medley from -- Motown greats Barrett Strong and Norman Whitfield, 
reunited after 20 years and joined by the full cast on "I Heard It Through the 
Grapevine." CHRIS WILLMAN

BUD'S PURE GIRL-POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From Blondie and the Go-Go's in the '70s to contemporary groups like the 
Primitives and Voice of the Beehive, pure girl-pop, mid-'60s vintage, has cast 
an enduring spell. 
</P>
<P>
It usually comes with an ironic angle these days, but the Darling Buds take it 
on their own terms. 
</P>
<P>
At the Whisky on Wednesday, singer Andrea Lewis' neo-'60s look evoked the era 
without re-creating it, and the young Welsh band's music rested on period 
values -- exuberance, innocence, sunny melodies, catchy hooks -- without 
sounding overly retro. 
</P>
<P>
But fundamentally, it is retro, and while the Buds are a little too inventive 
to be cast as revivalists, they aren't bold enough to become innovators. On 
their album, "Crawdaddy," they thicken the pop with dense, twisted textures, 
lending it an off-center quality. At the Whisky, though, they mainly rocked -- 
about a hundred times harder than they do on the album. 
</P>
<P>
But as much as the band put into its music, it's ultimately an unambitious 
endeavor, lacking the great songs and the compelling stance to make it more 
than a genre exercise. RICHARD CROMELIN

STAGE BEAT: PARTY GETS OUT OF HAND IN 'CATCH'

What fun can there be in going to plays night after night? Critics hear the 
question all the time, and have different answers. This corner's answer is 
simple: Seeing a playwright come up with a better play than his last one. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason why Gary Jacobelly's raucous "Catch" at Al's Bar is fun (it's 
also serious, but more on that in a moment). Jacobelly is clearly getting his 
voice together. His last play, also at Al's, was a dreadful bit of word spew 
called "The Skin Man." But it was obviously necessary for him to get something 
out of his system before "Catch." There's a real play here. 
</P>
<P>
Director Tim Hanson and a dedicated cast have certainly helped. Jacobelly sets 
up a funny situation, in which Tony (a slightly stilted Jeff Hawk), a bitter 
San Pedro kid who wants to get out of town, ends up hosting a party when a 
bunch of people come over unannounced. Hanson and company start the juices 
flowing, creating just the right tension between a good time and a weird one. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't easy to do, but it is this tension which is at the heart of "Catch." 
We hardly need to mention that drugs are the fulcrum, but they help define 
character. Tony sees the bag of coke as his meal ticket; whacked-out Gino (a 
fine Michael Costello) can't take the challenge it poses. Tony's pal Mike (a 
cherubic Ken Abraham) hasn't made up his mind, so his character is muddied. 
Bob-o (a fearsome Peter Josephs) wants it all to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Two things "Catch" does very well: the females are sharply defined, not at all 
hangers-on (Sharon Clark, Melanie Chapman and J. Allison Foust make sure of 
that); Jacobelly toys with no less than four alternate climaxes (three of them 
outrageously paranoid) that instantly get us inside Tony's head. It's not a 
nice place to be, but it's good theater.

'Other Five Percent' at the Powerhouse 
</P>
<P>
Even if you suspend your disbelief at the door of the Powerhouse, you still may 
not believe the play going on inside -- Bryan Goluboff's "The Other Five 
Percent." 
</P>
<P>
It's fanciful enough that Goluboff sets up naive, suburban teen Amy (Jennifer 
Trinker, a tad mature for a teen) as being so lost in New York City on 
Halloween that she's in the uninhabited meat-packing district, yet so lucky 
that she runs into nice, gregarious Hughie (Sean Gavigan). She seems to warm up 
to him, but misunderstands his friendliness and runs for protection (in this 
neighborhood?) 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, she finds a cop (Doug Hutchison), who, incredibly, knows Hughie 
from his halcyon high school days. Hutchison has a gun, and Hughie is wearing a 
skeleton costume, so we know where this is going. We just can't believe that it 
got this far. Hutchison revs up his actor's engine under Gwenn Victor's 
direction, but it looks like an exercise in a play that needs rethinking. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica, Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until Dec. 
9. $10; (213) 466-1767.

'Yankee Wives' at Two Roads Theatre 
</P>
<P>
Playwright David Rimmer needs to do a reality check with his serio-comic 
"Yankee Wives," at Two Roads Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
First presented at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre in 1982, "Yankee Wives" has 
reportedly been rewritten. But despite this, and despite the play's time frame 
(10 years hence, then the present), Rimmer's new draft doesn't mention the 
decade's most important Yankee: George Steinbrenner. A key man for any Yankee 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
A play like this needs those touches of reality to keep it from flying off into 
the melodramatic la-la land where so many baseball dramas go. Sure enough, 
that's the destiny of Rimmer's play, and it's the final indicator that "Yankee 
Wives" deeply suffers from a strong sense that this is writing not from 
observation, but from a desire for a commercial hit. 
</P>
<P>
Mark York's staging unwisely stresses this, so that when cute buddy wives 
Connie and Ronnie (perky Kathy Griffin and Terri Girvin) are on, it's the old 
comic relief shtick. Then, when the sturm hits the drang, and self-appointed 
Wives' manager Sally (a weak Shannon Eubanks) must confront either rival 
Marceline (a smooth Cyndi James Gossett) or rule-breaking Pam (Mary McDonough, 
never credible as an ex-swimming champ), it's soap opera without the commercial 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The breath of fresh air here is Sarah Trigger's Wyla, too young to know what to 
do with her rookie husband's incredible stardom and too guileless to conceal 
it. But Rimmer's contrived tragic ending forces Trigger and her team to 
navigate in emotionally impossible waters after what's been a generally light 
comedy. On or off the field, a poor era for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
At 4348 Tujunga Blvd., Studio City, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
Sundays, 2 p.m., until Dec. 16. $12; (818) 766-9381.

'Gallows Humor' Fails to Live Up to Title 
</P>
<P>
Absurdist comedy is dangerous business, which is why when it works, it is an 
aesthetic earthquake. When it doesn't, the show is turned to rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Why director Jerry Beal's revival of Jack Richardson's "Gallows Humor" doesn't 
work at Theatre 40 is only superficially because it doesn't live up to its 
title. More importantly, it's not a play at all, but a construct for Richardson 
to drive some points home via stick characters as mouthpieces. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, the warden (Gene Ross) upsets the soon-to-be-hanged Walter 
(Jack Gregory) and his orderly world with a surprise guest (the wooden Lorraine 
Michaels). In the second half, Ross' warden upsets the domestic stasis of his 
executioner's household (Gregory and wife Michaels). Beyond some thinly veiled 
misogyny, Richardson wants us to see the hanger and hangee as mirrors of each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme is as dry as the writing. The wife complains, "Your kiss would mean 
that I would have to breathe through my nose for its duration." Everyone talks 
in the same complex, compound sentences, as if George Santayana tried his hand 
at dialogue. Warden, let us out of here. 
</P>
<P>
And since this is one of Theater 40's low-budget shows, Beal had to fit things 
onto the set of the bigger-budget "Losing It in Cross Plains," which includes 
an overhead tree branch. Rather than lose the branch, Beal lets it jut into the 
prison cell space. 
</P>
<P>
 At 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills High School, Mondays through Wednesdays, 8 
p.m., until Dec. 12. $10; (213) 466-1767.

HOKEY PLOT CLOUDS 'VISIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Night Visions" (tonight at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39) is a supernatural buddy 
movie about a gruff, tough cop paired with a naive female partner who happens 
to be telepathic and have multiple personalities -- sort of a Nick 
Nolte-meets-Sybil thing. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Craven directed and co-wrote, but there's scant trace of any of the style 
or imagination that marked his best feature horror films, such as "Nightmare on 
Elm Street." Instead, he has hit rock bottom with this hokey, ill-conceived 
cross between "Eyes of Laura Mars" and "48 HRS," which has failed pilot written 
all over it and fails even minimal credulity tests both as a cop picture and 
thriller. 
</P>
<P>
James Remar -- a character actor attempting to make the leap from villain to 
hero, a la Willem Dafoe -- is the crusty, hard-drinking, hard-driving veteran 
of the force, so wired that he terrorizes suspects to the point of 
incontinence. Illogically, while investigating a highly publicized serial 
killer case, he's required to drag along a criminal psychology grad student, 
Loryn Locklin, whom no one initially seems to realize is a gifted psychic. 
</P>
<P>
The supernatural elements are unnecessarily confusing. Locklin keeps going into 
strange trances where she seems to turn into someone else, and initially, we 
figure she is telepathically interlocking with other characters (possibly the 
impending victims), or maybe channeling one of Ramtha's Valley Girl cousins. 
But eventually it turns out she has got wacky multiple personalities as well as 
soothsaying talent. Not exactly someone you want on an LAPD ride-along program. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the average viewer's psychic powers will prove much better than 
the heroine's rather low-wattage abilities. The identity of the killer is so 
obviously telegraphed throughout that if you don't figure it out within the 
first 45 minutes, you might check your pulse to make sure you haven't already 
been his next victim. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what?" a policewoman pal tells Locklin. "You are totally spooky!" Not 
so with the tacky "Night Visions," which has to settle for totally contrived.

STAGE PARENTS' GUIDE TO HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: BARBARA SCHIFFMAN GIVES ADVICE TO THOSE WHO THINK THEIR CHILDREN 
OUGHT TO BE IN PICTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE ZIAYA-ZEIGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ziaya-Zeiger is a Sylmar 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Risa Schiffman told her parents that she wanted to be on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Barbara Schiffman, secretly hoped her now 10-year-old daughter's 
desire was simply a whim. After working in the entertainment industry for 16 
years, Schiffman had firsthand experience with the pitfalls of Hollywood -- 
endless auditions, massive rejection and callous adults. But when Risa 
persisted and finally embarked on an acting career, Schiffman became a screen 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
The mother soon learned that there were many things she didn't know and 
resources seemed practically non-existent. Where should her daughter go for 
acting classes? How could she find an agent? Should she get a portfolio of 
photographs made? Many parents who were in the same situation seemed equally 
perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
Schiffman's research eventually resulted in the founding in 1988 of the 
Hollywood Screen Parents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of her Burbank house, she established an organization that serves 
as a support network for parents of young performers and a clearinghouse for 
information about the entertainment industry. Currently, the group's membership 
numbers about 125 parents, most from Southern California, with a few from out 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
For an annual fee of $30, members receive three newsletters and an additional 
pamphlet on classes and other relevant information. Members are also able to 
borrow books about show business from a lending library Schiffman operates from 
her house. 
</P>
<P>
The association also has a casting liaison service in which Schiffman keeps 
photographs of members' acting children on file for casting directors and 
others in search of juvenile performers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Schiffman's association is its 
advice and research service available to members and non-members. Anyone can 
leave a question regarding show business on Schiffman's answering machine and, 
within a few days, receive an answer. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Berkovitz of Sherman Oaks, mother of 10-year-old fraternal twins Dustin 
and Lindsay, said Hollywood Screen Parents has worked for her. For the past 
five years, her son Dustin has been carving out his own niche with television 
roles in TV movies such as "Brat Patrol" and commercials for Log Cabin and 
Kraft Touch of Butter. 
</P>
<P>
However, her daughter Lindsay, who has cerebral palsy, also wanted to act. 
</P>
<P>
"I had looked for an agent off and on for her for a few years," Berkovitz said, 
noting that she had little success, "I suppose because most people didn't want 
to be bothered with a child with special needs." 
</P>
<P>
But after contacting Schiffman last year, the situation changed. Schiffman gave 
her a few leads and Berkovitz finally found an agent. As a result, Lindsay 
landed a job on a McDonald's commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Guzek of Anaheim tells a similar story. Her son Christian, 13, has been 
in show business for the past five years, doing voice-overs on a Fox Television 
cartoon series, "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," as well as appearing 
periodically as Jake Bitterman on the ABC-TV sitcom "Full House." But when 
Christian wasn't working, it never occurred to Guzek to file for the state 
unemployment benefits available to her son -- until she contacted Schiffman. 
</P>
<P>
Under Screen Actors Guild regulations, union production companies must 
contribute to the state unemployment tax fund for each actor they employ. When 
a performer is not working, he or she may be eligible for state unemployment 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say enough good things about Barbara," Guzek said. "She's really 
helpful. She explores avenues in her newsletter that screen parents would be 
interested in. She always researches everything very thoroughly and comes up 
with the right answer." 
</P>
<P>
In her newsletter, Schiffman, 40, offers information on taxes, labor laws, 
unions, audition strategies and acting classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara's certainly not making money," said Beverly Hills talent agent Joan 
Mangum, who has known Schiffman for two years. "She's not making much of 
anything except a good impression on the people she's involved with." 
</P>
<P>
"She provides a lot of information," said Dick Woody, a talent agent with Terry 
Lichtman Co. in Studio City who met Schiffman at industry speaker forums. "For 
parents who want further knowledge about show business, the Hollywood Screen 
Parents Assn. is a central way to obtain information. Barbara really knows the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most common questions from parents, Schiffman said, is: "How can I 
find an agent for my child?" 
</P>
<P>
However, there are more difficult issues, she said, such as dealing with a 
child's rejection and finding the time and money to invest in a child's career. 
Schiffman estimates that a child will have to audition 50 times to land a 
single job. This, she said, is due in part to the scarcity of jobs and the 
abundance of child actors. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 73,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild nationwide, 6,000 are age 18 
and younger, and one-quarter of them are age 9 and younger. According to guild 
statistics, last year 3,200 child actors were employed at least once. However, 
Schiffman said, only about 100 to 200 child actors work regularly. 
</P>
<P>
The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists does not keep age 
statistics on its membership. 
</P>
<P>
To cope with all the rejection, Schiffman encourages parents to keep everything 
in perspective. "Kids need to stay involved in other activities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to keep Risa doing kid things," said Glenn Schiffman, Barbara's 
screenwriter husband. "She plays soccer, goes to camp every summer. And she has 
a lot of other interests. That's always been crucial. Make sure your child 
stays a child. Don't make being a star more important than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Schiffman said she also stresses the importance of attitude, and 
stresses to her daughter that frequently a person is often cast because a 
particular physical appearance is required for the role. 
</P>
<P>
"We love her no matter what happens," Glenn Schiffman said. "We tell her how we 
feel about her has nothing to do with the parts she gets or doesn't get." 
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the business that parents need to consider is the financial 
risk, she said. Especially during the first year, Barbara Schiffman advises 
parents not to expect their children to earn much. And once they do begin 
making money, a good deal of the income will go to agents (usually 10%), 
managers (15%), taxes (25%), plus many other expenses such as initial union 
dues ($800) and photographs ($200 to $400). And screen parents must have a lot 
of free time to take their children to auditions and callbacks. 
</P>
<P>
For Risa's career, the Schiffmans often rearrange their schedules to 
accommodate the demands of their daughter's, whose credits include the parts of 
Jennifer Baxter in the film "It Nearly Wasn't Christmas" with actor Charles 
Durning, and Scrapper in the pilot for the television series "The New Our 
Gang." Risa is currently in the play "Accompanied by Adults" at the Science of 
Mind Church in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
When Risa's career began to take off, Schiffman decided to leave her full-time 
job as development assistant for producer Dan Petrie Jr. at Disney Studios. 
Alternatively, she pursued free-lance assignments such as writing, script 
reading and script consulting. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 years ago, when Schiffman worked as assistant to the president at 
Wakeford-Orloff, a large commercial production company in Los Angeles, she 
couldn't imagine herself as a screen parent. After witnessing so many stage 
parents primping their children in the waiting room, she said she had silently 
vowed, "I will never do that. 
</P>
<P>
"Years later, I found myself doing the same thing," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Actively participating in a child's show business career invariably creates 
stress for screen parents, Barbara Schiffman said. Isolation and negative 
reactions from casting directors, agents and directors are common. 
</P>
<P>
"They treated me like they just wanted me to sit in the corner and shut up," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Berkovitz has had similar experiences. "Once your child gets the job and you're 
sitting there on the set, you feel like an ant," she said. "You know you're not 
wanted or needed. I've even heard negative comments about stage moms right on 
the set." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, despite the obvious drawbacks, children -- and their parents -- 
continue to strive for success in show business. Some are lured by the 
lucrative pay, said Barbara Schiffman, who added that minimum guild pay for a 
television feature is $431 a day and $1,498 a week. Others view the business as 
an opportunity for their children to develop self-confidence and have fun in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the reason, Schiffman reminds parents not to forget they are 
involved in a business. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was just beginning and met Schiffman, I would have gone through a lot 
less suffering and headaches," Berkovitz said. 
</P>

SASCH CLUB WILL HAVE NEW OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sasch, the popular Studio City nightclub, is changing owners, according to 
general manager Marlon Parry. 
</P>
<P>
Parry said the sale entered escrow last month and will become official in early 
December. 
</P>
<P>
As a tribute from current staff members, a farewell concert at the club will be 
held at 8 p.m. Dec. 8, featuring Faultline, the house band. Faultline contains 
several members of Ecstasy, including lead singer Debra Raye. Until earlier 
this year, Ecstasy played at Sasch every weekend for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's call it a last hurrah," Parry said. "We just want to thank all the 
people who have played here over the years." He said several signed acts, such 
as Bad English, have been invited to the show. 
</P>
<P>
Parry said that he believes the new owners -- Richard Kritzer and Arkady Kivman 
-- plan to make some changes, such as instituting food service at the club. He 
said he is unaware of any changes in entertainment. For years, Sasch featured 
mainly Top 40 music, but recently added more up-tempo rock 'n' roll, bringing 
in a range of local bands. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes have been very successful," Parry said. "We feel like people have 
been very receptive." 
</P>
<P>
Parry said the current owner, Tom Chin, has owned Sasch for nine years. MICHAEL

HONDO'S ONLY LOOKS STRAIT-LACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hondo's is a batty little place, specializing in fare I'd be tempted to call 
nouvelle Southwest. And like Glendale itself, it might look pretty strait-laced 
from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
But get a load of all the waiters in those beachy shirts and the buckets that 
hang upside down over the tables, pretending to be lampshades. And then eyeball 
the fun-loving office crowd that frequents this place. There is something wild 
lurking beneath the surface in all this. 
</P>
<P>
We soon discover what that is. If you can tear your attention away from all the 
cactus, serapes and plastic flamingos, you discover that Hondo's is actually 
attempting something original. Don't be fooled by those tropical drinks with 
the plagiarized names like Baja Breeze and Sonora Sunset. The whole menu is 
full of creative, wildly bizarre dishes you'll be curious to taste. Some of 
them even work. 
</P>
<P>
As in most nouvelle Southwest restaurants, you're given the opportunity to fill 
up on chips and salsa before the server has time to take your order. Here, 
thanks to a basket of warm, crunchy chips and a dark, smoky salsa, it is a 
temptation you won't want to resist. 
</P>
<P>
Appetizers are found under a section misnamed "little Mexican plates," possibly 
because the management may have decided that naming this section "little 
Mexican, Japanese and Thai plates" would have unglued the faithful. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it would have. Thai-quitos is one of the weirdest dishes I've run 
across: rolled and deep-fried tortillas filled with minced chicken and 
accompanied by spicy wasabi and a Thai dipping sauce. Say what? 
</P>
<P>
Then there is that traditional south-of-the-border treat, chicken satay -- the 
grilled chicken skewers you find all over Southeast Asia. Hondo's serves this 
dish with a sweet yellow curry sauce and an oddly appealing salsa made from 
fresh banana. 
</P>
<P>
Potato rojas tacos are a dish that is original and still fits the Southwestern 
context. It's terrific, steamy corn tortillas stuffed with seasoned diced 
potato and onion, with a topping of white cheese and roasted tomatillo salsa. 
Now that's getting it right. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican pizza gets it right too: chicken jalapeno sausage with jack and Cheddar 
cheese plus several Mexican toppings, laid smartly atop a crisp flour tortilla. 
If Taco Bell made one half this good, even I would make a run for the border. 
</P>
<P>
The many choices on this menu render a snap decision nearly impossible. If you 
want something simple, like a sandwich, you get to puzzle over such 
possibilities as blackened chicken, torta de carnitas, even a charbroiled skirt 
steak. All of them are unduly complicated by avocado, red onion and a red chili 
mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional Cal-Mex side of the menu is more familiar, but many of the 
dishes have been gussied up to confuse you. The Hondo is a quesadilla with 
smoked chicken, Gouda cheese and papaya salsa (a combination that works like a 
charm). How about a veggie burrito? That would be a flour tortilla stuffed with 
mesquite-grilled vegetables and black beans. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the section called "platos Tex-Mexicanos" is my favorite because it 
is the most straightforward. And that's where you find monster plates like the 
sizzling fajita: a good grilled flank steak and margarita chicken breast. 
</P>
<P>
The best dish in the section is Corona fish tacos, where beer-battered, 
deep-fried halibut is served taco-style, dressed with lime and pico de gallo. 
The tacos are lightly fried, and the fish is fresh and sweet. They taste as 
good as the ones you get at stalls in Rosarito Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The big loser? Easy. That would be the barbecue baby back ribs, honey-glazed 
and served with a mushy corn pudding. Everything on the plate is sticky-sweet 
and strangely spiced, altogether dreadful. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a shock, upon reflection. The biggest flaw in this kitchen is its 
liberal use of sugar. Even the jalapeno fries have been dipped in a sugared 
batter to make them brown up uniformly, making a greasy mess. Many other side 
dishes -- corn pudding for one -- are just plain too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the desserts are too sweet as well. Warm bread pudding makes your teeth 
hurt, and the Mexican honey flan isn't much better. I do like the traditional 
hot fudge brownie, and the good vanilla bean ice cream that comes on top. But 
it's awfully . . . well, strait-laced. 
</P>
<P>

BARRIER DIVIDES MEETING ON MIGRANT SAFETY; 
</P>
<P>
FATALITIES: OPINION IS SPLIT ON WHETHER A 10-FOOT HIGH FREEWAY-MEDIAN BARRIER 
WOULD REDUCE THE CARNAGE OF ALIENS. 
</P>

<P>
Immigrant advocates and enforcement officials seeking ways to reduce accidents 
involving undocumented pedestrians on San Diego-area freeways clashed Thursday 
over a proposal to erect 10-foot-high barriers along parts of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
While representatives of the U.S. Border Patrol and the California Highway 
Patrol strongly endorsed the barrier concept, immigrant representatives from 
San Diego and Orange County voiced fears that such a step could result in more 
injuries by trapping exhausted and frightened immigrants in the median strips 
of hazardous expressways. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to save one life," Lee Steelman, a member of the 
Human Resources Committee of the city of San Clemente, said during an 
informational meeting in Oceanside sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Peace 
(D-Chula Vista.) "I just see panic." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the California Department of Transportation, which is contemplating 
the construction of freeway barriers, disclosed that it had decided to halve 
the number of traffic lanes from 8 to 4 on the approximately 3-mile strip of 
I-5 near the U.S.-Mexico border where most of the accidents occur. 
</P>
<P>
The hope, Caltrans officials said, is that fewer lanes and consequently 
slower-moving traffic will reduce the frequency of pedestrian injuries in the 
targeted area, along I-5 between the international boundary and the off-ramps 
leading to California Highway 905. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that the reduction in lanes -- the northbound and southbound 
roadways each would be cut from 4 to 2 lanes -- should not significantly hamper 
the flow of traffic, said Stuart Harvey, deputy district director for the 
Caltrans district office in San Diego. The move is "not irreversible," Harvey 
added, explaining that the other lanes could be restored if traffic tie-ups did 
develop. The change is planned for sometime early next year, Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're breaking new ground here . . . in dealing with an extraordinarily 
unusual problem," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting was the latest in a series of sessions designed to devise 
solutions to the bloody problem, which has seen San Diego-area freeways emerge 
in recent years as death traps for scores of undocumented immigrants en route 
north from the border. Since January 1987, according to the California Highway 
Patrol, 101 immigrant pedestrians have been killed and an additional 110 
injured after being struck by vehicles on area expressways. The problem is 
unique to San Diego, one of the world's busiest migratory corridors. 
</P>
<P>
Two major trouble spots have emerged: The 3-mile strip of I-5 just north of the 
border, and, 70 miles to the north, an 8-mile section of I-5 in Camp Pendleton. 
The border-area freeway presents a barrier to undocumented immigrants who have 
just crossed from Tijuana, and the more northern section is regularly crossed 
on foot by immigrants attempting to evade detection at the Border Patrol 
checkpoint at San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, authorities attempting to reduce the carnage have taken a 
number of steps, including increasing freeway lighting; thinning roadside brush 
that provides cover for border-jumpers; posting warning signs advising 
motorists of the danger; and the airing of public service spots on television 
and radio publicizing the threat. The number of deaths has mounted anyway. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Border Patrol has attempted to devise strategies to keep 
migrants off the freeways, and the California Highway Patrol has increased 
officer presence near the checkpoint in an effort to reduce motorists' speed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have voiced the hope that the cumulative strategies are having some 
impact. No immigrant pedestrians have been killed on the freeways in two 
months, officials say, although several have been injured. 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo De la Vina, chief Border Patrol agent, said agents are now spotting 
about 100 people along the median of I-5 in the border area on a typical 
Saturday, down from almost 500 a month ago. He credited patrols deployed to 
force immigrants away from roadways. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Caltrans plans to erect changeable message signs along I-5 in the 
border area. The signs will be used to warn motorists that pedestrians might be 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, other strategies are under consideration, including the controversial 
proposal to build 10-feet-high metal barriers in the freeway medians in the two 
principal danger zones. Caltrans says it will make a decision on whether to 
proceed with construction of the barriers sometime early next year, possibly 
after holding public hearings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say such unscalable barriers would discourage immigrants from 
embarking on the hazardous dash across the expressways. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that something like this would help," said Capt. Ron 
Phulps of the California Highway Patrol, in comments echoed by De la Vina of 
the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
But immigrant advocates say immigrants would probably just walk around the 
barriers -- or, worse, become trapped and panicked in the median areas.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: OF BOVINES AND PROVOLONE, MANLY HANDSHAKES AND THE POLITICS 
OF MILK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By Tony Perry 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lured by an award-winning provolone, I am at the San Diego Convention Center 
(and adjoining Marriott Hotel) for the annual convention of the National Milk 
Producers Federation. 
</P>
<P>
These are 1,400 people who make a living in milk. 
</P>
<P>
Some are farmers who begin each morning, summer-fall-winter-and-spring, staring 
at the business end of a cow or a two. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these farmers have developed bone-squeezing handshakes. It's an 
occupational asset but sometimes a social liability. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the convention are officers of milk cooperatives and 
agribusiness conglomerates. Their hands rarely touch anything more rough-hewn 
than the pages of the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Different people have different reasons for praising the convention center: the 
nifty architecture, the billion-dollar boost it provides for the tourist 
industry, blah, blah. . . . Myself, I like it because it attracts people and 
concerns we might otherwise miss in homogenous San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
When, for example, is the last time you witnessed a heated discussion of bovine 
mastitis? 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the main concerns of the convention. That and politics. Both can 
wipe out a herd. 
</P>
<P>
Federal price supports are life and death. Collectively and individually, milk 
producers play politics to the max. 
</P>
<P>
The convention keynote speaker is trend spotter Kevin Phillips, author of "The 
Politics of Rich and Poor." 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers: Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee; Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza (D-Tex.), chairman of the House 
Agriculture Committee, and Reps. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) and Harold L. 
Volkmer (D-Mo.), both members of the House Ag Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Can you spell h-o-n-o-r-a-r-i-u-m? 
</P>
<P>
"Only 52 members of Congress give a damn about agriculture," said Earl 
Strehlow, a dairy farmer from Hettinger, N.D. "The rest just want cheap food: 
something for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The convention opener is a cheese contest, judged by two food science 
professors and an expert from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The criteria: 
aroma, flavor, body and texture. 
</P>
<P>
The grand winner is this year's provolone by Mid-America Dairymen Inc. of 
Bloomer, Wis. I find it delicate yet provocative. 
</P>
<P>
John Gherty, president-chief executive officer of Land O' Lakes Inc. of 
Minneapolis, insists that I try his medium Cheddar, which took a first in its 
category. I find it perky yet not presumptuous. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Joe Carroll, who runs the St. Vincent de Paul-Joan Kroc Center for the 
homeless in downtown San Diego, has gotten the milk producers to pledge 2,000 
pounds of cheese for the center. 
</P>
<P>
He's working the crowd. "I'll take cash, out-of-town checks, more cheese, 
anything you've got," he says cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said he routinely scans the list of conventions for possible donations 
to feed and shelter San Diego's growing number of homeless. He calls the 
donations "a byproduct of the Convention Center." 
</P>
<P>
He particularly likes conventions of doctors and food producers. 
</P>
<P>
He even got some dog food from a pet-lovers' convention. The homeless often 
keep dogs for protection, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Work, It Ain't 
</P>
<P>
More matter, less art. 
</P>
<P>
* Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown, facing unemployment soon after losing a race 
for sheriff, has gotten his first job offer in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
The letter writer said he had seen Drown campaigning and thought he had just 
the job for him. He included a video. 
</P>
<P>
After watching the video, Drown says he'll say, "Thanks, but no thanks." 
</P>
<P>
The job: selling Amway products. 
</P>
<P>
* No harm, no foul. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego city attorney's office Thursday decided not to file charges of 
indecent exposure against three scantily dressed "ring-card girls." 
</P>
<P>
The three had been cited by the vice squad at a boxing match last week at the 
Mission Valley Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: No pictures, no evidence of full nudity, no suggestive conduct. 
</P>
<P>
And very little chance of getting a conviction.

96 CRIPS, BLOODS ARRESTED DURING 'RED RAG' SWEEP; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: POLICE ROUND UP GANG MEMBERS ON DRUG CHARGES IN SEQUEL TO "OPERATION 
BLUE RAG." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sequel to its highly touted "Operation Blue Rag," in which 77 Crip gang 
members were arrested for drug sales, law enforcement officials rounded up 96 
more Crip and Blood gang members during "Operation Red Rag" in East and 
Southeast San Diego over the past three days. 
</P>
<P>
The five-month "Red Rag" operation, so named to target the Piru, or Blood, gang 
members, who favor red handkerchiefs, mirrored "Blue Rag," a nine-month 
investigation that involved the West Coast Crips, who have adopted blue as 
their color. 
</P>
<P>
The 96 arrested in "Red Rag" is the single largest sweep of gang members in San 
Diego's history, officials said, and will be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
As in its initial operation, which ended last March, the San Diego Police 
Department used a former gang member as a confidential informant armed with 
money seized in previous drug raids to make dozens of drug buys, including rock 
cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine, over five months. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations differed in two ways. While "Blue Rag" included an informant 
wired for sound, "Red Rag" included audiotaped and videotaped locations where 
the informant would lure gang members before making buys. Dist. Atty. Edwin 
Miller said the tapes will help make convictions easier when the cases get to 
trial, probably before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The second difference, investigators said, was the ease with which the "Red 
Rag" informant was able to make buys from both Crip and Blood gang members. 
Police had targeted the Bloods, but found that their informant was able to move 
easily through Crips gang areas. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 77 arrested during "Blue Rag," half are out of jail after serving six 
months or less. With 96 more arrested, the two operations had an impact on more 
than 4% of the 3,900 gang members registered with the police gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively small percentage, law enforcement officials said, is significant 
because the gang members targeted were among the most violent, most prone to 
get involved in drive-by shootings, and the most heavily involved in dealing 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The percentage of people we took out is not as important as who we took out," 
said police Sgt. Ross Stone, who led the department's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The operation also included help from the district attorney's office, the state 
Justice Department's Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Attorney General's Office and the 
county's probation department. "We may have 3,900 gang members out there, but 
many of them are not as hard-core as others," he said. "Anybody can say he's in 
a gang, but he may not be involved in drive-by shootings or other violent 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Bob Burgreen said the "Blue Rag" operation "kicked a hole, a big 
hole into the Crips" of San Diego. "They are not back to where they were 
before, and it will take months and months for them to recover and get back 
into place." 
</P>
<P>
Although 96 were arrested over the past three days, 112 gang members, 
representing 13 gangs, were charged. The rest were being sought Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
All but 12 were local gang members -- representing groups with names like the 
"Eastside Piru" and "Upside Sic." The rest were from Los Angeles gangs, like 
the "Raymond Avenue Crips" and the "L.A. Pueblo Bishop Crips." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office charged nine people and used the county grand 
jury to indict 76 more. The U.S. attorney general's office used a federal grand 
jury to indict 14. Eleven were charged in juvenile court, and two had their 
probations revoked. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office rarely uses the county grand jury to lodge 
criminal charges. But, with the June passage of Proposition 115, which did away 
with lengthy preliminary hearings following grand jury indictments, prosecutors 
can charge and bring defendants to trial more quickly. The absence of 
preliminary hearings also keeps confidential informants from having to testify 
until trial. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests began at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, when more than 100 officers 
representing six state and federal agencies began making arrests in East San 
Diego, Emerald Hills, Logan Heights, Lincoln Park, near Skyline Drive, near 
John F. Kennedy Park and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspects were in their late teens and mid-20s. More than half had 
prior felony convictions, and seven were suspects in gang-related murders or 
attempted murders, the district attorney's office said. Twenty are on parole 
and 20 more are on active probation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators confiscated seven weapons, including a sawed-off shotgun and 
AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
As in the "Blue Rag" operation, which used a confidential informant to set up 
the drug buys and then testify against his former gang colleagues, "Red Rag" 
used an informant who has been placed in the federal Witness Protection Program 
and moved out of San Diego until the cases goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The informant used $30,000 that had been seized in previous raids to buy drugs 
from suspected gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he wants as few trials as possible in order to protect the 
informant and keep him out of public view as much as possible.

NEW PENDLETON CHIEF'S TRIAL BY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tall general almost gleefully lifted the machine gun, then his jaw jutted 
fiercely as he rattled off bullets that wreaked dust-kicking havoc on the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, we're all just like kids," he said with a certain impish 
satisfaction, the usual warm countenance returning to his face. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Marine Brig. Gen. Michael Neil, more than almost anybody, grimly realizes 
this isn't child's play. 
</P>
<P>
This bloodied hero of Vietnam and prominent San Diego trial lawyer, who 
suddenly found himself in command of Camp Pendleton nearly three months ago, is 
somberly aware that the young Marines he is so fond of personally greeting may 
be sent off soon to a new war. 
</P>
<P>
Reservist Neil was called back to active duty after President Bush ordered 
troops to the Middle East, including Marine Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, who had 
commanded Camp Pendleton only three weeks before he turned the world's largest 
amphibious training base over to Neil. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Neil gave outsiders a glimpse of command as he appeared around the 
196-square-mile base, applying his style of tough discipline that's mellowed by 
friendly small talk and frequent pats on the back. 
</P>
<P>
One minute he wears a stern, the-man-chews-nails expression; next minute, he's 
almost joshing the troops. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a trial run behind the steering wheel of a 14-ton light armored 
vehicle, Neil stood before a bleacher full of training Marines and intoned, 
"Did you see me driving this up here?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir!" replied the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
"How'd I do?" he inquired. 
</P>
<P>
"EXCELLENT, sir!" the young Marines privates said, as if there were any other 
answer for a general. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, this would seem an unusual change of venue for a 50-year-old 
trial lawyer, the president of the law firm of Neil, Dymott, Perkins, Brown 
&amp; Frank. 
</P>
<P>
But Neil dwells in two worlds, one with a plush legal office, orderly 
courtrooms and juries to coddle, cajole and convince. 
</P>
<P>
The other is Camp Pendleton, a scruffy, shopworn expanse that has minted 
Marines since World War II, a noisy place of gunfire and thundering artillery, 
yet a place where Neil doesn't have to plead for a verdict -- he gives the 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
In normal times, 36,000 Marines are stationed at Camp Pendleton, but the 1st 
Marine Expeditionary Force went to Saudi Arabia in August, and the 5th Marine 
Expeditionary Brigade is shipping out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Neil doesn't say exactly how many Marines will remain, but he comments that 
there will be "a very significant reduction" of Marines on base. 
</P>
<P>
However, there's plenty of responsibility left for a warrior-administrator, 
including overseeing the care of 12,000 dependents on base and another 32,000 
living in the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be the battlefield command he's used to, but Neil is sort of a city 
manager of a self-contained community of barracks, a brig, training areas, 90 
firing ranges, PXs and a security force of MPs. 
</P>
<P>
He spreads himself around, noting that "part of being a commanding officer is 
to make his presence known." He often stays overnight on base, when he can't 
break away to go home to Mission Beach and see his wife, Jan. They have two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, Neil visited the School of Infantry where, regardless of the 
deployment, 22,000 Marine recruits a year receive six weeks of training. Neil 
wandered around, always strolling up to the officers and enlisted men for a few 
moments of conversation about equipment, training and hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no matter where he goes, no matter how many fresh young faces he meets, 
Vietnam, with its unforgettable agony and camaraderie, is always with Neil. 
</P>
<P>
It is the land where he saw good men die, and where he distinguished himself, 
winning the Navy Cross for leading his 21 Marines in a desperate firefight with 
150 North Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a day goes by when in some manner you don't think of the men you 
served with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When talking of such things, he uses the word "you" rather than "I" in a way 
that seems to protect the emotions no one who hasn't seen combat can possibly 
share or understand. 
</P>
<P>
For all Neil saw during his 13 months at war ("seemed like every day you were 
getting shot at"), he couldn't put the Marine Corps behind him when he came 
home in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed away a couple of years, (but) I found out I missed being around the 
Marines, the camaraderie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And he was undaunted about combat: "I always thought there would be another 
war. I wanted to be part of it if there was." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, that attitude may be natural for Neil, whose father was a 30-year 
Marine artillery officer who served in World War II. Neil remembers visiting 
Camp Pendleton for the first time in 1945, when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was lost, but for Neil, war sealed in him a certain mission to make 
sure the Marines of today and tomorrow learn their lessons well. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly believe in being tough, being firm, and in discipline, but at 
times letting them know you care about them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He believes contemporary Marines are better trained than were Vietnam-era 
troops, and the unabashedly gung-ho general said the Marines he sees are 
itching for service in the Middle East. He wishes he could go. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Marine wishes he was going, but some have to stay behind," he said. And, 
although a Camp Pendleton corporal this week received media attention by 
seeking conscientious objector status, Neil insisted morale and resolve are 
high. 
</P>
<P>
He said "there really hasn't been any change in the (absent without leave) rate 
that we've seen. Basically, they want to go." 
</P>
<P>
Part of his task in running the base and letting troops know he's behind them 
is participating in training and trying his hand with some military tricks that 
didn't exist when he was commissioned back in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Neil scrunched his 6-foot-2 frame and size 13 combat boots into a training 
light armored vehicle, in which, even in a modified fetal position, he looked 
more natural than Michael Dukakis during the former presidential candidate's 
much-ridiculed campaign tank ride. 
</P>
<P>
Then Neil jammed himself into the simulator to learn how to aim and fire the 
LAV's guns. The targets, moving and stationary, were visible on a 
computer-enhanced screen that showed enemy vehicles and helicopters on sweeping 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Richard Parks instructed him, but his first round missed. "Oh, I see what 
I did," said Neil. The second shot was high. "I see what I did," he repeated. 
The third mock projectile did it. 
</P>
<P>
By the second target, Neil was a real gunner. 
</P>
<P>
"One round, one hit, sir," Parks said. "Outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Neil had just killed a truck. 
</P>
<P>
A little more trial and error, and Neil definitely had the hang of things. 
</P>
<P>
Twisting himself out of the simulator, Neil said: "I think we scared 'em." 
</P>
<P>
"Scared hell out of 'em, sir," the sergeant replied.

S.D. SAID TO BE 1 OF 2 GOP FINALISTS FOR 1992; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SOURCES SAY HOUSTON PROBABLY WILL BE THE OTHER FINALIST FOR THE GOP 
CONVENTION WHEN THE REPUBLICANS MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY.

Barring an unforeseen circumstance, San Diego will be named today as one of two 
finalists in the competition for hosting the 1992 GOP Convention, a highly 
placed source in the Republican Party said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Site Selection Committee is expected to emerge from its meeting in 
Washington and name San Diego and Houston as finalists, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we think San Diego will be selected as the site," said Tess 
Dennis, assistant to Frank Visco, chairman of the California Republican Party. 
"Frank is very much in favor of San Diego and will, of course, be supporting 
San Diego when the full committee makes its decision early next year." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources in the party said Thursday that Houston's chances improved in 
recent weeks but ebbed in recent days, with party officials being told that the 
Houston Astros baseball team could not adjust its schedule to permit the time 
needed to ready the Houston Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's chances also are complicated, sources said, by the gubernatorial 
victory in Texas of Democrat Ann Richards over GOP challenger Clayton Williams. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans' chances have dimmed, sources said, because of former Ku Klux 
Klansman David Duke, now a state representative, who may seek the governorship 
of Louisiana, posing a potential embarrassment to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Several GOP sources interviewed Thursday, most of whom asked not to be 
identified, said San Diego has three "detriments." Otherwise the city, in the 
words of one delegate, would be "a lock": 
</P>
<P>
* The new San Diego Convention Center is considered too small by GOP standards, 
and its sight lines, both for television viewers and in-house delegates, pose 
serious aesthetic problems. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium may serve as the site for President Bush's 
renomination acceptance speech, but he could be making his televised address 
around sundown, causing him to squint into cameras. Because no portion of any 
Republican Convention has ever been held outdoors, the use of the stadium is a 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
* Unlike other cities, which have offered public subsidies, San Diego's 
$10-million funding pledge will come entirely from private sources. Coming up 
with the money isn't the problem, sources say; it's the fact that money 
otherwise earmarked for GOP congressional races will now be going to a 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some reports, other cities -- namely, St. Petersburg, Fla. -- are not 
out of the running for one of the finalist slots, alongside San Diego. But 
Cleveland is considered, at this time, a long shot, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego's strengths are that it's a beautiful city with the hotels and 
restaurants necessary for hosting a convention of this size," a ranking member 
of the Republican National Committee said Thursday. "Some delegates are tired 
of going to the Kansas Citys and Detroits and would welcome a San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The full Republican National Committee is scheduled to pick one of the two 
finalists at its meeting in January.

It was just declared a holiday, so you may find it missing from some 1991 
calendars: 
</P>
<P>
Malibu Independence Day, March 30. 
</P>
<P>
Yup, it's been officially designated by Malibu's unofficial City Council. 
</P>
<P>
As you may know, rebellious settlers there voted to establish their own 
government earlier this year. That the county has so far delayed granting them 
cityhood has deterred the rebels from organizing a Thirtieth of March ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight no doubt will be a dramatic reading of the Malibu Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
We, in the Colony, hold these truths to be self-evident, that all celebrities 
are created equal, that they are endowed by their Attorneys, Agents and 
Publicists with certain unalienable Rights (not to mention points), that among 
these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of a Septic Tank . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We'd go on, but we're getting teary-eyed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another reason to monitor Duke's eating during the holiday season: 
</P>
<P>
The county's fee for neutering male dogs under 50 pounds is $25, but it costs 
$35 to perform the rites on 51 to 70 pounders and it's a hefty $45 for 70-plus 
pounders.

Anyone who made an ant farm as a science project in school can appreciate 
Yukinori Yanagi's accomplishment. (Especially your Only in L.A. correspondent,

</P>
<P>
Yanagi has created an organic art work, "World Flag Ant Farm Project," which 
will go on display downtown at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
It will depict the national flags of the world in colored grains of sand. The 
ants will remove and rearrange the grains, the gallery tells us, "eventually 
dissolving (the individual flags)" as the art work evolves "into one universal 
flag." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds impressive. But wait a minute. Those ants will be dissolving the 
American Flag. Is it time for another ruling by the Supreme Court?

Pioneer author Horace Bell says that the most lavish hotel in L.A. in the 1850s 
was the Bella Union, whose earthen floors were "rendered quite muddy" in rainy 
weather. "If a very aristocratic guest came along," Bell added, "a great 
sacrifice was made in his favor, and he was permitted to sleep on the (hotel 
saloon's) little billiard table."

COLLAPSED TELEPHONE CABLE CUTS SERVICE TO THOUSANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A telecommunications fiber-optic cable damaged during a brush fire earlier this 
month collapsed as workers tried to repair it Thursday, temporarily cutting 
telephone service to thousands of customers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The crew was doing some routine extension and was repairing the cable, but it 
was so weakened that it gave way," said Michelle Payer, an MCI 
Telecommunications Corp. spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
She said the cable was damaged when a brush fire roared through Camp Pendleton 
on Nov. 6 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Keegan, an MCI spokeswoman in Washington, said the cable collapsed 
about 8:30 a.m. on the outskirts of Oceanside, but was repaired within two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we were able to repair it so quickly was because it was an aerial 
cable," Keegan said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the problem forced the carrier to reroute several thousand telephone 
calls in and out of the 619 area code. She said she did not know how the line 
was cut. 
</P>
<P>
"The cut affected the equivalent of about 14,000 simultaneous calls," Keegan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokeswoman Jane Young said many callers used the AT&amp;T 
long-distance service heavily during the interim. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Mother's Day revisited," Young said. "All the circuits were busy and 
our people in Denver who monitor the network thought that we had an earthquake 
out here because of all the San Diego lights flashing."

SMALL-BOAT OWNERS FEAR MARINA EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a salary of $6.50 an hour and bills that include monthly child support 
payments, John Thompson figures he's living pretty lean. Sure, he's got a 
sailboat. But the 22-footer is hardly a yacht. If it were, Thompson says, he 
wouldn't mind paying more than the current $160 a month for a slip in San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
But now, as the Los Angeles Harbor Department considers expanding the port-run 
Cabrillo Marina, many small boaters like Thompson face a difficult choice: Move 
or pay for larger slips than they need. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the success of the $45-million Cabrillo Marina, the Harbor 
Department is planning to add 1,510 slips to its marina south of 22nd Street by 
1994. To do this, port officials intend to evict four private marina operators 
who have been in business for decades and replace their old wooden docks with 
concrete wharfs that cater to larger boats. The average slip will measure 42 
feet, and none will be shorter than 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The plans for larger slips, officials say, are backed by studies showing that 
the best use for slips at Cabrillo Marina and elsewhere is to berth larger 
boats. "We've found that when vacancies occur, they tend to be at smaller slips 
-- those have the highest turnover and the lowest demand," said Mark Richter, 
the port's assistant property manager. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, port officials say many of the nearly 200 smaller boats (less than 30 
feet long) that occupy slips in the private marinas can easily be put on 
trailers and launched from ramps. That is especially true for powerboats, 
Richter said, conceding that some sailboats pose hauling and storage problems 
because of their keels and masts. 
</P>
<P>
Private marina operators and small-boat owners take issue with the port's 
attitude, saying they deserve better treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"The small-boat owners were the ones who built these marinas . . . and this is 
unfair to them," said Valerie Gerkey, dockmaster for the 450-slip Fleitz 
Brothers marina, the largest of the four to be evicted by the port. "I mean, 
everybody with a boat is not rich . . . and there will be a lot of people who 
won't be able to handle" the fees for larger slips. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a 29-year-old boat repairman, agreed: "Why should I pay for a 30-foot 
slip when I have a 22-foot boat?" A larger slip would cost at least $50 more a 
month, he said. "It's just unfair." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Gerkey and other marina operators say, the port's plans to expand the 
Cabrillo Marina have drawn little attention because they are incomplete and 
have not been publicized. "Nobody knows what the plan is, exactly," said Steve 
Gossett, assistant manager of Holiday Harbor Marina. "I have a feeling that 
when they do, there is going to be quite a commotion." 
</P>
<P>
Though the Harbor Department has begun to make way for the new marina by 
issuing a demolition permit for the Navy's fuel dock, port officials say they 
are months away from finalizing the marina's design. No date has been set for 
the evictions, but it is certain that the private operators will be gone. And 
many of their small-boat customers may follow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to hurt a lot of people. A lot of people won't be able to have 
boats anymore," said Donald Holland, foreman of the 110-slip Cabrillo Boat 
Shop, owned by his father, Rolland. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where they're going to go," said Kathy Geiger, who manages 
Shelter Point Marina, which opened in San Pedro 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
With all but nine of its 79 slips measuring less than 30 feet, Shelter Point 
Marina has catered to smaller boats whose owners haven't had to pay for one 
foot more of slip space than they needed, Geiger said. They include Thompson, 
whose 22-foot sailboat, "Das Boat," has been in a 22-foot slip at Shelter Point 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Another Shelter Point tenant, Candace Rivilla, is a part-time schoolteacher who 
lives aboard a 27-foot sailboat with her husband and daughter. "People think 
that if you own a boat, you're wealthy," Rivilla said. "And it just isn't 
true." 
</P>
<P>
The rent increase is "going to be a problem for some of our neighbors who like 
to just come down on weekends and use their boats," Rivilla said, predicting 
that it will force some to give up their boats. "The sport sailors are the ones 
who are really going to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Port officials dispute that claim. They say expanding the marina will provide 
more slips and better facilities for boaters. "The current facilities are in 
deplorable condition," Richter said. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion plans, he said, include concrete floats to replace the old, 
weathered wooden docks and three new hoists for boats that are not moored at 
the marina. 
</P>
<P>
Richter said the eventual slip prices will be reasonable, given the new 
amenities for boaters. "The rent will be commensurate with the quality of 
facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But as they wait for the port's plans to take shape, the private marina 
operators and some boaters say the Harbor Department has put the squeeze on the 
little guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand that the port is in the business to make money. But I think 
they should provide water space for smaller boats," Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
"Come down on a weekend and see which boats have gone sailing. It's not the big 
boys. All of them are in port. It's the small boats that are out there."

LUBACH'S RESTAURANT, A DOWNTOWN LANDMARK FOR 35 YEARS, WILL CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying economic conditions became too much to bear, R.C.A. (Ray) Lubach closed 
his legendary restaurant, Lubach's, Thursday after 35 years of business in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It just kept going down and down and down," said Lubach, 80, whose exotic a la 
carte menu and Harbor Drive location drew dozens of dignitaries and 
entertainers, including Lubach's personal favorite, Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the end, he said sadly from his home in La Mesa Thursday night, it was 
work without hope that caused him to close the doors and send home 44 
employees, one of whom had worked for him 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't take enough money in to pay your expenses, eventually, you have 
to close," Lubach said. "Everything went up -- insurance rates, liquor prices, 
everything. If you don't meet the costs, what else are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Lubach refused to say how much money he lost on the business but noted, "If the 
business had made me wealthy, I wouldn't be closing." 
</P>
<P>
Rival restaurant owner Tommy Tomicich, who for 27 years has owned Old Trieste 
on Morena Boulevard, said he was saddened by Lubach's decision. He said he 
empathized with a restaurateur stung by a slumping economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has slowed down," Tomicich said. "I know of restaurants in 
Manhattan in New York City who have scaled back waiters from 30 to 40 to four 
or five. Times are tough. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that businessmen could deduct 100% of what they spent 
entertaining clients at a restaurant. Now, it's down to 80%, and they're 
talking of trimming it to 50%. That hurts a lot. I'm lucky, I own my land, but 
a lot of places can't pay the rent. People across America don't go out as often 
as they used to, because they can't. And it's going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Lubach, whose full name is Rinse Cornelius Antonius Lubach, came to the United 
States from his boyhood home in Amsterdam in 1937. He moved to Los Angeles, 
then settled in San Diego in 1940. Long active in San Diego civic affairs, he 
once served as consul of the Netherlands in San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
His only child, Bob, 54, assisted him in the business, which opened on the 
city's waterfront in 1956 in what had once been the cafeteria for Solar 
Turbines. 
</P>
<P>
As to what his son will now do, Lubach said, "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Lubach said he doesn't own the property at 2101 Harbor Drive but 
added that rent was never a problem -- it was merely the cost of "everything 
else" that became prohibitive. (The land is owned by the San Diego Unified Port 
District, which leases it to Solar Turbines, which acted as Lubach's landlord.) 
</P>
<P>
Times restaurant critic David Nelson said Lubach's demise may have been due in 
part to the loss of an older clientele, which was never really replaced by a 
younger crowd. Nelson said the menu "hadn't really changed" in all the years 
Lubach's was open. 
</P>
<P>
Lubach said Thursday that he refused to compromise -- "I have high standards 
and saw no need to alter them" -- and that he considers the culinary habits of 
most Americans in the 1990s suspect, "to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
He said he enjoyed offering fresh lobster from Maine every day for 35 years, as 
well as Dover sole imported once a week from the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"We flourished up until five years ago," he said. "In the end, the only problem 
was the people with the briefcases. Nowadays, a hamburger and a hot dog on a 
stick is good enough for them."

SUICIDE STIRS FEAR OF ADDED HEALTH FUND CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of doctors and counselors warned Thursday that Los Angeles County could 
face more cases like the AIDS patient who committed suicide in a Mid-City 
shelter earlier this week if the Board of Supervisors approves further drastic 
cuts in mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the county has few facilities that can simultaneously provide for 
both the physical and mental needs of AIDS patients, the mental health 
advocates said that those gripped by AIDS-related dementia would be even more 
at risk if the county proceeds with $41.9 million in funding cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, as the county held hearings into the threatened cutbacks, an AIDS 
patient at the Casa de Nuestra Senora shelter opened fire at staffers in the 
residence and then at police, holding officers at bay for four hours before 
firing a fatal shot into his head. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter workers said later that the patient, Alberto Alvizuri, 34, had been 
gripped by worsening toxoplasmosis and AIDS dementia and was about to be 
transferred to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"This tragedy could be repeated throughout Los Angeles County as we lose more 
services," said Dr. Ann Brand, president of the Assn. of Community Mental 
Health Agencies of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Jue, a mental health program manager at AIDS Project Los Angeles, added 
that "when (AIDS patients) become dangerous, most AIDS hospices and shelters 
are just not equipped to handle them." 
</P>
<P>
Jue said that as AIDS patients have been able to live longer with advances in 
medicine, her facility has begun seeing increased cases of serious dementia 
among them. Studies have shown that between 80% and 90% of AIDS patients 
experience some form of dementia over the course of their fatal disease, Jue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, any cuts in mental health funding would come at the worst possible 
time, said Jue and other mental health advocates. Diane Bloom, director of 
counseling for the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, said that her 
agency has seen a 25% increase over the last three months in the number of AIDS 
patients coming in with "immediate crises." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a crisis unit, but we're becoming one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors took steps to offset the projected mental 
health cuts with $8 million in new utility and hotel taxes and pleas to local 
cities to come up with another $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the meeting, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley rejected that request.

CORRUPTION TRIAL OF 7 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES GOES TO FEDERAL JURY; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: PROSECUTION CLOSES BY SAYING THE MEN VIOLATED THE PUBLIC TRUST. THE 
DEFENSE SAYS THE MAIN WITNESS IS A LIAR AND A THUG.

<P>
The case of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies accused of skimming 
$1.4 million in drug money went to a federal court jury Thursday with a 
prosecutor calling them corrupt, and the defense saying the government used 
unreliable witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles trial lasted seven weeks and focused the spotlight on a scandal 
that embarrassed the Sheriff's Department in the nation's most populous county 
and its chief, Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the power the government has, they have not proved their case beyond 
a reasonable doubt," defense attorney Harland Braun told jurors. "And that is 
because the defendants are innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Braun, who represents former Deputy Daniel Garner, pointed the blame at Robert 
Sobel, the government's star witness against the deputies and the former chief 
of the elite narcotics squad called Major Violators II. 
</P>
<P>
Braun portrayed the former Sheriff's Department sergeant as a thug and a liar. 
</P>
<P>
"Sobel is worthless," Braun told the jury. "It would demean our history, our 
jury system if you based a verdict on someone like Robert Sobel." 
</P>
<P>
The seven defendants, Garner, Terrell Amers, James Bauder, Eufrasio Cortez, 
Ronald Daub, John Dickenson and Macario Duran are charged with conspiracy, 
theft, racketeering, tax fraud and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Braun criticized prosecutors for using drug suspects as witnesses and said 
testimony had shown that the government operated its own undercover 
money-laundering operation, returning drug profits to the Colombians supplying 
the illegal product. 
</P>
<P>
In rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann said, 'There are some 
things the government does that aren't very pretty. . . . But it's done 
according to the book and approved at the highest level of government. 
Washington says OK because it's a drug war and there are benefits. So there is 
an undercover money-laundering operation." 
</P>
<P>
As for the drug suspects, he said the government did not choose them as 
witnesses. He said the defendants caused such people to become witnesses in the 
case by allegedly stealing money from them. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the deputies testified that they made luxury purchases of 
boats, cars and vacations by legitimate means, with money obtained from 
savings, relatives, overtime work, legal gambling and yard sales. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the defenses of wishful thinking," Hagemann said of the deputies' 
evidence, "a defense made up of nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor pointed to the men's "outlandish expenditures" for luxury items 
during the 15 months the skimming allegedly occurred and said their guilt had 
been proved. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case about trust and the people that we entrust," he said. "In 1988 
and '89, these deputy sheriffs could not be trusted." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie spent an hour giving jurors instructions in 
the law and ordered them to begin their deliberations this morning.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GRANT AWARDED FOR LEARNING STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A professor at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson has been awarded a 
three-year, $177,000 grant to study cooperative learning among college 
students, a method that previous studies have found beneficial for younger 
students, especially minorities. 
</P>
<P>
James Cooper, a professor of graduate education, recently was awarded the grant 
from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, which is 
administered through the U.S. Department of Education, university officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the grant will fund continued study of cooperative learning, which 
places students in small groups and stresses dependence on one another as well 
as individual accountability for assignments. The focus of classroom learning 
is shifted from the teacher to the student. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said studies of students in cooperative learning classes, from 
kindergarten through the 12th grade, indicate that they have a better 
self-image than other students and tend to be more tolerant of people with a 
different gender or ethnic background. In addition, Cooper said, research 
indicated that minority students benefit the most from the cooperative 
approach.

SAN PEDRO WORKSHOP TO STUDY LOCAL SPIDER CRAB POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bring your soft-soled shoes, warm clothing -- hip waders if you have them -- 
and become a marine naturalist for a day. No experience necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro is inviting people over the age of 13 
to take part Saturday in an ongoing research program on the spider crab 
population at the Point Fermin Marine Life Refuge near the museum. 
</P>
<P>
In a "Science at the Seashore" workshop from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m., people will be 
shown how to measure crabs, determine their sex and record data. They'll then 
spend two hours observing and counting spider crabs at the tide pools. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a way for the public to get some experience doing a research project," 
said museum curator Cathy Crouch, who will conduct the workshop. "They get a 
better understanding of why we do research, how we do it and what we do with 
the data." 
</P>
<P>
The crabs, which have legs up to a foot long, are found hidden in surf grass at 
the extremities of the tide pools. "They are uncovered at the lowest low 
tides," she said. "You have to really look for them." 
</P>
<P>
The research program began in 1986 when almost 300 of the crabs were counted in 
one day in the tidal area. "The museum was interested in what they were doing 
there and developed a monitoring program to check on when they occur," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The original number has never been equaled, with subsequent counts turning up 
no more than 70 crabs. Crouch said researchers haven't determined why the 
numbers fluctuate, but it could be because of reproduction patterns or 
migration. "They could be out there, but somewhere else," she said, adding that 
monitoring will continue at least five more years. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop costs $5, and reservations may be made by calling 548-7563. 
Another spider crab workshop will be given Jan. 27 from noon to 3 p.m. The 
museum is at 3720 Stephen White Drive.

HAND-WRINGING BY DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ex-Gov. Jerry Brown, chairman of the state Democratic Party, decries the fact 
that registered Democrats did not turn out in sufficient numbers in the last 
election to help their candidates ("Clarion Call for a New and Fair Deal," 
Column Left, Commentary, Nov. 18). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if the Democratic hierarchy would pay more attention to the grass-roots 
Democrats instead of making them spear carriers and fund funnels, plain old 
Democrats would be willing and anxious to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry ought to hark back to the days of the lively California Democratic 
Council (CDC) when the club movement had some clout, and candidates eagerly 
sought its endorsement. There's no substitute for involvement.

GILLESPIE JUDGESHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was insulting, to say the least, to learn that our governor is apparently 
embarking on rewarding loyalty with a judgeship for Roxani Gillespie at the end 
of his term ("Prospect of Gillespie Judgeship Stirs Fight," Part A, Nov. 15). 
It wasn't enough that she was appointed as the insurance commissioner in the 
first place, but now we probably will be forced to continue to endure her 
ineptness. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's demonstrated inability to enforce the law over an extended period 
clearly suggests that this lack of performance could only be anticipated on the 
bench. At times she appeared to be totally lost in the performance of her job. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens of California deserved better than Gillespie as the insurance 
commissioner and most assuredly now as a Superior Court judge. As the insurance 
commissioner, we insured had little relief to none as evidenced in the Prop. 
103 debacle, which I lay directly at her doorstep. Her decision not to run for 
office may well have been orchestrated by the governor. After all, why suffer 
an expensive and humiliating defeat when a choice plum would be just handed to 
you?

GILLESPIE JUDGESHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gillespie failed miserably in her appointed position as insurance commissioner. 
The fact that she failed to uphold Prop. 103 places her in a position similar 
to (former Chief Justice) Rose Bird who also failed to uphold another law that 
was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of this state, the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Deukmejian has indicated a desire to appoint Gillespie to a 
Superior Court judgeship before leaving office clearly indicates that his 
position was also very soft toward the insurance companies and their campaign 
to ignore Prop. 103. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder voters are so disgusted with the political system. It stinks!

PARADE ESTIMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I see once again that you need to be reminded of the silliness of accepting 
parade crowd estimates at face value. 
</P>
<P>
I refer to the statement on the front of the Metro section (Nov. 26) concerning 
the Hollywood Christmas Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Arithmetic reveals that "about 750,000 spectators along the 3.2-mile route" 
would require packing people together 29% more densely than the mythical 1 
million who have been said to linethe 5.5-mile Rose Parade route. The actual 
number at the Rose Parades is really under 400,000 by more thoughtful 
estimates, so your Hollywood Parade estimate is even more grossly exaggerated.

BENNETT OPPOSES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republican National Committee rushed away from the Senate candidacy of 
former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon David Duke earlier this year. Incoming RNC 
Chair Bill Bennett, however, has embraced Duke's platform by scoring Democrats 
for their support of affirmative action, which he defines as the process 
whereby whites lose their jobs to less qualified blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Duke may have lost the election, but he won the ideological war. If Bennett has 
his way, the 1992 national election will set middle-class whites against 
blacks, the sort of struggle Duke has spent his life instigating. 
</P>
<P>
Despite The Times' choice of words, there is nothing "curious" about Bennett's 
approach. With Willie Horton as the MVP of George Bush's 1988 campaign, and 
Sen. Jesse Helms' success invoking the issue this fall, Bennett apparently 
hopes the Duke strategy will distract an angry electorate from its economic 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans should follow The Times' lead by exposing Bennett's 
assault for what it is, and reminding Americans of the profound benefits of 
diversity at all levels.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
A man whom San Diego police described as well-dressed and driving a late-model 
car robbed a Western Federal Savings and Loan branch of $35,450 in traveler's 
checks, police reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 10 a.m., a man entered the savings and loan in the 1000 block of 
Camino del Rio South, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the man was wearing a blue sport coat, tan pants, and 
gold-rimmed glasses, and carrying a small, brown and maroon brief case. 
</P>
<P>
He told the teller he wanted to buy some traveler's checks, and, when the 
teller brought a box containing the checks, he said, "This is a robbery. Give 
me the checks," Robinson said. No weapon was seen. 
</P>
<P>
The man escaped in a teal green, four-door, 1989 or 1990 Honda Accord, Robinson 
said.

The team of detectives investigating the Clairemont-University City serial 
killings has sorted through roughly three-fourths of the leads in the case, San 
Diego police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
New leads continue to come in, adding to the 2,600 total leads, but at a slower 
pace, Capt. Dick Toneck said during the group's weekly press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
The department announced earlier this month that the 27 detectives 
investigating the stabbing deaths of five women would return to normal duties 
as they worked though the leads. One detective has since been reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
The team was beefed up to 27 detectives in September in response to the huge 
number of tips, Toneck said. As leads are reduced, the force will be gradually 
cut, but the original five-person team will remain on the case, he said.

After a two-day search covering 1,200 square miles, the U.S. Coast Guard 
suspended its search Thursday for a Canadian sailor feared swept overboard near 
the Coronado Islands during a storm. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard used three helicopters and a jet to search for Joseph Clarke, 
61, of North Delta, British Columbia, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy helicopter spotted Clarke's 27-foot sailboat, Migal-1, adrift Tuesday 
morning about 20 miles southwest of San Diego and reported the sighting. 
</P>
<P>
The search was suspended at 6 p.m. Wednesday, and authorities decided Thursday 
not to resume looking for the retired engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The Migal-1 had sailed out of Vancouver on its way to Cabo San Lucas. Clarke 
was last seen in Dana Point at 8 p.m. Sunday and planned to stop off in San 
Diego to pick up a passenger, a Coast Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Coast Guard boarded the empty boat Tuesday, the boat's radio and 
navigational equipment were working and plenty of food and water were on board. 
But the boat's jib was torn and the mainsail was lowered, indicating Clarke had 
run into heavy winds that slammed into San Diego early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The storm was accompanied by 10- to 12-foot waves and winds up to 32 m.p.h.

LOYOLA MARYMOUNT OPENS THREE-GAME STRETCH WITH TOURNEY GAME VS. BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cavalry may arrive for the Loyola Marymount men's basketball team this 
weekend, although it may not be in time. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off its 1-2 performance in the Maui Classic last weekend, the Lions play 
another three-games-in-three-days string, competing in the Freedom Bowl 
Invitational at UC Irvine tonight and Saturday before traveling to UCLA Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions open tonight at 6 o'clock against Bradley (0-1) in an underwhelming 
Irvine field. The host Anteaters (1-2) face Idaho State (1-1) in the second 
game, with the winners and losers playing Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, Bradley and Irvine all play a running game, but there is no dominating 
team in the field. The Lions, who left several injured starters home and had a 
noticeably depleted lineup against the strong Maui field, should hold their own 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
They expect to have 6-foot-10 center Richard Petruska in uniform and even a few 
effective minutes could help. In their two losses in Maui, the Lions got 
pounded inside for 120 rebounds by Santa Clara and Northeastern, a part of the 
game Loyola usually won in past years with Hank Gathers in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley lost its opener, 93-70, at Georgia Southern. Standout guard Curtis 
Stuckey scored 32 points for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is coached by former NBA coach Stan Albeck, who is accustomed to having 
a big scorer. Three years ago the Braves' Hersey Hawkins led the nation in 
scoring, and Stuckey was the Missouri Valley Conference's scoring leader last 
season. But he got little support against Georgia Southern from the front-court 
starters, who shot only two for 14 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola produced the past two national scoring champions in Gathers and Bo 
Kimble. This is the first meeting between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola will need a strong effort to compete Sunday with 10th-rated UCLA, which 
will be well-rested after having last played on Monday when it defeated 
Virginia to win the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions hope to suit up co-captain Tom Peabody for Sunday's 5 p.m. game, 
although his status is still questionable. Peabody missed last week's action 
with a severly sprained ankle but has been running lightly on it this week. 
Point guard Tony Walker's injured wrist remains in a cast and his playing 
status for the season is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' inexperience was evident last week. In their opener against Santa 
Clara, they saw a nine-point halftime lead turn into an 11-point second-half 
deficit. When they made a late run, their lineup included several freshmen and 
only one player who was on the team last season. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell Lowery leads the Lions with a 25-point average, followed by Craig Holt 
at 18.3, freshman Kareem Washington at 16 and Brian McCloskey at 14. John 
O'Connell is averaging 13.7 points and a team-high 9.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with the UCLA game, every team on Loyola's schedule until Christmas is 
currently ranked in the Top 20. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team (1-1) will be tested at 5 tonight 
when it meets Vanderbilt in the opening round of the Lady Ute Classic in Salt 
Lake City. In the second game, host Utah meets Southwest Texas State. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (2-1) is led by 6-4 All-American center Wendy Scholtens, who scored 
19 points Wednesday in a victory over Maine to surpass 2,000 in her career. The 
Lady Commodores are ranked 22nd in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are coming off a 109-62 loss at Arizona State in which they committed 
32 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola returns home next week to play its next four games in Gersten Pavilion, 
starting with Nevada at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday.

EL CAMINO QB HARVEY PASSES THE TEST; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES: SOPHOMORE OVERCOMES INEXPERIENCE AND PRESSURE OF STARTING 
TO LEAD THE WARRIORS TO THE ORANGE COUNTY BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many people, including Coach John Featherstone, used words such as 
inexperienced and untested to describe El Camino College quarterback Rod Harvey 
throughout most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But not anymore. Not after Harvey helped lead the Warriors (8-2) to a tie for 
first place in the 16-member Mission Conference. And not after El Camino won 
its fourth consecutive Mission Conference Northern Division title with a 4-0 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey will lead the Warriors against Orange Coast College on Saturday at 7 
p.m. in the Orange County Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The gangly quarterback, a first team All-Mission Conference selection, has 
completed 58% of his passes this season for 2,104 yards and 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people didn't think I would do this good," Harvey said. "Hey, I even 
surprised myself." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone believes Harvey is the team's most improved player. The coach said 
there have been some bad performances, but overall Harvey has been consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest concern with Rod is that he was inexperienced and he's not a big, 
physical guy," Featherstone said. "That's why quarterback was one of our 
biggest questions on this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's a fighter and he's a battler. He's had his fanny popped a few times, 
but he always gets back up. With the abilities he has, he gets the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey is not a dominating figure in the pocket, where he feels most 
comfortable. Even in pads and a helmet, he looks small at 6 foot 1 and 170 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the 20-year-old sophomore was expected to live up to the El 
Camino quarterback tradition. Harvey's All-American predecessors have been Dan 
Speltz, Ron Barber, Tim Green and Frank Dolce. 
</P>
<P>
And Harvey has excelled in the successful community college program known for 
its passing offense. 
</P>
<P>
The expectations alone were enough to give a young player ulcers and Harvey has 
felt the heat. He said he was confident when battling two freshmen this summer 
for the starting job, but once he got it, he was worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I knew deep down inside that I could do it, but I was nervous," Harvey 
said. "When I got the job in August, it was kind of scary for me." 
</P>
<P>
No one has seen that side of Harvey. His coaches and teammates say there have 
been no signs of fear or apprehension. On the field, he is always confident and 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very strong leader on this team," Featherstone said. "He takes command 
in the huddles and he doesn't take any crap from the other kids." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Daigle, El Camino's standout tailback, said: "He never displayed that 
he was under any pressure. He always takes charge of the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Daigle, a redshirt transfer from Arizona State, has lifted some of the pressure 
off Harvey with his spectacular running. He is the first back to rush for more 
than 1,000 yards in Featherstone's six years at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
Having a runner such as Daigle has been perfect for Harvey, who had not started 
at quarterback since his senior year at Morningside High (1988). He passed for 
1,700 yards as a senior for a Monarch team that went 2-7. As a junior, Harvey 
led Morningside to the CIF playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod is the most pure passing quarterback we've had here," Morningside Coach 
Ron Tatum said. "He's a real quarterback from the old mold. He throws very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey wasn't recruited and planned on giving up his football career after 
high school. Tatum suggested he try playing at a community college and Harvey 
started to attend El Camino part-time in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone had him work out as a redshirt, but Harvey rarely went to practice 
and his teammates called him "ghost." Harvey said he lacked motivation and 
dedication. His mother, Ellen, believes it was because he missed the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult for him when he wasn't playing," Ellen said. "He's much 
happier now and he's much easier to get along with." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey didn't play much as a freshman last year, but he practiced harder. He 
was the backup to Dolce, who passed for 2,494 yards and led the Warriors to a 
10-1 record. Harvey said he learned a lot from watching the powerful 6-1, 
200-pound quarterback who is playing at Utah this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great experience for me as a player and a person," Harvey said. 
"Frank really helped me out. It helped to analyze what he did. And I treasured 
the little time I did play." 
</P>
<P>
This season there has been a lot to treasure, on and off the field. Harvey has 
played in every game (he missed part of the Cerritos game with a sore back and 
thigh) and his son, Travis, was born six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He lives in Inglewood with his parents and sister, but he sees Travis every day 
after football practice and on Sundays. Travis lives in Inglewood with Harvey's 
girlfriend, Tiwana, and her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's changed my life a lot," Harvey said of being a father. "Just watching the 
process of birth and thinking 'this is my making.' That's helped me with 
football because I must set examples for this team. I know now that I can be a 
father and still help this team." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone said being a father has helped Harvey in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest stabilizing factors in Rod's life is the birth of his son," 
Featherstone said. "He's grown up a bunch since then." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, a criminal justice major, said he will savor his last game as a Warrior 
on Saturday. He'd like to play at a four-year college, but he has accepted the 
possibility that this might be the end of his football career.

COLLEGE NOTES: ST. MARY'S COACH SAYS HE'S UNDER FIRE; SCHOOL SAYS HIS JOB IS 
SECURE 
</P>

<P>
Is time running out on Paul Landreaux at St. Mary's? 
</P>
<P>
The basketball coach who gained statewide acclaim at El Camino College is in 
the second year of a three-year contract with St. Mary's, where he inherited a 
woeful team last season and is off to a 0-2 start with what is virtually a new 
team this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The paradox is that Landreaux is the one publicly telling people he's being 
pressured, while the school says his job is secure. 
</P>
<P>
In a preview of the St. Mary's team last weekend, Landreaux told the San 
Francisco Chronicle, "It's just my second season and I feel like I'm hanging on 
by my fingernails." 
</P>
<P>
Landreaux said he feels pressure from Athletic Director Rick Mazzuto, who was 
hired after Landreaux was already at the school. The two are not close friends 
-- "There's no question I would not (take) another basketball job unless I knew 
who the athletic director was," Landreaux told the Chronicle -- but an athletic 
department spokesman told The Times that Mazzuto has made no public statements 
about Landreaux's job security and that Landreaux might be doing himself damage 
with his comments. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last season's 7-20 record, part of the disaffection with 
Landreaux was that he continues to make his home in the South Bay and has not 
endeared himself to alumni at the small West Coast Conference school in Moraga, 
nestled in the hills outside Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"You win basketball games and you can be a mole and be considered a great guy," 
Landreaux said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzuto has said that only Landreaux is being evaluated this season. The school 
spokesman said St. Mary's does not normally buy out contracts and that it 
appears Landreaux's job is secure, especially if St. Mary's improves this 
season. He has only three players back from last season and brought in seven 
new players, most of them community college transfers including two from El 
Camino. 
</P>
<P>
But Landreaux apparently feels the heat, whether self-imposed or from Mazzuto. 
Although this is his third season away from El Camino, he technically remains 
on leave there with a teaching spot open for him. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team, which finished the regular season 
nearly two weeks ago, practiced for most of last week while hoping to be 
invited to this week's Women's Invitational Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The invitations went out Sunday and the women were kept in suspense because the 
calls went out late. 
</P>
<P>
"We practiced Sunday night, still not knowing, but we were told we'd hear by 8 
o'clock if we were going," Coach Steve Stratos said. "To their credit, it was a 
great practice. They never stopped working hard. Meanwhile, 8 o'clock had come 
and gone and when practice ended I had to tell them we were not going." 
</P>
<P>
Then Athletic Director Brian Quinn showed up and gave them the good news. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola women opened preliminary play in the 20-team tournament Thursday in 
Knoxville, Tenn., and won their first match against Dayton in three games. 
"This is a super experience for the girls," Stratos said. "They're really 
pumped up to do well." 
</P>
<P>
An item here on Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave Yanai drew a 
letter pointing out that there was a program at the school before Yanai took 
over in the 1977-78 season. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, little is on record before the Yanai era because the school, still in 
its infancy in the early 1970s, had no sports information office and 
record-keeping was spotty. The school officially started keeping records in the 
1977-78 season. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Biggles, who was a member of the school's first team in 1974-75, writes 
to point out that Coach Al Pompey had some success playing at the NAIA level, 
even ending Biola's 45-game home winning streak in 1975-76. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good squad both years," Biggles wrote. "Your article gives the 
impression that Dominguez Hills had no basketball life before Dave Yanai. I 
hope you will set the record straight." 
</P>
<P>
To Have and Have Not: The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team opened with 
a 130-52 victory Friday over The Master's College -- the highest point total 
for a women's team in West Coast Conference history -- then dropped its next 
game Monday at Arizona State, 109-62. The 78-point victory and a 47-point loss 
represent a 125-point turnaround in four days. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: The bookkeeping at the Maui Classic was unusual at times. In 
Loyola Marymount's first game, Tom Peabody, who was back in Los Angeles 
recovering from an injury, was given credit for two rebounds in the official 
box score. It gives a whole new meaning to the term "long rebound." 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Loyola Marymount seniors Kristen Bruich and Lynn Flanagan each passed 
1,000 career points in Friday's opening game. In the 130-52 victory over The 
Master's College, Flanagan set a school record for most points in a game with 
36. Bruich is two short of 400 career assists and 20 away from moving into 
second place in West Coast Conference records book. . . . In Monday's victory 
over Cal Baptist, Dominguez Hills sophomore Dionne Vanlandingham pulled down a 
career-high 19 rebounds. She's averaging 12.3, helping propel the Lady Toros to 
a 4-1 start. They play in the Fresno Pacific Tournament this weekend, opening 
today against Grand Canyon. Fresno Pacific plays Southern California College in 
the second game. The Toros won the tourney last season. . . . Dominguez Hills 
sophomore Julie Martinovich was named to the District VIII Academic All-America 
volleyball team. The San Pedro resident gives the Toros an academic 
All-American for eight consecutive years.

Bush Signs Tuna Labeling Law: Both tuna industry leaders and such one-time 
antagonists as the Dolphin Coalition, a Washington-based umbrella group of 37 
conservation organizations, applauded the signing by President Bush of laws 
setting standards for "dolphin-safe" tuna. Packaged as amendments to the 
Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, the new statutes 
define what canners must do before labeling their product as dolphin safe. Many 
in the canning industry favored the bill because it provides a uniform 
standard.

PANEL OKS PURCHASE OF CARS FOR RAIL NETWORK; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE 40 DOUBLE-DECKERS WILL BE USED ON COMMUTER LINES LINKING 
LOS ANGELES WITH VENTURA AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a step toward launching a Southern California commuter rail network that 
will link Ventura County to Los Angeles by the end of 1992, the Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission has approved a $51-million purchase for the 
system's first 40 commuter cars. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase from the UTDC firm of Kingston, Canada, calls for delivery of the 
first 162-seat car in early 1992 and delivery of all 40 double-decker cars by 
July, 1992. The cars will be used primarily on runs from Los Angeles to San 
Bernardino and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
The projected commuter rail system would serve such far-flung points as San 
Bernardino, Riverside, San Juan Capistrano, Santa Ana, Fullerton and the San 
Fernando, Simi and Santa Clarita valleys with the lines basically radiating out 
of Los Angeles Union Station. The San Diego lines would be separate. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County terminus for the system remains in doubt. Originally, Los 
Angeles planners thought the line through Glendale, the Burbank airport, Van 
Nuys, Chatsworth and Simi Valley would terminate at Moorpark. Ventura County 
authorities have been pressing for an Oxnard terminus. 
</P>
<P>
A complicating factor is that Ventura is the only affected county in the 
network that does not have an extra half-cent on the sales tax devoted to 
transportation projects. This has made the other counties reluctant to deal 
with Ventura, or to include it fully in a planned regional commuter rail 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Supervisor-elect Vicky Howard, who worked on establishing a 
commuter rail link in eastern Ventura County while serving as a transportation 
commissioner, said Thursday that she believes that the service will extend to 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
However, Howard said that because county voters this month rejected the 
transportation tax ballot measure, the rail line will probably not include 
Moorpark as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said that Simi Valley may still have to come up with some funds to get 
the commuter service but that the city is committed to doing so. The city is 
trying to identify a possible commuter station site. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we will have it," Howard said of the commuter service. "Measure A would 
have made it easier. But we'll just have to be a little more creative." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's relatively weak position of influence in the regional rail 
partnership was dramatized recently when transportation officials from Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties met in Santa Ana to 
discuss the regional authority. 
</P>
<P>
They dealt with Ventura representatives only at the beginning of the meeting, 
when other matters were being discussed, leaving them out of the debate over 
how to form the regional authority. 
</P>
<P>
This could leave Ventura County as the only Southland urban county without full 
participation in how the commuter system is to be run. However, officials say 
the regional network will definitely extend into Ventura County regardless of 
the actual degree of county involvement in planning. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 40 cars that have now been purchased, the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission has an option to buy 40 more cars -- 20 to be used by 
San Diego transportation authorities and eight to provide service from Los 
Angeles to Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation authorities in Southern California have envisioned beginning the 
commuter service with four daily trains each way on each route out of Los 
Angeles. San Diego envisions commuter service to Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The new rail service would be in addition to the two Los Angeles-Santa Barbara 
Amtrak trains that now run through Ventura County along with the Starlight. 
That would mean seven trains a day each way through the county, with the 
prospect of more later if there is sufficient patronage.

NEIGHBORHOOD FEARS FOR SAFETY OF PETS AFTER DOG IS KILLED WITH CROSSBOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the Thousand Oaks neighborhood where a 9-year-old German shepherd 
was shot and killed with a crossbow said Thursday that they fear similar 
attacks on their pets. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been really scared for her," one neighbor said about her 5-year-old 
terrier, which she has kept locked up. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who asked not to be identified, added, "You move into an area like 
this and you think you're not going to have any problems. . . I couldn't stand 
it if anything happened to her." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors fear that pets in fenced yards will be vulnerable to the same hunter 
who used a crossbow to kill a family pet dubbed Bandi. 
</P>
<P>
The dog was shot at close range with a crossbow Tuesday in the 1700 block of 
Misty Creek Road, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Frank O'Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrow apparently pierced the dog's right hind leg, and she died nine hours 
later in a veterinarian's office of respiratory failure. 
</P>
<P>
Bandi's owners, Jack and Carol Storti, "told us they had no known arguments 
with neighbors, so we're really at a loss," O'Hanlon said. "Whoever it is, it's 
a senseless death of an animal." 
</P>
<P>
An 18-inch arrow found in the Stortis' fenced yard had a razor-sharp tip 
usually used in hunting large game animals, Detective Greg Seeba said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stronger than a regular hunter's arrow. It passed right through the dog," 
Seeba said. 
</P>
<P>
Seeba said detectives were stymied as to why someone would hunt down a domestic 
pet kept behind a locked fence. Coyotes roam the semi-rural area, but neighbors 
say it is unlikely that a pet would be mistaken for one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say what kind of motives this kind of person would have," Seeba 
said. "It's strange. . . We've never heard of anything like this happening 
before." 
</P>
<P>
If found, the person responsible for the attack faces felony prosecution on 
animal cruelty charges, a crime that could be punished by a prison term and up 
to $20,000 in fines, Seeba said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Storti, 47, said she was awakened about 3 a.m. Tuesday by Bandi's 
unusually ferocious barking. 
</P>
<P>
After about two minutes, however, the barks turned into yelps and whimpers, she 
said. Bandi left a trail of blood from a side yard to her doghouse, where the 
Stortis found her cringing and wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I became hysterical when I realized someone murdered my dog," Storti said. "To 
have my dog murdered at the hands of a human being. . . This person's 
definitely demented." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors voiced fears about their pets. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Delmont, 17, keeps his 1-year-old Samoyed in a fenced yard but said he 
might look for a safer spot. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the pets in the neighborhood are used as guard dogs, another neighbor 
said. "I think everybody's concerned," said the woman, who also asked to remain 
unidentified for fear of losing her pets. 
</P>
<P>
Bandi was known by neighbors as an affectionate animal who never attacked 
humans, another neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Storti, claiming the attack on the family pet was deliberate, said there 
had also been a disturbance in the neighborhood on Thanksgiving Day. When Bandi 
barked that morning, she said, her husband went outside to check for a burglar 
and saw a man fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was the second known crossbow attack on an animal in the Southland 
recently. On Nov. 18, a 100-pound doe was shot and killed with a crossbow in 
front of a house at the base of the Verdugo Mountains in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Born in December, 1981, Bandi would have turned 9 next month. As a puppy she 
was given as a Christmas gift to the Stortis' daughter, Lori, then a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Bandi's name was shortened from "bandit," said Lori Storti, now 23 and working 
in North Hollywood as an insurance biller. In 1982, when Lori was seriously 
injured in a car accident, "the first thing I did was request my dog," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Storti is offering a $1,000 reward for information that will lead 
authorities to the dog's slayer. 
</P>
<P>
"That dog's worth a million dollars to me," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
David Smith, a 45-year-old financial planner and first-term Camarillo city 
councilman, has been chosen to succeed Charlotte Craven as mayor. Stanley J. 
Daily, a longtime city official who recently was reelected to the council, has 
been appointed vice mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Wednesday evening to appoint Smith and Daily to 
the one-year positions. Smith has served on the council since 1988. Daily 
served as vice mayor and mayor in the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Both men said Thursday that they have several goals. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he plans to keep a close watch on the city's finances to ensure that 
Camarillo continues to recover from money troubles stemming from poor 
investments several years ago. Smith also plans to encourage more recycling and 
water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
And he said he will work on a thorough review of Camarillo's General Plan, 
which will be revised to address uses for city agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
Daily said the review of the General Plan is also one of his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a crossroads," Daily said. "There will be challenges ahead, no doubt 
about it." TINA DAUNT

FORMER POLICEMAN APPEALS DISMISSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Oxnard police officer convicted of assault with a deadly weapon is 
appealing his subsequent dismissal from the department, contending that he was 
fired because he is Latino, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Opening statements in Ray Centeno Jr.'s appeal to the Oxnard Board of Review 
took place Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Centeno, an officer for 10 years, was fired by the Police Department 
immediately after he was convicted of misdemeanor assault against his 
brother-in-law, David Castanon, in 1989, said Centeno's attorney, James Farley. 
</P>
<P>
Centeno hit Castanon after Castanon beat Centeno's sister, Farley said. Centeno 
subsequently served 30 days in the Ventura County Jail and is still on 
probation, Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Farley said Centeno's dismissal was harsher treatment than other 
officers in the department, who were not Latino, have received for the same or 
similar offenses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Farley said, the punishment was too severe given Centeno's work 
record. CAROL WATSON

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY SHIPPING BOXES OF 
WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Reseda resident accused of illegally shipping 75 boxes of hazardous 
waste from a Chatsworth laboratory to Pakistan surrendered Thursday in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Tariq Imran Ahmad, 30, was charged with failure to properly label and illegal 
transportation of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmad was ordered by county health authorities to dispose of hazardous 
chemicals last year after fire swept through his Chatsworth company, Shankman 
Laboratories, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Ahmad sent the chemicals to a company near Los Angeles 
International Airport to be shipped to Pakistan. During unloading, the 
chemicals spilled, prompting evacuation of 75 workers. The spokeswoman said 
Ahmad failed to properly package the chemicals, and the Pakistani government 
sent them back. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmad was arrested last week in Reno, Nev. He disappeared after posting bail. 
Prosecutors were unaware of his whereabouts until he surrendered, the 
spokeswoman said.

RECYCLING PROGRAM EXPANSION PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Ventura will begin a recycling program in mid-December for 
apartments, condominiums and mobile home parks featuring a scavenger-proof 
recycling bin, city officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The multifamily program, which is expected to collect between five and 10 tons 
of materials each day, will be added to the commercial and single-family 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the single-family program are now recycling 25 tons of refuse a 
day and commercial accounts contribute 30 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of single-family homes are provided with ordinary plastic trash bins, 
but apartment and condo dwellers will use a bin that opens when a garbage truck 
flips it upside down. 
</P>
<P>
The new bins weigh 500 pounds when empty and will have one compartment for 
newspapers and one for plastic, glass and aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
They have a small lid on top that functions like a mailbox -- allowing 
residents to deposit recyclables, but making it difficult for materials to be 
removed from the bin. 
</P>
<P>
The bins, which cost $300 to $350 each to manufacture, will be purchased with a 
$40,000 grant from the State Department of Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Saturday, volunteers from the League of Women Voters will pass out 
brochures on recycling bin sites. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

WOULD-BE MURALISTS CONFESS TO GRAFFITI; 
</P>
<P>
VANDALISM: POLICE LINK PAIR TO WEST VALLEY TAGGING. COUNCILWOMAN PICUS PLEDGED 
CITY FUNDS FOR THEM TO COMPLETE RESEDA ART PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-age graffiti artists commissioned by Los Angeles Councilwoman Joy 
Picus to paint a historical mural have been arrested on suspicion of felony 
vandalism for defacing property with spray paint throughout the west San 
Fernando Valley, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The youths -- Marco Cisneros, 15, and Larry Chavez, 16, both of Reseda -- were 
arrested the day before Thanksgiving, said Los Angeles Police Lt. William 
Gaida. 
</P>
<P>
They confessed to "tagging" their nicknames on at least 76 mailboxes, telephone 
poles and walls from Canoga Park to Van Nuys, causing $14,000 in damage, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"These two boys are not artists -- they're vandals," Gaida said. "We've 
resolved a major vandalism problem." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Picus pledged to provide $2,400 from the city's 
anti-graffiti funds for a mural tracing the history of Reseda, which the boys 
were to have painted under the aegis of a Venice arts organization. However, 
Picus was unaware that one of the youths had been arrested twice before on 
suspicion of misdemeanor vandalism, said Edward F. Roes, a Picus aide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bummer," Roes said. "We figured they were young artists. We had no idea 
of their criminal activities." 
</P>
<P>
But after The Times reported the events leading to the historical mural 
commission, police recognized the youths' tag names -- "Anger" and "Kosk," 
which stands for Krazy Obscene King, and arrested them, Gaida said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys came to Picus' attention after they obtained a Reseda homeowner's 
permission to paint a mural on a wall facing busy Vanowen Street. The mural, 
depicting a bare-breasted woman wearing a bandoleer of ammunition being leered 
at by a man with an extra-long tongue, provoked protests from passersby and 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
After the boys agreed earlier this month to replace the offending mural with 
artwork on a Christmas theme, Picus commissioned the historical work as part of 
an effort to redirect young graffiti artists. The mural was to be supervised by 
the Social and Public Art Resource Center, or SPARC, a private, nonprofit 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Roes said Picus will consult with police and SPARC members before deciding 
whether to allow the youths to paint the historical mural or to rescind the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of supporting graffiti in any way," Roes said. "But it 
may be a good idea to keep the kids on board as rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Nakagawa, head of educational outreach for SPARC, said the youths should 
be allowed to participate in the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we don't endorse what they did, I'd like to see them continue on the 
project to show them an alternative to graffiti," Nakagawa said. "The reality 
is, a lot of the kids we hire are past taggers. Murals are one of the best ways 
to deter that." 
</P>
<P>
But Gaida said the youths did not learn their lesson from previous arrests and 
should not be rewarded with the commission. One of the youths -- whom he would 
not identify -- had been arrested twice before, on Sept. 1 and Nov. 5, by 
officers who caught him in the act of spray-painting mailboxes and lampposts in 
Reseda, he said. 
</P>
<P>
When they were arrested Nov. 21, "they were somewhat proud of what they had 
done," Gaida said. He is recommending that the boys be sentenced to community 
service cleaning up graffiti. Both boys have been released pending sentencing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry, who is known as "Kosk," said Thursday in a telephone interview that he 
would like Picus to give him a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
"The tagging was a way of getting fame, but it's in the past," he said, adding 
that his parents had punished him by grounding him indefinitely.

PANEL OPPOSES PLANS TO DEVELOP MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nature lovers hoping to spare two controversial meadows from development have 
won support from the Ojai Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended Wednesday that a 26-acre parcel on Besant Road and 
an adjoining 32-acre parcel along Maricopa Highway be designated as open space. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Besant Meadow changed hands Wednesday morning after lenders 
foreclosed on developer John Schuck of Franciscan-Lowe Ojai Venture. Schuck 
recently lost a five-year court battle with Ventura County to build 50 houses. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners, the William Blatt Family Trust, could not be contacted for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
David Armanetti, the agent for Howard M. Palmer of Ojai Investments Ltd., said 
he needs more information before commenting on how the zone change could affect 
Palmer's plans for the 32-acre site. After losing a 10-year battle with the 
city to build a shopping center, Palmer wants to create a 26-lot subdivision 
and donate 12 acres for a public park. 
</P>
<P>
Both property owners lost long court battles this year to develop their land 
under the current zoning. Two local public land trusts want to buy the parcels 
to preserve their wetland habitats. 
</P>
<P>
Rezoning the parcels from residential and commercial to a new 
"institutional-recreational" zone would allow some development but would 
severely limit the amount, city planners said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-growth city has spent four years drafting a plan to place 21 other 
parcels under the new zoning as a way to curb commercial development. The City 
Council is slated to adopt the document, called the Maricopa Specific Plan, 
early next year. THIA BELL

APPEALS JUDGE OVERTURNS BAN ON TREE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appeals court judge late Thursday overturned an order by a Superior Court 
judge that banned the sale of Christmas trees on the Pierce College campus in 
Woodland Hills, paving the way for Joe Cicero to reopen his tree lot today or 
Saturday, said Cicero's lawyer, Harold Kippen. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles was a victory for 
the Ciceros, a San Fernando Valley farm family locked in a legal struggle with 
a large tree-selling chain that operates a sales lot across the street from the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Miller, owner of Miller &amp; Sons, which operates more than 40 lots 
statewide, brought legal action to block the Ciceros from selling trees, saying 
he was illegally denied the right to bid on the campus location, which is 
public land. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community College District, faced with a lawsuit by Miller, on 
Monday obtained a restraining order against Cicero from Superior Court Judge 
Dzintra I. Janavs. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero "is really very happy," Kippen said. "If the order had not been stayed, 
it would have bankrupted him. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero had protested that he had already ordered about $150,000 worth of trees 
when the order was issued. He said his $22,000 profit on tree sales last year 
was all that kept afloat the 15-acre farm he leases on the college campus, the 
last remnant of a landmark Valley agricultural operation.

HATE LETTERS PROMPT INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police said Thursday they are investigating white supremacy groups 
in the San Fernando Valley in connection with three racially derogatory letters 
received this week by two school administrators and a student at Grant High 
School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported the letters also were directed at the families of Principal 
Robert J. Collins, who is white and has a black wife, and Assistant Principal 
Joseph Walker, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
The letters, which had references to swastikas and white supremacy, also 
"contained racial statements which fall under the category of hate crimes," Los 
Angeles Police Lt. Joe Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said no suspects have been identified, but police are looking into 
"white supremacy groups in the area" and students. 
</P>
<P>
He said police are conducting a chemical analysis and other scientific tests on 
the letters, which were received over several days. The tests are to analyze 
handwriting and check for fingerprints, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Isaacs, the superintendent in charge of high schools in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, said: "It is obviously a very serious issue. We hope 
the party or parties responsible will be identified, but that is a matter for 
Los Angeles police." 
</P>
<P>
Racial slurs believed related to the letters were found Tuesday night painted 
on a school parking lot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials and police would not reveal the contents of the 
letters, but Garcia said one contained a threat in addition to racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 48, has been principal at Grant for more than seven years. He was 
named California's principal of the year in 1988 by the National Assn. of 
Secondary School Principals. 
</P>
<P>
The honor was given in part because Grant had the state's highest number of 
students who earned college credit by passing advanced placement tests in 
subjects such as calculus, physics and U.S. history.

A 61-year-old Van Nuys man who was shot during a confrontation outside a 
supermarket drove 2 1/2 miles to a hospital but died after emergency surgery, 
Los Angeles police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
There was no suspect or motive in the slaying of Clarage R. Kingsmore, and 
investigators said they had found few witnesses who could help piece together 
what happened at about 9 p.m. Wednesday outside the Hughes Market in the 14400 
block of Burbank Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Detective James Vojtecky said Kingsmore, who was to retire in a few months 
after 32 years as a manager at a Bendix Corp. office in Sylmar, had gone to the 
Hughes Market at about 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
After buying groceries, the victim walked back to his white 1987 Cadillac 
DeVille. Before getting into the car he was shot in the upper body by a gunman 
who fired at least twice at him, Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsmore managed to drive to Valley Presbyterian Hospital where he died at 
12:15 a.m. Thursday. The victim apparently didn't ask anyone in the store 
parking lot for help, and though some witnesses told officers they heard shots, 
the shooting was not reported to police until Kingsmore arrived at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said detectives were unable to talk to Kingsmore before his death. The 
victim's wallet was not missing, but police have not ruled out attempted 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
"He was coming out of the store, he had a nice car, it could have been an 
attempted robbery," Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe there were cars and shoppers at the market at the time of the 
slaying and asked that anyone who saw or heard anything to contact detectives.

TIRE PLANT RECAPPED; 
</P>
<P>
UNIROYAL LANDMARK REVIVED AS $120-MILLION COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For years, the abandoned Uniroyal tire plant alongside the Santa Ana Freeway in 
the City of Commerce was a shabby monument to an era when a rapidly growing Los 
Angeles attracted the nation's major tire producers. 
</P>
<P>
The plant was boarded up in 1978, ending nearly half a century of tire 
production. Its windows were broken and its facade was dingy from exposure to 
years of freeway exhaust fumes. 
</P>
<P>
But the imposing factory, built to resemble an Assyrian palace complete with 
turrets, never ceased to turn the heads of the tens of thousands of motorists 
who pass each day. Its stylized facade concealed a collection of steel 
buildings in Commerce, five miles south of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Now the freeway Goliath is being resurrected as a $120-million complex of 
office buildings, retail stores and a hotel. Some of the stores opened for 
business earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists laud the work done by developer Trammell Crow Co. to breathe 
new life into the structure. Its six-story administration building is intact, 
as is all but about 150 feet of its massive wall. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a question of whether it was going to survive in the long run," said 
Jay Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy. "It's a very 
important reminder that Southern California was second only to Detroit as a 
center of the automobile industry for a good part of the century, and second 
only to Akron (Ohio) in producing tires. 
</P>
<P>
The human-headed, winged bulls surrounding the entrance to the administration 
building have been spruced up, as have the winged genii and kings who grace the 
turrets along the massive wall. Steel reinforcing beams have been added to make 
the building and wall earthquake safe. A fresh coat of paint covers the royal 
facade. The firm that designed the colors for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los 
Angeles produced the paint scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Newly cast friezes depicting Assyrian warriors in horse-drawn chariots adorn 
the lobby of the tower, which served as the administration building for tire 
manufacturer Adolph Schleicher in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Offices in the tower are being leased, as is space in newly constructed office 
buildings. Construction has not yet started on the hotel. The entire project 
will not be finished for more than a year, a Trammell Crow spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow won the right to develop the project after assuring city 
officials that it would tread lightly on the landmark. It has spent $6 million 
to restore and renovate the administration building and wall, said Trammell 
Crow partner Hayden C. Eaves III. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born and raised in Los Angeles," Eaves said. "To have done anything less 
than we have done would have been a disaster to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow hired various restoration and design experts to work on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The administration building and wall are designed to look as if they were 
constructed from huge blocks. But the structures are made of reinforced 
concrete, mostly eight inches thick, which was poured into molds at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Structural engineer David L. Houghton came up with a system to reinforce the 
administration building and wall to resist earthquakes. Almost all of the 
original metal manufacturing buildings to the rear have been razed and new 
construction has gone up in their place. 
</P>
<P>
A Gardena firm, which has done work for movie studios, was brought in to 
replicate the friezes and other ornaments that had been damaged over the years. 
Sussman/Prejza and Co. Inc. of Culver City was hired to develop the color 
scheme.

IN A SWITCH, UNLV CAN DEFEND TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
NCAA DECISION: GIVEN CHOICE, SCHOOL OPTS TO PLAY FOR 1991 CHAMPIONSHIP. REBELS 
FORGO LIVE TV APPEARANCES AND POSTSEASON PLAY IN 1991-92. 
</P>

<P>
In an unprecedented move, the NCAA lifted its sanction prohibiting the 
University of Nevada Las Vegas from defending its national title in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA Committee on Infractions had ruled in July that UNLV would be 
prohibited from postseason play after the 1990-91 season as a final penalty 
stemming from the infractions case that caused UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian to 
take the NCAA to court 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a ruling released Thursday, the committee offered UNLV two 
alternative penalties, both of which allowed the Rebels to participate in 
postseason competition at the end of the current season. 
</P>
<P>
School officials immediately announced that they would accept one of the 
alternative penalties, which will prohibit the Rebels from making live 
television appearances during the 1991-92 season and competing in postseason 
play in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The other penalty offered by the committee called for UNLV to be banned from 
postseason competition in 1992 and Tarkanian to be suspended during postseason 
competition in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative penalties are similar to, but somewhat stronger than, those 
offered by Tarkanian and UNLV officials at a meeting with the committee on Oct. 
28 in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In losing its right to appear on TV or play in the NCAA tournament in 1992, 
UNLV will suffer in trying to balance its athletic budget. UNLV basketball made 
about $1.5 million during its championship season of 1989-90. However, because 
of the NCAA's new distribution formula for tournament revenue, UNLV would make 
significantly less even with another run to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's acceptance of one of the alternative penalties effectively ends the 
bitter legal fight Tarkanian has waged against the NCAA since the organization 
ordered UNLV to suspend him 13 years ago. The case went all the way to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, which ruled in the NCAA's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the threat of further legal action by both Tarkanian and UNLV 
players, the committee offered the alternative penalties as a means of putting 
the matter to rest. 
</P>
<P>
In its ruling Thursday, the committee wrote: "The committee emphasizes that it 
is making these two alternatives available to the university because it 
believes it is in the best interest of all concerned for this lengthy dispute 
to end, and either one of these alternatives . . . offers the university a fair 
and reasonable way of ending the dispute." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, UNLV President Robert Maxson described both alternative 
penalties as being fair and said the university would accept the penalty 
banning TV appearances and postseason play for the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We regret that next year's team is not eligible (for postseason competition)," 
Maxson said. "But we felt it was terribly important that our national champions 
be allowed to defend their title." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, ranked No. 1 in most preseason polls, have four starters back from 
the team that overwhelmed Duke, 103-73, last April 2 to win UNLV's first NCAA 
title. Among the returning starters are star forwards Larry Johnson and Stacey 
Augmon, both of whom almost certainly would have been first-round picks in last 
spring's NBA draft had they not decided to return to UNLV for their senior 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement issued at Vancouver, Canada, where the Rebels are 
scheduled to open their season Saturday against Alabama Birmingham, Tarkanian 
said his legal battle with the NCAA was finished and added: "I'm pleased for 
the kids and fans that we will be allowed to compete. Let's put these matters 
behind us and look to the season ahead and defending our national 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
Still to be resolved, however, is a three-year-old preliminary inquiry into the 
UNLV program that stems from the school's recruitment of former New York high 
school star Lloyd Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's news conference, Maxson said the school expects to receive a 
letter of official inquiry, outlining charges against UNLV, in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maxson, the charges have been ready for some time, but the NCAA 
agreed, at UNLV's request, not to send them to the school until the 1977 case 
was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Once it receives the charges, UNLV will have up to 90 days to draft a response 
before appearing in front of the infractions committee. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1977 case, the NCAA had placed UNLV on two years' probation with 
sanctions that included two-year bans on postseason competition and television 
appearances. The NCAA also ordered the school to "show cause" why it shouldn't 
suspend Tarkanian for two years or be penalized further. 
</P>
<P>
Of 38 rules violations documented by the NCAA in the case, 10 involved 
Tarkanian directly, including one in which he was cited for trying to coerce a 
former UNLV player into lying to NCAA investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that his constitutional right of due process had been violated by 
NCAA enforcement procedures, Tarkanian obtained injunctions in District Court 
in Las Vegas against both UNLV and the NCAA preventing any action on the "show 
cause" order involving him. 
</P>
<P>
The case, hinging on the question of whether the NCAA should be considered a 
governmental body whose actions must meet constitutional due process 
requirements, was heard by the Supreme Court in December 1988, and the court 
ruled, 5-4, in the NCAA's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Legal maneuvering led to a District Court order last March removing Tarkanian's 
injunction against the NCAA, but allowing his injunction against the school to 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Free to act on the 1977 "show cause" order, the current committee on 
infractions met with Tarkanian and UNLV officials in June. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, UNLV representatives asked that the committee take no action 
against the university under the "show cause" order, citing the "hardship" of 
the 13 years of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee saw the matter differently and imposed the ban on postseason 
play for 1991, making UNLV only the second school barred from defending its 
title in basketball because of NCAA sanctions. Kansas was barred from 
postseason competition because of NCAA sanctions after winning its national 
championship in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 2, a week before UNLV was scheduled to appeal the committee's decision 
to the NCAA Council, school officials announced that they had been granted 
another hearing by the committee to allow them to present new information on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
At the Oct. 28 hearing in Chicago, UNLV presented four alternative penalties: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tarkanian would sit out the 1991 NCAA tournament, forfeit his personal 
stake (10%) in the school's tournament revenue and abstain from recruiting for 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tarkanian would sit out the 1991 and '92 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UNLV would not compete in the '92 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UNLV would make no network TV appearances during the 1991-92 season, reduce 
its scholarships by two and official visits by nine during the 1991-92 school 
year and allow no off-campus recruiting by any basketball staff member for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the outcry at UNLV against being banned from postseason play in '91 
focused on the fact that athletes who were barely in elementary school at the 
time the 1977 case was processed would be unfairly punished by such a penalty. 
The committee took note of this position in its report Thursday but said the 
matter still called for some kind of postseason sanction. 
</P>
<P>
The committee cited the fact that the delay in carrying out the "show cause" 
order was caused by Tarkanian's litigation and noted that the NCAA's ability to 
enforce the order, in light of the Supreme Court's decision, was widely 
publicized. 
</P>
<P>
Had UNLV proposed at the June hearing the alternative penalties it suggested in 
October, the report stated, "the committee would have considered them and 
possibly . . . adopted penalties . . . that would have been similar to the ones 
the committee has adopted in this report."

ANGELS: CAUTIOUS PORT LOOKING TO TRADE AN OUTFIELDER FOR AN INFIELDER. BICHETTE 
SEEMS MOST LIKELY TO BE DEALT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is no trading deadline compelling them to make a deal at the annual 
winter meetings, but the Angels say they feel pressure about shoring up the 
many weak spots in their lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"The urgency is there in that, certainly, our aspiration is to get better," 
General Manager Mike Port said Thursday. "But you have to balance that urgency 
you feel and be careful it doesn't translate into foolishness." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are hardly an impetuous bunch. Over the years, they have made few 
trades at the winter meetings and even fewer major deals. In 1988, they 
acquired catcher Bill Schroeder from the Milwaukee Breweres for infielder Gus 
Polidor, and in 1987 acquired pitcher Dan Petry from the Detroit Tigers for 
outfielder Gary Pettis. Tim Foli was acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates 
during the 1981 meetings and dealt to the New York Yankees during the 1983 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Port said the deal he described as near completion 10 days ago has been put on 
hold but hasn't fallen through. He wouldn't specify the object of his efforts 
but did say the deal would bring the Angels an infielder. The cost would 
probably be an outfielder, Dante Bichette the likely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to be able to go forward with it, but if we don't get a, 'Yes, we 
have a deal,' then it wasn't meant to be," Port said. "I hope that's not the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
A number of teams are interested in Devon White, and although the Angels have 
grown exasperated with his inability to translate potential into production, 
they may not be able to afford to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have a viable (replacement) candidate within the organization 
at this point," said Manager Doug Rader, who will join the Angels' delegation 
in Chicago today. "It's a moot point until there's a suitable replacement. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very important for everybody to understand Devo's name is out 
there, but that's not necessarily because we are bandying it about. His ability 
and potential mean there's always going to be interest in him, and rightfully 
so. Those inquiries are not coming because we're putting his name out there." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have made finding a regular second baseman their priority, although 
they also are looking for a productive third baseman and a left-hander for the 
bullpen. The Toronto Blue Jays reportedly are making second baseman Manny Lee 
available and might also give up left-hander John Cerutti. They plan to move 
Mookie Wilson out of center field, a position Bichette or White could fill. But 
if the Angels need a center fielder in return, the Blue Jays can't accommodate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Lee had a strong first half last season but tailed off in the second half and 
finished at .243 with six home runs and 43 runs batted in. He made only four 
errors in 550 chances for a .993 fielding percentage. Cerutti was 9-9 in 30 
games -- 23 of them starts -- and had a 4.76 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Astros are said to be willing to trade switch-hitting third baseman 
Ken Caminiti but supposedly aren't interested in White and want a prospect in 
return. Caminiti hit .255 in 1989 with 10 homers and 72 RBIs, but his numbers 
dropped last season to .242, four homers and 51 RBIs. He made 21 errors at 
third in 382 chances for a fielding percentage of .945. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sax would solve the Angels' problem at second, but their chances of 
acquiring Sax from the Yankees apparently have diminished. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a dead issue," said Dan O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice 
president for baseball operations. "I think the Yankees are going to keep him." 
</P>
<P>
Port denied last week that the Angels were trying to acquire Cleveland's Jerry 
Browne or Atlanta's Jeff Treadway. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are interested in third baseman Jim Presley, a free agent who hit 
.242 with 19 homers and 72 RBIs for the Braves last season. Rader, however, 
reiterated that the club considers dabbling in free agency the least attractive 
of its alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be very tempted by quick-fix free agency, but it has an everlasting 
and devastating effect on the organization," Rader said. "We need to really 
devote ourselves to sticking to our organizational philosophy. . . . There's a 
few (free agents) who certainly would tempt us, but it's prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
Signing new-look free agents won't cost clubs a draft pick, as will be the case 
when they sign re-entry free agents. Angel President Richard Brown said the 
delay in announcing the list of new-look free agents hasn't affected his 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not held up any potential trades based on who will be new-look free 
agents," he said. "I wouldn't say we're less likely to make a deal because the 
list hasn't come out yet. We know what our weaknesses are. We're going after 
those holes and trying to fill them. We're talking. A deal or two may be 
consummated before, during or slightly after the meetings." 
</P>
<P>
Brown also said the Angels won't give free-agent left-hander Dave Righetti the 
five-year contract he's seeking, but they remain interested in him. Brown said 
the club has had no more than one or two meaningful conversations with 
Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein. 
</P>
<P>
"They're talking perhaps four (years) firm," Brown said. "Are we interested? 
Yes. We're interested in all quality free agents. Have we had negotiations? 
No."

Dr. Steve Bramwell, team physician for the Rose Bowl-bound Washington Huskies, 
was badly hurt Thursday in a plane crash that left his wife and a son with 
lesser injuries, associates said. 
</P>
<P>
Bramwell, 46, a former Husky star, was taken to Harborview Medical Center, 
where he was listed in critical condition with head, chest and facial injuries, 
hospital spokeswoman Lahar Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Bramwell was the most seriously injured of five people in his twin-engine Piper 
Navajo on a return flight from Provo, Utah, where he had taken a son, Eric, 18, 
to begin preparation as an overseas Mormon missionary, said Dennis Sealey, the 
team trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Bramwell's youngest son, Jeremy, 8, and his daughter's mother-in-law, Diane 
Dowd, 48, also were taken to Harborview and were listed in serious but stable 
condition, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Bramwell's wife, Linda, 45 or 46, and Eric Bramwell's girlfriend, Brooke 
Thorson, 20, were released from Enumclaw Community Hospital after being treated 
for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Bramwell, a native of Salt Lake City, played for the Huskies from 1963 to 1965 
and holds team records for punt returns with 59 for 704 yards, an 11.9 average, 
and kickoff returns with 54 for 1,443 yards, a 26.7 average.

Don't expect Ram quarterback Jim Everett to emulate Cleveland quarterback 
Bernie Kosar, who went into a tirade Sunday after the Browns' sixth consecutive 
loss. Kosar criticized his teammates for lack of concentration, and this week 
said the Browns appear to have benefited from the lashing as they head into 
this Sunday's game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it was out of frustration; I'm sure it's one way he wants to try to 
motivate his troops," Everett said. "They've had a coaching change, and the 
leadership probably is not there, so he's probably trying to take it upon 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fortunate that we have some team leaders that are very solid individuals 
here, who through thick and thin make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson, while straining to make it clear he wasn't specifically 
talking about Kosar's action, said he would never want an individual player 
taking his teammates to task in the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you feel betrayed when somebody does something like that, when in 
essence it's behind your back, it's to the press," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also held an on-field meeting to make sure the Rams don't have a 
letdown Sunday against the Cleveland Browns (2-9) after upsetting the San 
Francisco 49ers. TIM KAWAKAMI

KANSAS CAN'T SEE WHY UNLV WAS TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY NCAA

While UNLV celebrates, Kansas seethes. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure wish they'd given us a multiple-choice penalty," said Roy Williams, the 
Jayhawks' basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe what the NCAA did," said Jeff Gueldner, a guard on Kansas' 
national championship team of 1988 that was barred from the 1989 tournament. 
"It looks to me like the rules are not applied uniformly." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas followers were angered Thursday when the NCAA gave UNLV a choice it did 
not give the Jayhawks. After barring UNLV from defending its 1989 title because 
of violations stemming from a 1977 infractions case, the NCAA on Thursday 
changed its mind and offered the Rebels two alternatives. UNLV chose the second 
alternative, and will be able to defend its title this year after all. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Kansas will remain the only NCAA basketball champion barred from 
defending its NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
Del Brinkman, a vice president at Kansas and the school's longtime faculty 
representative, issued a one-sentence statement: "I didn't think it was 
possible to negotiate with the NCAA."

EXCAVATE MAKING NAME FOR HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excavate's odds in the Kentucky Derby future book crashed before some of the 
Las Vegas casinos learned how to spell his name. 
</P>
<P>
Probably because of a slip of the tongue by his trainer, Charlie Whittingham, 
the 2-year-old colt had been listed as "Excavator" by at least two Nevada race 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after Whittingham's Golden Pheasant had won this year's Arlington 
Million, the trainer was unexpectedly asked on national television about his 
Kentucky Derby prospects. Whittingham stumbled over the horse's name, it came 
out "Excavator," and that's the way it stayed in Las Vegas until recently. 
</P>
<P>
But Excavate blew his cover last Saturday at Hollywood Park, running for the 
first time and winning at six furlongs by five lengths. It was a debut that 
gave Whittingham no reason to disbelieve that Excavate might complete the hat 
trick that Ferdinand and Sunday Silence started for the 77-year-old trainer at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, based on his one victory in a maiden race, Excavate's odds have dropped 
from 30-1 to 3-1 at the Frontier's race book, making him the second choice for 
next year's Derby, behind the 5-2 Fly So Free, winner of the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile at Belmont Park a month ago and a cinch to be voted the Eclipse Award 
as divisional champion. 
</P>
<P>
The Derby is five months and a jillion land mines away, but if Excavate would 
give Whittingham that third sniff of the roses, he would be the most expensive 
horse ever to win the race. As a yearling, the son of Mr. Prospector and Anne 
Campbell, the Never Bend mare who also produced Desert Wine, was sold for $1.1 
million at a Keeneland auction. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lukas was the underbidder on Excavate, with Whittingham buying the 
handsome colt for Dick Duchossois, the owner of Arlington International 
Racecourse. 
</P>
<P>
After the sale, Arthur Hancock, Excavate's breeder, bought 12% back from 
Duchossois and Whittingham has become a 10% owner. 
</P>
<P>
Like Whittingham, Hancock became a Derby mainstay in the last decade. He was a 
partner in Gato Del Sol, who won the race in 1982. Then in 1989, Hancock, 
Whittingham and another partner, Ernest Gaillard, bottled the lightning with 
Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
"Excavate is big-boned and tough," Hancock said. "I've liked the horse from the 
time he was a foal. I think that running across those 100-acre fields we've got 
at Stone Farm (in Paris, Ky.) has really helped him." 
</P>
<P>
Hancock turns out his mares when they're just in foal, and one day a group of 
them took off running across one of those large Stone Farm fields. 
</P>
<P>
"They were running full out and Excavate was running right with them," Hancock 
said. "At the end, he beat them. He reminded me of a silver bullet that day." 
</P>
<P>
For a horse with such little experience, Excavate has already worked up a mound 
of ballyhoo. He has twice been featured on national television, besides the 
brief, muffled notice Whittingham gave him that day at Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Charlie about this horse when (Excavate) was still a weanling," Hancock 
said. "Another thing I like about him is that he's smart. This is a horse 
that's got a world of sense. If everything goes right, he could really be 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Some trainers might be tempted to thrust Excavate into the $1-million Hollywood 
Futurity a week from Sunday, but not Whittingham, who frequently doesn't run 
his horses at all when they are 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence raced for the first time on Oct. 30, 1988, and broke his maiden 
in his next race, Nov. 13. He had run four times before his first stakes race, 
which turned out to be a victory in the San Felipe Handicap at Santa Anita in 
March of 1989. He had run just six times going into the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
And Ferdinand, the Derby winner in 1986, didn't win for the first time until 
Nov. 3 of the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
There's something odd about this Sunday's promotion at Hollywood Park. The 
track is offering airplane trips for 100 fans to Las Vegas, where the winners 
will spend three days at the Riviera Hotel and Casino. Does it make sense for a 
track to send bettors someplace else to bet? Did Macy's tell Gimbels? What's 
more, the Riviera isn't even among the numerous Nevada horse books that 
co-mingle their bets with the mutuel pools at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Go and Go, the winner of the Belmont Stakes but a disappointment in the Travers 
and the Breeders' Cup Classic since then, has drawn the outside post in a field 
of eight in Saturday's $100,000 Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park. Rial, 
winner of the Oak Tree Invitational and then disqualified after finishing first 
in the Burke Handicap at Santa Anita, is the high weight with 122 pounds. He'll 
be running on dirt for the first time in this country, with Jose Santos riding 
for the first time. Kent Desormeaux will be riding Go and Go for the first 
time. Also in the field is Pleasant Tap, third in this year's Kentucky Derby 
and eighth in the Breeders' Cup Turf. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, the leading money-winning jockey this year with a lead of about 
$850,000 over Santos, will be riding Aksar Saturday in the $100,000 Bay Meadows 
Derby. There will be betting on the race at Hollywood Park. . . . Jerry Bailey 
regains the mount on Plenty of Grace for Sunday's $200,000 Matriarch. Bailey 
had another commitment at Aqueduct the day Herb McCauley rode the filly to 
victory in the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita. . . . Caliente, which has been 
closed because of labor problems, will resume racing on Jan. 19.

HUBBARD SENDS PROXY FIGHT TO STOCKHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fight for control of Hollywood Park moved to the next stage Thursday when 
R.D. Hubbard, owner of race tracks in Kansas and New Mexico, sent an eight-page 
letter to stockholders calling for the removal of Marje Everett as chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard's mailing came hours after filing a joint proxy and consent statement 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter Hubbard said: "Through a combination of what I believe to be 
mismanagement and bad judgment, Mrs. Everett has permitted Hollywood Park to 
decline into the second tier of racetracks from its former position of 
greatness." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard spent four pages attacking Everett's performance at Hollywood Park. He 
identified the following as problems caused by Everett: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The construction of the $40-million Pavilion of the Stars which "(is) so 
poorly designed . . . that people couldn't see the races and no one wanted to 
go there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The failure to gain zoning approvals at Los Alamitos that would have 
allowed them to sell the land at a great profit. Los Alamitos ended up as a 
$4.7-million book loss with an additional $18 million lost in expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A pre-tax loss of $9.4 million in 1989 compared to a pre-tax income of $9.5 
million in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A stockholder equity loss of $1.7 million at the end of 1989 from a 
$30.8-million profit in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failure to sell or develop excess real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mismanagement of concessions whereby Hollywood Park's profit is 12% 
compared to Santa Anita's 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failure to run the 1987 Breeders' Cup in a "professional way . . . 
resulting in interminable lines at betting windows and concession stands and 
traffic jams so bad that at least one trophy presenter was unable to reach the 
track." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard also outlined his plan should he gain control of the track. Among his 
suggestions were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To sell or develop the excess real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Promote inter-track wagering to include simulcast racing between Hollywood 
Park and Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Return the track to a one-mile course. It is currently 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Close the Pavilion of the Stars except for special occasions and simulcast 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
Harris Diamond, a spokesman for Hollywood Park, issued a rebuttal: "Mr. Hubbard 
has tried to take the track private before and he's clearly trying to do that 
again without spending any money. 
</P>
<P>
"The (operating) board has recently stated it should maximize value by selling 
the track and Mr. Hubbard should either join into that or purchase it (the 
track). What Mr. Hubbard has not told the shareholders is that under Marje 
Everett, the track has had a tremendous turnaround. It increased its dividends 
from 15 cents to 20 cents. Its operating numbers are positive as compared to a 
loss in the past and it has reduced debt from $100 million to $45 million." 
</P>
<P>
A stockholder meeting is scheduled for Jan. 28.

Led by twins Kathleen and Marianne Dixon, Cal State Northridge emerged from the 
first day of pool play unbeaten in the Women's Invitational Volleyball 
Championships on Thursday at the University of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Matadors beat Alabama Birmingham, 15-7, 15-11, 10-15, 15-9, 
then swept 10th-seeded Colorado State, 15-7, 15-4, 15-12. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will conclude pool play today against Eastern Kentucky (0-2 in pool 
play) and Iowa (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
In the match against Colorado State (14-7), Kathleen Dixon led the Matadors 
(26-8 overall) with 11 kills and 12 digs, and Marianne added 10 kills and 10 
digs. Senior setter Beth Welch had 35 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Dixon had 20 digs and 18 kills to lead CSUN against UAB (31-15). 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Walt Ker described his team's performance against Colorado State as 
polished. 
</P>
<P>
"We started a little slow in game one," Ker said. "Our serving and defense 
finally kicked in and allowed us to get into our transition game. We really got 
into the flow of the game then and played very confidently after that."

Use your mentality 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up to reality 
</P>
<P>
 -- From "I've Got You Under My Skin"by Cole Porter 
</P>
<P>
The actor facing the camera is Richard Gere, and can he really be saying what 
he is saying on network television? 
</P>
<P>
"Now here's the most important thing you need to know. If you have sex, wear a 
condom. If you're stupid enough to shoot drugs, for God's sake don't ever share 
the needle." 
</P>
<P>
Red, hot and bold -- that's what "Red, Hot and Blue" is by United States TV 
standards. It's a stride forward for which ABC should be applauded. No other 
U.S. network would gamble on it, according to its originators, New York lawyer 
and art critic John Carlin and London filmmaker Leigh Blake. 
</P>
<P>
A 90-minute music-video special, "Red, Hot and Blue" airs at 11:30 p.m. 
Saturday (which is World AIDS Day) on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
</P>
<P>
World AIDS Day is also being recognized elsewhere on TV, including cable's 
Bravo, whose telethon "Unfinished Stories II: Artists and AIDS" airs from 2 
p.m. Saturday to 3 a.m. Sunday, and again from 2 p.m. Sunday to 3 a.m. Monday. 
The event features celebrities galore and, at 5 p.m. Saturday, a 60-second spot 
titled "A Moment Without Television," during which viewers will be asked to 
reflect on the AIDS epidemic. The spot is also being carried on numerous other 
cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
Then at 8:30 p.m. Saturday, CBS is broadcasting an episode of "The Hogan 
Family" in which David Hogan learns that a close friend has AIDS. Curiously, 
David never asks how his friend got AIDS, but he does give some valuable advice 
to a high school assembly at the end of the episode: "If you're gonna do it, 
use a latex condom." 
</P>
<P>
Not part of this mix, unfortunately, is the excellent AIDS-related episode of 
NBC's "Lifestories" that was to have been shown Sunday night, only to be yanked 
by the network for reasons that remain ambiguous at best. NBC should run this 
episode as soon as possible, for it's arguably the most honest and educational 
AIDS story ever produced for American TV. 
</P>
<P>
And that returns us to "Red, Hot and Blue." 
</P>
<P>
While going much further than most in addressing the causes of AIDS with a 
bracing candor deserving of cheers, "Red, Hot and Blue" is still entertainment 
foreplay compared with a much better and blunter British version to be shown in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The differences in the two programs spotlight a wide attitudinal gap separating 
British TV and American TV on this issue. The latter is still hesitant to fully 
confront the AIDS crisis and its sexual reverberations, apparently for fear of 
alienating some viewers. When it comes to AIDS, American TV for the most part 
still wears a Victorian corset. 
</P>
<P>
"You can say much more and be more experimental on British TV than you can on 
U.S. TV," Blake said, "because generally in Europe, one is allowed to have more 
of a political view. It's also because we are used to thinking for ourselves 
much more than being told what to think." 
</P>
<P>
Both "Red, Hot and Blue" programs utilize the music of the great American 
composer Cole Porter, with top rock and pop performers having donated their 
services, along with prominent directors, to make video adaptations of classic 
Porter tunes whose romantic lyrics assume an eerie and powerful relevance in 
the context of today's AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
And both programs will benefit AIDS by drawing attention not only to the 
epidemic itself but also to a companion album and video whose proceeds will go 
to AIDS charities. 
</P>
<P>
The major differences are tone and focus. 
</P>
<P>
The British program is essentially a testament to the urgency of the AIDS 
crisis, supported by Porter music. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. program is essentially a testament to Porter, with AIDS in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"I would definitely say this is an entertainment special designed to celebrate 
Cole Porter through musicians of today," said Malcolm Leo, the producer 
assigned by ABC to assemble videos supplied by Carlin and Blake into a 
late-night program for its U.S. audience. The AIDS message was secondary, he 
said. "The problem was finding the right balance so that the show wasn't a 
polemic." 
</P>
<P>
The results are mixed. Ranging from Jody Watley's romantic rendition of "After 
You, Who?" to k. d. lang's melancholy "So in Love" to Neneh Cherry's driving, 
liberty-taking version of "I've Got You Under My Skin," some of the videos are 
striking as well as provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Erasure's rousing "Too Darn Hot," for example, at times superimposes printed 
AIDS statistics and other messages on news footage of AIDS activists clashing 
with police. And the last of the 12 videos -- Annie Lennox singing "Ev'ry Time 
We Say Goodby" -- is either an aching reminder of those lost to AIDS or simply 
a torchy lament, depending on your perspective. 
</P>
<P>
And perspective is just the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of American TV, the ABC program uses stars -- Carrie Fisher, Kyle 
MacLachlan and Whoopi Goldberg in addition to Gere -- to introduce the videos. 
The British one doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted this to be very modern and different, where you just go from 
film to film," said Carlin. "We felt people didn't really need to have their 
hands held, but the network felt the people would have been very confused." 
</P>
<P>
It's the presentation that's sometimes confused. With the exception of Gere, 
and Goldberg on one occasion, these stars emphasize Porter, not AIDS, in their 
introductions (MacLachlan actually sits at the piano and briefly plays). And 
this, combined with extensive use of archival footage of Porter, blurs the 
focus on AIDS to the point that the impact of the videos themselves is somewhat 
diminished. 
</P>
<P>
The archival material is charming and would be grand on just about any show. 
Except this one. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because this material is included, and partly because the U.S. version 
is 12 minutes shorter due to having more commercials, ABC's "Red, Hot and Blue" 
contains six fewer videos than the program being aired on Britain's Channel 4 
(and also getting weekend screenings at the Museum of Modern Art in New York). 
</P>
<P>
Two of the missing videos are among the most interesting and provocative: In 
the Jungle Brothers rendition of "I Get a Kick," a huge condom is stretched 
across a face, and in Jimmy Sommerville's interpretation of "From This Moment 
On," men romantically embrace. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred those be in, but ABC wanted more marque names," Blake 
said. "Actually, it was the Erasure piece that we never expected to get on the 
network because it expresses a lot of real issues that pertain to the epidemic. 
But Launa Newman Vincent (director of variety and late-night development at 
ABC) insisted that it go in." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the video appears in the ABC program minus some of the toughest printed 
statements that appear in the British version, such as: "The U.S. spends more 
in one hour on defense than in one year on health care." That was dropped 
because "it couldn't be documented," an ABC spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
In many other respects, the British program is simply more informational and 
much more of a health-awareness program, while also containing provocative 
statements from some of the rock artists who don't appear in the ABC program. 
David Byrne: "Sex is not only safer with a plastic condom, it's my . . . 
opinion that it feels better also." 
</P>
<P>
ABC was "shocked when they first got some of the material we produced, because 
some of these videos are more downbeat than what we would ever see on the 
network," Carlin said. "But after their initial shock, they slowly came 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Although Carlin and Blake say they had strong differences with supervising 
producer Leo, both laud Vincent and Michael Brockman, ABC's president of 
daytime, children's and late-night entertainment, for "pulling this program 
through." 
</P>
<P>
"We hung in there, and the network really turned out to be all right," Carlin 
said. Using its mentality, waking up to reality.

CHANNEL 7 SWEEPS PAST CHANNEL 4; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: ANCHORWOMAN CHRISTINE LUND'S RETURN AFTER FOUR YEARS HELPS KABC 
INCREASE ITS VIEWERSHIP BY ABOUT 90,000 HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NOVEMBER RATINGS. 
'OPRAH WINFREY'S' STRENGTH IS ANOTHER FACTOR. 
</P>

The return of anchorwoman Christine Lund helped KABC Channel 7 jump ahead in 
the local afternoon news race in what has become a see-saw war with former 
champion KNBC Channel 4, according to ratings for the November sweeps released 
Thursday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
Lund, the anchor superstar who re-emerged this month at Channel 7 after a 
four-year absence, boosted the station to victory for her 4 p.m. newscast by 
more than 40,000 households over Channel 4. A year ago, Channel 4 had won this 
time period by about 80,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
With Lund, KABC increased its viewership over last year by about 90,000 
households to 362,000, although some of that upsurge could also be attributed 
to the large audience increase enjoyed by "The Oprah Winfrey Show," which 
leads-in to the Channel 7 newscast. 
</P>
<P>
"Her fans are still out there and they came back to find her," Roger Bell, 
KABC's news director, said Thursday of Lund's impact on the station's ratings. 
But Bell also insisted that the gains reflect a trend that began earlier in the 
year in response to what he called an improved overall news product. 
</P>
<P>
"You will recall that we had (ratings) books in the past when numbers weren't 
so good and we had (most of the same) really good anchors then," Bell added. 
"It's not just the anchors. You have to have a good product around them." 
</P>
<P>
KABC also won at 5 p.m. by a small margin, while KNBC squeaked to victory at 6 
p.m., according to Nielsen. In the rival Arbitron ratings service, KABC tied 
KNBC at 6 p.m. and scored decisive victories at 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 p.m., KNBC's newscast was able to widen its hefty lead over all rivals in 
both ratings services. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings skid for Channel 4's 2 1/2-hour afternoon news block first surfaced 
in the sweeps month last May, when KABC overtook it at 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. KNBC 
regained the lead in all news time periods during the summer, but then this 
month -- despite sensationalistic feature series on such topics as sex on the 
daytime soaps and aphrodisiacs -- the station again saw its audience switch 
elsewhere in huge chunks. Nielsen numbers for Channel 4's afternoon block read 
like statistics in the California housing market: at 4 p.m., down 30,000 homes 
from a year ago; at 5 p.m., down 78,000; at 6 p.m., down 100,000 -- about 25%. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC spokeswoman Regina Miyamoto explained the station's decline by saying that 
"Donahue," the lead-in to the afternoon newscasts, was down a bit while "Oprah" 
showed big gains. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that the severe ratings decline suffered by NBC's "Today" show 
early this year has hurt Channel 4's entire daytime schedule, so that the 
station's on-air promos for its newscasts are not reaching as many people as 
they once did. Furthermore, she said, many viewers who once watched "Today" 
before work and then left the house with the TV tuned to Channel 4, now have 
their sets tuned elsewhere when they switch them on after work. "Today's" local 
ratings were down about 50,000 homes from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Miyamoto also pointed out that Channel 4 had made significant strides at 11 
p.m. and had again won a decisive victory over its two rivals in the 6 a.m. 
news battle. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS Channel 2 once again finished third in news among the three network-owned 
stations, losing large chunks of audience from a year ago in the afternoon, 
according to Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
With new anchor Michael Tuck facing his first sweeps in Los Angeles, KCBS' 6 
p.m. newscast dropped more than 55,000 viewers from a year ago. On the other 
hand, the station's 11 p.m. newscast showed an increase of about 45,000 viewers 
in Arbitron's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of audience has been a continuing problem for the local afternoon 
newscasts for more than a year, as competition from the independent stations 
and Spanish-language broadcasters has proved formidable. This month, the 
audience for the three Spanish-language stations -- KMEX Channel 34, KVEA 
Channel 52 and KWHY Channel 22 -- grew 23% over last November. From 9 a.m. to 
midnight, the three stations were watched by an average of 216,000 homes, up 
nearly 40,000 from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Reruns of "Hunter" on KTLA Channel 5 again dominated the 6-7 p.m. period this 
month. The show added some 40,000 households to its total of last November, 
beating the local and national newscasts on Channels 2, 4 and 7. How strong is 
"Hunter"? More than 200,000 more homes tuned in for the veteran cop show than 
tuned in for Dan Rather and "The CBS Evening News." 
</P>
<P>
The combined audience of the three national newscasts at 6:30 p.m. on the three 
network-owned stations is about twice as large as the audience for "Hunter," 
however. Still, more people are watching rerun entertainment fare on the four 
independent stations than watch the three network newscasts, by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA's long-dominant 10 p.m. newscast lost some of its audience for the first 
time in many years. Hal Fishman and his colleagues still won the time period 
over three other newscasts -- with about 32,000 fewer viewers than the year 
before, according to Nielsen. KTTV Channel 11 was second, but still trailed by 
about 70,000 homes. KCAL Channel 9 was a distant third, while KCOP Channel 13's 
new anchor and management team fell to fourth. In Arbitron's count, KCOP was 
third and KCAL was fourth, and KTLA's lead over KTTV was 135,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
For its three hours of prime-time news, KCAL averaged about 140,000 out of Los 
Angeles' 5 million households, a slight improvement over its showing last May. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, NBC squeaked out its 11th consecutive sweeps victory in the most 
competitive season since 1984, despite dropping two full ratings points from 
last November. NBC averaged a 13.1 rating in prime time for the month to ABC's 
12.8, CBS' 12.1 and Fox's 6.6. (Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.) 
</P>
<P>
Bob Niles, NBC's vice president of research, rejoiced at the victory and 
explained that the drop in ratings stems from the massive schedule changes -- 
nine new series and four time-slot moves for continuing series -- that the 
network made this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Though CBS trailed, the race between the three major networks is now "so close 
that a victory in the sweeps comes down to special events -- whose movie beats 
whose movie," said David Poltrack, CBS' vice president for planning and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, ratings for the three networks in November was 6% lower than 
a year ago. And viewing levels for the month's 10 top-rated series were down 
11% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In other sweeps highs and lows (using Nielsen numbers, unless otherwise 
indicated, with each local rating point equaling 50,263 homes): 
</P>
<P>
* "The Oprah Winfrey Show" on KABC crushed all of its talk-show competitors, 
scoring a 8.2 rating at 3 p.m. against "Donahue's" 5.1 on KNBC and "Joan 
Rivers' " 2.3 on KCBS. "Geraldo" at 4 p.m. on KCBS grabbed a 5.2 rating, while 
"Sally Jesse Raphael" registered a 3.8 at 2 p.m. on KCAL. 
</P>
<P>
* KABC is also the morning talk champ as "A.M. Los Angeles" scored a 3.1 rating 
at 9 a.m. KNBC's block of "Kelly and Gail" and "Marsha Warfield" managed only a 
1.8 while "Regis and Kathie Lee" scored a 1.6 for KCAL. Game shows on Channel 2 
actually won the hour with a 3.3 rating, while reruns of "I Love Lucy" on KTTV 
tied "A.M. Los Angeles" for second. 
</P>
<P>
* KNBC dominated the early morning news battle, grabbing a 4.2 rating and 27% 
of all those watching television between 6-7 a.m. KABC scored a 2.7 for its 
half-hour newscast at 6:30 a.m., while KCBS nabbed a 1 for its broadcast at 6 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
* Sitcom Mania: Expensive reruns of network sitcoms, which several station 
managers claim lure the younger demographics that advertisers prize, fared a 
bit better this month. "Cosby" on KCOP came in second in its 7 p.m. time period 
behind "Entertainment Tonight" on KNBC, beating "Wheel of Fortune" on KCBS and 
"Inside Edition" on KABC. Reruns of "Growing Pains" also made a strong showing 
for KCOP at 6:30 p.m., knocking off all three network newscasts and all other 
competitors except "Hunter." 
</P>
<P>
* "Jeopardy!" on KCBS won the highly competitive 7:30 p.m. time period over 
KNBC's "Hard Copy." These two shows, with 10.1 and 9.5 ratings respectively, 
finished as the two highest-rated programs outside of prime time. KTTV's "A 
Current Affair" slipped into a distant third-place tie with reruns of "The 
Golden Girls" on Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Tonight Show" on KNBC is still the king of late night with a 5.3 rating 
and a 20% share of the audience. "Arsenio Hall" on KCOP scored a 3.9 rating and 
attracted 11% of the viewers while "David Letterman" managed a 3.4 rating and a 
20 share at 12:30 a.m. on KNBC. "Into the Night" with Rick Dees scored a 2.3 
rating and a 10 share at midnight on KABC. Reruns of "Cheers" on Channel 5 at 
11 p.m. outscored all the late-night talk shows except for "The Tonight Show."

CONSULTANT PAUL KAGAN, A MAN ABOUT THE MEDIA

<P>
For Paul Kagan, the professional journey from media junkie to media guru began 
with a job as a movie usher in what he recalls as "a classy art house" in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Decades later, the firm he founded could be described in the same terms. The 
75-member Carmel company churns out nearly 30 newsletters on various aspects of 
the movie, television and cellular industries, and dispatches analysts to 
conduct seminars around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Kagan, 52, is scheduled to moderate a panel discussion this morning at the 
Western Cable Television Conference here on "Creating a Stable Environment for 
System Values." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kagan Associates averages 15 phone calls a day from reporters tracking 
various media developments, especially in cable television. Not surprisingly, 
there are more than 1,000 citations to the firm in the Nexis database, which 
monitors major newspapers, wire services and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"I did all different broadcast jobs," Kagan said in a recent interview. "I came 
to understand the value of investing in the business in the bull market of 
1967, and I realized that there wasn't that much understanding of value" of 
media properties. "My job is to determine value." 
</P>
<P>
Kagan's first big idea, during a brief tenure at E. F. Hutton, had to do with 
the future of cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"I was convinced from the beginning that cable was going to infiltrate society 
until people had as many channel choices as they could get," Kagan recalls. E. 
F. Hutton didn't agree, and Kagan left to establish his own firm in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Kagan said that what he does is no mystery: "An analyst is an observer who 
understands a trend, and spots it and tells everybody what the trend is." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, Kagan said, "we saw the era of mergers coming" and, he added, 
most of the companies he recommended rode the crest of buyouts and mergers. 
Now, he said, "the deal market has been murdered" by tough credit controls 
instituted in the wake of the savings and loan collapse and the junk bond 
scandals. But some major exceptions to this trend are in the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Time-Warner merger, said Kagan, "cast the die for future conglomerization 
of media companies. Somebody will buy NBC from GE. Something is going to buy 
CBS. People will merge with the assets they like." For example, he said, in 
light of the impending acquisition of MCA by Matsushita, another natural 
marriage would be Mitsubishi and Paramount. Because of currency variations, 
particularly the value of the dollar, "American studios can be bought very 
cheaply" by foreign companies, Kagan said. "It's like buying an offshore 
manufacturing facility." 
</P>
<P>
Kagan also said he is not overly concerned with the impact of the recession on 
the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
Premium services will be affected "because it is a discretionary buy," but he 
added that "pay (television) already has been in its own recession for several 
years." Basic cable, on the other hand, will be affected very little because 
"it's a good entertainment buy, like movies in the Depression -- dime-a-ticket 
escapism."

14 INDICTED IN POT-FARMING OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Phoenix has indicted 14 men accused of operating a 
multimillion-dollar network that allegedly dug high-tech subterranean marijuana 
farms beneath desert land in the Antelope Valley and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, released Thursday, is the first issued since federal drug 
agents last month discovered the highly organized ring, which was allegedly 
headed by construction contractors. The operation is a major, previously 
unknown supplier of marijuana to California, as well as other states including 
New York, authorities have said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators and sheriff's deputies have raided four underground farms 
equipped with elaborate, automated growing systems, two in the Antelope Valley 
and two in Bullhead City, Ariz. They have seized 23,000 marijuana plants valued 
at $77 million. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have also raided two homes in Lancaster and in the Barstow area 
where they said new indoor farms were being built. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the case, which has spurred a new law enforcement focus on 
the movement of growers from Northern California outdoor plantations to indoor 
sites in Southern California, will probably result in more arrests and charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The amounts are massive," Assistant U.S. Atty. James Lacey in Phoenix said of 
the amount of drugs seized thus far. "It could be this thing evolves further." 
</P>
<P>
Ten of those named in the indictment are already in custody, including 
45-year-old Frank Edward Gegax, the Lancaster plumbing contractor alleged to 
have financed and supervised the operation of each farm on properties owned by 
"front men." 
</P>
<P>
Gegax and his brothers -- fellow contractors Michael and Alan Gegax, ages 49 
and 44 -- are charged with conspiracy to distribute marijuana and two counts of 
possession of marijuana in connection with a farm near Lancaster and the two 
Arizona farms. Facing the same charges are three brothers -- David Larson, 28, 
Daniel Larson, 26, and Donald Larson, 32, of Bullhead City, -- and their 
cousin, Robert Benson, 28, of the Bullhead City area. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges Richard F. Yerger, 28, the owner of the ranch house east 
of Lancaster where investigators recovered 8,000 plants from a concrete bunker, 
with conspiracy to distribute marijuana. The three men who allegedly worked as 
caretakers at the farms were each charged with conspiracy to distribute 
marijuana. One of those men also was charged with possession. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Gegax and three other suspects indicted are still at large, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The indicted suspects face between 15 to 25 years in prison if convicted, Lacey 
said. Arraignment has been set for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Yerger said he believes his client is innocent. No attorney 
could be reached for Frank Gegax, who will be transferred from Los Angeles 
County Jail to federal custody next week along with Yerger and two of the 
caretakers. Attorneys for the other defendants also could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment does not mention one of the Antelope Valley sites, a farm where 
2,500 plants were recovered beneath a newly built house, owned by Yerger's 
father, Richard E. Yerger. He has not been arrested or charged. Investigators 
are still trying to determine how that operation fit into the network, 
authorities said, and new charges may be filed.

When Hubert Williams was police chief in Newark, N.J., during the early 1980s, 
city officials imposed a hiring freeze, announced layoffs and eliminated almost 
a third of his uniformed officers. 
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the police union picketed City Hall. Out-of-work officers 
mounted a "Fear City" campaign and distributed bulletins warning visitors not 
to shop in Newark lest they be robbed or mugged. Other officers stayed home 
with the "blue flu." And the windows of 90 radio cars were shattered in the 
police parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"That was pure unadulterated hell," the chief recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, where a similar budget crisis is looming, Mayor Tom Bradley 
this week ordered an emergency, seven-month hiring freeze -- in the midst of 
one of the city's most violent years in history. The city may face a 
$120-million budget deficit over the next 18 months if cost-cutting steps 
aren't taken. 
</P>
<P>
But his announcement drew immediate cries of doom of another kind. Some police 
and community leaders Thursday warned that the city's crime rate might worsen 
if the police drop their guard. 
</P>
<P>
Some police officials predicted fewer officers on the beat, slower police 
response times, less time for crime prevention work and sinking morale among 
the LAPD's 8,400 sworn officers. Community activists also worried that the 
hiring freeze would signal a field day for crooks, who already outnumber police 
in parts of the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the day after the mayor ordered the halt on police hiring, City 
Council member Joy Picus pledged to introduce a resolution to overturn the 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not stand still and let the number of officers be reduced," she said at 
a news conference on the lawn of the LAPD's patrol station in Reseda. "You 
can't turn recruitment on and off like a switch and expect it to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said they lose about 400 officers each year through attrition, 
with most of those positions being filled by graduates from the Police Academy. 
They said that the seven-month freeze would translate into a loss of about 200 
officers and that some recruitment and academy personnel might have to be 
reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
But they also said that 300 recruits enrolled in the academy will graduate in 
the months ahead. The real crunch, they said, won't come until late spring or 
early summer. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth, the department's chief spokesman, said there will be no 
new classes started after December. He said the department is hoping that the 
freeze is only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"If it goes very long, then we'll get into a hole that is very difficult to get 
out of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A short-term freeze, on the other hand, might "turn out to be nothing more than 
an uncomfortable hiccup," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Daryl F. Gates said the city's "roller coaster" style of management is to 
blame for the budget crisis. He said that for years he has asked for a 
contingency fee in his budget to pay for equipment and other costs but that 
"that has gone on deaf ears." 
</P>
<P>
Other police departments have been down this road. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a cutback resulted in a 3% reduction in police salaries, he said. 
In New York, he added, the mayor is requiring a 1% cut in salaries for all 
police managers. He said New Orleans for a while put their police officers on a 
reduced, four-day workweek. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a panel of Washington civic leaders concluded that its Police 
Department was poorly organized, with one out of five officers not working in 
the field. The group, brushing away contentions that there is a link between 
crime and police manpower, called for a 27% reduction in the Police 
Department's 6,024 uniformed and civilian positions. 
</P>
<P>
Their premise is not supported by all law enforcement experts. Many believe 
that an increased police presence on the street goes a long way to stemming 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common sense that when you're speeding and you pass a cop, you slow 
down," said Jerry Needles, director of police organizational services for the 
International Assn. of Chiefs of Police in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Or, if you're going to pull a burglary or rape somebody and you see a cop on 
the block, what would you do? Well, you'd change your mind real fast. It's that 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
Police experts and citizen groups also worry about what effect the freeze will 
have on crime prevention. They believe that successful programs like the DARE 
drug education effort in the schools help reduce future crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Sutton, a spokesman for the Brotherhood Crusade in Los Angeles, said that 
if police crime prevention suffers, community groups like his will have to step 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"It would signal an opportunity for us, at a time of adversity, to take control 
of our situation and help the police, who would be undermanned to do their 
job," he said. "We'll need more people in the community involved in sending 
notices to the criminal element that we will drive them out."

BRADLEY SEEN MOVING TO OUST CRA LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley is negotiating to force the resignation of John Tuite, the 
controversial head of the Community Redevelopment Agency, the city's powerful 
urban renewal agency credited with stimulating $7 billion in development, City 
Hall sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tuite, who has headed the agency for 4 1/2 years, has had a stormy relationship 
with the Los Angeles City Council and is viewed by some as out of step with the 
Bradley Administration's new emphasis on affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Ed Avila likely will be named to replace Tuite, sources said. 
Avila, a former member of the Los Angeles City Board of Public Works, has 
little redevelopment experience, but is considered highly loyal to Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Problems flared earlier this year for Tuite when he was investigated for 
allegedly violating bidding procedures and misusing city funds in hiring public 
relations consultants. He was cleared, but the agency was criticized for loose 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Tuite said Thursday he has made no decision about leaving his job, but plans to 
meet with the CRA's board next week to try to clarify the situation "because of 
the swirl of rumors." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bradley said Thursday that Tuite will "continue to serve as 
administrator for as long as he so chooses." 
</P>
<P>
Some supporters of Tuite, and even some longtime critics, said Thursday they 
feared he was becoming a scapegoat for Bradley's failure to shift the CRA's 
emphasis away from huge commercial developments to desperately needed housing 
for low-income groups. 
</P>
<P>
"If they remove John Tuite, they're making him the fall guy for a decade of 
missed opportunity at the CRA," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who has 
treated Tuite harshly during his brushes with the council in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to change the agency," Yaroslavsky said. "This is a 
superficial, cosmetic kind of a thing designed to create the impression of 
change, but in fact nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Tuite's fate, a consensus is emerging at City Hall that the 
42-year-old agency is at a crossroad. Having presided over the dramatic rebirth 
of downtown and stimulated $7.5 billion in largely commercial development 
projects citywide, the agency is now under pressure to embrace housing with 
greater zeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The CRA is still in the midst of an identity crisis," said Councilman Michael 
Woo. "There isn't a consensus on its mission. It used to be promoting new 
development in downtown Los Angeles, but today the climate is very different. 
There's more of a slow-growth movement. Support for the CRA is much more 
tenuous." 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years ago," Yaroslavsky said, "the mission of the CRA was to kindle a 
pilot light in downtown Los Angeles, which was dying. Today that fire should be 
housing . . . the most critical issue facing Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Tuite, a former official of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 
former Jesuit priest, said Thursday the criticism is baffling to him. 
</P>
<P>
"The agency has been running the largest affordable housing program in the 
country in the years I've been here," Tuite said. But the CRA must have a dual 
mission, he added, because commercial developments generate the revenue needed 
to fund housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some CRA insiders said that Tuite faced a difficult task because he lacked the 
backing of any interest group. "Tuite had no identifiable group of people as a 
base . . . not the business community, certainly not the service providers," 
said a source who participated in CRA decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
As if to counter critics, the CRA announced its new annual budget Thursday, 
including $100 million for housing construction and rehabilitation for the 
fiscal year beginning next July. That figure represents 36% of the agency's 
$278.2-million budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the agency's commitment to housing remains too small and 
others complain that they don't get clear guidance from the agency about its 
overall plans. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Molina, probably Tuite's strongest critic on the council, said, "There's 
a lot of concern about the CRA's direction and where it's going. They operate 
almost on a deal-by-deal basis, which is troubling." 
</P>
<P>
If Tuite does leave, according to Molina and others, the change may prompt 
renewed interest in a council takeover of the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
As a measure of its frustration with the agency, the council last year 
considered a complete takeover of the agency, which had operated independently 
with almost no council oversight. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover attempt failed, but the council established an oversight committee 
headed by Molina and gave itself greater control over CRA matters. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been mixed. Molina has continued to complain that Tuite and 
others at the CRA are less than forthcoming with information requested by the 
council. Several rancorous arguments have erupted at the committee meetings 
between Molina or Yaroslavsky and Tuite. 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing problem that remains, Molina said, is a lack of a clear 
statement of purpose from the CRA. For instance, she said, there are no precise 
guidelines for establishing redevelopment project areas. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen such areas now exist, the largest of which is the Central Business 
District.

PARTNERS STOLE DRUGS, CASH, EX-AGENT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: HE TESTIFIES THAT THE THREE NETTED MILLIONS IN THEFTS FROM DEALERS, 
STASH HOUSES AND EVEN FROM THE DEA'S HEADQUARTERS IN LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former federal drug agent on Thursday told jurors, in graphic detail, how he 
and two other agents went on a crime spree over several years in which they 
stole drugs and cash from dealers, stash houses and even from the Drug 
Enforcement Agency's Los Angeles headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
So audacious was the scheme, which netted them millions of dollars in drug 
profits, that the former agent, John Anthony Jackson, testified that he cut 
stolen cocaine for illegal street sales at night in the DEA's offices in the 
World Trade Center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is a key government witness in the DEA corruption trial of former agent 
Darnell Garcia, 43, of Rancho Palos Verdes, who is charged with drug 
trafficking, money laundering and conveying intelligence information to a 
fugitive drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson accused his fellow agent of participating with him in a wide range of 
crimes between 1983 and 1988, including breaking into a Pasadena garage, where 
they ripped off a Colombian drug cache of 180 kilos of cocaine, worth a 
potential $36 million in street sales; orchestrating diversions at DEA 
headquarters to steal drugs from the agency's evidence vault and almost 
$100,000 in drug money from a nearby cashier's office; instructing Jackson and 
another agent how to hide their drug profits in secret Swiss bank accounts, and 
harboring drug fugitives in Garcia's apartment in Bunker Hill Towers downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's daylong testimony provided moments of high drama in the second week 
of a trial growing out of the DEA's worst corruption scandal. Under rapid-fire 
questioning from Assistant U.S. Atty. Joyce Karlan, he described a series of 
drug thefts that quickly made the agents millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Jackson nor Garcia showed outward emotion. Jackson looked at his former 
colleague only once, when U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. asked him to 
identify the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
During a recess, Jackson, 41, of Claremont, shook hands and hugged other DEA 
agents in the court corridor who had come to see him testify. Responding to 
reporters' questions, he suggested that Garcia's chances of being acquitted 
were slim. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have gotten off the Titanic when it first started going down," 
Jackson said, referring to the government investigation that resulted in the 
1988 indictment of the three agents. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence mounted against the three, Jackson and the third agent, Wayne 
Countryman, 47, of Walnut, pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges last 
August. The two were told by prosecutors they might receive reduced prison 
sentences -- Jackson 15 years, Countryman, seven years -- if they cooperated 
and testified against Garcia, who has steadfastly maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a stocky man known as "J.J." among his associates, said he harbored no 
animosity toward Garcia. Of his stinging testimony, Jackson told reporters 
Garcia knew that he -- Jackson -- was doing what he had to do. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows that's the way the cookie crumbles," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
But if Garcia and Jackson kept their cool, some DEA agents in the courtroom 
audience had difficulty controlling their emotions toward their colleagues' 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
"It really, really hurts to see someone who was your friend do this," said an 
agent who had worked closely with Jackson and who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. "J.J. was a good agent. He made a lot of cases. We're all touched by 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Jackson's 15-year career with the DEA was spent in dangerous undercover 
work ferreting out drug dealers. He told jurors it was in this role, in 1981, 
that he posed as the nephew of Brooklyn, N.Y., drug dealer Mahlon Steward. It 
wasn't long, he testified, before the two developed a "brotherly" relationship 
and began discussing the possibility of putting together their own illicit drug 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
Steward, 60, the government's first witness last week, testified how, beginning 
in 1983, he trafficked in heroin and cocaine supplied to him by Jackson and 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson described how he and Garcia "made arrangements to adulterate a pound of 
(seized) cocaine and subsequently sold it." 
</P>
<P>
In one of their early sales, he said, Garcia returned with $21,000 in a paper 
bag and evenly split the profits among the three agents. 
</P>
<P>
Adulterating narcotics, Jackson explained, meant he would extract a pound of 
relatively pure cocaine from a kilo (2.2 pounds) and replace it with baking 
soda to cover up the theft. He said he performed the procedure at night in the 
DEA's downtown headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
In another bold theft in July, 1984, Jackson said he and Garcia conspired to 
steal almost $100,000 in drug proceeds that had been left in a box in the DEA 
cashier's room. He said that while Garcia "distracted" a DEA agent who was 
monitoring the room via a television camera, he -- Jackson -- walked into the 
unlocked room and absconded with the cash. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Jackson said, in October, 1984, while he distracted a DEA guard at 
the agency's 800-square-foot evidence vault, Garcia stole one kilo of heroin. 
"Garcia simply walked down the aisle and removed it," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Their biggest theft, which made the three agents instant millionaires, Jackson 
said, occurred in November, 1985, when they discovered the 180 kilos in 
Pasadena -- a theft he called "the Big Rip." 
</P>
<P>
The defense is to cross-examine Jackson today.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALDANA ATTACKER'S TRIAL FOR LETTER THREATS 
BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attacker in the near-fatal stabbing of actress Theresa Saldana began trial 
Thursday on charges of sending death-threat letters to the movie star and her 
rescuer. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur R. Jackson, 55, faces six years in prison if convicted of sending the 
letters to Saldana and Jeff Fenn, the water deliveryman who subdued Jackson and 
held him for police after Jackson nearly stabbed Saldana to death in West 
Hollywood in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In the letters, Jackson said it was his "divine mission" from God to kill 
Saldana so that she could have a future heavenly rendezvous with him. The 
Scottish drifter, who has a history of mental problems, entered the United 
States illegally in 1982 to stalk the actress. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was convicted of attempted murder after the March 15, 1982, knife 
attack outside her apartment. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, which was 
cut in half for good behavior. Authorities learned about the letters just weeks 
before his scheduled June, 1989, release.

OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Authorities are investigating the complaint of a 27-year-old Whittier woman who 
told deputies that she was sexually assaulted by a man dressed like a police 
officer and driving a four-door sedan painted black and white like a patrol 
car. 
</P>
<P>
However, no suspects have been arrested and a detective said authorities have 
been unable to contact the victim since the attack was reported. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose identity was not disclosed, said she was stopped about 12:30 
p.m. Tuesday in the 1400 block of Dicky Street in the Whittier area by a man 
wearing a badge. The man handcuffed her and attacked her in the back seat of 
his car as she screamed for help, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk substation Sheriff's Detective Barbara Henderson said Thursday that she 
has "no idea" whether the man may have been impersonating a police officer or 
may have been, in fact, a security guard or a policeman.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE MYTH OF CLEAN POLITICS CRUMBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An enduring California myth has held that politics are cleaner here than in 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
It's really more complicated than that. For example, look what's happened to 
two well-known elected officials, Mayor Tom Bradley and Sen. Alan Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's personal and political finances are under investigation by local, 
state and federal officials. Cranston is being investigated by the Senate 
Ethics Committee as one of the Keating Five, accused of giving special 
treatment to campaign contributor Charles Keating, owner of Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
What's ironic is that the two had started out as reformers, first Cranston and 
then Bradley, heroes of the California myth. 
</P>
<P>
As an idealistic liberal Democrat, Cranston wanted to expand the party's base, 
recruiting the young families moving to California after World War II. In 1953, 
he founded the California Democratic Council, a group of grass-roots volunteers 
who soon became a dominating force in party affairs. The volunteers, organized 
in clubs throughout the state, were anti-Legislature, anti-Establishment and 
anti-corporate power. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, then a police officer, got into politics by joining a CDC club in Los 
Angeles. The young CDC reformers welcomed him, and by the early '60s had formed 
the heart of a political organization that elected Bradley to the City Council 
and eventually made him mayor. 
</P>
<P>
People power. Grass-roots democracy. The California ideal. 
</P>
<P>
The same sort of thing I'd been taught in school, along with the story of a 
sainted old governor named Hiram Johnson who had permanently banished all 
crooks from the Capitol. I accepted that until until I arrived in the Capitol 
in 1961, many years after Johnson's demise. That's when I learned that old 
Hiram's broom hadn't swept clean. 
</P>
<P>
Racetracks, the liquor and beer business, and the banks and savings and loans 
all had a piece of the government, exerting their influence through powerful 
lobbyists, campaign contributions and favors. Favors were as small as a pass to 
the races and as large as a chance for a bargain-basement purchase of savings 
and loan stock. In the mornings, oil, liquor and racetrack lobbyists would sit 
down with the Senate president, the late Hugh Burns, and plan the day's 
legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
When I moved to Los Angeles in 1970, I found things were pretty much the same 
at City Hall, except that the land developers occupied the power positions held 
in Sacramento by oil and financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
No one thought there was anything wrong with this -- not the press, not the 
politicians, not even the public. In fact, in the middle of this gaudy era, in 
1968, Californians voted the Legislature a pay raise and gave it full-time 
status. 
</P>
<P>
While they advocated -- and accomplished -- reform, Bradley and Cranston also 
learned the contribution game. You can't be elected in this huge state, where 
costly television commercials dominate politics, without being able to rake in 
big contributions. 
</P>
<P>
When Bradley first ran for mayor in 1969, his finance chairman was a rich land 
developer named Mark Boyar. Mark, who's now dead, was my cousin. He was tough, 
smart, sophisticated and totally cynical. I can't think of any character more 
in contrast to the Bradley reformers than Mark -- or anyone Bradley needed more 
that year. He raised the money that fueled the reform campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, even in his younger days, was an extremely successful fund-raiser. He 
was state controller from 1959 to 1967. Like his predecessors, Cranston 
appointed functionaries known as inheritance tax appraisers. They were campaign 
contributors and other political cronies who'd make a quick examination of the 
deceased's holdings and collect a substantial fee from the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Bradley and Cranston became most adept at the money game. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has outstripped his predecessor, Sam Yorty, in raising money from those 
doing business with the city. Documents recently obtained by The Times 
portrayed City Hall as a virtual fund-raising "boiler room." And it now appears 
that Cranston has been running a one-man portable boiler room, calling 
contributors day and night from his office, his home, hotel rooms, airports. 
</P>
<P>
If you ask either the mayor or the senator, they would tell you they've done 
nothing wrong. And by the standards of their youth, maybe they haven't. 
</P>
<P>
But rules of politics have changed since the early reform days of Bradley and 
Cranston. In their time, the press began routinely investigating campaign 
contributions. Populist-style politicians learned they could win by attacking 
even the smallest conflicts of interest. Ethics became an Issue. 
</P>
<P>
The myth of clean California politics has been put to a test. And as it has 
crumbled, so have the fortunes of some of those who honestly helped create it.

FROM A TO Z, U.S. LEADERS AVOID R WORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would a recession by any other name feel as bad? 
</P>
<P>
Government leaders clearly hope that the answer is no: They are struggling 
mightily to avoid the dreaded R word, even as bleak economic news keeps piling 
up. 
</P>
<P>
In a phrase only economists could love, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan termed the slump "a meaningful downturn in aggregate output." 
Translation: The economy is shrinking. A "lull" is the soothing image favored 
by Michael J. Boskin, chief White House economist. President Bush has called it 
a "slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
There's no mystery to these benign word choices. No president wants to be 
identified with a recession, however complex its roots. Also, it's not 100% 
certain that a recession is in progress, although many experts say it is. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials "are going to call it the Hussein recession or the Fed 
recession," predicted Lawrence Chimerine, a fellow with the Economic Strategy 
Institute, a Washington think tank. "No Administration likes to admit there's a 
recession taking place on their watch." 
</P>
<P>
A recession is broadly defined as six months of a declining economy. In an odd 
rite of policy and tradition, the date of its arrival is decreed by a group of 
seven academics, who mull over things such as U.S. employment, income, 
industrial output and trade. 
</P>
<P>
"They call a meeting when they feel like they can make a decision," explained 
Donna Zerwitz, a spokeswoman for the private National Bureau of Economic 
Research in Cambridge, Mass., whose Business Cycle Dating Committee performs 
the weighty task. "There is nothing scheduled right now." 
</P>
<P>
Barring an official determination, the quest to find kind and gentle 
substitutes for the R word is likely to go on. Many Americans would find it 
unsettling for a high-level official to proclaim a recession at this early 
stage of a slump, Chimerine said; such a statement could further jeopardize the 
economy and stir the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's cautious choice of words this week underlines another side to the 
dilemma. Declaring that the economy is in the tank would unleash public 
pressure for lower interest rates. And the Fed chief doesn't want to lower 
rates too fast for fear of provoking inflation. 
</P>
<P>
While none of that is a secret, those schooled in the arcane code-language of 
government economists were startled by his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard that yesterday, I said, 'Oh, God, we've been waiting for this,' " 
said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover. "To hear Alan 
Greenspan say there is a meaningful downturn, tells me he thinks we're in a 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
Other government officials have found even more creative ways to describe a 
recession. Alfred Kahn, the Carter Administration's inflation fighter, got a 
presidential scolding for uttering the taboo term in public. So Kahn, in an 
effort to satisfy his boss, took to calling it a "banana."

WILL STATIONS HAVE TO 'EAT' THE NEW GAS TAX? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new nickel-a-gallon federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel goes into effect 
Saturday, but it's unclear how much of that increase will find its way to the 
corner gasoline station. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, service station operators say they can't afford to swallow any of 
the tax and must pass the 5-cent hike onto consumers. On the other hand, 
service station operators may not want to risk losing any more customers, 
especially since demand for gasoline has already fallen dramatically in the 
face of high prices resulting from the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, 
analysts note. 
</P>
<P>
"You're damned if you do and damned if you don't," said David Carney, who 
operates Hillside Chevron in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-cent tax was approved by Congress in October as part of the budget 
reconciliation act, with half of the anticipated $5 billion in new revenues 
going to reduce the federal budget deficit and half to finance transportation 
projects. It boosts total federal gasoline taxes to 14 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Jones, an industry analyst and president of AUS Consultants Inc. in 
Philadelphia, said his firm's research indicates most retailers will hike 
prices the full nickel at first, but then back off in the next two or three 
weeks, with dealers ultimately eating two cents of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Picture four service stations at an intersection," Jones said. "Given the 
current market situation, with sellers of gasoline vying for decreasing demand, 
it will be too enticing for one of those four stations to raise their prices 
only four cents a gallon while the other three raise theirs a whole nickel. 
Then it starts." 
</P>
<P>
There is another scenario: refiners or oil companies could decide to drop the 
wholesale prices of gasoline sold to dealers to offset the tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a possibility that retailers will appeal to branded refiners and say, 
'Look, the competition is forcing us to lower our prices; you guys have to give 
us some help,' " Jones said. But, he added, "Normally this sort of thing falls 
full force on the retailer." 
</P>
<P>
None of seven major oil company spokesmen interviewed Thursday would comment on 
future price changes, saying only that the companies would remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp., however, recently dropped posted wholesale prices of gasoline 4 
cents a gallon in California. But there was no net effect on wholesale prices, 
because the change simply reflected a discount already being offered to 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco Inc. said it has dropped Los Angeles wholesale prices of its regular 
unleaded gasoline 5 cents a gallon and diesel fuel 6 cents a gallon in the last 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kaplan, a Shell dealer in Sherman Oaks, said he believes Shell Oil Co. 
may drop its wholesale gasoline prices 2 cents a gallon, though a Shell 
spokesman would not comment on that. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever Shell does, Kaplan said, consumer wrath would still fall on him. 
"We collect every kind of tax you can think of, and my customer looks at me and 
says, 'You ought to get your hand slapped for what you're doing,' " he said. "I 
think it's totally unfair." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 5-cent hike on Saturday, federal taxes will rise another 0.1 
cent per gallon to raise money for a fund to deal with leaking underground 
storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
For Californians, the tax increases follow a state hike of 5 cents a gallon on 
Aug. 1 -- the day before the invasion -- and precedes another penny-a-gallon 
state tax hike coming Jan. 1. By then, the price of a gallon of gasoline will 
include 38 cents in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the taxes are paid by wholesalers of gasoline and built 
into the cost of the fuel sold to retailers: service stations, bulk 
distributors and others. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they pass that cost onto consumers depends on a variety of factors. 
</P>
<P>
Already, retail prices of gasoline have skyrocketed about 30 cents a gallon 
since the Iraqi invasion, although they have stabilized in the last five weeks 
or so. This week, the national average price of a gallon of regular, self-serve 
unleaded gasoline -- the most popular grade -- was $1.366 a gallon, according 
to the American Automobile Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the run-up in retail prices had not kept up with the rise in 
the cost of crude oil, from which gasoline is made, or in some cases with the 
wholesale cost of gasoline sold to dealers. That meant that many dealers were 
seeing their operating margins squeezed at the same time demand fell off. 
</P>
<P>
Operating margins for retailers nationally fell from 13.9 cents a gallon on 
July 6 to 8 cents a gallon on Aug. 24, according to the widely read Lundberg 
Survey. That margin has recovered to about 13.4 cents a gallon now, Lundberg 
reported. Out of that margin, dealers must pay overhead, income taxes and other 
expenses before seeing a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Bacca, who operates Chevron stations in Costa Mesa and Santa Ana, said his 
sales volume has fallen about 15% and his profits are down 25% since the 
invasion. "I'm going to do my best to pass (the new tax) on, because our 
profits are pretty slim right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there are real concerns that another steep hike in gas prices will further 
discourage motorists from buying. 
</P>
<P>
Carney said sales volume at his Chevron station in Torrance fell 30% from Aug. 
1 to Aug. 4 -- first, because of the new 5-cent-a-gallon state sales tax, then 
because of a 5-cent-a-gallon price increase due to the Iraqi invasion. Sales 
have not yet bounced back, Carney said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, gasoline demand was 2.7% lower in October than a year before. 
</P>
<P>
GAS PRICES 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the American Automobile Assn. 
began reporting national gasoline prices daily. After the first few weeks, it 
began reporting prices weekly.

NESTLE, COKE PLAN JOINT VENTURE FOR READY-MADE COFFEE AND TEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coca-Cola Co. and Nestle S.A., already husky players in the global beverage 
market, said Thursday that they plan to team up to make ready-to-drink coffees 
and teas. 
</P>
<P>
A new company to be owned and funded equally by the two giants would make and 
sell concentrates for use in production of beverages under the Nescafe and 
Nestea brand names. The venture would exclude Japan, where both Coca-Cola, 
based in Atlanta, and Nestle, of Vevey, Switzerland, already compete with 
similar products. 
</P>
<P>
One beverage industry consultant said such a union would enable the companies 
to tap into a potentially explosive market, with Nestle providing the 
well-known brand names and Coca-Cola supplying the distribution clout. In 
Japan, for example, the ready-to-drink coffee market grew 20% last year and is 
worth an estimated $10 billion at retail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good move for both companies," said Hellen Berry, market research 
director for Beverage Marketing Corp., a consulting firm in New York. "It gives 
(them) a niche in a beverage category that I suspect is going to become very 
important in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Francois-Xavier Perroud, a Nestle spokesman reached in Switzerland, said it is 
far too early to say which markets or products would be of most interest. The 
products could be served hot or cold, although packaging details have not been 
worked out. In Japan, many consumers pour their canned coffee over ice, a 
variation that has not yet found wide acceptance in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the management team is at work, they will have to identify markets," 
Perroud said. "We're certainly not limiting our sights to any particular 
regions." 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, which sells syrups and concentrates to bottlers in 170 countries and 
has the world's largest beverage distribution network, has marketed 
ready-to-drink coffee in soft drink-style cans in Japan under the Georgia label 
since 1975. The beverage, much of it sold through vending machines, is the 
leader with an estimated 27% of that market. 
</P>
<P>
The company had total sales last year of about $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Nestle, No. 2 in Japan, distributes Nescafe ready-to-drink canned coffee 
through a partner, Otsuka, a beverage distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi-Cola, Coke's big U.S. rival in soft drinks, also sells coffee, under the 
Freedom label, and tea, called Jazzinn, in Japan in both cans and bottles. 
Spokeswoman Becky Madeira said Pepsi has found that most customers prefer cold 
refreshments. She added that Japanese consumers face a dizzying array of 150 
flavors of soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said General Foods sells a similar canned-coffee product in Japan. A 
General Foods spokesman could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Nestle, which claims to be the world's largest food company with 1989 sales of 
more than $30 billion, owns Nestle Chocolate Co., Carnation Co., Stouffer Foods 
Corp. and Nestle/Hills Bros. Coffee Co., among many others. Based in San 
Francisco, Nestle/Hills Bros. sells coffees under the names MJB, Chase &amp; 
Sanborn, Sark's Supreme, Nescafe and Taster's Choice. Nestle's Nestea competes 
with, among others, a canned iced tea made by Thomas J. Lipton Inc., owned by 
Unilever. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the joint venture could take several months to work out, observers 
noted. By signing a so-called letter of protocol, the two sides have "agreed to 
agree," said George E. Thompson, a beverage industry analyst with 
Prudential-Bache in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a long-term deal," Thompson said, adding that results of the venture 
probably would not be reflected on either company's bottom line for at least 
three years. Thompson added that, in his view, a wide-scale introduction of 
canned coffee in the United States would probably be "way down the road." 
</P>
<P>
The new company is expected to start with funding of $100 million.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: MERGING WITH RIVAL MAY ASSURE SURVIVAL DURING 
A DOWNTURN 
</P>

Like most entrepreneurs, Prime Time Shuttle founder John Kindt searched hard to 
find an investor. Kindt's angel, who was in the construction business, fueled 
Prime Time's growth by providing the money to install a high-tech computer 
reservation system. Soon, the company, which serves airports, piers and train 
stations in Los Angeles and Orange counties, ranked second among shuttle 
services in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But a few months ago, when the region's construction boom fizzled, Kindt's 
angel pulled out, asking Kindt to convert his substantial equity investment 
into a loan. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to decide whether to pull way back and resign my position as No. 2 in 
the industry, or go forward and turn into the storm," said Kindt, who founded 
the company in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting back was too depressing. Selling out would be a defeat. As he weighed 
his alternatives, Kindt recalled an earlier overture made by a rival, City 
Shuttle founder Rod Ramsey. Kindt and Ramsey had served together on the board 
of a shuttle industry trade association. Although they competed for every 
passenger in the San Fernando Valley, the two respected each other's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
While the thought of joining forces with your enemy may be hard to swallow, 
more small-business owners are using mergers or strategic alliances as a way to 
flourish during the current economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It is much more difficult for companies to remain independent and grow in a 
recession," said Jim Freedman, managing director of Barrington Associates, a 
Brentwood investment banking firm. "In these times, companies need size, 
bargaining power, increased distribution and decreased costs." 
</P>
<P>
If your company is not ranked No. 3 or better in its industry, you should think 
of making some kind of alliance with a competitor, said Michael Corrigan, head 
of Price Waterhouse's corporate finance group in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"In any recession, the weakest tend to go to the wall," said Corrigan, who 
along with Phil Tremonti, another partner at Price Waterhouse, orchestrated the 
Prime Time-City Shuttle merger. 
</P>
<P>
When Kindt and Ramsey began negotiating in July, Tremonti said they were far 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
"They walked away from each other three or four times," Tremonti said. "I felt 
like a priest or marriage counselor." 
</P>
<P>
Tremonti, who has put together several mergers, said the biggest problem in 
bringing two small companies together is meshing the needs of their 
strong-willed owners. "While I was using financial logic, the entrepreneurs let 
their egos get in the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, he encouraged Kindt and Ramsey to focus on the positives of a deal, 
emphasizing growth potential and ability to cut overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Tremonti, the entrepreneurs, their accountants and attorneys 
crafted a merger plan. The division of responsibility reflected their personal 
strengths. Kindt, who became president of the combined firm, realized he 
enjoyed overseeing day-to-day operations. Ramsey, vice president and chief 
financial officer, prefers to concentrate on the financial and administrative 
side of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Time hired a number of City Shuttle's drivers, bringing employment to 
500, but many others were let go. 
</P>
<P>
To give the new and bigger Prime Time a fresh start and more space, the company 
recently moved into a 15,000-square-foot facility near Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after moving into the new headquarters, Ramsey, who also founded his 
shuttle company in 1986, reflected on his decision to join Prime Time. 
</P>
<P>
"I approached John and told him it made sense for us to get together," he said. 
"At first, he wasn't too receptive, but then he became convinced it was a good 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
As the company gears up for the busy holiday travel season, Ramsey said, he can 
already see how the merger has substantially reduced overhead costs. 
</P>
<P>
"This merger will contribute to our profits and allow us to survive the hard 
times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kindt also feels good about the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"I eliminated a competitor," he said. "The merger gives us good economy of 
scale and allows us to have a broader financial base." 
</P>
<P>
Although no money changed hands in the tax-free merger, Kindt said he and 
Ramsey "both brought their bank accounts" into the new company. The new, bigger 
Prime Time expects to serve 720,000 passengers, which should generate about $12 
million in revenue a year. 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD MERGER PARTNER 
</P>
<P>
Orchestrating a successful merger is like getting married. You may be attracted 
to each other and have similar interests, but everyone has a different way of 
doing things. 
</P>
<P>
After figuring out what company might fit well with yours, experts suggest 
asking a third party to make the initial overture. If there is interest in your 
firm and you begin discussions, ask yourselves these questions: 
</P>
<P>
* What is the synergy between our companies? Do we serve the same customers? 
Are our products and services similar? 
</P>
<P>
* How could our combined companies increase sales? 
</P>
<P>
* Are our management styles compatible? 
</P>
<P>
* Which company has a better facility or location? 
</P>
<P>
* If we merge, should we move to a bigger space or new location? 
</P>
<P>
* Who will be president and who will be vice president? 
</P>
<P>
* How would we eliminate duplication of jobs and let employees go? 
</P>
<P>
* What should the merged company be called? 
</P>
<P>
* Should we have employment contracts to keep each other around for a while? 
</P>
<P>
* Where can we find the best advisers to structure the deal? 
</P>

USAir, All Nippon Airways Plan Link: USAir Group agreed to initiate service 
between Orlando, Fla., and Washington as part of a cooperative agreement with 
All Nippon Airways. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows ANA to offer customers round-trip flights between Tokyo 
and Orlando -- a popular tourist destination -- with a stop in Washington. Both 
airlines said they have asked the U.S. government to allow shared flight codes 
and blocked space arrangements, under which ANA would guarantee USAir a certain 
amount of revenue for the Washington-Orlando flights. The airlines said they 
would explore other cooperative arrangements, perhaps on flights between 
California and Japan.

Wells Fargo Acquisition Approved: Wells Fargo &amp; Co. received Office of 
Thrift Supervision approval to buy Great American Bank's 130 California 
branches for $491 million. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators' approval was the last obstacle facing the deal first announced 
last July. The first phase of the sale, including branches in San Diego, Orange 
and Riverside counties, will close today, Wells Fargo said. Wells Fargo said it 
plans no layoffs among the 1,900 Great American employees it is absorbing, even 
though the San Francisco-based bank plans to close seven of the 64 Great 
American branches it is acquiring in San Diego County. The OTS also approved

Forest Products Firm to Curtail Output: Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said it would 
temporarily curtail production at many of its mills because of the slump in the 
housing market. "The record decline in the home building market and sharply 
lower prices for building products have forced the company to curtail 
production at many plants for varying periods of time during the fourth 
quarter," the forest products company said in a statement. Company spokesman 
Barry Lacter said officials had not decided which mills to close or how long 
they will be shut down.

Pickens to Look at Japanese Firms in U.S.: Bringing his fight to win a place on 
the board of Japan's Koito Manufacturing Co. to America's heartland, investor 
T. Boone Pickens Jr. announced that he is forming a group to study the 
activities of Japanese auto companies in the U.S. Pickens described the 
Mid-America Project as a coalition of labor union and business leaders from 
Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee that intends "to identify and 
evaluate" the influence of foreign investment in the region. Toyota Motor Corp. 
and Honda Motor Co. operate major facilities in the region.

IBM Joins European Research Project: Europe's semiconductor research project 
JESSI opened its doors to a U.S. firm -- IBM Europe -- for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Joint European Submicron Silicon group also agreed to formalize its ties to 
the U.S. semiconductor research program, Sematech, it said in a statement 
released in Munich, Germany. But JESSI plans to review the role of British 
International Computers Ltd. following that company's takeover by Fujitsu Ltd. 
of Japan. The move reflects a reluctance among some JESSI members to share 
technology with the Japanese. The $5-billion, eight-year JESSI project was set 
up in 1989 as part of the 19-nation Eureka high-technology research and 
development program.

9 STATE ATTRACTIONS, DELTA JOIN TO LURE VISITORS; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: THE AIRLINE WILL GIVE FREE TICKETS TO DISNEYLAND, UNIVERSAL AND OTHER 
LOCATIONS TO CERTAIN CALIFORNIA-BOUND FLIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nine of California's major tourist attractions have joined forces with the 
state Department of Commerce and Delta Air Lines in what tourism officials on 
Thursday described as an unprecedented campaign to bolster the state's meager 
share of tourists from Eastern states. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry officials also hope that the campaign -- scheduled to begin 
Jan. 1 -- will revive gate receipts that have declined in the past year because 
of a nationwide economic slowdown, fear of gangs and the threat of war in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The state has dedicated $180,000 of its $7-million annual tourism advertising 
budget to help promote the "Delta California Dream Vacation" package, in which 
the Atlanta-based carrier will offer California-bound passengers free admission 
tickets to the state's major tourist attractions under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland, Universal Studios and the San Diego Zoo are among the tourist 
attractions contributing $25,000 each to the advertising campaign, in addition 
to providing Delta with admission tickets at a "deep, deep discount," said Jack 
Stewart, the Commerce Department's chief deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
The promotional campaign could generate as much as $25 million in additional 
tourist spending if Delta reaches its goal of selling 25,000 travel packages to 
tourists in the East, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, he said, Delta's television and newspaper advertising 
campaign in major Eastern markets should leave "countless impressions" on 
consumers who traditionally have flown or driven to Florida rather than 
traveled to California for family vacations. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of exposure is important, tourism experts said, because the state 
spends woefully little on out-of-state promotion, and individual tourist 
attractions lack the capital to heavily advertise their attractions back East. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has ever done anything like this before," Stewart said. "We're going 
head-to-head with Florida" for Eastern tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
During 1991, Delta will offer the free tickets, which would carry a value of 
more than $500 to a family of four, to passengers who book certain round-trip 
flights, agree to rent a car and remain in California for at least five days, 
Stewart said. The package is available to residents of all states except 
California, Nevada and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Other tourist attractions participating are the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose, 
the San Diego Wild Animal Park, Knotts Berry Farm, Sea World of California, 
Marine World Africa USA Theme Park and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
Industry and state tourism officials have for years known that California ranks 
far behind Florida as a destination for Eastern tourists. During 1989, for 
example, tourists from states east of the Rocky Mountains accounted for just 
25% of the nearly $50 billion of tourism-related spending in California. The 
remainder was spent by Californians and residents of 10 Western states. 
</P>
<P>
Delta declined to specify how much it would spend on the campaign, but Stewart 
said Delta has agreed to spend "a figure that is between $3 million and $5 
million" on the promotion and the purchase of admission tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Delta outbid United Airlines, American Airlines and USAir for the right to the 
California vacation promotion, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Delta spokeswoman Frances Conner said the airline pursued the promotion to 
bolster its share of the lucrative East-West air traffic market. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation (for the Delta campaign) is unprecedented," San Diego Zoo 
spokesman Jeff Jouett said. "We've never been all together like this before, 
and the state deserves praise. I think it's really a sign of the times; we're 
all seeing (attendance) decreases in Southern California, so we're trying to 
combine forces and get people here." 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to a common cause, a common interest," Disneyland spokesman Bob 
Roth said. "We've done some joint efforts previously (with Knotts Berry Farm) 
but nothing on this broad a spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry experts said they would hope to recoup the cost of the ticket 
giveaways through sales of "T-shirts, food, souvenirs and the like," Stewart 
said. In addition to money spent at the attractions, hotels and restaurants 
would also get some of the tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to the parks will not be as dramatic as it first appears because 
"nobody could have the energy to do all nine parks," said Harrison Price, a 
Torrance-based tourism industry consultant. "Whoever priced it (for the parks) 
has contemplated the fact that not all the (free admissions) will be used." 
</P>
<P>
Price commended the state for getting the nine attractions to agree to a joint 
campaign. "Over the years I've seen a ton of joint-marketing efforts where a 
couple of different parks might get together," Price said. "But this is the 
biggest group I've ever seen together." 
</P>
<P>
Although the parks are working together to get Easterners into the state, "once 
the tourists are in California, it's everyone for himself again," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said it is too soon to say if the program will be repeated during 1992.

PEOPLE: A &amp; M RECORDS NAMES AL CAFARO PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Longtime record executive Al Cafaro has been named president of A&amp;M 
Records, the Los Angeles-based label of the Dutch music concern Polygram N.V. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Cafaro, who joined A&amp;M Records in 1977 as a promotion 
manager, fills a post that had been held by A&amp;M Chairman and Chief 
Executive Jerry Moss. Moss has served as president since A&amp;M President Gil 
Friesen resigned in April shortly after A&amp;M was sold to Polygram. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M in recent months has suffered a round of layoffs as well as the loss of 
a multimillion-dollar distribution pact with Windham Hill Records. But Cafaro, 
a former radio station deejay, said he expects the label to turn around as it 
gears up early next year for a host of new releases from veteran artists such 
as Sting, Amy Grant and Barry White.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WHY ARBITRAGERS KEPT TO SIDELINES DURING MCA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MCA Inc.'s $6.6-billion sellout to Matsushita ought to be a big victory for 
Wall Street's arbitragers the professional traders whose specialty is betting 
on takeover deals. But in fact, many of the arbs say they'll reap no windfall, 
because they didn't buy MCA. It just never looked like an honest enough deal to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the vast majority of professional arbitragers played that deal 
correctly -- that is, they had very small positions or none at all," argues 
Jeffrey Greenblatt, partner at the Baker, Nye Investments arb firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
For months, much of what was being said about MCA's takeover potential "were 
things that just didn't make sense," Greenblatt says. 
</P>
<P>
So the profits from the deal, instead, will flow to the cowboy speculators who 
took a chance on MCA armed with little more than hunch and hope. 
</P>
<P>
The arbs' avoidance of MCA is a good commentary on the state of the stock 
market -- and offers good reason why less-well-informed speculators will 
continue to be the main driving force in the market, with all of the attendant 
volatility that can cause for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Professional arbs are traders who make a living ferreting-out market 
information before it becomes well known. Takeovers have long been their bread 
and butter, for obvious reason. In the deal-crazy '80s, arbs played rumored 
takeover stocks with abandon and made huge profits. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1987 stock crash and the 1989 collapse of the junk bond market killed 
off untold numbers of arbs by killing the deal game. And this year, one of the 
biggest anticipated takeovers -- the buyout of United Airlines -- collapsed, 
bloodying more arbs. 
</P>
<P>
The arbs who are left are sober realists who have gone back to arbitrage's 
roots: Rather than take a flyer on something, they wait for a deal to be 
announced. Then they try to determine what the target's stock should be selling 
for, given the complexity of the deal and the time to completion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's back to arbitrage as a systematic discipline again," says Gene Cordon, 
partner at arb firm Mesirow Advanced Strategies in Highland Park, Ill. "Even 
those people who are more aggressive arb managers have become more cautious." 
</P>
<P>
What you see happening now with MCA stock is indeed traditional arbitrage. 
Thursday, 779,900 shares traded between $65.75 and $66. MCA closed at $65.875. 
Arbs know Matsushita will pay $66 a share in cash. What the pros are doing now 
is poring over research, trying to estimate the real value of the expected $5 
in stock to be paid for MCA's WWOR TV station. And they're estimating how long 
the deal will take to be consummated. 
</P>
<P>
If the final value of the deal is indeed $71 a share, a buyer at $66 will earn 
7.6% before expenses. If the deal is completed in two months, as expected, that 
looks like a substantial annualized return. But to the arbs, that return is 
just adequate considering trading expenses, the chance of hitches developing 
and the uncertainties about valuing WWOR. 
</P>
<P>
To the speculators who paid prices in the $40s or $50s for MCA in recent 
months, there's no need to analyze MCA now. They stand to make a handsome 
profit. But those gunslingers could just as easily have been wrong, and lost 
their shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Baker Nye's Greenblatt says the "nature of the personalities involved" meant 
there was too much risk in MCA. And talk valuing MCA at $90 a share just raised 
the risk, Greenblatt says, because "I don't think anybody who did analytical 
work believed those values would be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
So, many of the pros stepped away, and the amateur speculators took control. 
And that's how it's likely to stay in the bear market. That will mean more 
volatility, because speculators' trigger fingers have replaced the arbs' more 
deft touch. 
</P>
<P>
Fund Investors Abandon Uncle Sam: In times of international turmoil, investors 
are supposed to seek safety in U.S. government securities. Somebody forgot to 
tell mutual fund investors about that concept. 
</P>
<P>
October fund industry statistics, out Thursday, show a continuing outflow of 
cash from bond funds that invest in Treasury securities. Purchases of those 
funds totaled $1.01 billion for the month. Meanwhile, investors redeemed $1.46 
billion of those funds' shares, resulting in a net outflow of $447 million from 
the U.S. government funds. 
</P>
<P>
The outflow occurred even as investors generally showed bullishness about other 
bond funds and about stock funds. Overall, net purchases of bond funds totaled 
$1.4 billion in October, compared to $1.7 billion in September. Net purchases 
of stock funds totaled $1.1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion. While down for 
now, the ongoing net inflow of cash shows investors aren't spooked by economic 
and war worries. If they were, they'd be liquidating like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
So why are people cutting out of Treasury bond funds? Don Clark, officer at the 
Financial Programs fund family in Denver, argues that fund investors are simply 
showing their sophistication. Unlike in years past, "People are less inclined 
now to run for cover (during crises). They're more inclined to look for buying 
opportunities," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Money is exiting Treasury funds because the 7% to 8% yields those funds pay 
look meager compared to returns elsewhere, fund officials say. Where the money 
is going: 
</P>
<P>
* Bond and stock funds that invest in foreign securities. Global bond funds 
alone saw a net inflow of $711 million in October, and fund officials say those 
portfolios remain hot tickets this month. Many of the funds offer yields of 9% 
or better. 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. stock funds, especially those investing for long-term growth. The 
market's low in October just encouraged more bargain hunting. And that has 
continued in November, fund officials say. The Franklin Group of funds in San 
Mateo, Calif., says net stock fund purchases zoomed to $45 million in November 
from $4 million in October. Meanwhile, investors already in stock funds largely 
are staying put. At T. Rowe Price funds in Baltimore, spokesman Steve Norwitz 
says stock fund redemptions fell 50% in November from October. 
</P>
<P>
* Tax-exempt municipal bond funds. With income tax rates rising, investors are 
realizing that tax-exempt muni yields of 6.5% to 7% are worth more than even 
8.5% taxable Treasury yields. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign that fund investors now are less worried about the Iraq situation 
and the economy: Fidelity Investments' monthly survey of individual investors 
showed sentiment improved in November, after falling for five months. 
Fidelity's sentiment index rose to 67.2 this month from 64.1 in October. The 
index, which measures investors' optimism about the markets, was at 94.3 in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: From the Maybe-They-Should-Ask-Someone-Else Dept.: At the recent U.S. 
League of Savings Institutions convention, a Soviet official asked for U.S. 
advice in overhauling the U.S.S.R. Savings Bank. 
</P>
<P>
FUND INVESTORS' MARKET VIEWS 
</P>
<P>
Here are mutual fund purchase, redemption and net cash inflow/outflow totals 
for key fund categories in October. The figures show investors remained 
positive on stocks, but yanked big money from U.S. government bond and junk 
bond funds.

PEOPLE: JOHN POPE IS ELECTED UAL'S VICE CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, has elected John C. Pope vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Pope, 41, will give up his title as executive vice president, but will continue 
as the company's chief financial officer, and will continue to oversee finance, 
marketing, planning and management information systems for United, UAL said. 
</P>
<P>
Pope joined the airline in January, 1988, from rival American Airlines, where 
he was senior vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Regarded as one of the most astute financial executives in the airline 
industry, he played an important part in a failed October, 1989, 
management-employee bid for the airline. Pope received a good deal of blame for 
the failure of the bid, and many observers thought his job was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The collapsed $300-a-share offer triggered one of the largest one-day stock 
market slides in history, and signaled the unraveling of the junk bond market.

UMBERG, AN OFFICER AND ASSEMBLYMAN, DOUBLE-TIMES IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the get-go, Tom Umberg knew it was going to be a tough job to turn out an 
incumbent Republican and win election to the 72nd Assembly District from 
central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But now that he's pulled off that political coup, the Garden Grove Democrat has 
discovered that, thanks to a monumental scheduling conflict, making plans to 
get to Sacramento next week just to be sworn in has been no cinch either. 
</P>
<P>
As a rookie assemblyman, Umberg is supposed to be in the state Capitol at noon 
Monday to take his oath of office and immediately plunge with his legislative 
colleagues into a special session called by Gov. George Deukmejian to deal with 
a mounting state budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as a major in the Army Reserve, Umberg is scheduled to be in 
Charlottesville, Va., next week as part of his yearly commitment to the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg said he's managed to persuade the reserves to let him start his two-week 
tour on Tuesday so he can fly up to Sacramento for the swearing-in, cast a few 
votes and attend a reception in honor of his election before taking off for the 
East Coast. His original orders had him reporting for duty at 7:30 a.m. Monday 
-- an assignment that would have precluded him from showing up in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
But the Umberg household got another scheduling jolt Thursday, this one more 
severe: Tom's wife, Robin, got a call from her 6252nd Army Reserve unit placing 
her on alert status to await call-up for up to six months of active duty. 
</P>
<P>
"I was rather expecting this. At least it's official now," said Robin Umberg, a 
major in the reserves and an intensive care unit nurse, who is among 150 
medical personnel based in Santa Ana being called to active duty, destination 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't question being in the reserves. I'm ready for this professionally. But 
it's as a mother that I have a lot of work to do. It's a very emotional 
situation," she said. The Umbergs plan to have their children stay with 
relatives and then a nanny while Umberg is in Sacramento and his wife is on 
active military duty. 
</P>
<P>
For Umberg, his new 7:30 a.m. Tuesday military start time still means he will 
be away for much of the debate and votes having to do with Deukmejian's 
proposal to chop $1 billion out of the state budget immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg said he's hoping the Legislature will simply put off the business until 
Governor-elect Pete Wilson is sworn in next month. That way, he can serve out 
his two weeks of military duty and return to Sacramento before lawmakers really 
hunker down to business. 
</P>
<P>
If not, he said, he's prepared to jump on a plane at a moment's notice. "If it 
turns out there's going to be some important vote, and my vote is necessary and 
there are going to be things that affect my constituents, then I will come 
back," Umberg said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's come easy," Umberg said. "We had a tough primary. We had a tough 
election. This is par for the course."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TIMES O.C. PARADE TO TAKE PLACE SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 Times Orange County Holiday Parade, with celebrated teacher Jaime 
Escalante as grand marshal, will take place Saturday morning in downtown Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's parade is "Learning -- Celebrate Life's Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the parade will be Escalante, whose achievements as a teacher at 
Garfield High School in East Los Angeles were portrayed in the 1988 film "Stand 
and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Several giant cartoon character balloons will also be featured. This year's 
collection of helium-filled balloons, some as tall as 75 feet, will include 
Mighty Mouse, Popeye and Olive Oyl, Raggedy Ann and Heathcliff the Cat. 
</P>
<P>
The parade, produced each year by more than 500 volunteers, will also feature 
celebrities, floral floats, high school marching bands and equestrian units. 
</P>
<P>
The parade begins at 10:30 a.m. at Civic Center Drive and Broadway. It proceeds 
north on Broadway to 17th Street, travels east on 17th Street to Main Street, 
goes south on Main and concludes at Main and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will be televised live on KCAL Channel 9.

CREST VIEW SCHOOL MAY FACE CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The board of the Ocean View School District this week took its first step 
toward a reorganization plan that probably would close Crest View School at the 
end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees adopted criteria for identifying racially isolated schools under which 
Oak View School and Crest View's middle-school grades must be desegregated 
before the 1991-92 school year. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said the move will prompt further study into a conceptual 
desegregation plan proposed last month by district staff and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
That plan calls for Crest View's seventh- and eighth-grade students to be 
transferred to other schools. Removing those students from the 
kindergarten-through-eighth-grade campus would reduce the school's enrollment 
to about half the district average, making it a leading candidate for closure, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Designating Crest View's middle school students as racially imbalanced "clearly 
positions Crest View for closure," Assistant Supt. Paul Mercier said. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he added, "I do not believe Crest View automatically will be closed . . 
. or that this plan will be limited to just that closure." 
</P>
<P>
The adopted criteria, under which schools with more than 48% or less than 8% 
ethnic minority students are considered to be segregated, is the basis of the 
district's ongoing effort to correct its schools' racial imbalances to comply 
with state law. 
</P>
<P>
The integration-based reorganization was prompted by last year's enrollment 
figures that showed 86% of Oak View's students are ethnic minorities, including 
70% Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Based upon that enrollment report, 68% of Crest View's middle-school students 
are minority students. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed reorganization, Oak View would become a magnet center for 
the district's incoming limited-English-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
The desegregation issue in recent months has become intertwined with the 
district's continuing budget-cutting reorganization study, which last June 
culminated in a proposal to close Golden View, Haven View and Lake View 
schools. Board members voted to postpone those closures for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
The board is scheduled next spring to consider the sweeping budget and 
integration questions posed by reorganization. Three newly elected trustees 
join the board next month. JOHN PENNER

GOLF COURSE SITE'S FUTURE TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council authorized spending up to $10,000 to study what should happen 
to the Santiago Golf Course site, which was most recently slated for 160 houses 
and a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 10 years of fighting about at least three different proposals to 
develop the site, residents led by the Santiago Creek Greenway Committee 
persuaded the council in August to stop development of the site. The group 
wants the city to explore purchasing the former 37-acre golf course to create a 
city park or greenway. 
</P>
<P>
The funds approved this week are the first city monies to go toward the project 
and will be used to hire a consultant who specializes in the acquisition and 
design of urban open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant will study recreational uses for the site as well as research 
funding sources to help purchase the land, said Howard DeCruyenaere, president 
of the Santiago Creek Greenway Committee. The value of the site, which includes 
the golf course, a former housing tract and city and county land, will be 
determined within six to eight weeks by an appraiser approved by the committee 
and city staff, said Scott Morgan, senior assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hennessey, a member of the Greenway committee, said he was encouraged 
by the city's cooperation and asked for continued support. 
</P>
<P>
"We are as determined now as the day we started," Hennessey said. "We will not 
let go. We will not relent." 
</P>
<P>
The city also lifted the 90-day moratorium on development proposals for the 
site in response to a request from Santiago Associates, a partnership of the 
William Lyon and Burnett-Ehline Development companies. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Burnett told the council that any action by his firm would not affect the 
Greenway committee's efforts, but he reminded the council that "we have not 
been on hold for just . . . 90 days, we've been involved with this project for 
4 1/2 years." MARY HELEN BERG

COUNCIL PROPOSES BAN ON BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A building moratorium of anywhere from 45 days to 10 months was proposed this 
week by the new City Council, known for its anti-development sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-0 vote, the council asked the city staff to prepare recommendations for 
a moratorium, which will be discussed at the council's Dec. 10 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was first proposed by Councilman Robert D. Breton in his final meeting 
as a city planning commissioner on Nov. 19, and forwarded to the council for 
discussion after Monday's swearing-in ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Breton contends that a moratorium is necessary while city officials resolve a 
dispute with the area's master developer, the Mission Viejo Co., over a newly 
adopted general plan -- a blueprint for future development. The Mission Viejo 
Co. recently sued the city, claiming that part of the general plan contradicts 
a 1987 development agreement approved by county supervisors four months before 
Mission Viejo's incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
The city's general plan calls for preserving as open space some areas slated 
for development by the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we use what little leverage we have left with the (Mission 
Viejo) company in developing the rest of the community . . . and to resolve 
these conflicts," Breton said at Monday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to establish a negotiating team, made up of the city 
manager, city attorney and community development director, to work with Mission 
Viejo Co. officials on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
However, company spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel said the county-approved development 
agreement prevents a moratorium from being placed on remaining projects for its 
10-year duration. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be worth anything if it didn't," Wetzel said, adding that the 
proposed moratorium "wouldn't affect us or our property. But it would be 
detrimental to others in the community . . . builders of smaller projects, 
especially during a construction recession." 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel said that the city has reaped most of the benefits of the development 
agreement, which called for $45 million in public improvements such as roads, 
intersections and a community park. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Douglas C. Holland said that because the city has received portions 
of the improvements, it may be too late to change the terms of the development 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Breton on Monday also suggested that the city could declare its general plan 
ineffective, rescind the document and negotiate amendments to the plan with 
Mission Viejo Co. officials on disputed properties. WENDY PAULSON

PREGNANT WOMAN BOUND AND ROBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old woman in her ninth month of pregnancy was bound, blindfolded and 
robbed by three men, one of whom posed as a deliveryman, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred in the 4200 block of Avocado Avenue at 9:11 a.m. Thursday 
when a man dressed as a deliveryman and driving a white, red and blue mail-type 
truck knocked on the victim's door, police said. 
</P>
<P>
When the unidentified victim opened the door, the man pointed a gun at her and 
walked inside, police said. The gunman was joined by two other men who helped 
blindfold and tie the victim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers ransacked the victim's house for about 15 minutes taking an unknown 
amount of property, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the robbers left they untied the victim and told her to wait before 
calling authorities, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Several minutes later the victim called police and was taken to Placentia Linda 
Hospital, in Placentia with a bruised wrist, police said. She was treated at 
the hospital and released without injury to her unborn child.

STUDENTS GET CLOSE LOOK AT QUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the big one hits, the students at La Paz Intermediate School will know 
precisely how big it really is. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a seismograph was installed on the campus, making La Paz only 
the second junior high in California to have a fully operational seismology 
lab, teacher Daniel Doty said. The other junior high is in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
The instrument -- purchased for $17,000 with grants from GTE and a foundation 
-- includes a detector buried in front of the school and a barrel graph, which 
would record the quake, displayed in a nearby hallway. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the equipment has only recorded jumping students and passing trucks. 
But it also can detect any quake in Orange County and perhaps Southern 
California, Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
Seismology "is something the students need to know," said Doty, who will help 
teach the school's Earth science classes. Instructor Betty Foley will teach the 
students the mathematics -- graphing, ratios, charting, forecasting -- that a 
seismologist uses. 
</P>
<P>
"Earthquakes happen all of the time in this area, and for the students, this is 
real-life science," Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley said it is easier to teach students math when they can see how it's 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
"Scientists work with math -- you shouldn't separate them into two 
compartments," she said. "This way, the students will see that math is 
something they will use all of their lives. And it's easier for them to learn 
when it is a hands-on activity, rather than on a teacher-directed project." 
</P>
<P>
The program is receiving statewide support. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech, Cal State Fullerton and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 
Northern California, along with other institutions, are providing Doty and his 
students with information about recent earthquakes worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that students will remain interested in science if they have a real 
opportunity to apply what they learn to something that is meaningful to them," 
Livermore seismologist Eileen Vergino said. "And what could be more meaningful 
to a student in California than earthquakes?" 
</P>
<P>
David Clouse and three of his classmates -- Danny Besharati, Kevin Lau and 
Brian Beichner -- couldn't wait for the class to begin and have been spending 
their lunch hours in Doty's classroom, using a computer to chart 1990 
earthquakes that have occurred worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this, I didn't even know what a seismograph looked like or really what 
it was," David, 13, said. "But this has been a good learning experience. I'm 
learning earthquakes happen all around the world." 
</P>
<P>
The others agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize there were that many" quakes, said Kevin, 12. TERRY SPENCER

WING-A-THON WILL RAISE FUNDS FOR BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy with an incurable kidney disease will benefit from a 
fund-raiser scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Saturday at the Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Wing-a-Thon, a chicken wing-eating contest, is for Christopher Carter, son 
of Police Officer Jeff Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher is undergoing dialysis and taking medication at a cost to his 
family of more than $800 a month. He will eventually need a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Among those participating will be Councilmen Scott Diehl and Joe Anderson. 
Money is being pledged for each wing eaten. The chicken is being donated by the 
city's Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Carter joined the Police Department in July after 10 years in the Navy. He 
left the service because he was afraid he would be shipped overseas and away 
from his son. 
</P>
<P>
But because Christopher's illness was diagnosed before his father joined the 
force, the boy is not covered by the Police Department's medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
To pledge money call (714) 361-8201.

ARSONIST SOUGHT IN 80-ACRE CANYON FIRE 
</P>

<P>
Authorities searched for an arsonist Thursday who sparked a brush fire that 
raced through 80 acres of Carbon Canyon Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators searching the southeast portion of the park found a charred 
incendiary device, footprints and other evidence that led them to conclude the 
blaze was intentionally set. 
</P>
<P>
A plea for the public's help in locating the arsonist seemed to be working, 
with fire and police investigators receiving numerous tips, Orange County Fire 
Capt. Dan Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting lots of calls," Young said. "We've got several leads and 
they are good leads. It's good to see the community pitching in to help like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a warming Santa Ana condition that was bringing high winds into the 
area worried fire officials and prompted them to leave extra crews on the scene 
during mop-up procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still hot spots that we can't walk away from," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze charred dense grassland in the 120-acre park, narrowly missing three 
groves of 60-foot-high California redwoods that were planted in the park in 
1975 for preservation purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned within a quarter of a mile of two neighborhoods. No one was 
injured and no property was destroyed, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The 110 county firefighters at the scene, comprising 25 engine companies, two 
bulldozer crews and four hand crews, fought increasing winds and chilly 
temperatures as they worked all night to contain the blaze, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators declined to describe the device they believe was used to 
set the blaze.

PLAN TO PROTECT MIGRANTS ON I-5 PROVOKES DISPUTE

Immigrant advocates and enforcement officials seeking ways to reduce accidents 
involving pedestrians on freeways from San Clemente to the Mexican border 
clashed Thursday over a proposal to erect 10-foot-high barriers along portions 
of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. Border Patrol and California Highway Patrol officials strongly 
endorsed the barrier concept, immigrant representatives from San Diego and 
Orange County voiced fears that such a step could result in more injuries by 
trapping exhausted and frightened immigrants in the median strips of hazardous 
expressways. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to save one life," Lee Steelman, a member of the 
Human Resources Committee of the city of San Clemente, said during an 
informational meeting in Oceanside sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Peace 
(D-Chula Vista). "I just see panic." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the California Department of Transportation disclosed that it has 
decided to halve the number of traffic lanes from eight to four on the 
approximate 3-mile strip of Interstate 5 near the U.S.-Mexico border where most 
of the accidents occur. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, 1987, 101 immigrant pedestrians have been killed and an 
additional 110 injured after being struck by vehicles on area expressways.

Two suspected burglars were arrested Thursday after a resident dialed 911 from 
a second-floor bedroom to report that two men had kicked down her door and were 
downstairs. 
</P>

The intruders, who went upstairs and found the resident on the phone, fled the 
Palmer Street location in a red Volkswagen. Police stopped a car matching that 
description and arrested Anthony Lee Likai, 23, of Santa Ana and James Michael 
Linquist, 29.

BOURASSA PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MURDER CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
Richard H. Bourassa Jr. pleaded not guilty Thursday to a murder charge 
involving the shooting death of a 17-year-old classmate, the second friend who 
died in his Anaheim Hills home since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown scheduled Bourassa's trial to 
begin Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
A Juvenile Court judge has already ruled that, because of the seriousness of 
the charge and since Bourassa will be 18 in January, he should be tried as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
Holding his stepfather's .38-caliber pistol, Bourassa was in his family's den 
with friend Christian Wiedepuhl on May 24 when, he told police, the gun 
accidentally discharged. Wiedepuhl was wounded once in the forehead and died 
early the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said that the physical evidence -- gun residue and the 
direction from which the bullet struck the victim, for instance -- does not 
support Bourassa's story of what happened. They suggest that Bourassa tried to 
scare Wiedepuhl by aiming and then firing the gun at him in a reverse form of 
Russian roulette. They allege that Bourassa, who is dyslexic, removed one round 
but misjudged the direction in which the five-bullet gun chamber would rotate. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 12, 1986, in the same room and during the same hour of day, Bourassa 
and friend Jeffrey Bush, both 13, were pointing rifles at each other when the 
shotgun in Bourassa's arms went off. Bush was struck several times by buckshot. 
After he was declared brain-dead the next day, his heart was transplanted into 
the body of a Northern California woman. Police ruled the shooting accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa remained in custody at Orange County Jail, where he was being held in 
lieu of $100,000 bail.

You usually only see a flash of him once the play begins. That's him, diving

Buford McGee works so tailback Cleveland Gary can drive into the secondary or 
dance through the hole or even dribble the football to his heart's content. 
Before Gary meets the hole, McGee has already met a linebacker or two. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Rams' 210-pound fullback rammed into Matt Millen, the 49ers' 
inside linebacker, a time or 20. It was a man-on-man battle that Ram Coach John 
Robinson described afterward with a tinge of awe. "Millen only outweighs Buford 
by about 30 pounds," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, McGee, a seven-year veteran, probably 
will spend most of the day trying to slam middle linebacker Mike Johnson 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
We might not see McGee doing it, but his coach does. Last Sunday, Robinson saw 
enough -- in addition to McGee's touchdown run and scoring pass -- that he went 
out of his way to praise the Ram fullback. McGee got a game ball for his 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's hard for people to know whether a guy plays good or not," 
Robinson said. "It is for me when I walk out of the stadium until I look at the 
film. (McGee) gets caught up in that thing of playing a lot of (roles), 
different things he's got to do. . . . It's a tough job; it's one of the 
hardest jobs." 
</P>
<P>
McGee, who can go weeks without carrying the ball, actually ran it six times 
Sunday for 36 yards and a touchdown. Going into the game, he had carried it 
just 19 times all season. 
</P>
<P>
While Gary can concentrate mostly on running the ball, McGee is asked to block, 
to catch passes -- he has 32 receptions this season, three for touchdowns -- to 
run option passes, to do all the dirty work of the Rams' offensive operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm playing well," McGee said. "Blocking well, catching well and 
running well, finally." 
</P>
<P>
And it's nice, McGee said, to get some public recognition from his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, because we're overlooked, I think, as fullbacks," McGee said. "I think 
I've earned it. It feels good to see that he sees the hard work you put in." 
</P>
<P>
If the Pro Bowl had a berth for blood and sweat without cheers, fullbacks would 
have an annual trip to Hawaii. But the Pro Bowl is for the glamour guys who 
don't muss up their uniforms unless their hands are on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it because I play the position," McGee said, "but it's not fair 
for guys like (the 49ers' Tom) Rathman, who had the season he had last year; 
(Seattle's) John L. Williams, those type guys, who block as well as catch, and 
they don't get a chance to get voted in." 
</P>
<P>
The Buford McGee-type of guys. 
</P>
<P>
McGee was drafted in 1984 by the San Diego Chargers, where then-Charger 
offensive assistant Ernie Zampese plugged him into the air show. 
</P>
<P>
When Zampese came to the Rams in 1987, he suggested the Rams get McGee, which 
they did, along with a 1988 second-round pick (which turned out to be Flipper 
Anderson) and a 1989 No. 6 pick for running back Barry Redden. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect Ram quarterback Jim Everett to emulate last Sunday's outburst by 
Cleveland quarterback Bernie Kosar after the Browns' sixth consecutive loss. 
Kosar ripped his teammates for a lack of concentration, and this week said the 
Browns seemed to have benefited from the lashing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it was out of frustration; I'm sure it's one way he wants to try to 
motivate his troops," Everett said. "They've had a coaching change, and the 
leadership probably is not there, so he's probably trying to take it upon 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fortunate that we have some team leaders that are very solid individuals 
here who, through thick and thin, make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams got beat like a drum by the New York Giants Nov. 11, then beat the 
49ers last week, but those two outcomes should be no measuring stick for Monday 
night's super-team summit between the 10-1 49ers and the 10-1 Giants, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't think that's a fair barometer at all," Robinson said, before 
breaking into his own analysis of the matchup. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confused by it, probably more than anything. I don't know what's going to 
happen. I'm a little confused by the 49ers right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jerry Rice has to have a Jerry Rice-type of game for the 49ers to be 
successful. There are two great QBs and it comes down to which has the best 
game. I think the Giants have to keep the score low to be successful. That's 
what I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
And does Robinson think the Giants could learn something from the Rams' formula 
of using six defensive backs to slow the Joe Montana passing show? 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the Giants will want to force the 49ers to run the ball," he 
said.

They've come to praise Bill Denny, Mission Viejo High School's strong 
safety/linebacker/fullback. They haven't had much luck blocking him or keeping 
him from turning a football game in the Diablos' favor. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Bill Denny, as much as anyone else, was a factor in their emotion," 
Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Mission Viejo 28, Capistrano Valley 13. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a very, very good game against us," El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said. 
"He's a great kid from what I've seen of him. I respect him. I can't say enough 
about him." 
</P>
<P>
Final: Mission Viejo 21, El Toro 9. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense is based on reads," Mission Viejo secondary coach Ken Sjobom said. 
"We tell the kids, 'If they line up in a pro set, you do this. If they line up 
in an I formation, do this.' At first, they don't know what we're talking 
about. Bill did. Even when he was a sophomore, he knew." 
</P>
<P>
The record so far: Mission Viejo has 11 victories, one loss. Denny has the 
honor of being the South Coast League's co-MVP on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo plays Capistrano Valley in the semifinal round of the Southern 
Section Division II playoffs at 7:30 tonight at Mission Viejo. El Toro plays 
Paramount in the other semifinal Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Victories by Mission Viejo and El Toro would set up another rematch in the 
championship game next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of a better way to win a championship," Denny said. 
</P>
<P>
The odds would appear to be against Mission Viejo, however. The Diablos have 
never beaten Capistrano Valley twice in the same season. Nor have they advanced 
past the semifinals in Denny's three seasons on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
But Denny has found this season to be different. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo began the year among Orange County's top-10 teams. The Diablos 
figured to challenge for the league championship and a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
But something was missing. Call it confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Denny and Beau LeBreton were the only returning seniors on defense and Denny 
wasn't expecting much. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo rolled over Long Beach Jordan, 42-12, in the season-opener, but 
that could have been expected. Mission Viejo then got trounced by Rancho Buena 
Vista, one of the San Diego Section's top teams. That, too, figured. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos have won 10 consecutive games since. Some games have been closer 
than others, but a strong defense, led by Denny, has been a constant. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we'd have an explosive offense," Denny said. "Once we get a lead on a 
team, we (the defense) need to slow down the other team and get our offense 
back on the field." 
</P>
<P>
The theory never worked better than against Capistrano Valley on Oct. 26 and El 
Toro a week later. Both games were expected to be wide open and high scoring. 
Both were expected to be won by Mission Viejo's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
But the Diablo defense wrecked that thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Plain and simple, they kicked our butts," Patton said after Denny and friends 
had stuffed Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They stopped us when they had to," Johnson said after Mission Viejo 
neutralized El Toro's passing game. "This is a tough loss. Real tough." 
</P>
<P>
The silence on El Toro's sideline was deafening as the game slipped away in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Denny seemed to be everywhere, covering receivers, delivering thunderous hits 
to running backs, even rushing the passer. 
</P>
<P>
For the Capistrano Valley and El Toro games, the Mission Viejo coaching staff 
shuffled the defense into something resembling Buddy Ryan's aggressive 46 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Denny, a 6-foot-2, 202-pound senior, became a linebacker. The idea was to place 
an extraordinary amount of pressure on Tony Solliday of Capistrano Valley and 
Rob Johnson of El Toro, two of the county's best quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Denny won't say for sure, but look for him to be in a similar alignment 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem that different," Denny said of playing linebacker. "I'm just 
lining up in a different spot. I like sticking my nose in there." 
</P>
<P>
Football is an easy game for Denny, the son of Diablo defensive line coach, 
Bill Denny Sr. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have a complicated offense and defense," young Denny said. "But being 
around my dad, I've always been into football. It comes as second nature." 
</P>
<P>
Denny hopes to parlay his football skills and a 3.9 grade-point average into a 
college scholarship. Stanford has expressed considerable interest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not ready to end his high school career just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"This year has been by far the best," he said. "Everything's worked perfectly 
so far. Hopefully, it won't end tonight."

BURNS LIFTS HIS WAY TO A LINEBACKER'S PERFECT BODY; 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION III: LONG HOURS SPENT IN THE WEIGHT ROOM DURING OFF-SEASON GIVE 
ESPERANZA SENIOR ADDED STRENGTH, INCREASED SPEED AND IMPROVED SELF-CONFIDENCE.

<P>
What better place to conduct an interview with linebacker Mike Burns than the 
Esperanza High School weight room. 
</P>
<P>
It's here among the barbells and incline presses that Burns has developed into 
one of the strongest linebackers in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
He spent five hours a day in the off-season improving his upper and lower body 
strength through a series of drills provided by assistant coach Bill Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The program helped Burns lower his time in the 40-yard dash by a second and 
gave him the self-confidence on the field to battle any offensive guard. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my home away from home," said Burns, sitting next to a bench press. "I 
kind of like it here." 
</P>
<P>
Burns' lifting schedule is impressive. Three days a week, he works on his upper 
body strength with bench presses, lock outs, incline bench presses and arm 
curls. On the other days, he performs squats, lunges, power clean and dead 
lifts to improve his lower body strength. 
</P>
<P>
In the evenings, he works out at a local fitness center for a couple of hours 
with his girlfriend, Shannon Port. "I've been trying to talk her into getting 
into some body building contests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burns' motivation for building more muscle is simple: Added strength gives him 
the stamina to resist the blocks of opposing guards, and his newly acquired 
speed allows him to chase down tailbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I can win any battle of the hit with an offensive lineman," he said. 
"My speed has allowed me to get a piece of the action no matter what the play 
or where the ball is going. Mentally, I feel strong, even though I've lost 17 
pounds since the season started." 
</P>
<P>
The inability to work out regularly since the football season began 14 weeks 
ago has frustrated Burns. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm getting small," Burns said. "I eat constantly, but the season 
has taken its toll. I'm not burned out on football, but I look forward to daily 
workouts again." 
</P>
<P>
Burns has set a goal of bench pressing 425 pounds. Last year, he reached a goal 
of 380 pounds and had a personal best of 55 feet 9 1/2 inches in the shotput 
for Esperanza's track team. 
</P>
<P>
Burns finished fifth in the shot at the Southern Section Division 3-A 
championship, but was overshadowed by teammate Mark Parlin, who went on to 
finish second in the state meet as a junior and recently earned a track 
scholarship to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Track is something I look forward to, until the meets," he said. "Just once, 
I'd like to beat Mark Parlin. It's very frustrating always finishing second. 
This year, I'm shooting for 60 feet, and he'll probably go to 70 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Burns' inability to perform consistently in the shot reached a frustrating 
point last season, when he said, "I have the school record for choke." 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the reasons why I lift so hard is someday I'm going to beat 
Mark," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
It's this competitive drive that separates Burns from other linebackers in the 
county, according to Esperanza Coach Gary Meek. Meek described Burns as "a 
steady but unspectacular player" with a burning desire to excel on the football 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's biggest asset is his speed," Meek said. "You look at him on film and 
wonder, 'How can a guy that big be so fast?' Mike's speed will earn him a 
college scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Esperanza (12-0) will play host to Hart (9-3) in the semifinals of 
the Division III playoffs at 7:30 tonight at Placentia's Bradford Stadium. The 
game matches Esperanza's hard-hitting defense against Hart's no-huddle offense 
that mixes a myriad of formations. 
</P>
<P>
Burns attended Esperanza football games as a youngster growing up in Yorba 
Linda. Pendleton said the coaching staff was well aware of him as an 
eighth-grader and marveled at his speed and strength as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Burns was elevated to the varsity team as a sophomore, but had to be content 
being a member of the scout team that simulated opposing offenses for the 
Aztecs' first-string defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the running back going against guys like Matt Werner and Sean Donohue," 
he said. "That sure toughened me up." 
</P>
<P>
Burns said he and his teammates began to anticipate a banner season during 
two-a-day drills in August, when the players talked of a 14-week season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone expected to be 12-0 at this point," he said. "But after 
the first game, several of the guys said, 'OK, 13 more weeks to go.' There was 
a feeling all along that we were going to the finals." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Burns said his four-year career went swiftly, adding, "I can 
remember freshman practices like they were yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton said the maturing of Burns was one of the highlights of the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike developed the million-dollar body," Pendleton said. "He is a unique 
athlete who won the Orange County Weightlifting Championship and the frosh-soph 
Empire League 100-meter championship on the same day as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"I've challenged him and channeled his personality for four years. He was never 
very mature until this year, when he became a leader. It's been very satisfying 
watching him grow this year as a person."

CHAVEZ WHIPS YOUNG, BUT CAN'T FLOOR HIM

<P>
Ernie Chavez of Santa Ana won the vacant California welterweight title with a 
10-round decision over Charles Young of Los Angeles Thursday night at the 
Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez bloodied Young's mouth in the first round, gave him a mouse under his 
left eye in the third and sent him reeling in almost every round thereafter. 
But Young wouldn't go down. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like a Weeble, if you know what I mean," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez wobbled Young in the fourth with a right-left-right combination. Young's 
mouth was a bloody mess and he seemed to be teetering, but Chavez couldn't come 
up with a knockout punch. 
</P>
<P>
Young survived the best Chavez could dish out, going 10 rounds for the first 
time in his career. Until Thursday, the farthest he'd gone was six. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez gained his 13th victory and remained undefeated. Included among his 
victories was a four-round decision over Young two years ago at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Young fell to 8-4-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw about 15 good punches," Chavez said. "I exaggerate, but I hit him with 
some god-awful shots in the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
In the later rounds, Chavez said he didn't mind taking Young's jab full-force 
because it set up his overhand left to Young's head. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez seemed to be more effective when Young was punching rather than running 
and ducking. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy has a bigger heart than we thought, that's for sure," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
With his victory, Chavez joins a long line of champions trained by Jackie 
McCoy, including Carlos Palomino, who was among the sellout crowd of 1,267. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Palomino was one of the founders of the Westminster Boxing 
Club, where Chavez trains. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy," Chavez said. "I just hope this will lead to something bigger and 
better." 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, Ernie Magdalena of the Westminster Boxing Club scored a 
third-round knockout of Aniello Crestenzo of Alhambra. Magdalena improved to 
4-0 by wearing down a heavy-looking Crestenzo (1-1). Magdalena was introduced 
at 175 pounds; Crestenzo 176. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Mejia of Irvine scored a second-round knockout of Efren Sargent of 
Ontario.

EVANS SAYS SHE MAY LEAVE STANFORD IF NCAA CUTS PRACTICE

<P>
Janet Evans, Placentia's triple gold medalist in the 1988 Olympics, said 
Thursday that she may drop out of Stanford if the NCAA adopts legislation that 
would force her to decrease her practice time. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA convention in January will consider a proposal that would cut practice 
time for sports to 20 hours per week during a 24-week season. Another proposal 
would prohibit college coaches from coaching outside teams during the 
off-season and from working with their athletes during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a significant threat to the success of our athletes at the world level," 
USA Swimming executive director Ray Essick said. "If you talk to the people 
from tennis, gymnastics, wrestling, track and field, among others, you'll hear 
the same story that you're hearing from swimming." 
</P>
<P>
Evans and other swimmers plan to wear special caps during the three-day U.S. 
Open that begins today. Swimming USA has purchased about 500 caps with a logo 
that shows a bar passing through the circled words: "NCAA Restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
"As an athlete, we're really upset about what is being proposed," said Evans, a 
graduate of El Dorado High School who has a 3.0 grade-point average at Stanford 
despite spending some 30 hours a week training. "We came to college because we 
felt we could handle the academic load and swim. If I hadn't applied to swim in 
college, I could have taken the endorsements that were available after 1988 and 
not bother with studies. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I feel we can handle the academic loads. I think for governing 
bodies (NCAA) to be telling us when we can swim, and with whom we can swim is 
not fair. I think it will put our priority to train for the Olympics and in 
international competition in jeopardy. It won't allow us to train for the 
Olympics the way we need to train."

U.S. SAYS FORD NOT PROVIDING PENSION DATA; 
</P>
<P>
AUDIT: AGENCY SAYS IT NEEDS THE INFORMATION TO CALCULATE SURPLUS OF FUND AT 
COMPANY'S FORMER NEWPORT BEACH DIVISION.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Defense Logistics Agency said Ford Motor Co. has failed to supply necessary 
information about an overfunded pension fund at the car maker's former 
aerospace division in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
When New York-based Loral Corp. acquired Ford Aerospace earlier this year, 
Loral allowed Ford Motor to keep about $100 million of surplus funds in Ford 
Aerospace's employee pension program. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction supplemented Loral's $715-million bid for Ford Aerospace -- now 
Loral Aerospace -- and helped it beat out other suitors for the Ford Motor 
defense and communications unit. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal government is conducting a preliminary audit of the transaction 
to determine if it has a claim on a portion of the overfunded amount. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Miller, a Ford Motor Co. spokesman, said the company has fully cooperated 
with government attorneys and provided all the documents requested by the 
Pentagon agency. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Wilson, a DLA spokesman, disputed that statement. The agency, he 
said, has not received information that would enable it to calculate the 
overfunded amount of the pension fund, which sources say is around $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the agency cannot calculate the portion of the fund that 
was paid for with taxpayer money. Under government contracting law, the 
government sets aside a portion of any defense contract as payment into a 
company's pension plan. If the fund is overfunded, the agency can seek to 
recover its share. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the agency is talking with the company about setting a deadline for 
receiving the information. He declined to comment on any enforcement action the 
agency could take if Ford does not comply. 
</P>
<P>
A Loral spokesman said the company has fully complied with the agency's 
requests for data. He said Loral was unaware of any dispute between Ford and 
the DLA about the pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Loral officials said the matter would have no effect on Ford 
Aerospace pensioners because the pension fund still retains a surplus 
sufficient to meet all obligations. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, the Pentagon inspector general estimated that the government 
was entitled to $90.9 million out of $527.3 million contained in 12 overfunded 
pension programs that were terminated between 1982 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Schwartz, Loral's chairman, said in a recent interview that he doesn't 
believe the government is entitled to any of the pension surplus and that the 
government had made no formal claim for the money. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said determining the amount owed the government would be difficult to 
determine. "Without the paper work from Ford, it's impossible to tell what the 
amount is," he said.

Most people's idea of a fun watch is a Swatch, something made of only the 
finest plastic that costs about $40. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our fun watch -- if there is such a thing," explains Holli Perone, 
director of fine watches for Chanel in the United States. She is pointing to an 
18-karat, gold-plated watch with a chain and leather strap that costs $1,250. 
It's the lowest-priced piece in the entire Chanel watch collection. 
</P>
<P>
Chanel watches are such luxury items that they recently warranted their own 
champagne reception at the new Chanel store in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Perone works in New York City and was visiting Chanel boutiques around the 
country to toast Chanel's new Mademoiselle Collection, three watch styles of 
solid, 18-karat gold. 
</P>
<P>
Each style comes in some combination of black, white and gold, the "Chanel 
color code." The top-of-the-line model has a bracelet of cultured pearls. It's 
the one most likely to join quilted purses and long faux pearl necklaces as a 
Chanel classic. 
</P>
<P>
"Chanel decided to create a pearl watch because pearls were (founder Coco 
Chanel's) favorite gem. She liked to mix fake ones with real ones," Perone 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The strap consists of five strands of small pearls mounted on 18-karat gold 
chains. The watch has a square face with a matte white lacquer dial and black 
Roman numerals, surrounded by a gold bezel with a cultured pearl at the crown 
and at the clasp. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a price tag of $5,200 to $5,400 (depending on the length of the 
strap), the cultured pearl model is in demand. After five days in the stores, 
Chanel was already taking pre-sale orders of customers who want the watches and 
warning people of a limited supply before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The watches take time to make because of the complicated process developed by 
Chanel for adhering the pearls to the gold chain. Each pearl -- and there are 
more than 100 on the strap -- must be the right size and have the same 
pink-white tone and high luster. 
</P>
<P>
"The cultured pearl watch is going to be very difficult to purchase," Perone 
says. "There's not too many on the market. It's new and feminine, and we hope 
we'll have the supply to fill the need." 
</P>
<P>
The other two models in the Mademoiselle Collection have identical black 
lacquer dials with Roman numerals in gold and white mother-of-pearl in the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
One has a strap in black patent leather, crocodile skin or quilted leather and 
sells for $3,750. The other has a gold chain bracelet entwined with leather -- 
Chanel's trademark -- and sells for $6,700, $7,000 or $7,300, depending on the 
size of the strap. 
</P>
<P>
"Coco instigated the interplay of leather and gold. She thought it was the 
perfect combination for day and evening," Perone says. 
</P>
<P>
The collection was designed by Jacques Helleu, Chanel's creative director, in 
honor of Coco Chanel. The watches' design harks back to the 1930s, her heyday. 
Unlike other Chanel watches, all of the Mademoiselle styles have old-fashioned 
square faces with a flat crystal and Roman numerals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a completely different look," Perone says. 
</P>
<P>
Watches in Chanel's first Premiere Collection have emerald-cut crystals, 
reminiscent of the stopper from the Chanel No. 5 perfume bottle. They also have 
contemporary solid black dials with no numerals. 
</P>
<P>
One has an 18-karat, white gold bezel set with diamond baguettes. Chanel can 
produce only 25 of the baguette watches a year because of the labor that goes 
into cutting and matching the diamonds, so they are always in limited supply. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive model remains a diamond-encrusted gold watch that sells for 
$42,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It does sell very well, even at that price point," Perone says. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, shortly after its debut, demand for the watch was so great that 
customers had to wait a year to get one. Setting the diamonds is painstaking 
business, and Chanel can produce only one or two of the watches a month, Perone 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Watches aren't the only Chanel accessories in big demand. Its belts, handbags, 
scarves and jewelry have all become status symbols with staying power. 
</P>
<P>
The quilted leather handbag with the chain-link strap that Chanel introduced in 
the 1950s remains a classic and is enjoying renewed popularity. At $600 to 
$6,000 a bag, however, Chanel is an easy target for copycats. Imitation Chanel 
accessories can be found in most department stores and boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their fabulous design," Perone says. "They're worth copying." 
</P>
<P>
Since entering the watch market in 1987, Chanel has become the No. 1 watch 
company in Japan and one of the leading watch companies in Europe. All of the 
watches are manufactured at La Chaux de Fonds in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Mademoiselle Collection join the ranks of the much-copied Chanel 
classics? One could almost set his or her watch by it.

ONE DEATH THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVOIDED

The picture is moving in its simplicity: a snapshot of a father and son that in 
another time, in happier circumstances, might have been lost in the stacks of 
photos that chronicle one family's life. 
</P>
<P>
But to Hugh Cherry, it is a cherished reminder of the past, and of a son who 
laughed and cried and left an indelible mark of happiness and hope on all who 
knew him. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Robert Cherry, standing on the beach with his father, a broad smile 
crossing his tanned face, is dead -- and Hugh Cherry doesn't want to forget. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Cherry was 27 when he died on a flat stretch of state highway north of 
Mesa, Ariz., in July, 1989. It was 6:30 in the morning, the skies were clear, 
and he was doing what he loved -- riding his beloved Cannondale 12-speed 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to be doing everything right: riding with the flow of traffic, far to 
the right side of the road. But the driver of the Tioga motor home apparently 
didn't see him in time, and when the right-front fender clipped the Cannondale, 
Timothy Cherry was thrown violently forward. 
</P>
<P>
In the flat, emotionless language of the police report, to be precise, Timothy 
Cherry was "thrown approximately 106.2 feet to the right at a slight angle, and 
came to rest 20.4 feet from the east edge of the northbound lane." 
</P>
<P>
Cherry, a Huntington Beach native and accomplished triathlete, died of massive 
head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He was not wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
And now Hugh Cherry, in remembering his son, is determined that everyone know 
that his son might be alive today if he had. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim didn't have a helmet on when he died, and if he had he may have been left 
a vegetable -- we just don't know," said Cherry, a retired broadcaster who 
lives in Seal Beach. "What I do know is that wearing a helmet improves your 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was anticipating there not being much traffic that early in the 
morning. He exercised the same kind of carelessness that we all exercise on 
occasion. I would be the last one to blame Timothy for that accident. But I 
think if he hadn't been out on the road, it wouldn't have happened. And he 
should have been wearing a helmet." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Cherry remembers his son as a classic triathlete, lean and "all sinew and 
bone." He grew up in Huntington Beach, attended Arizona State University and 
settled in Fountain Hills, Ariz., working in landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
It was four years ago that Timothy, worried about his father's health, 
persuaded him to take up bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
"I had smoked for 46 years," Hugh Cherry said. "I'm incapacitated with 
emphysema, and my bicycle is recommended for my health. My son said, 'You don't 
need to run, ride a bicycle.' I did it and took to it immediately. Here I am, 
partially incapacitated riding a bike." 
</P>
<P>
Cherry now rides his Univega mountain bike almost every day, from Bolsa Chica 
to the Santa Ana River, along the beach in Huntington Beach and back. The week 
of Oct. 7, when he turned 68, Cherry put in 260 miles. He is concerned, he 
said, by what he sees as careless riders -- those who ride too fast and those 
who ignore the basic rules of bicycle safety. 
</P>
<P>
"The bike paths have become increasingly dangerous because of the hotdogs," 
Cherry said. "The hotdogs sail through there at 18 miles an hour in a 
10-mile-per-hour speed limit. They whip through pedestrians, people walking 
dogs. There are places along the beach where I would rather get on PCH than the 
bike path because it is so dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing that bothers me," he added, are people who ride without helmets. 
</P>
<P>
"I am tempted to take off my own helmet, but I have to say to myself, 'Hey man, 
remember Tim.' The thing that really bothers me is seeing someone with a baby 
seat on the back of a bike and the kid with no helmet. I once saw an adult who 
had a helmet on, but the child didn't. My heart just broke for that child. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize how fast accidents can happen -- in a flash of an eye. If 
that kid goes down, he is going to be damaged. The speed he gains from falling 
that three feet is enough to kill him. I was in a hospital recently, and the 
halls were full of motorcycle and bicycle accident victims . . . . They were 
all vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Cherry has continued riding. He holds closely two reminders of his son's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"(Timothy) gave me my (bicycle) odometer for Father's Day last year. He was 
killed July 19th. That was the last gift he gave me. My daughter gave me one of 
my son's helmets, and I treasure it. Tim gave me a lot of joy, but riding a 
bicycle is the greatest thing he ever gave me." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the deaths of people like Timothy Cherry can often be avoided 
if only cyclists would invest $40 in a helmet. One place where the message is 
being spread effectively is in Irvine, where the Irvine Bicycle Club has made 
helmet safety one of its pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with statistics showing an alarming number of children injured in 
bicycle-related accidents, the club has embarked on a program to get children 
wearing helmets early, and often. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt, more than just as a bicycling-riding recreational club, that we 
should get involved in helmet awareness," said Richard Martin, 51, president of 
the Irvine Bicycle Club, which boasts more than 800 members. "We have held a 
bicycle rodeo and gotten helmets to sell or give away at cost. We're looking 
for more ways to get helmets to kids and their parents." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a resident of Fountain Valley, said the club's efforts are aimed at 
both the children and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The resistance you get is not from 5- to 9-year-olds but from the 12- to 
18-year-olds. It's just that peer pressure . . . the kids who don't want to 
mess up their hair or look nerdy or whatever. A lot of progressive communities 
feel that if you can get to the kids young enough, they will start wearing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
For parents, Martin said, "it's like wearing a seat belt. All the parents we've 
ever talked to say they would love for their kids to wear helmets. But I'm not 
sure how many of them really stop to think about it. It's just a matter of 
getting to them. I'm not sure they realize how important this is." 
</P>
<P>
Consider, Martin said, some of the statistics, compiled from various consumer 
agencies: 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400,000 children under the age of 14 are treated across the nation each 
year for bicycle-related injuries in hospital emergency rooms. There are half a 
million more bicycle-related injuries that are medically attended to in other 
than emergency-room settings. 
</P>
<P>
A third of all child bicyclists treated in hospital emergency rooms suffer head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 bicyclists under age 14 die each year. About 80% of them suffer head 
trauma. This number, Martin notes, exceeds the combined death ate from 
accidental poisonings, falls and firearm injuries to children.

Over 50% of all fatal injuries occur when a child rides out into the street 
from a sidewalk or driveway and collides with a motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Martin cited estimates from consumer groups predicting that bicycle helmets 
could reduce the risk of serious head injury by 85%, yet less than 2% of the 
children who ride bicycles wear helmets. 
</P>
<P>
One of the great myths, Martin said, is the idea among cyclists that as long as 
they don't ride fast they don't need a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
"They think they won't hit the pavement hard, but anyone who rides a bike can 
tell you that isn't true," he said. "There really is no excuse for not wearing 
a helmet. We can save lives with just a little investment. If what our club is 
doing helps, even a little bit, then we've done some good."

FITNESS: A 10-YEAR EXPERIMENT IN CHANGING RESIDENTS' LIFESTYLES IS SPREADING 
THE WORD THAT A SMOKE-FREE, LOW-FAT, ACTIVE LIFE CAN BE PAINLESS.

Regular customers at the Cup 'N Saucer can order fried clams, but they may get 
a turkey sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
Wander in off the street, order a burger and fries, and owner Nick Georgitis 
may suggest a boiled potato with lemon instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them right off -- I like to see these people have something good," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Georgitis is one of the more enthusiastic followers of the Pawtucket Heart 
Health Program, a 10-year project to teach this working-class city of 72,000 
residents better health habits. 
</P>
<P>
The program is built on the belief that people with poor health habits learned 
them in society, and can unlearn them, said Thomas Lasater, director of the 
project and an associate professor of health at Brown University. 
</P>
<P>
The project started in 1981 with a $20-million grant from the National 
Institute of Health. Today, restaurants, grocery stores, schools, churches, 
civic centers, businesses and 4,000 volunteers help spread the word that a 
smoke-free, low-fat, active life can be painless. 
</P>
<P>
One sausage maker worked with the program to develop a Portuguese sausage with 
lower fat, Lasater said. 
</P>
<P>
Former couch potatoes who joined a free fitness class designed especially for 
non-exercisers continued when it was over, renting their own space, said Joan 
Lovell, the program's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Carleton, principal investigator of the program and physician-in-chief 
at Memorial Hospital, believes the program can work nationally -- good news for 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who recently announced 
goals for improving Americans' health over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Healthy People 2000" identifies nearly 300 specific health objectives, 
including several covered in the Pawtucket plan. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics are not yet available for the Pawtucket program, Carleton said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that we have had huge numbers of people participate, that we 
influenced their behavior," he said. "What we don't know is, will it reduce the 
number of heart attacks?" 
</P>
<P>
A similar undertaking in Stanford used preliminary data to estimate that the 
risk of heart disease was reduced by 20 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The program works when health professionals, the food industry, government 
agencies and educational resources act together, he said. Gregg's restaurant, 
for example, marks menu items that meet the program's standards with a red 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
Pawtucket's guidelines are more restrictive than those of the American Medical 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"All along we kept getting calls from our customers that they wanted us to 
expand on it and couldn't we have more items," said Bob Bacon, vice president 
of Gregg's Restaurant Inc. "We decided that we would design a complete menu 
from appetizers to desserts." 
</P>
<P>
The menu was introduced last month at all three Gregg's restaurants in Rhode 
Island and the response has been excellent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pawtucket Heart Health Program sampled the new creations, and helped the 
restaurant determine the sodium, fat and calorie content, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we've been learning is how it can be mutually beneficial for 
everyone," said Lasater. "It's a win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
New York recently set up a program in eight communities based on the Pawtucket 
model. People from more than two dozen countries have visited Pawtucket to 
study the program, Carleton said.

MALE CONTRACEPTION A NEGLECTED SCIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: DESPITE PROMISING STUDIES, AN EFFECTIVE VERSION OF THE PILL FOR MEN IS 
STILL A GLEAM IN A RESEARCHER'S EYE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Once a week Bill, a social researcher for the state of Washington, drops into 
his doctor's office in the Seattle area. He receives a 200-milligram shot of 
testosterone enanthate (TE), a synthetic version of the male sex hormone now 
being tested as a contraceptive. The procedure is, quite literally, a pain in 
the behind, but Bill doesn't mind. A little soreness is a small price to pay, 
compared with the frustration he's endured using conventional methods. 
</P>
<P>
Bill's wife used to take the Pill but gave it up because of concerns about the 
side effects, and because of the cost. She tried using the contraceptive 
sponge, which failed and led to a pregnancy. Then Bill started using condoms. 
</P>
<P>
Both in their 20s, Bill and Mary have two children. Although they decided they 
didn't want any more, a vasectomy was out of the question. Faced with dwindling 
options, Bill became a pioneer on the frontier of reproductive biology. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Mary are volunteers in a program conducted by the researchers at the 
University of Washington as part of a World Health Organization study involving 
more than 300 couples worldwide. For the past year he and 10 other men have 
relied on weekly injections of TE, which lowers sperm production, as their sole 
means of contraception. None of their spouses has become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
The program is a promising development in a quest many scientists regard as, at 
best, quixotic: the search for a male version of the Pill. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential male contraceptive drugs are being studied at several research 
centers around the world. Because the dosages are potent enough to damage the 
liver if taken orally, the so-called "male pill" is being developed as a series 
of shots or implants designed to be long-lasting. Few of the projects have 
reached the clinical-trial stage, and all of the drugs are years away from 
practical development. 
</P>
<P>
The need for more acceptable and reliable forms of birth control is critical, 
according to a report released last winter by a prestigious panel of scientists 
and policy makers assembled by the National Research Council and the National 
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. Half of the estimated 1.5 million 
abortions performed in the United States each year are the result of 
contraceptive failure. 
</P>
<P>
Oral contraceptives remain the most popular form of reversible birth control 
among fertile, sexually active women, but up to two-thirds of those at risk for 
unwanted pregnancy can't or won't take the Pill. For their part, men have 
traditionally had three less-than-ideal options: vasectomy, condoms or 
"whatever she's using." 
</P>
<P>
Despite advances in microsurgery and better vasectomy techniques, the chances 
of restoring fertility remain slim in a male who has had a vasectomy. Condoms, 
quite apart from their lack of aesthetic appeal, have an actual failure rate of 
12 percent or more in the first year of use. The failure rate of diaphragms, 
sponges and spermicides is even greater. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a viable male contraceptive won't be available for at least a 
decade. Questions remain about the effectiveness of drugs that appear to lower 
sperm production, as well as their long-term health risks. Yet many researchers 
insist the most formidable roadblocks aren't medical but social, economic and 
political. 
</P>
<P>
No fundamentally new form of contraception has reached the American consumer in 
almost 30 years. In the past decade the number of private U.S. companies 
researching new types of contraception has dropped from 17 to one, and the 
United States now trails in the field behind European countries, where women 
have several options -- including progestin implants or injections, an 
abortifacient and a new generation of IUD's. But even in Europe, male 
contraception is a neglected science. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have known for decades that it's possible to manipulate male 
fertility with drugs in much the same way the Pill prevents women from 
ovulating. Translating that knowledge into trouble-free contraception is 
another matter. It's easier to target one egg a month than to suspend the daily 
production of millions of spermatozoa -- unless, of course, the goal is to shut 
the factory altogether.

MORE THAN A PRETTY FACE;

<P>
ARNIE ROBERTS REDISCOVERED A LOVE OF CLOWNING, SO IN HIS 50S HE RAN AWAY TO 
JOIN THE CIRCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Arnie Roberts recalls watching in amazement as his father began to apply the 
makeup: the dabs of colors around the eyes, then the mouth; the slow and subtle 
changes that turned a father into a clown. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1943, and his father was preparing to march through the streets of 
Benton Harbor, Mich., in a city-sponsored parade to cheer up a war-weary town. 
Most of the people lining the streets never knew that the clown prancing up and 
down the avenue was one of their neighbors. The greasepaint and makeup ensured 
a certain anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
It is an image that has stuck with Roberts, and today -- at age 58 -- he too, 
stands before a mirror. Contorting, powdering, and painting a bright-red 
smiling mouth with huge buck teeth, the tall, lanky, gray-haired grandfather 
from Anaheim slowly becomes Rufus the Clown. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation takes about an hour. But it is a metamorphosis that has been 
perfected over a decade of classes and clubs, charity events, parties and more 
than a year as a traveling clown for Circus Vargas. These days, Rufus is at 
home in Anaheim entertaining at private parties and schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The mere fact of the entertaining part of (clowning) keeps you young," Roberts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For years, clowning was little more than a memory of his father as Roberts grew 
up and worked his way through a variety of careers. After a four-year hitch in 
the Navy, Arnie married, and he and his wife Pauline moved to Southern 
California. He got a job at Western Electric, took classes in law enforcement 
and then went into police work, including six years at the Anaheim Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1981, when he was well into a 20-year stint as a production 
control specialist with Hughes Aircraft in Fullerton, that Roberts rediscovered 
his love of clowning. It was something that was in his blood, and buried in the 
distant memories of his father. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie and Pauline had gone to a Halloween costume party that year, and he 
dressed as a clown. He enjoyed the anonymity of the white face, the silliness 
of the colorful makeup. He enjoyed making people laugh. Suddenly the memories 
of playing with his father's costumes and floppy shoes came flooding back. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Roberts enrolled in a class for clowns at a local community 
college -- more out of curiosity than anything else. He learned all the basic 
makeup, the costuming, puppeteering and basic magic. He was told that the class 
would teach him everything he needed to know about putting on a child's 
birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
Parties led to community performances at charity events and club functions. He 
joined a club for clowns called the California Clowns, based in Westminster, 
and joined other members touring local hospitals. Through the club, Arnie 
became a member of the World Clown Assn. At some of its conventions, Roberts 
noted, he won awards for his makeup techniques and learned new skills. At one 
convention, he learned to sketch a cartoon character that Arnie uses in his act 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, at age 55, and after 20 years of employment at Hughes Aircraft, 
Roberts qualified for and received early retirement. Then Roberts bought a 
motor home, and Arnie and Pauline decided to travel. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could come up with a job where we could travel and get paid for it at 
the same time, it would be ideal," Roberts said. "So I started coming up with 
the idea of being a rodeo clown. I tried to contact rodeo promoters, tried for 
over a year, but couldn't get the promoters to talk. The promoters claimed I 
didn't have enough livestock experience." 
</P>
<P>
So Arnie started thinking about the circus. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly ruled out Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus because 
of its requirement that all its clowns go to a clown college in Sarasota, Fla. 
And just going to the clown college there didn't guarantee a job. 
</P>
<P>
The next best bet was to set his sights on either Circus Vargas or one of the 
other traveling tent shows. A brief interview, without an audition with the 
owner of Circus Vargas, brought a swift job offer as an advance clown. And that 
meant a new career for the newly retired man. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Pauline and Arnie set out in their motor home. They rented their Anaheim 
home to two of their six children, and ran away to join the circus. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie's job was to travel ahead and drum up enthusiasm for the circus before it 
got to town. Pauline would cook the meals, fix Arnie's clown suits and offer 
advice for the act. Arnie would visit grade schools and shopping centers, 
promoting the circus by performing magic, juggling and sight gags. He made 
Rufus into a stumbling, loud character, with shocks of bright yellow hair 
billowing from under a tiny red hat. There were few hints that somewhere 
underneath was a kindly, tall grandfather of 14. 
</P>
<P>
The routine was pretty much the same all over the country. After the juggling 
act, which usually involved three shiny hatchets, he would draw pictures for 
the children -- character sketches of a clown -- and hand them out with an 
anti-drug message saying, "Rufus always says no to drugs." At the end of every 
show he would hand out discount tickets and tell them to let the people at the 
circus know that Rufus sent them. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a grind: two to three appearances a day, five to seven days a week. 
As the circus was coming to town, he and Pauline were disconnecting the motor 
home from its latest mooring, driving to the next location and starting the 
whole thing over again. 
</P>
<P>
Late last summer, the circus decided that it wanted a bilingual advance clown. 
The Robertses were notified while touring in the Chicago area and severed their 
ties with Circus Vargas. But there was no severing their ties to Rufus. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Arnie performs for his grandchildren, entertains at children's birthday 
parties for $100 a show, and recently appeared at a local school on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
And, just like his father, Roberts likes to provides cheer for some of his 
neighbors. Sitting at the table in his motor home, he carefully applies a new 
round of makeup. With every dab of color and application of glitter, Arnie 
becomes Rufus, until finally the transformation is complete. Outside the motor 
home, a group of neighborhood children are gathered on his lawn, waiting for 
you-know-who. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie and Pauline are unsure just where their retirement motor home may take 
them next. But one thing is certain. Arnie will always be a clown -- no one can 
take that away. 
</P>

RATIONING OF FOOD SENDS CHILL THROUGH LENINGRAD; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: MANY ARE HAUNTED BY THE CITY'S WARTIME DEPRIVATION. WESTERN AID 
IS ANTICIPATED.

LENINGRAD, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shopping for groceries lately, elderly residents here say, recalls the hungry 
days of World War II when hundreds of thousands of Leningraders starved to 
death as the Nazis blockaded the city. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since rationing of food was suspended in 1947, Leningraders 
will have to produce coupons to buy food at state-subsidized prices starting 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the situation is worse now than after the war," said Dalya V. 
Kudryavtsyeva, 65, a retired teacher. "I've lived through rationing twice in my 
life -- during World War II and immediately afterward -- and we did not go 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"But this time, I have no faith that rationing will work." 
</P>
<P>
Across the Soviet Union, consumers have stopped believing that the 
state-controlled economy can feed them and now fear they will go hungry because 
fledgling private industry is not developed enough to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech televised this week, First Deputy Prime Minister Lev A. Voronin 
blamed the country's food shortages on hoarding and a breakdown in the 
distribution system. Food-processing factories and local politicians in 
countless areas of the country are simply refusing to meet agreements to supply 
food to other areas, but the amount of food produced has not decreased, Voronin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For people like Kudryavtsyeva, that means leaving the local grocery store 
empty-handed because the only food for sale may be something as unpalatable as 
canned seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
In Kudryavtsyeva's store, the monthly supplies of butter and cheese are sold 
out in one day. Sausage, which is delivered to the store on most days, is 
always gone within 15 minutes, sales clerk Galina I. Shtatnova, 45, said while 
standing idly behind a wall of canned seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
Customers, who seem to have a sixth sense about when the store has received a 
shipment, line up outside at 6 a.m., waiting for three hours until the doors 
open at 9, for staples such as cheese and sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked here for 29 years, and I can easily say our supply has never been 
as bad as it is now," Shtatnova said. "Ration coupons aren't worth anything if 
they cannot be backed with goods." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Leningrad city councilwoman in charge of the rationing program says 
food supplies are declining so rapidly that Leningraders may not even be able 
to buy the modest amount allotted each person. 
</P>
<P>
The coupons will provide three pounds of beef, two pounds of sausage, 10 eggs, 
a pound of flour, two pounds of cereal, half a pound of oil and a pound of 
butter per person each month. Sugar and alcohol are already rationed. 
</P>
<P>
"We guarantee that much will be available the first month," said Marina Y. 
Salye, chairwoman of the Leningrad council's Food Commission. "But I'm afraid 
there may not be a reason to print the ration cards for the second month, 
because we may not have the food to back them up." 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, buying food without coupons will cost two or three times the 
price with coupons, according to Leningrad Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak. 
</P>
<P>
Salye said the food shortages are aggravated by a strong "Mafia" that controls 
the distribution of food and is backed by conservative politicians who do not 
want to give up power. They are allegedly trying to sabotage the food supply to 
discredit Mayor Sobchak and the City Council, which is dominated by 
progressives and radicals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the interest of the conservatives that the situation be bad, 
especially in Moscow and Leningrad, to show that the democrats are not capable 
of running the cities," charged Salye, a leader in Leningrad's radical 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Food supplies in those two cities, the country's most populous and both of 
which have progressive-dominated city councils and non-Communist mayors, have 
suffered because other parts of the Soviet Union have reneged on contracts. 
Instead of abiding by agreements to ship food at the state price, they seek 
buyers willing to pay more or to trade scarce goods in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Deputy Mayor Sergei B. Stankevich complained this week that he 
believes that an attempt is under way to destroy the Moscow city government, 
because nine regions of Russia that have supplied milk to the capital decided 
simultaneously to stop deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's City Council is also considering emergency measures. One would be the 
distribution of "Moscow money" to residents to enable them to buy goods at low 
prices, Stankevich said. The same goods would also be available at much higher 
prices without the special currency. 
</P>
<P>
Reneging on supply agreements is becoming so widespread -- as Soviet republics, 
cities and regions all try to exercise their autonomy -- that politicians in 
Leningrad and Moscow have decided that the only way to feed their people is to 
seek aid abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to solve Leningrad's problem by appealing to the West, not to 
other areas of the Soviet Union," Mayor Sobchak said. "Because of the battle 
for sovereignty going on here, everyone has become too egotistical to meet 
their agreements with other parts of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Sobchak said he expects that provisions from United States, Germany, Sweden and 
other Western countries will prevent famine in his city. Germany has already 
sent a container ship loaded with food to Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the first planeload of food from German charities arrived in 
Moscow, destined for children's hospitals and orphanages in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has made big pitches for foreign food aid 
on recent trips abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Germany has responded overwhelmingly, planning to donate some of the massive 
reserves stockpiled during the Cold War in case of a repeat of the 1948-1949 
Soviet blockade of West Berlin. Individual Germans are also generously giving 
money in a charity drive to avert hunger in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
During a nationwide telethon Wednesday, which reportedly raised $2 million in 
40 minutes, German viewers saw footage of long lines and empty stores in 
Leningrad, the city Nazi soldiers unsuccessfully tried to starve into 
surrendering in a wartime siege that lasted almost 900 days. 
</P>
<P>
Although Leningraders may have to tighten their belts this winter, they will 
not starve, Salye maintained, because many people have been hoarding food for 
months and supplies are available at much higher, non-subsidized prices at 
peasant markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Every other person has stored up enough food at home to survive the winter -- 
I'm sure of this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations with dozens of Leningraders backed up Salye's assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I have stored away lots of provisions -- macaroni, potatoes, jams, 
pickled cabbage, peas, meat -- everything," said Tatyana A. Kluyeva, 42, a 
secretary. "My 78-year-old mother predicted this would happen, so I started 
stocking up last spring. I'm not worried about going hungry this winter." 
</P>
<P>
But those Leningraders who have no food reserves and cannot afford the prices 
at the peasant markets are panicking. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid that the amount of food rationed will not be enough to live on," 
Marina S. Ivanova, 21, a finance and economics student, said while standing in 
a 90-minute line for cheese. 
</P>
<P>
"People with low incomes, like students and pensioners, will not be able to 
afford the higher prices" they will have to pay for food without coupons, added 
Ivanova, who lives on a meager monthly stipend of 60 rubles, or about $100 at 
the artificially inflated official exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
But some Leningraders do not worry about feeding their families, and 
22-year-old Vasily, who drives a grocery truck, is one of them. "We don't have 
any problem getting food," Vasily said proudly as he walked down the street 
with his wife, who was pushing a baby carriage. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say more than half the food I carry is gone before it reaches the 
grocery counter," added Vasily, who asked that his last name not be printed. 
"Sometimes all of it disappears, depending on what it is."

MOVE TO L.A. HOSPITAL MAY FOIL PLAN TO OUST LINDSAY; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL: THE ACTION COULD BLOCK EFFORT BY HIS COLLEAGUES TO REMOVE HIM FOR 
BEING ABSENT, OUT OF CITY.

<P>
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, incapacitated by a stroke three months ago, is to 
be moved from his hospital bed in Inglewood to a hospital within Los Angeles 
city limits, an action that will foil plans by his colleagues to remove him 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, whose 90th birthday was Thursday, has been in Daniel Freeman Hospital 
in Inglewood since a stroke Sept. 2 left him partially paralyzed and unable to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
His extended stay outside the city, half a mile beyond Los Angeles city limits, 
has put the council seat he has held for 27 years in jeopardy. A technicality 
in the City Charter allows for the removal of a council member who is absent 
from the city for 60 days or longer. 
</P>
<P>
But Lindsay will be transferred, possibly as early as today to Queen of 
Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Hollywood, according to his 
stepson, Herbert Howard, and his council deputy, Bob Gay. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-mile trip apparently will protect Lindsay's seat on the council, even 
though it is not clear, according to visitors, that he is mentally or 
physically up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
The move also will mean that Lindsay will continue to receive his council 
salary of nearly $90,000 instead of the pension of about $45,000 he would 
receive if he left office now. If Lindsay can hold onto his seat until next 
July, his pension will be boosted to about $60,000 under the city's formula for 
calculating retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Lindsay's fellow council members began invoking the 
provision of the City Charter that allows them to unseat a colleague after a 
60-day unexcused absence. The council stopped excusing Lindsay's absences on 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
By returning to the city before Jan. 1, Lindsay will stop the 60-day clock from 
running. 
</P>
<P>
When Lindsay first fell ill, some council members said they would never attempt 
such a maneuver and one called it a petty technicality. Under increasing 
pressure from community leaders in Lindsay's largely black 9th District, 
however, the council reversed its position. The community leaders had 
complained that they were without a voice on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the 60-day rule, the Charter provides few options for removal. A council 
member can be removed for conviction of a felony, if judged insane, or if 
recalled by the voters. There is no movement afoot in Lindsay's district for a 
recall -- an expensive and time-consuming effort -- and, although disabled, he 
is not suffering from any mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Council members say Lindsay's situation has prompted them to seek changes in 
the City Charter to make it possible to vacate the seats of elected officials 
who are incapacitated. Such changes would have to be approved by the voters, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, who has been overseeing Lindsay's medical care, said Thursday that the 
move to Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian was approved by Lindsay's 
physician and was not prompted by the council's apparent intent to remove him 
from office. Howard added that the move was planned from the day Lindsay 
entered the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"My only concern is my father's health," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said that Lindsay's regular doctor is at Queen of Angels-Hollywood 
Presbyterian and is affiliated with a convalescent facility for stroke 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman, Howard said, has "pretty good vital signs. He is still 
paralyzed. He still cannot talk. I don't know if he is recognizing people or 
not. I have never felt that he did. But doctors say that he can be 
transported." 
</P>
<P>
Council President John Ferraro, who visited Lindsay several weeks ago, said he 
was unsure if the elder councilman understood what was happening and could not 
tell whether Lindsay recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, who visited Lindsay on Wednesday, said the councilman 
seemed to respond to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was happy I was there," said Holden, who stayed with Lindsay about 
half an hour. "I was able to communicate with him. He squeezed my hand when I 
asked him to and he blinked his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was time to leave, he squeezed my hand so tight as if he didn't want 
me to go." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Holden threatened to seek a court order, if necessary, so he 
could visit Lindsay. Holden said council members should be allowed to make a 
first-hand assessment of Lindsay's condition before taking any action to remove 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Ferraro and Lindsay's aide Gay, Howard has allowed almost 
no visitors since Lindsay entered the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
However, Howard relented on Tuesday and said council members could visit. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his gregariousness, Lindsay was the city's first black councilman 
when he was appointed to the City Council in 1963. He handily has won 
reelection ever since, including his most recent bid in 1989, a year after 
suffering a mild stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's 9th District encompasses the extremes of the city, from the gleaming 
skyscrapers of downtown to the crime-ridden slums of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said Thursday he was unsure when Lindsay would be moved, but Tim Ogata, 
vice president of Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian, said the hospital is 
expecting Lindsay to arrive by ambulance today.

<P>
LEAKS AND MATSUSHITA'S EARLY LOW-BALL BID SPELLED TROUBLE. HOLLYWOOD'S LEW 
WASSERMAN TURNED IRRITABLE. THE JAPANESE WORRIED ABOUT SABOTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Lew R. Wasserman, the selling of MCA Inc. began with a phone call at home 
on the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The caller was Michael S. Ovitz, a 43-year-old talent agent with whom Wasserman 
had sometimes fought -- but whom many in Hollywood found to be from Wasserman's 
own mold, aggressive, hard and wildly ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz suggested that he might have a buyer for MCA, the $4-billion-a-year 
entertainment conglomerate at which Wasserman, 77, had spent 54 years. 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., a corporate behemoth based in Osaka, Japan, 
was interested. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman said he wasn't especially eager to peddle MCA, though close 
associates confirm what had become well known in the business world -- that the 
aging mogul for at least five years had been angling for some sort of corporate 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The two agreed to talk. And so, with understatement and polite fictions, began 
a colossal poker game that ended three months later in a $6.59-billion deal, 
the largest purchase ever of an American company by a Japanese firm. It 
promises to change the face of the entertainment industry as new investment 
fuels a likely wave of acquisitions by MCA, but it also puts ultimate control 
of that growing pyramid of assets in faraway Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
MCA produces music, movies and TV shows. Matsushita, approaching $50 billion in 
sales, makes, among other things, the equipment on which people consume much of 
what MCA manufactures. That two such companies should merge, just as Sony 
acquired Columbia Pictures last year, may only be natural. But the process of 
joining them had to bridge the wildly disparate cultures of Wall Street, 
Hollywood and industrial Japan -- and it will almost certainly be studied for 
years to come as a textbook illustration of the deal maker's art. 
</P>
<P>
If Wasserman wasn't aware that Ovitz had leveled his sights on MCA, it could 
only be because he had long tuned out of the breakfast and lunchtime table talk 
by which Hollywood keeps in touch with itself. 
</P>
<P>
For six months or more, the gossip circuit had been dimly aware that Ovitz, 
chairman of the powerful Creative Artists Agency, had developed an interest in 
the Universal City company that went far beyond a desire to sell clients or 
command a premium price for his next film package. 
</P>
<P>
According to the rumors, Ovitz had grown restless with his role as a talent 
agent -- an exhausting profession in which even the most powerful practitioner 
ultimately must answer to every client on his Rolodex -- and had begun to see 
himself as something more. Some intimates believed that Ovitz, a Japanophile 
who had helped to match Sony with Columbia the year before, meant to recast 
himself as nothing less than a broker of whole companies -- a kind of 
investment banker to the stars. Others felt he was gunning for Wasserman's job 
and, with it, the mantle of industry leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Matsushita was searching for an entertainment acquisition and had 
contacted Ovitz in early fall of 1989, just as he had finished working on the 
$3.5-billion Columbia acquisition. The deal had made him a celebrity in Japan 
and triggered a landslide of similar inquiries. When Ovitz's staff reviewed 
Matsushita's financial structure, they quickly realized that they were dealing 
with a company capable of even the biggest Hollywood purchase. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Ovitz met one of Matsushita's top managers, Executive Vice 
President Masahiko Hirata, in Honolulu. For two days, the agent explained the 
inner workings of Hollywood, while Hirata talked of his company's goals. 
Similar meetings followed in Los Angeles and Osaka during the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, Ovitz's team presented Matsushita's options. Orion Pictures, 
Paramount Communications and MCA were identified as prospects, but Ovitz 
recommended an approach to MCA. A key factor appears to have been MCA's theme 
parks, in which Matsushita was deeply interested. Ovitz was also comfortable 
with MCA, where he worked as a Universal Studios tour guide while in college. 
And MCA's management appeared nearly as conservative as Matsushita's. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, CAA began to prepare a detailed report on MCA. In late August, a 
confidential feeler was extended to Felix Rohatyn, a prominent investment 
banker with Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and a member of MCA's board. 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly, MCA executives have always said they would listen to legitimate 
buyout offers but were not actively seeking to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, MCA had been going through an intricate dance since the 
mid-1980s as it searched for a partner without wishing to seem desperate. The 
company was sound, but its ambitions had begun to exceed its access to funds, 
particularly after a huge investment in Canada's Cineplex Odeon Corp. turned 
sour. MCA needed money to challenge Walt Disney Co.'s theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman's age had also become a concern. Sidney J. Sheinberg, the company's 
54-year-old president, was the heir apparent and held control of day-to-day 
affairs. But Wasserman worried that any successor, lacking his own political 
clout, might not hold the company intact. 
</P>
<P>
MCA had fielded approaches from Disney, Sony, RCA and 20th Century Fox. Earlier 
this year, it also discussed a merger with Paramount Communications Co. but 
broke off the talks when the companies couldn't decide who would run things. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman is by nature aloof, even with executives as trusted as Sheinberg. 
Those who dealt with him through the weeks of bargaining found him, by turns, 
excited, irate, anxious and inscrutable. Sheinberg, for his part, pushed 
vigorously for the Matsushita deal and immediately took charge for MCA after 
the first approach. 
</P>
<P>
Volatile by nature, the Texas-born executive brought his confrontational 
tendencies under control. He worked smoothly with Ovitz despite past clashes 
between the two. Wasserman, too, had fought with the agent more than a year 
ago, when Ovitz reportedly tried to impose an eleventh-hour renegotiation of 
director Robert Zemeckis' contract for a pair of "Back to the Future" sequels. 
Supposedly, Wasserman prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman claims to have been skeptical of the Matsushita deal until the last 
minute. "Having spent the better part of my life in negotiations, I'm never 
convinced anything is going to happen till it happens," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he began to feel a nostalgia that seemed to point toward a sale. In his 
words: "You get a couple of lumps in your throat. It revives a lot of memories 
of the past. . . . It's an emotional thing. It makes you think back over the 
past 54 years quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
By someone's design, the secret negotiations became public on Tuesday, Sept. 
25. Word of the talks surfaced in a Wall Street Journal story based on unnamed 
sources. MCA stock immediately shot up $19.50 a share to $54. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz was in Osaka meeting with Hirata and Matsushita President Akio Tanii when 
the story broke. The Japanese, who are wary of doing business publicly, 
considered breaking off the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Each side still blames the other for the leak. In any case, Ovitz, who returned 
to the United States that day, worked closely with Sheinberg to contain the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
MCA officers were particularly concerned because they hadn't yet "positioned" 
themselves in Washington and they feared an angry backlash from lawmakers who 
might try to block the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, there would be bitter voices raised against the deal, which to some 
represented a sellout of American culture. But Wasserman's decades of support 
for politicians may have taken the edge off any resistance. When Rep. Edward J. 
Markey (D-Mass.) criticized the deal as a gift to the Japanese, one MCA insider 
complained: "He gets half of his money out here!" 
</P>
<P>
The press continued to be a factor. Despite a determination to keep the talks 
private, individuals with various interests in the deal opened pipelines to 
news outlets, in an attempt to control the "spin" of reports. Investors were 
pulled off base by stories of a much richer deal than was struck. Only at the 
eleventh hour did a new round of leaks point to the actual prices being 
discussed, leading to a sharp drop in MCA stock. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman and his team originally believed that they would meet the Japanese in 
New York as early as Oct. 3 or 4. 
</P>
<P>
The plan appears to have died suddenly on the night of Oct. 1. That night, a 
small cadre of MCA executives met in the company's Black Tower headquarters and 
agreed on Draconian steps to control the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
They canceled earlier travel plans and agreed to make arrangements without 
travel agents and, if necessary, behind closed doors to shut out even 
high-level MCA associates. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, according to one person, Sheinberg went so far as to call 
both David Geffen, who held 10 million MCA shares and headed its Geffen Records 
unit, and Allen, who was advising Ovitz, to explain that both would be "cut out 
of the loop" for a time to get the Japanese back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen says he was in "constant" contact with Sheinberg and Wasserman and was 
never excluded from their deliberations. He became a peculiar adjunct to the 
deal. He played no official role yet was never far from the action. He owned 
almost twice as many MCA shares as Wasserman, having sold his record label to 
the company in April. The sale occurred when MCA stock was trading at $54.50, 
but by mid-September it had declined to $34.50. Geffen didn't belong to the MCA 
board, and most of his stock was held in special, convertible-preferred shares 
that gave him no direct voice in MCA management. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen was vacationing off the Greek coast when Sheinberg told him of the 
offer. Geffen favored a deal from the outset. He decided to sell to MCA because 
he believed that Wasserman would sell out within 36 months, leading to an 
enormous profit for himself. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest mystery in the deal remains the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Press reports briefly mentioned Matsushita President Akio Tanii, who was less 
well known to the West than Sony's Chairman Akio Morita and belonged more to 
the conservative culture of industrial Osaka than to Tokyo's globe-trotting 
business set. Only on Oct. 13 did U.S. reports, working from translations of 
Japanese reports, identify Tanii's lieutenant Hirata as Matsushita's point man. 
</P>
<P>
Hirata belonged to a cluster of Matsushita executives who had risen with Tanii. 
An accountant, he was at one with Matsushita's tight-fisted business culture. 
But he had also been the corporation's agent abroad, addressing securities 
analysts in London and New York in past years, while advancing Tanii's program 
of modernization. 
</P>
<P>
In a reflection of corporate rivalries back home, Sony executives, in their 
growing contacts with the Hollywood community, made no secret of their belief 
that Matsushita managers were too hidebound to accomplish something so grand as 
an MCA purchase. Sony President Norio Ohga, in Los Angeles over the weekend of 
Nov. 12-13, was still betting that Matsushita, accountants and penny-pinchers, 
would never close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Hirata, in fact, proved himself more nimble than Morita. He wrapped up an 
acquisition twice as large as the Sony purchase in less time. And he appears 
likely to sidestep the entanglements that Sony encountered when it lured movie 
producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber away from a contract with Warner Bros., 
only to be hit with an embarrassing lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 7, Wasserman had his first personal encounter with Hirata and Keiya 
Toyonaga, another Matsushita executive, during a secret meeting at the MCA 
chief's Beverly Hills home. The Japanese, according to one MCA insider, seemed 
to regard Wasserman with awe. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, Matsushita retained Allen &amp; Co. as an investment banker and 
Simpson, Thacher &amp; Bartlett for legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks following, it became clear that the Japanese were reluctant to 
share their complete trust with any outsider, even Ovitz. The Wall Street 
Journal would later report, for instance, that Matsushita, without Ovitz's 
knowledge, had secretly retained the investment banking firm of Wasserstein 
Perella &amp; Co. to offer a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, members of Matsushita's U.S. team even began to suspect sabotage 
by Matsushita employees who opposed the deal -- which Tanii was pushing through 
without the customary broad consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion of sabotage became acute when a Japanese news service reported 
that Matsushita was fed up with MCA's demands for a high price and wanted a 
"cool-off period" to let MCA stock "run out of steam." Within minutes, MCA 
stock dropped more than $10. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz, pulled from his agency's customary Wednesday morning film meeting, woke 
Hirata in the dead of the night. Within two hours, Hirata soothed the market 
with a written statement that the talks were progressing. 
</P>
<P>
The final meetings -- held on relatively neutral ground in New York City -- 
were characterized widely as "face-to-face." But they were actually a series of 
disjointed sessions in which each side convened separately, even as their 
various representatives faced one another intermittently across a table. 
</P>
<P>
MCA has its own corporate office in New York but met most often in the Park 
Avenue offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz. The law firm, a veteran 
of the takeover wars, was heavily equipped with communications facilities and 
staffed with lawyers who were accustomed to running a 24-hour drill when big 
deals came to a head. 
</P>
<P>
MCA staff members were ferried to New York on the corporate jet, a top-of-the 
line Gulfstream IV that Wasserman, after years of resistance to such 
extravagance, had finally agreed to buy the year before. As they began to 
arrive on Wednesday, Nov. 14, most checked into the Regency, a plush Park 
Avenue hotel that turned into a virtual MCA dormitory. Sheinberg stayed at his 
own apartment at the Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. Wasserman, who has never 
mingled closely with his executives, stayed a few blocks away in his New York 
apartment in the Sherry Netherland hotel -- in the same building where Allen, 
the Matsushita investment banker, lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Matsushita team worked largely from the Midtown offices of Simpson, Thacher 
&amp; Bartlett, with which Ovitz had dealt in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinberg has said the bargaining turned into a "one-hour television drama, 
with lots of peaks and valleys." Seen differently, it was still a poker game, 
with an elaborate series of bluffs and forays on the crucial question of price. 
</P>
<P>
As early as September, Wasserman and the Japanese had discussed basic matters 
of corporate governance. In the first serious bargaining session -- at 
Sheinberg's apartment on Monday, Nov. 19 -- the sides quickly agreed that both 
Wasserman and Sheinberg were to remain with the company under five-year 
employment contracts. The chief executive's office would default to Sheinberg 
automatically if Wasserman were for any reason unable to fill his office. There 
would be no significant changes in MCA personnel or policies -- though managers 
in the ranks would not get new contractual guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Yet both sides kept their positions on price vague -- and Wasserman still 
declines to say precisely what his feelings were about an appropriate price for 
MCA. In his words: "What was in my head is going to stay in my head." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as a year ago, in internal MCA discussions, Wasserman had insisted 
that his company would command $100 a share. His expectations clearly 
diminished as the market battered media stocks and MCA shares collapsed below 
$35. But he telegraphed to the Japanese at the outset that he expected a rich 
payout of between $75 and $90 a share for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Things had also changed for the Japanese. In September, they had considered the 
range realistic. But that was before the world economy had registered the full 
extent of damage that would be caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Matsushita 
also insisted that "due diligence" examinations of MCA's finances militated 
toward a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
The Matsushita team set its position at a private meeting on Monday afternoon. 
In a bizarre twist, Washington attorney Robert S. Strauss -- an MCA board 
member who is personally close to Matsushita's Toyonaga -- attended the 
meeting, having been retained by Matsushita under an arrangement permitted by a 
waiver from MCA. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion was troubled. Matsushita had decided to come in well below the 
earlier price range. Ovitz was reportedly authorized to offer a maximum of $65 
a share, including the roughly $5-per-share value of MCA's WWOR-TV station, 
which would have to be sold separately because of federal restrictions on 
foreign ownership. 
</P>
<P>
By the next morning, MCA had been hit with the news and wasn't pleased. The 
deal was already fragile. Each side suspected the other of escalating press 
leaks, and the Japanese only the week before had actually canceled their flight 
to New York until Ovitz turned them around. 
</P>
<P>
Averse to confrontation, the Japanese appeared little inclined to wrangle over 
price. Wasserman reportedly was kept away from direct price talks by his own 
team because it feared he might become volatile in a meeting with the Japanese. 
"Look, Lew does get irritable," an MCA insider noted. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, Wasserman wasn't the only irritable one. Matsushita had come up 
to $70 a share. MCA was still holding out for $75. 
</P>
<P>
At about 7:30 p.m., the deal appeared close to dead. Ovitz left to spend 
Thanksgiving in Los Angeles, apparently hoping to shock the sides into some 
movement. The Japanese also considered leaving. Allen and Rohatyn headed for 
Long Island. But the talks were salvaged in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day 
in a session brokered by Allen, as Strauss and Rohatyn -- both MCA board 
members -- came to an understanding. 
</P>
<P>
MCA would deal if Matsushita raised its offer even slightly. The Japanese by 
early Thursday agreed. Hirata and Toyonaga met Wasserman and Sheinberg shortly 
afterward. They reached an accord at $72. The Japanese would pay $66 per share, 
and both sides concurred that the station would be spun off to shareholders at 
a presumed value of $6 a share. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, the board met by telephone and approved plans for a Sunday 
meeting. The session lasted 13 hours, but Wasserman says there was no serious 
opposition to a deal. The vote to accept was taken at midnight, and the 
directors left at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The MCA chairman returned to the Sherry by 1:30 a.m. and discussed the deal 
with his wife, Edith, then found he couldn't sleep. He spent several hours in a 
chair in the couple's living room, staring out at Central Park, feeling wistful 
and thinking of the late MCA founder Jules Stein, who had treated him as a 
surrogate son. "I was thinking back over the years. I decided Stein would have 
been very happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the meeting's end, telephone reports were leaked back to 
friends in Hollywood. According to one of the earliest reports, which is 
disputed by others, Sheinberg had told the board that, despite his contractual 
guarantees of succession, he did not see himself as the long-term heir to power 
at MCA. 
</P>
<P>
At least some MCA insiders continue to believe that an American corporate giant 
such as General Electric may descend with a new bid. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the only coda to the deal has been a peculiar offer by MGM-Pathe 
Communications Co. boss Giancarlo Parretti. The Parretti bid, faxed to MCA in 
Los Angeles, reached Wasserman as he arrived home Monday. He had considered 
taking Tuesday off but decided instead to come into the office. The executive, 
who routinely dines in the studio commissary, found someone else sitting at his 
table. 
</P>
<P>
It was obviously the result of a scheduling mix-up. But Wasserman thought to 
himself nonetheless: "It didn't take long for them to move me out."

VACCINE FOR FLU MAY NOT MEET DEMAND; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: TWO OF THE FOUR LICENSED U.S. MANUFACTURERS HAVE RUN OUT WHILE THE 
OTHER TWO REPORT ONLY A LIMITED SUPPLY IS IN STOCK.

A dwindling supply of flu vaccine this year could mean that not everyone who 
wants a flu shot will get one, health officials report. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four licensed U.S. manufacturers producing this year's influenza 
vaccine have run out of vaccine while the other two companies report a limited 
supply in stock. 
</P>
<P>
In California, some county health departments, clinics and individual 
physicians have depleted their supplies and will probably be unable to obtain 
more from the manufacturers, said Dr. Loring Dales, chief of immunization for 
the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Health Department officials, however, report that they still 
have flu vaccine available. 
</P>
<P>
"We have plenty of vaccine," said Chuck Alexander, who directs distribution of 
the county's vaccine. "We have to be somewhat conservative with it, but we've 
been giving it out to whoever wants it." 
</P>
<P>
Dales said about 20% of county health departments in the state have run out of 
the vaccine, which immunizes against three strains of influenza: A Shanghai, A 
Taiwan and B Yamagata. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Orange and San Diego counties report they have enough vaccine to 
hold public immunization clinics within the next few days, but supplies are not 
expected to hold out much beyond that time. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, health officials report that demand for vaccine has 
increased from 16,000 doses provided last year to 21,000 doses so far this 
year. Riverside officials this week borrowed 1,000 doses of vaccine from the 
San Bernardino Health Department, which has not experienced a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"We've certainly had a bigger response to our flu clinics this year than we 
anticipated," said epidemiologist Randy Regester of the Riverside County Health 
Department. "It hasn't been critical, but we have had to borrow some doses in 
order to complete this season's immunization program." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, more people have sought flu shots this year than ever before 
from the Department of Public Health, but supplies have been ample to meet 
demand, said Sue Hyatt, public health nurse. 
</P>
<P>
The department administered 12,500 shots at 18 clinics held around the county, 
she said. Public Health also distributed vaccines to many of the county's 
nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt said Thursday that the department has about 150 doses remaining, which it 
will continue to offer at its regular public health clinics until the supplies 
run out. 
</P>
<P>
Because leftover flu vaccine cannot be saved and used the following year, 
manufacturers are faced with the difficult task each year of guessing how much 
vaccine will be needed, Dales said. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to gauge how much to make," he said. "Some years they make too much. 
Some years they make too little. This is one of the years where they didn't 
make enough, but they came close." 
</P>
<P>
The manufacture, packaging and shipping of large quantities of flu vaccine 
takes several months, according to the vaccine makers. By the time the existing 
supplies could be supplemented, the current flu season would be well under way. 
</P>
<P>
Flu vaccine is designed each year to protect against particular strains and 
should be administered in November and December to be most effective, Dales 
said. It takes two to three weeks for the vaccine to produce immunity. 
Influenza, which is spread by droplets coughed or sneezed into the air, usually 
hits full force in December, spurred by holiday travel. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is recommended for people who might suffer serious consequences if 
stricken with flu. Health-care workers are also encouraged to be immunized to 
halt the spread of illness among their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Flu causes fever, headache, muscle ache and fatigue but can lead to additional 
complications among the elderly and individuals with immune-system disorders. 
About 20,000 Americans die each year from influenza. 
</P>
<P>
Health clinics and physicians place their orders for vaccine early in the year 
and must estimate how much they'll need. 
</P>
<P>
The county attempts to order enough vaccine to meet the needs of individuals 
who are at particular risk for serious complications from the flu and may be 
unable to afford a shot from a private physician, Alexander said. A shot costs 
about $15 to $30 from a private practitioner, clinic or hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Individual physicians may still have plenty of vaccine available. According to 
a spokesman for one manufacturer, Connaught Labs Inc., vaccine supplies sold to 
public health departments are usually depleted quickly while supplies in 
private physicians' offices and clinics dwindle gradually. 
</P>
<P>
Supply "would vary from physician to physician," Dales said. "But if (private 
doctors) have run out, it would be difficult to get any more." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next week, state officials will transfer supplies of flu vaccine from 
counties with an excess to those experiencing a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"Some counties have scheduled (immunization) clinics and have had to close 
them," Dales said. "We hope next week to gather up vaccine from some clinics 
that came out ahead and shift the vaccine to the other counties so they can 
hold makeup clinics."

TEEN TO STAND TRIAL FOR ATTACK THAT LEFT GIRL'S FACE SCARRED

<P>
An Orange County Municipal judge ordered a young Stanton man to stand trial on 
felony assault charges Thursday for allegedly throwing a piece of glass that 
slashed Amber Jefferson's face during a brawl last August. 
</P>
<P>
After four days of pretrial testimony, Judge Michael Beecher ruled that there 
was ample evidence to try Kurt David Wimberly, 18, on felony mayhem charges, 
although no one saw him throw the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Trial is set to begin Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The charge stems from Wimberly's involvement in an Aug. 6 fight outside his 
home that left the 15-year-old Garden Grove girl with a disfiguring scar that 
runs from her temple to her neck. 
</P>
<P>
Two misdemeanor assault charges against Wimberly were dropped because one of 
his alleged victims, a former friend of Amber's who has since accused her of 
attempting to bribe him into changing his testimony, now says he was never 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
Wimberly, who remains in the Orange County Jail, is also charged with assault 
with a deadly weapon, infliction of bodily harm and battery. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, as many as 12 people on both sides, some armed with 
bats and boards, took part in the fight that allegedly stemmed from an argument 
between Wimberly's former and current girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that during the confrontation, an angry Wimberly threw an 
ash tray, knife and then a glass shard from his patio, striking Amber in the 
face after one of her friends started breaking out the windows in his home. 
Following the near-fatal injury that slashed Amber's face to the bone, she and 
her family charged that the attack was racially motivated, causing civil rights 
activists to rally around her. 
</P>
<P>
Amber, the daughter of a black father and white mother, said her assailants had 
used racial slurs during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
But the district attorney soundly rejected that claim, saying that the 
confrontation had nothing to do with race. During pretrial testimony, there was 
little evidence presented to suggest that race was a motive. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier testimony, 17-year-old Matt Stewart -- a friend of Amber's who was 
with her the night of the incident -- alleged that Amber had told him they each 
would receive $1,000 if they told authorities the attack was racially 
motivated. Amber denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Garcia, a sheriff's homicide investigator, testified Thursday that a 
13-ounce piece of glass from a sliding glass window was probably the object 
that cut Amber. Although blood samples taken from the glass matched Amber's 
blood type, Garcia said that investigators did not find any fingerprints on the 
shard to directly tie it to Wimberly. 
</P>
<P>
Despite confusing and often conflicting testimony presented by the prosecution 
witnesses, Assistant Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper said she remains convinced that 
the district attorney has a strong case.

WHITE MAN IS SENTENCED IN RACIAL ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTING: HE IS GIVEN SEVEN YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON FOR WOUNDING A BLACK WOMAN 
AFTER MAKING RACIAL SLURS. 
</P>

<P>
A white San Bernardino County man was sentenced Thursday to seven years in 
federal prison for violating the civil rights of a black neighbor by shooting 
her with a high-powered rifle after making a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts in Los Angeles imposed the sentence on 
Gary Dean McInnis, 39, of Hesperia, who was convicted in August of using force 
to interfere with the housing rights of Oleatha Kellar, 63. He was also 
convicted of using a firearm during a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the first successful felony prosecution of its kind in the federal 
court's seven-county Central District, which comprises most of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said McInnis fired shots from a high-powered rifle across an empty 
lot at Kellar's house last January after commenting to an acquaintance that he 
did not like black people. Kellar was standing in the kitchen and was struck in 
the abdomen by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies investigating the shooting found in 
McInnis' garage workshop black figures hanging from nooses, swastikas and a 
wooden sign suggesting that all blacks be "executed." 
</P>
<P>
Another of Kellar's neighbors heard McInnis shouting racial slurs before he 
fired the shots, Kellar said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither McInnis nor his lawyer could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kellar, a former resident of the San Fernando Valley community of Pacoima who 
has been disabled for years with diabetes and other ailments, moved to Hesperia 
two years ago and shares the home with her sister. Her house and McInnis' are 
separated by the empty lot. 
</P>
<P>
Hesperia, located 20 miles north of San Bernardino, is one of the 
fastest-growing cities in California. Its population, which is 94% white, has 
surged from 5,000 in 1970 to 49,818 today, according to the most recent Census 
estimates, with increasing numbers of blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Kellar said she had not been the victim of any racial 
incident in Hesperia before the shooting, and had not seen McInnis until he 
made a court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
She believes, however, that resentment about blacks living in the town might 
have prompted McInnis' action. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very prejudiced here," Kellar said. She added, however, that some of 
her white neighbors were kind to her after she was shot and one sent her 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, there have been two incidents that she believes were 
racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Kellar said, two white men who looked as if they had been 
drinking, rang her doorbell and said they wanted to talk about a "personality 
contest." Their comments seemed to make no sense, she recalled. Later that 
evening, she said, she heard someone shouting racial slurs outside her house. 
</P>
<P>
On Thanksgiving Eve, Kellar said, someone shot at her sister near their home. 
Kellar said she reported both incidents to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Elana S. Artson, who prosecuted McInnis, would not say 
whether her office is looking into the reports. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say nothing about recent incidents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in Hesperia shares Kellar's opinion that the town is prejudiced. 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree with that. We're the same as anyone else," said Sgt. Pat Dailey, a 
supervisor with the Hesperia Police Department and a resident for 15 years. "We 
have incidents where people get into name-calling because they are angry but I 
don't recall any hate crimes other than this. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have a member of the Ku Klux Klan but we arrested him and he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
McInnis has been in custody for months at the federal Metropolitan Detention 
Center in downtown Los Angeles. State charges had been filed against him, but 
were dropped after local authorities discovered possible violations of Kellar's 
civil rights and referred the matter to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
While prosecutors said they were pleased with Thursday's sentence, Kellar was 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that they didn't let him out" of jail, she said, "but I don't really 
think he got enough time. He was shooting at our house. I could have been 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was thinking about moving out of Hesperia, she replied: 
</P>
<P>
"This is our home. I intend to stay."

SOVIET UNION: THE PRESIDENT CONCEDES ERRORS IN HIS LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THAT

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saying he and other Communists are 
"guilty before the working class" for their errors in leadership, vowed 
immediate efforts Thursday to alleviate the country's worsening food crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging speech to a citywide conference of Moscow Communists, 
Gorbachev, who is also the party's general secretary, said his country, as in 
World War II, is again in a life-or-death situation. 
</P>
<P>
In another development reflecting the Soviet Union's troubled domestic 
politics, official media reported that Gorbachev scheduled a trip to the 
republic of Moldova in the Soviet southwest today in a bid to mediate the 
nation's latest ethnic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from a stage dominated by a white bust of Soviet founder V. I. Lenin, 
the 59-year-old Kremlin leader said the party he heads, which has been fast 
losing members, has been out of touch with the Soviet people and their demands 
for a "U-turn" in society. 
</P>
<P>
"We are guilty before the working class -- all of us, I think, and me 
personally," Gorbachev declared. 
</P>
<P>
Answering written questions from the audience of about 1,000 Communists, 
Gorbachev gave special attention to the food situation in the capital, saying 
he gets daily reports that show meat and bread supplies at about the same 
levels as in 1989. Hearing that, some in the audience jeered. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said, however, that supplies of milk and other dairy products have 
dropped as regions around Moscow refuse to meet prior commitments. He said 
agreements have just been concluded with Estonia, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine to 
supply the capital and Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second-largest city, with 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also assured his Muscovite audience that food aid from foreign 
countries "will go first to Moscow and Leningrad." 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, quoted the chairman of the Moldovan 
legislature, Alexander Mosanu, as saying Gorbachev will make a one-day visit to 
the republic today and meet with lawmakers to discuss the "social-political 
situation" there. 
</P>
<P>
Moldova, formerly known as Moldavia, is a small, largely agricultural republic 
on the border with Romania. It has been riven by ethnic quarrels since the 
Moldovan majority, which speaks a language akin to Romanian, declared the 
republic's sovereignty this summer. 
</P>
<P>
In response, a Turkic-speaking minority, the Gagauz, and a predominantly Slavic 
enclave proclaimed their own breakaway states. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, at least three people were killed in clashes between Moldovan 
police and residents of the Slavic area. Earlier, Gorbachev had sent his 
personal adviser on defense matters, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, to Moldova 
in a bid to halt the unrest, but the Soviet leader has apparently decided that 
his own presence will be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Gorbachev intervened personally in an ethnic dispute, the results 
must have seemed dismaying to him as well as harmful to his prestige. He 
traveled to Lithuania in January to urge its people to remain in the Soviet 
Union, but the Baltic republic's legislature proclaimed independence in March. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, there is widespread resistance in Moldova to Gorbachev's attempt to 
conclude a new union treaty between the republics and the central government. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Communists in Moscow, Gorbachev again said that the Soviet 
Union should not be allowed to break up, but he acknowledged that achieving the 
transition to a truly federal state, given the longtime tyrannical 
centralization of Soviet power, may be "the most difficult task of the 20th 
Century."

American deserters from a Persian Gulf war will not be given asylum in neutral

Foreign Ministry said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden rejected a request by the German Greens party to accept U.S. soldiers 
now in Germany who wish to desert. And it would not accept deserters from a 
U.N.-sanctioned war in the gulf, spokeswoman Birgitta Ahlen said. 
</P>
<P>
German peace groups said Thursday at least 24 American soldiers are ready to 
flee if they are ordered to the gulf.

John Major, making his first appearance in the House of Commons as Britain's 
new prime minister on Thursday -- with Margaret Thatcher looking on from the 
back benches -- insisted "I am my own man" after coming under renewed fire for 
his close political ties to his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Major was derided for not appointing a woman to his Cabinet, 
whose members he announced Wednesday. One of his campaign promises had been to 
find more jobs for women in his government. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rough first day as the 47-year-old former chancellor of the exchequer 
faced Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock in his inaugural parliamentary debate as 
the country's leader and was needled by other opposition members. 
</P>
<P>
During the prime minister's traditional "question time," Major not only faced 
Kinnock, a veteran debater, but was mocked by Labor member of Parliament Robert 
Hughes, who cited the all-male Cabinet lineup and asked, "Is the only woman in 
the Cabinet the back-seat driver?" 
</P>
<P>
This was a reference to a remark Thatcher made before Major's selection as 
Conservative Party leader -- a remark that many in the party soon regretted -- 
that she would make a good "back-seat driver." At the time, it was clear that 
Major was her favored candidate. 
</P>
<P>
After Hughes' comment, Major shot back, "I am my own man. I do not need to beat 
my chest and tell the honorable gentleman. Let him see what we will do." 
</P>
<P>
The new Cabinet is England's first since 1964 -- and the only one in Western 
Europe today -- to have no woman. Thatcher began her Cabinet career as 
education secretary in the government of Edward Heath. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after the parliamentary debate, at 10 Downing St., Major announced 
the appointment of Gillian Patricia Shephard, a member of Commons, as a 
treasury minister, a job under Cabinet rank. Shephard, who becomes the first 
woman to fill a senior post in that important department, said she considered 
her appointment "a vote of confidence in women." 
</P>
<P>
During Major's brief clashes with Kinnock in the crowded parliamentary chamber, 
the new prime minister promised a thorough review of the controversial local 
poll tax, which has replaced private property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
When the 48-year-old Kinnock pushed him to abolish the poll tax, Major coolly 
pointed out that in 1980 Kinnock roundly condemned the property tax system as 
the "most unjust of all taxes." 
</P>
<P>
That drew murmurs from the Conservative backbenchers, who were happy to see 
Major apparently holding his own in his first performance against Kinnock. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher sat on a fourth-row rear bench for the first time in 29 years. By 
tradition, parliamentary members of the government and the opposition "shadow 
cabinet" sit on the front benches directly across from one another. 
</P>
<P>
Former prime ministers are entitled to sit on the front bench "below the 
gangway," but Thatcher chose to sit elsewhere -- possibly because she otherwise 
would have been next to Ted Heath, whom she deposed as Tory leader in 1975 and 
who has never forgiven her. 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament was in a raucous mood as the MPs filed in. When Environment 
Secretary Michael Heseltine, who led the fight against Thatcher that ultimately 
led to her resignation last week, strode into the chamber, a Labor MP shouted: 
"Good afternoon, Judas!" 
</P>
<P>
And as Major himself entered, the left-wing Laborite and parliamentary wit 
Dennis Skinner called out: "Resign!" 
</P>
<P>
Major smiled and replied, "Wait a while." 
</P>
<P>
Among his other comments Thursday, the prime minister said he hopes to see 
President Bush "this side of Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
By and large, parliamentary correspondents noted that Major seemed nervous at 
first but began to relax and, overall, performed well.

TERRORISM: N.J. RESIDENT ALSO IS ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING TO ATTACK MILITARY 
INSTALLATIONS.

FBI agents arrested a man they identified as a Palestinian from Jordan on 
charges of making threats against U.S. officials, including President Bush and 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, and conspiring to damage military 
installations in North Carolina and Texas, the Justice Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials emphasized that they have not been able to determine the 
seriousness of the threats allegedly made by Jamal Mohamed Warrayat of 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"Threats like this are always taken seriously," a department official said, but 
he noted that there is no evidence to link the 32-year-old suspect with any 
international terrorist network. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chertoff, U.S. attorney in New Jersey, said that from last August until 
Tuesday, Warrayat conspired with others to attack military installations in 
North Carolina and Texas and to assault and murder U.S. government officials. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the charges, Warrayat would face a maximum sentence of 10 years 
in prison and a $500,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In an Associated Press report from Newark, N.J., Warrayat's attorney, Terence 
Scott, was quoted as saying that his client was born in Kuwait and has 
relatives in both Kuwait and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Warrayat came to the United States in the early 1970s and served about four 
years in the Army until 1979, Scott said. He added that his client, who worked 
as a taxi driver until recently but was unemployed at the time of his arrest, 
denies all the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, FBI headquarters ordered 
its field offices throughout the country to be on alert for any signs of 
terrorist activity in the United States. But no hard evidence of any plot has 
surfaced, and there was nothing about Warrayat's arrest linking him to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Papers filed with a federal magistrate in Newark made clear that much of the 
evidence against Warrayat came from a Nov. 8 conversation he had with an FBI 
undercover agent near Newark International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
That conversation, conducted in Arabic, was recorded, according to an affidavit 
by Andrew A. Apollony, an FBI agent assigned to the FBI-New Jersey State Police 
Terrorism Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
In the conversation, Warrayat said that he headed a group of seven individuals 
planning to conduct terrorist acts and seeking assistance in the form of 
explosives, money and technical training, according to Apollony. Warrayat said 
he already had a couple of machine guns at an undisclosed site but needed a 
sniper rifle and additional machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
He also told the undercover agent that the group had selected a number of 
targets, including high-level officials "such as" Bush, Baker and members of 
Congress, and military bases, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect said he had drawings and diagrams of the military targets, some of 
them made several years ago, and that they would be used in attacking the 
installations, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 31 conversation with the undercover agent, Warrayat claimed that he 
and the other members of his group each had at least four years of military 
training and that they had sufficient weapons and materials to carry out small 
terrorist operations, Apollony said. 
</P>
<P>
It was learned that FBI agents have interviewed other persons linked to 
Warrayat but that no additional arrests are planned. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Chertoff said the FBI was joined by the Secret Service, Immigration 
and Naturalization Service and New Jersey State Police in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Wire services reported that U.S. Magistrate Donald Haneke set a probable cause 
hearing for Dec. 7.

SANCTIONS HAVE GOOD CHANCE OF WORKING, EXPERTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
EMBARGO: THEY COULD REDUCE IRAQ'S ECONOMY BY NEARLY HALF, THEY SAY. THE KICKER: 
IT MIGHT TAKE 18 MONTHS TO TWO YEARS FOR THEM TO BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

<P>
International sanctions against Iraq have an unusually high likelihood of 
succeeding, but it might take 18 months or two years before they could persuade 
Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, a Washington economic think tank said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute for International Economics estimated that the global oil embargo 
eventually will reduce Iraq's economy by nearly half -- an amount 20 times the 
average impact of past "successful" embargoes in this century. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by a team that studied 115 other cases of embargoes since 
World War I, also concluded that eventually Iraq's civilian population will 
suffer severe hardships, its industrial base will be crippled and its military 
capacity will be wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions echo those of two former military chiefs -- retired Air Force 
Gen. David C. Jones and retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. -- and other defense 
experts who have urged the Bush Administration to avoid rushing prematurely to 
war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The report cautions, however, that the definition of "success" has to be 
somewhat narrow. If the goal remains the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and the 
restoration of the Kuwaiti government, then sanctions will eventually prevail, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on circumstances, however, sanctions might have to be paired with 
some concessions to Hussein, such as loan forgiveness by Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait and greater access to Persian Gulf waters, said the institute, which is 
headed by C. Fred Bergsten, a Treasury official during the Carter 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The report warned that more ambitious demands -- such as payment of 
reparations, retribution for war crimes, the overthrow of Hussein or the 
eradication of his nuclear and chemical weapons programs -- could not be 
achieved through sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bergsten and the authors of the report -- Georgetown 
University economics professor Gary C. Hufbauer and institute trade specialists 
Jeffrey J. Schott and Kimberley Ann Elliott -- said that they do not rule out 
the threat of military action as a way to enhance the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Iraq are almost unique in this century in being virtually 
airtight, they pointed out. Also, the U.S.-led military coalition in Saudi 
Arabia poses a credible threat of military action should the sanctions 
eventually fail. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation is unprecedented," said Elliott, declaring that there has been 
virtually zero leakage through the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti 
oil. The report estimates that the ultimate cost to Iraq would amount to 48% of 
its gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most effective alliance (in an international sanction) mounted in 
this century," added Hufbauer, who pointed out that an isolated Iraq has no 
credible ally, or "black knight" capable of mounting an effective breach of the 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
"If war is the only alternative to maintaining the sanctions," Bergsten said, 
"then the sanctions seem more likely to work. The conventional view that time 
is on Hussein's side is, in our view, not correct." 
</P>
<P>
Explained Bergsten at another point: "If you talk about political pressures 
working against Bush or against the coalition, I'd ask: 'Compared with what'? 
If the alternative is tens of thousands of casualties, then the chances of 
keeping the sanctions in place are much higher." 
</P>
<P>
By that logic, Hufbauer added, Bush's controversial recent decision to double 
the deployed U.S. forces over the next few months should have the short-term 
value of making the military alternative still more credible and therefore more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
The group was unanimous in warning that the sanctions process, even under these 
uniquely favorable conditions, would take at least a year, more likely 18 
months to two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions are not surgical," said Schott. "Rather, their effect is corrosive, 
over time. It takes time for sanctions to reach a level of intensity, and then 
they have to be maintained at that level before they can work." 
</P>
<P>
Hufbauer estimated that the standard of living of the average Iraqi has already 
declined by 10% -- a far more drastic impact than U.S. citizens feel in most 
recessions, when a contraction of 2.5% is more usual. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Hufbauer said, the sanctions should be felt most widely in three 
areas crucial not only to industry and national output but also to military 
capability: transportation, electrical utilities and telecommunications.

FORM OF ARTHRITIS REPRODUCED IN RATS; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: EXPERIMENTS HELP CONFIRM LINK BETWEEN GENE REGULATING IMMUNE SYSTEM 
AND A TYPE OF THE DISEASE. RESEARCHERS SAY THE ACHIEVEMENT WILL HELP TRACK THE 
AILMENT FROM ITS EARLIEST STAGES.

<P>
Experiments for the first time have reproduced a form of human arthritis in 
genetically altered rats and confirmed a previously established link between a 
gene involved in regulating the immune system and this form of arthritis, 
researchers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement means researchers now have a reliable animal model to aid 
studies of ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis and 
related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The rats carry the human genes for a tissue type found in many patients with 
these diseases, which are collectively known as spondyloarthropathies. 
</P>
<P>
These forms of arthritis are believed to affect about 200,000 Americans, 
primarily young adults. Other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
and osteoarthritis, are more common. 
</P>
<P>
The advances, reported by researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center in Dallas, may eventually lead to better treatments and 
prevention strategies. Their findings are being published today in the journal 
Cell. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas researchers injected a solution containing DNA fragments of the two 
genes that encode for the tissue type into fertilized one-cell rat eggs. They 
then performed experiments that confirmed that the genes had been incorporated 
into the genetic material of the rats and that the rats produced protein 
molecules encoded by the genes. 
</P>
<P>
Several months after birth, the rats develop symptoms similar to those found in 
the human arthritic diseases, such as arthritis of the spine and large joints, 
and inflammation of the bowel, skin and nails. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all very pleased with this remarkable scientific advance," said Dr. 
Lawrence E. Shulman, director of the National Institute of Arthritis and 
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, which was one of the sponsors of the 
research. "The discovery clearly shows that genetic factors participate 
directly in causing (the diseases)." 
</P>
<P>
Shulman added: "Now they need to find out how these genes act and work to 
produce the arthritic changes, and what, if any, co-factors are involved in 
this process." 
</P>
<P>
The development of an animal model "allows us to examine the development of the 
disease from its very earliest stages," said Dr. Joel D. Taurog, one of the 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
About 7% or 8% of Americans are believed to carry genes for the tissue type 
HLA-B27. This tissue type is also present in the vast majority of individuals 
who develop spondyloarthropathies, an association that was first noted in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers seeking to understand these diseases have been puzzled by the fact 
that only a minority of individuals -- estimates vary from 1% to 20% -- with 
the HLA-B27 tissue type become ill. One theory is that the diseases are 
triggered by exposure to certain types of intestinal bacteria. Another is that 
some individuals with the HLA-B27 tissue type make a protein encoded by the 
genes, and therefore become ill, while others do not make the protein and 
remain well. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings provide strong evidence that the B-27 gene is directly involved 
in causing the disease," Taurog said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Texas researchers and others had previously conducted similar 
experiments in mice, but the animals did not become ill. They now hope to study 
the effects of various drugs on the development of arthritis in the rats and 
try to learn more about the changes in the rats which initiate the development 
of disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARTHRITIC DISEASES 
</P>
<P>
 These are major forms of the group of arthritic diseases known as 
spondyloarthropathies. An estimated 7% of Americans have a genetic 
predisposition to developing these diseases, but only a minority of these 
individuals do so. 
</P>
<P>
ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: This ailment causes pain and stiffness in the joints of 
the body's trunk, including the back, neck, hips, shoulders and ribs. In severe 
cases, a stiff and inflexible spine can develop, as well as eye, heart and 
other complications. 
</P>
<P>
ARTHRITIS OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: Some patients with the bowel disorders 
ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease develop arthritis, primarily in the hands 
and feet. 
</P>
<P>
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS: Individuals who have the skin disease psoriasis sometimes 
have an accompanying joint inflammation, especially in the knees and elbows. 
</P>
<P>
REITER'S SYNDROME: A type of arthritis transmitted by sexual contact that is 
the most common cause of arthritis in young men. Features include pain in the 
joints, eye inflammation, skin rash and a penile discharge.

GALILEO SPACECRAFT RIGHT ON TARGET FOR EARTH FLYBY DEC. 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After taking a brief look at Venus, the Galileo spacecraft is speeding toward a 
close encounter with Earth Dec. 8 on its long journey to Jupiter and it is 
expected to hit its desired course almost on the button, scientists reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had tried to block the launch of Galileo last year because 
its instruments draw their energy from nuclear power, and some feared that a 
launch failure or a subsequent collision with Earth could release deadly 
radioisotopes into the atmosphere. But there is no chance of that, scientists 
said, because Galileo will be within about 16 miles of its desired course, 
passing 590 miles over the surface of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo will make an even closer Earth flyby in two years, passing less than 
200 miles from the planet on its way to its ultimate destination, Jupiter. But 
nothing about the spacecraft has given officials with the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration anything to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"The spacecraft's health is excellent," said Galileo project manager William J. 
O'Neil of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo is functioning so well that "we don't have to do anything on the ground 
or anything on the spacecraft" to successfully zip by the Earth and use gravity 
to boost its speed by about 15,000 m.p.h. That is one of several maneuvers that 
Galileo will go through in order to reach Jupiter, where it will conduct a 
two-year study of the Jovian system. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, plans did not call for Galileo to fly past either Venus or Earth, 
but a new course had to be developed after changes in the space program 
resulting from the Challenger disaster precluded the use of a rocket powerful 
enough to send it on a direct course to Jupiter. So both Venus and Earth are 
bonuses along the way, and scientists expect to make full use of both 
opportunities to study planets that are very similar in some ways, but quite 
different in others. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth flyby will be unique in that, for the first time, a spacecraft will 
reveal the Earth as it would appear to an alien spacecraft flying through the 
solar system. The flyby is expected to produce some first-ever pictures of the 
Earth and the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see portions of the far side of the moon that have never been looked 
at with modern sensors," said Torrence V. Johnson of JPL, the project 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The images that Galileo will send back as it speeds toward Earth, as well as 
the thousands of photographs it will take of Jupiter and that planet's moons, 
could be exceptionally rewarding because the camera aboard Galileo is capable 
of creating extremely sharp images in very low light, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Belton, leader of the imaging team, Galileo's camera is 
about 100 times as sensitive to light as the cameras that sent back spectacular 
images from the two Voyagers as they explored the outer reaches of the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo's visit to Venus has been upstaged by JPL's Magellan spacecraft, which 
uses a radar camera to pierce through the sulfur dioxide clouds that hide the 
planet's surface, but at least it gave scientists a chance to check out their 
instruments and pick up a little precious data on the brilliant white planet. 
</P>
<P>
The data, collected in February, was stored aboard the spacecraft until last 
week, when Galileo was close enough to Earth to transmit it back. Scientists 
have spent the last few days devouring the information. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas came early this year," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
And there were a few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Galileo's instruments detected a concentration of electrons 
traveling at far higher speeds than would have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
The electrons apparently were accelerated to the extraordinary speeds because 
of some "interaction" of Venus with the million-mile-an-hour wind blowing off 
the sun. Asked the significance of the discovery, Louis Frank of the University 
of Iowa, head of the plasma science team, said: 
</P>
<P>
"It shows our ignorance of how to push particles around the solar system." 
</P>
<P>
The photos of Venus taken by Galileo do not rival the sharp radar images that 
Magellan has been sending back for the last few weeks, but scientists embraced 
them anyway because they reveal additional details about the clouds that cover 
Venus. That, in turn, is important because it gives scientists a chance to 
study the atmosphere of a planet that evolved quite differently from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in an atmosphere that we are changing," Belton said, referring 
to the global warming effect that many scientists believe is taking place on 
Earth. "If you don't want the Earth to change into something like that (Venus), 
then you better learn about atmospheres." 
</P>
<P>
Venus has an atmosphere that is rich in carbon dioxide, so it has already 
experienced the greenhouse effect. It is also devoid of life.

Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, 
Anadarko Algeria Corp., has signed a contract with an Algerian drilling 
contractor to drill the first well of a multiwell program. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is with Enterprise Nationale des Travaux aux Puits. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the drilling to start in May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with ENTP is Anadarko's latest step in its 10-year joint venture 
with Sonatrach to find and develop crude oil reserves in the Algerian Sahara 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract with ENTP is significant in that it represents the results of 
competitive bidding and the commitment of a national public sector company to 
seek new deals with foreign competitors under new and more wide-open commercial 
and hydrocarbon regulations," said Robert J. Allison Jr., Anadarko chairman and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Anadarko Algeria teamed up with Sonatrach under a production-sharing agreement 
signed in October 1989, and opened its subsidiary headquarters office in 
Algiers in July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1990, Anadarko Algeria began full-scale operations of a seismic 
processing center 25 miles east of Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
The exploration license in Algeria covers an area of 5.1 million acres in the 
Grand Erg Oriental of the Sahara Desert.

FIRST PERSON: SPENDING 97 MONTHS IN FAMILY OF FELONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACQUELINE HENDRICKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Dec. 1, 1989, I was told how long. Ninety-seven months. On Dec. 20, I was 
told where and when. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Jan. 10, 1990, at noon, I was to report to the Federal Correctional 
Institution at Pleasanton. Eight years of my life were to be turned over to the 
United States Justice Department. These would be mandatory years, which means 
no parole, no chance for early release. 
</P>
<P>
Barring an Act of Congress, I will leave prison Jan. 21, 1997. Eight years in 
prison, more time than I spent in college, more time than high school, more 
time than my marriage lasted. It is a time segment like I've never known, with 
no frame of reference. 
</P>
<P>
I called ahead to see what was appropriate to take to prison. I had never been 
before. 
</P>
<P>
I was arrested on a Friday morning in April of 1989. I spent the weekend in 
jail. It was my first and only experience with incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
I arrived at the Pleasanton gate, suitcase in hand trembling inside. I'm 42 
years old, a schoolteacher, divorced, mother of two. I've always told myself 
that if I survived childbirth, I could survive anything. 
</P>
<P>
On this sunny day in January, I wondered. 
</P>
<P>
The officer from Receiving and Discharge came to the front reception area to 
pick up her new charge -- me. 
</P>
<P>
She quickly went through my suitcase, separating what I could keep from what 
was to be sent home. My purse was sent home along with the suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
I am no longer a valid California driver. My checkbook, children's pictures, 
credit cards, the tangible life accessories that defined me, were left in the 
suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
I am now an eight-digit number assigned by the U.S. Marshal. My only 
identification is a plastic card with my picture and number. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite sweater I could not keep. I wore my Reeboks, but I was not allowed 
to keep them either. I had to buy Reeboks from the prison commissary or wear 
prison-issue shoes. For the first month of my sentence, the commissary was out 
of Reeboks. 
</P>
<P>
The check-in process involved filling out forms, picture-taking, fingerprinting 
and body-searching. The latter involves undressing completely in front of an 
officer who checks each article of clothing, the seams and pockets, raises your 
arm so she can see around your breasts, looks between each toe, in your ears, 
your mouth (tongue out). You shake your hair, finger-comb it, squat down and 
cough, bend over, pull your cheeks apart, and get dressed. 
</P>
<P>
This done, I was presented with one eerie question, "Is there anyone here who 
would make it impossible for you to stay here?" I had seven co-defendants, none 
of whom I know or would recognize if they sat down beside me. I answered, "No." 
</P>
<P>
On April 28, 1989, I had boarded a plane at LAX bound for Seattle. A man I knew 
there had asked me to do him a favor. He said he needed something from Los 
Angeles but didn't have the time to come to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I was too trusting, but I was not suspicious, even when he said he 
would pay me $500 for "my trouble." The next day, a man I didn't know dropped 
off a black leather gym bag at my home and gave me money to buy a plane ticket 
to Seattle. I did not examine the contents of the bag. I should have. 
</P>
<P>
When I got off the plane with the gym bag in my hand, my Seattle acquaintance 
met me. We walked to his car talking about the weather, his private 
investigation business, and other things. 
</P>
<P>
At the elevators in the parking structure, he told me to wait for him while he 
got my money. Within 60 seconds, it seemed like I was in the middle of a scene 
from "Miami Vice." Men were pointing guns at me and yelling. 
</P>
<P>
As they grabbed me and snapped the handcuffs on my wrists, I asked, "What did I 
do?" "You know," said my captors. "You know." 
</P>
<P>
The formalities of checking in to prison were over. I was given a plastic bag 
of bedding and another bag for all my clothes that I was allowed to keep. 
</P>
<P>
They give us what we need: two pairs of socks, three pairs of khaki pants, six 
bras (one style suits all), six shirts (men's khaki), six T-shirts (Army green 
and white), six pairs of panties, not necessarily the right size. Laundry soap 
is rationed for one load per week. 
</P>
<P>
We walked out of the windowless reception office onto a college-type campus. 
The officer generously, he told me, carried one of the large bags as we walked 
to my dorm -- in Pleasanton parlance, the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasanton is a co-ed administrative facility. My unit is divided; men have 
three-fourths of the space, women have the rest. I asked the unit officer to 
place me in a room (cell) with a nonsmoker. I was accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
My roommate told me she was "a racist lesbian." Our room-sharing lasted about 
five days before I was moved, apparently at her request. I humbly moved in with 
a sweeter woman from New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The units are molded concrete, modern-looking structures with vaulted ceilings 
and skylights all around. 
</P>
<P>
I had been very fearful about women's prison, having seen only the Hollywood 
visions of them. It was a relief to see the modern structure. 
</P>
<P>
The wall facing the compound is all glass. It is two stories high and angles 
steeply toward the middle of the unit. The staff offices are located in all the 
corners of the building. We have a counselor to take care of all the in-unit 
problems, a case manager to handle the legal problems with the Bureau of 
Prisons and the U.S. Justice Department, a unit manager to cope with the more 
major problems of the bureau and our cases or with problems we may have with 
our case managers. 
</P>
<P>
I type in a small room with a window wall that looks out on a lawn, small 
flower garden, pine trees, another unit, and in the background the double 
razor-wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinklers come on automatically at night. We are situated in the rolling 
hills south of Oakland. The hills are dried and brown. Our compound is lush and 
green. 
</P>
<P>
I am presented with the idyllic setting and feel betrayed. What does it mean? 
Where am I in all of this? 
</P>
<P>
The unit is at once the private place of "home" and the public place of sharing 
with about 220 other inmates. The noise reverberates so that at times it is 
difficult to hear the voice of the person standing next to you. 
</P>
<P>
Solace becomes sacred and rare. The cell or "home," as the experienced call it, 
is a small room with a bunk bed, desk, two lockers (like old-fashioned 
wardrobes), sink, toilet and lamp. The bedding is U.S. Army surplus, including 
the military insignia. 
</P>
<P>
The people I love smile permanently in their pictures pinned on my bulletin 
board. Pictures of people I don't know also smile at me, my "bunkie's" family. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the moments when the camera clicked, the laughing and loving. Now 
there is this separation and loneliness. Nothing much is said between us and 
I'm filled with things to say. 
</P>
<P>
The walls are newly painted white; the linoleum floor is yellowed with old wax. 
All the rooms open onto the great room, either from a second-floor balcony or 
the first floor. MTV and HBO blare from the great room TV. 
</P>
<P>
There is a duty officer who handles the incidental details of making sure women 
are not in their rooms having sex with each other, stealing food from the 
cafeteria, or hoarding hair dryers, irons and ironing boards. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, there is no smoking except in our rooms. We spend a lot of time 
cleaning and are dismissed for meals based on the cleanliness of our units. Of 
the three units, ours is always last. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the employees, everyone here is a felon. Some of them are famous: 
the woman who tried to assassinate Gerald Ford, the woman who laced the Tylenol 
capsules (a sweet friendly countenance), a San Diego woman who defrauded people 
of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
And there are the not-so-famous, like the pregnant woman who in two weeks will 
give birth to a baby she must give up for five years. 
</P>
<P>
My first day, I was impressed with the number of women my age and older and 
their racial diversity. Thais, Chinese, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Colombians, 
Mexicans, Canadians and Russians, all are here. 
</P>
<P>
The crimes are as diverse as the people who committed them, but most, like me, 
are here for drug-related offenses. The real face of crime doesn't look like I 
thought it would. 
</P>
<P>
Common courtesy is a casualty of confinement. Rudeness and crudeness (the 
language would match the worst of the drunken sailors and the harshest of 
street rappers) are routine. The incessant bickering and loudness resonates and 
pounds and says nothing, nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
Street hollering, country hog-hollering, angry hollering. Can we talk? No, we 
holler, and my English teacher said there wasn't such a word. 
</P>
<P>
My first prison job was in the kitchen. Everyone must serve 90 days in the 
kitchen. I worked in the dish room. It is the place where the dishes and all 
the pots and pans are washed. 
</P>
<P>
The garbage disposal was broken so the dishes were scraped by hand. Inmates 
shoved their trays with all the leftover foodstuff in our direction. 
</P>
<P>
When our shift was over, we were covered with Cream O' Wheat, scrambled eggs, 
potatoes, ketchup, mustard, garbage. At the end of seven hours, we had earned 
77 cents and spent most of that time on our feet. 
</P>
<P>
We all work. Unless someone is medically exempt, they have a work assignment. 
The game is to get a work assignment that requires the least amount of effort, 
or the most amount of money, if money is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
We are only allowed to spend $115 per month in the commissary, most work 
assignments pay about $5 per month. Some, like my kitchen job, pay 11 cents per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
There is no one here who ever cut hair professionally. But there are many here 
who say they did. Hairstyles and colors are limited. Long, long hair is often 
indicative of a long, long stay. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone is our lifeline. All 220 women share four phones. The time limit 
is 20 minutes per call. (Large, obnoxious, inconsiderate women routinely talk 
longer.) 
</P>
<P>
This gives me 20 minutes in which to do that which I spent 24 hours, seven days 
a week doing before I came here -- that is, being a mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I love you and I miss you and I want you to come home," my children say every 
day on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
We have a candy machine here that eats our money. Women who are large, larger 
than the 6-foot-tall machine, grab the ends and turn it sideways, forward and 
backward until the snacks fall out. 
</P>
<P>
This is not life as I knew it. 
</P>
<P>
The life I once lived no longer exists, only parts of it remain. Love and 
family take on exaggerated dimensions. I ask much of those I love. 
</P>
<P>
I want to call home and hear my daughter and my son tell me they love me. 
</P>
<P>
I want my fiance to reassure me he is still there. To know, to hear their 
voices, their life, is soothing. I can face another day with just one reminder 
that love is out there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendricks, who holds a master's degree in education from Indiana University, 
is a former Los Angeles schoolteacher. Although she pleaded guilty, she is 
appealing the length of her sentence. This was originally received as a letter 
to View.

PRISONERS OF SILENCE;

<P>
IN A SMALL KANSAS CEMETERY, THE GRAVES OF 14 GERMAN POWS REPRESENT ONE OF THE 
LAST UNTOLD STORIES OF WORLD WAR II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LEAVENWORTH, Kan. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no women or children buried in the little hilltop cemetery 
overlooking the Missouri River, only military convicts, about 240 of them, 
their souls forever tainted by some dishonorable deed that made this 
Godforsaken place their final outpost. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the pristine national cemetery half a mile away, this place attracts few 
visitors; no flowers are laid on the unblessed ground. The small tombstones 
bear nothing more than a name and a date of death -- but that, 10 years ago, is 
what caught the attention of Army Sgt. Ken Knox, a corrections officers at the 
Disciplinary Barracks at Ft. Leavenworth, and began his obsession with one of 
the last untold stories of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Come here. Look at this," Knox said to his wife, Dianne, while biking around 
the post one Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Off to one side, separated from the other graves, were 14 tombstones, each with 
a German name, half inscribed with the same date, Aug. 25, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Knox's first thought was that they must have died in a bus accident, but he 
soon learned that he had stumbled onto the graves of the only prisoners of war 
ever executed in the United States, and, delving through archives and 
libraries, he found that many troubling ethical questions still remained over 
the circumstances of their hanging. 
</P>
<P>
From his second-floor office, he would look down on the prison courtyard and 
imagine Walter Beyer and Otto Stengel and the dozen other German sailors and 
soldiers, handcuffed, each escorted by an eight-man guard, walking to the 
makeshift gallows the fort had set up in the elevator shaft of an old 
warehouse. He could almost hear the Episcopal chaplain, John Sagar, reciting 
Psalm 130, the litany for the dying: "Out of the deep I have called unto thee, 
O Lord. Lord, hear my voice. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not contesting their guilt, only the injustice," says Knox, who now lives 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys just don't belong in that cemetery. They were honorable military 
men and, right or wrong, if Germany had won the war, they'd have been given a 
medal. They ought to be reinterred in Germany, in a place of respect. That's 
all I'm trying to accomplish. Besides, they were executed after the war was 
over, and that raises a lot of questions over whether they were the victims of 
a society's desire for revenge against all Germans." 
</P>
<P>
The 14 condemned men -- one of whom was a grocer in civilian life, one a 
pattern cutter, another an engineer -- were among 400,000 Germans held prisoner 
during World War II at 500 camps scattered across the United States. The German 
prisoners worked in the wheat fields of Kansas, stuffed olives with Spanish 
peppers in Texas, repaired Army vehicles in Virginia, sewed U.S. Army uniforms 
in Maryland, picked peas in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the war, aided by prison tailors who made them civilian clothes 
and artists who provided them with forged documents, Germans were escaping the 
camps at the rate of 100 a month, often melting into American society. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officers worked hard to recruit "snitches" among the newly 
arrived prisoners, and they put unsuspecting inmates in with them in bugged 
two-man cells. 
</P>
<P>
The information they gathered proved invaluable to the Allied war effort. One 
snitch, Johannes Kunze, passed on details of the camouflaging of Hamburg 
intended to mislead British bomber pilots -- the roof of the train station had 
been painted to resemble a highway, the lake had been covered over -- and 
others identified Nazi camp ringleaders and shared secrets about German U-boat 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 p.m. on Nov. 4, 1943, one of the German prisoners at Camp Gruber in 
Tankowa, Okla., Walter Beyer, a 30-year-old first sergeant captured in North 
Africa, ordered his company to assemble in the mess hall. Johannes Kunze was 
one of the last to enter. White-faced and perspiring, he took a seat at a table 
by the door. Beyer held up two notes in identical handwriting -- one unsigned, 
containing a brief description of Hamburg's camouflaging, the other a letter, 
signed by Kunze, to his wife in Leipzig. 
</P>
<P>
"Comrades," said Beyer, whose wife and 2-year-son, Edgar, lived in Hamburg. "I 
am sorry and it hurts me in my soul to be forced to tell you some sad news, and 
the case is so grave that I am not in a position to pass judgment myself. Bad 
as it may seem, we have a traitor in our midst." 
</P>
<P>
Beyer had hardly finished before someone shouted, "That's him! Don't let him 
get out!" and a score of men pounced on Kunze, who struggled wildly to escape 
the fists and feet of his tormentors. He died a short while later of a 
fractured skull and cerebral hemorrhaging. Beyer, court testimony later 
disclosed, did not participate in the beating. 
</P>
<P>
During the next five months, three other informers were murdered in unrelated 
incidents at POW camps in Florence, Ariz., Camp Chaffee, Ark., and Aiken, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
The killings led to lengthy investigations -- one of the suspects, Otto 
Stengel, confessed only after being forced to wear a gas mask stuffed with 
onions and garlic -- and eventually 14 Germans were sent off to Ft. Leavenworth 
to be hanged after being convicted in four separate courts-martial. 
</P>
<P>
Each contended that he had acted as would have any conscientious soldier. 
</P>
<P>
"I am no murderer," the grocer, Sgt. Erich Gauss, 32, told the court. "I merely 
fought for the honor of my fatherland and for respect as a soldier, and I 
believe that every decent German soldier would do likewise. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Germans' defense was based on the argument that their victims were traitors 
and prisoners of war were obligated to prevent treason against their homeland. 
To defend Beyer and the four others accused of killing Kunze, the government 
assigned, part time, Lt. Col. Alfred Petsch, who described himself as a country 
lawyer and farmer and who told a review board that he had "practically no 
experience in matters of this sort." The prosecutor was one of the Army's most 
respected lawyers, Lt. Col. Leon Jaworski, the eventual Watergate special 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Knox, whose father was a decorated aviator in Korea and who himself served 
in peacetime Korea and warring Vietnam, is retired from the military now after 
a 22-year career and works as a sandblaster at the Army Depot in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
He has collected 4,000 documents, many of them under the Freedom of Information 
Act, and has struggled to put together 159 pages of a book. Evening after 
evening he sits at his computer, sifting through testimony and declassified 
Army memos, wondering if he has overlooked some clue that would prove the 
injustice of the Germans' deaths. Friends say to him, "What are you doing with 
your Germans today?" but, he says, they aren't really interested in hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain why this thing has become so important to me, I really can't," 
Knox says, "but it's been like an ulcer. I keep thinking of the families in 
Germany who've been told their father or grandfather died as a criminal, when 
this wasn't the case at all. We'd consider Americans who did what they did 
heroes." 
</P>
<P>
The Germans lingered on Death Row in Ft. Leavenworth for a year. During that 
time, 15 of the 90,000 Americans being held prisoner on German soil were also 
sentenced to death, and Washington and Berlin began negotiating through Swiss 
intermediaries on a prisoner exchange. Both sides agreed not to execute anyone 
until the negotiations were complete. 
</P>
<P>
"No death sentence imposed on German prisoners of war in this country will be 
carried out," said a classified message from the assistant chief of staff to 
Ft. Leavenworth authorities on April 28, 1945, ". . . until further order from 
the personnel division." 
</P>
<P>
Nine days later, the war in Europe ended with the German surrender. The 15 
Americans sentenced to death were returned to the Allied command, and President 
Harry S. Truman signed the Germans' death warrants, despite the recommendation 
of a review board that the sentences be commuted to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Just past midnight, July 10, the first batch of five Germans prisoners, all 
former members of Rommel's famed Afrika Korps, were taken from their cells 
after a meal of stew, steamed rice and cake. 
</P>
<P>
It was 300 yards from Ft. Leavenworth's solitary-confinement wing, known as the 
Castle, to the warehouse gallows, and in bright moonlight, accompanied by a 
Catholic priest and an Episcopalian chaplain, the prisoners crossed the 
courtyard Sgt. Ken Knox would spend so many hours looking at years later. At 
their request, all wore their military uniforms. Sgt. Walter Beyer was the 
first to approach the American soldiers who waited by the noose. 
</P>
<P>
"The prisoner appeared none too robust and his cheeks were drawn," William H. 
Radford reported the next day in the Kansas City Star. "A black stubble, 
matching his hair, indicated that he had not shaved for at least 12 hours. His 
eyes were those of a trapped beast. They moved nervously from right to left. 
But he never turned his head or moved his chin from its jutting position. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"A noncommissioned officer standing beside him removed Beyer's cap and placed a 
black hood over his head. There was a brittle command, 'Right face, forward 
march,' and the Nazi pivoted on his right heel in rhythm with the bodyguard of 
soldiers that brought him into the building and stepped off the remaining 30 
feet to the gallows. His bearing was military to the last." 
</P>
<P>
Beyer's wife knew something was very wrong early that spring of 1945 because 
her husband's letters stopped. But it was a year before she learned that he was 
dead and several more before she learned the circumstances of his death. By 
then she could not afford a trip to the United States to claim the body. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still remember the moment Mother found out my father was dead," said 
Beyer's only child, Edgar, 49, the assistant manager of a Hamburg bank. "I was 
5 years old. She was cooking beans in the back yard when it came, a simple, 
open postcard. She read it and started to shake. She let out a wail that I will 
never forget. It must have lasted 5 to 10 minutes. I thought she was going to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
The postcard, Beyer recalled in a telephone interview, was cryptic: It was 
dated Aug. 2, 1946, and gave no details except for the fact and date of death. 
Eventually, it was followed by a death certificate and a note from the Red 
Cross stating no further information was available. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years Mrs. Beyer shared her secret with no one, and it was not 
until Edgar Beyer was about to marry that she sat him down and told him his 
father had been executed and was buried in a criminal's grave. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete shock," Beyer said. "I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago an aunt gave Edgar Beyer the equivalent of $4,000 for a trip to 
the United States on the condition that he visit all the family's relatives as 
well as his father's grave. He flew alone from New Orleans to Kansas City, 
drove to Ft. Leavenworth and met an Army officer who told him where the 
convicts' cemetery was. The gate was locked, so he climbed the chain-link fence 
and found his father's grave, the first one in the row of 14. The last time he 
had seen his father was Christmas Day, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, German and American military authorities have suggested that 
perhaps the prisoners' remains should be returned to lie in a German war 
cemetery. But while Germany was divided, the West Germany Embassy in Washington 
preferred that the matter not be raised at all, fearing that East Germany would 
use it to cause a rift in the Washington-Bonn alliance. 
</P>
<P>
None of the victims' families has tried to claim the bodies. Even Edgar Beyer 
isn't sure repatriation of the bodies is a good idea. "I'd need time to think 
about that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
So, Ken Knox in Sacramento keeps poring over his stacks of documents, calling 
newspapers and TV stations, hoping that someone will share his interest in 
righting the injustice he perceives. "There was some interest in first," he 
says, "but it died pretty quickly. What have I achieved in 10 years? Nothing, 
really. Just frustration. I guess I've reached my limit. I would need someone 
with more education and experience than I've got to get this done." 
</P>
<P>
A cold autumn wind whipped across the cemetery on Ft. Leavenworth's Hancock 
Hill one recent Sunday afternoon, murmuring through the leafless trees. It was 
Nov. 18, a day the Germans call Volkstravertag -- People's Remembrance Day -- 
and from the road five German soldiers wearing gray jackets, leather gloves and 
maroon berets approached the row of 14 tombstones, carrying a wreath of 
carnations. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Michael Hueber, a 27-year veteran and the son of a World War II 
paratrooper, came first, remembering on this day of memories the Allied air 
strike on his home in Kreuzuach that had killed his mother, his grandparents, 
an aunt and a nephew. With him, in military step, were four other Germans who 
are attached to the U.S. Army's Command General Staff college here. 
</P>
<P>
They placed the wreath between the tombstones of Pvt. Rudolf Sraub, the 
39-year-old pattern cutter, and Pvt. Helmut Fisher, a 22-year-old high school 
dropout. "We stand here," Hueber said, head bowed, "in front of the graves of 
young soldiers who died in meeting their given missions. They were just 
soldiers like you and me. 
</P>
<P>
"They died harder than their colleagues in combat because they realized that, 
in the end, they would die. But they died so that we could live in freedom, so 
that Germany could finally end 60 years of dictatorship. That is why the people 
of Germany pay them their respects today." 
</P>
<P>
Then with a salute, the Germans were gone, their steps rustling through the 
ground cover of dead leaves, and in the coming darkness the wreath and the 14 
headstones were hardly visible at all.

IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN A WHIFF TO PICK UP A SCENT; 
</P>
<P>
FRAGRANCE: WEAR A SPRITZ OF PERFUME FOR A DAY OR TWO BEFORE DECIDING IF IT'S 
RIGHT FOR YOU, ALFRED SUNG SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
Alfred Sung, the Canadian fashion designer-turned-perfume mogul, advises women 
to slow down and smell the flowers before buying their next bottle of 
fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a tester and wear the fragrance for a day or two," Sung suggests. "If the 
scent lasts all day and still smells good when you go to bed, then go back and 
buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Also, hold the bottle to see if it's comfortable. "Studies have shown that a 
woman won't use a fragrance if she doesn't like the way a bottle feels in her 
hand," says Sung, who recently introduced his second fragrance, Encore, at 
Bullock's Beverly Center. "Fragrance has traditionally been an impulse buy -- 
but you end up with a dresser full of scents you don't wear," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
While Sung was in the store, a man walked up to the Encore counter and bought 
70 bottles of the $40 eau de parfum, after taking little more than a whiff. 
"There's no explaining it," Sung says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
The heady tangerine and tuberose scent did $6,000 in sales the first day, even 
before the 70-bottle buyer came in, a Bullock's executive said. 
</P>
<P>
Encore is the follow-up to the 1986 scent Sung. Last year, before Christmas, 
the light blend of jasmine and gardenia ranked among the top five sellers in 
its price category. 
</P>
<P>
"Buying a fragrance should be like buying a piece of clothing -- it has to suit 
your personality," says the designer, whose Alfred Sung and Club Monaco 
clothing boutiques are scattered liberally throughout North America. The 
formula, he says, is utterly logical. "If you're quiet, don't buy a fragrance 
that's overpowering. You won't wear it. If you're the kind of person who wants 
to be noticed, get a strong scent and make a statement. But don't let the 
spritzer girls influence you in the stores. Test. Always test." PADDY CALISTRO

A STREET OF MANY CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of decades ago, when Rodeo Drive was just another street, it contained 
a coffee shop, a gas station and a hardware store, according to old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
These are long gone, of course, but even over the last decade or so, change has 
been constant on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the stores that were on Rodeo in the early 1980s have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Among stores that have moved on are Right Bank Clothing Co. and Tea Room, Mr. 
Guy, Gunn Trigere, Juschi, Elizabeth Arden and Kurt Geiger of Bond St. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Some failed and some were driven off by soaring rents, which now range from $75 
to $225 per square foot in the Two Rodeo/Via Rodeo development. 
</P>
<P>
Two Rodeo itself made perhaps the most dramatic recent change in the street. 
The 1.25-acre project, at the corner of Rodeo and Wilshire Boulevard, gobbled 
up a savings and loan office, an exotic-car dealership and a few boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
But, typical of Southern California, most of the site was a parking lot.

OKLAHOMA ARTIST FINDS FAME IN THE TRADITIONAL 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doc Tate Nevaquaya doesn't know what course his life might have taken if his 
cousins hadn't happened along while he was trying to hitchhike. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to Oklahoma City to join the Marine Corps," recalls Nevaquaya. 
"They bought me a ticket and put me on the bus for Lawrence, Kan., to enroll in 
a trade school. I had 35 cents in my pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed for Nevaquaya since then. He now is an internationally 
acclaimed artist whose work includes designing a shield on the Tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. He also sold a painting to 
England's Queen Elizabeth II for about $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
Nevaquaya paints in the traditional two-dimensional Indian style, which often 
has the main object or feature outlined. Some work is a flat dimension, 
resulting in a semi-abstract work. His canvas, "Native American Church," 
depicts 16 figures involved in religious ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Nevaquaya's paintings range in price from $500 to $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his work is done in watercolor. "I feel that most closely depicts the 
effects of the earth pigments," Nevaquaya says. 
</P>
<P>
The hitchhiking incident isn't the only time that a seemingly minor event 
played a part in changing the artist's life. 
</P>
<P>
"I first heard the Indian flute about 1939, when I was 7," Nevaquaya says. "I 
thought it was so beautiful, but even then it was dying out. I decided that 
someday I would learn to play the flute." 
</P>
<P>
It was a concern of trying to preserve a part of his Indian heritage that was 
rapidly disappearing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But other pursuits became paramount until 1947, when Nevaquaya bought a 
suitcase at a pawnshop. "There was an old metal whistle in the suitcase, 
similar to the flute. I experimented with it and decided then I would learn how 
to make flutes and play the flute." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Nevaquaya received a $5,000 National Heritage Fellowship from the 
National Endowment for the Arts for preserving and developing a renewed 
interest in the Indian flute. The citation hailed him for being "one of the few 
remaining artists" to link past generations with the future. 
</P>
<P>
Nevaquaya also has been the subject of television documentaries, has appeared 
with country music star Roy Clark, has played at the Kennedy Center for 
Performing Arts in Washington, and appeared on British television while on a 
goodwill tour sponsored by the State Department and the Smithsonian 
Institution. He has appeared in concerts or lectures in Europe and the Far 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Nevaquaya has taken the Grand Award for his paintings at various art shows, 
including exhibitions in Chicago and Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was a time when the future didn't look all that bright. 
</P>
<P>
Nevaquaya, formally Joyce Lee Tate Nevaquaya, was orphaned when he was 13. He 
lived for a time with an older brother in the Apache-Fletcher area of rural 
southern Oklahoma. Both the nickname "Doc" and the "Joyce" are in honor of Dr. 
C.W. Joyce, a physician for whom many Indian children in the Fletcher area were 
named. 
</P>
<P>
It was while he was living with his brother that he started the fateful trip to 
Oklahoma City to enlist in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just started hitchhiking when my cousins picked me up," Nevaquaya says. 
"If they hadn't come by, within a few minutes my whole life might have been 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
Nevaquaya says his brother didn't know where he was or where he had gone until 
he wrote him a letter from the trade school, which now is Haskell Indian Junior 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nevaquaya says he painted and sketched in the 1940s, he stayed away 
from the art classes while attending the Ft. Sill Indian School because he did 
not like the policy that discouraged all painting except portrayals of 
traditional Indian culture. 
</P>
<P>
His interest in art was honed by the fact that an early neighbor had been Allan 
Houser, a painter who now is an acclaimed sculptor. He later met and became 
friends with artist Black Moon Riddles. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sold a few of his paintings in the early 1950s, he painted and 
sketched in his spare time while holding down a job. Then, in 1955, Doris 
Littrell of Oklahoma City sought him out after seeing some of his work at the 
Southern Plains Indian Museum in Anadarko. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, Nevaquaya made art his vocation. 
</P>
<P>
Nevaquaya is in demand for his expertise with the Indian flute as are his 
paintings. He frequently holds workshops and has taught his sons -- he has 
five, along with four daughters -- to play the flute.

The partially clothed body of an unidentified woman was found this morning at a 
construction site at Jamboree Road and Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin police said the woman's body, which was naked from the waist down, was 
found near three large earthmovers at about 6:20 a.m. by workers who were 
arriving at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the morning, detectives were searching the area for clues, including 
tire tracks in the dirt lot, where a business park is being built. 
</P>
<P>
Police speculate that the woman may have died somewhere else and then been 
thrown from a car.

Americans who have been living off canned tuna and rice at the U.S. Embassy in 
Kuwait have received fruit, vegetables and a case of cigarettes from the 
Iraqis, President Bush disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Iraqis who showed up with the goods Thursday said they would return 
with a second delivery, including soft drinks, on Saturday, Bush said during 
televised remarks on the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the Iraqis also told the Americans to make a list of medical supplies 
they need. 
</P>
<P>
He called the Iraqis' move an "interesting development" but noted that 
electricity is still cut off at the American Embassy compound in Iraq-occupied 
Kuwait, where eight U.S. diplomats and 19 private citizens are holding out. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be a positive sign, but it's so far short of compliance with 
international law that I can't be rejoicing," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who said he had received the report of the delivery this morning, said he 
had been asked what would happen if the Iraqis provoked him regarding the 
Americans still holding out at the U.S. outpost. 
</P>
<P>
"Consider me provoked when I see Americans without proper food and medical 
equipment," he said.

A Roman Catholic nun won a $13,000, fire-engine-red sports car in a raffle to 
benefit her school.

Sister Rebecca Berghoff, 65, said she was aghast when she was declared the 
winner in the raffle for the St. Joseph-Marquette School, where she is 
principal. 
</P>

She said she bought 30 $1 tickets for Saturday's drawing. About 32,000 tickets 
were sold for the school, which has 300 pupils in kindergarten through eighth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
She returned the Geo Storm to the dealer and said the refund will help ease the 
school's budget problems.

<P>
Besides, she said, it wasn't appropriate "for a nun to be streaking around in a

Law enforcement officials have warned five prominent New Yorkers that their 
names were found on a list kept by the man accused of killing radical Zionist 
Meir Kahane, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), two federal judges, a former assistant U.S. 
attorney and a columnist for the weekly Jewish Press were on the list, Newsday 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those on the list found in El Sayyid A. Nosair's Cliffside Park, N.J., 
home were involved in the extradition from Venezuela through Brooklyn of 
terrorist suspect Abdul Atta, a Muslim linked to a terrorist group, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither police nor the FBI would comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials have said they believe that Nosair acted alone when he gunned 
down Kahane during a Nov. 5 conference in New York City but are still trying to 
determine if he was backed by a terrorist group.

BUSH MEETS WITH CHINA ENVOY; MAY SIGNAL THAW

<P>
President Bush met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today in a move 
that seemed designed to end Beijing's international isolation since its 1989 
military crackdown on a pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed a day of confusion in which the State Department first 
announced that the meeting would take place and then denied it, saying only 
that Secretary of State James A. Baker III would meet Qian. 
</P>
<P>
A senior official said Bush decided on the meeting this morning, despite 
Washington's disappointment that China had abstained on a U.N. Security Council 
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq if it does not withdraw 
from Kuwait by Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was hoping for Chinese support for the resolution, which was 
adopted 12 to 2. But China did withhold its veto, allowing the resolution to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Western nations suspended senior official contacts with Beijing and shut off 
government loans and military cooperation after the army's bloody crackdown 
around Tian An Men Square in the Chinese capital last year, when hundreds, 
perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed. 
</P>
<P>
But Beijing has slowly been edging back into the international community. At 
last July's Houston economic summit, Japan said it intended to resume loans to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Only a month after the 1989 crackdown, Bush signaled his intention of 
maintaining a high-level dialogue with China by dispatching National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft on a secret mission to Beijing. 
</P>

When Scowcroft went there again in December, 1989, the news caused a storm of 
criticism, with many in Congress accusing Bush of disregarding China's human 
rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
He also courted criticism by maintaining China's most-favored-nation trading 
status last summer. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision to meet Qian will be seen as the most powerful signal yet that 
the United States is ready to welcome China back as a full member of the 
international community. 
</P>
<P>
A high-level Chinese official, Vice Trade Minister Gu Yongjiang, has also been 
invited to hold trade talks in the United States on Dec. 10-11 with Commerce 
Undersecretary J. Michael Farren.

The United States should continue "our present defensive position" in Saudi 
Arabia rather than wage war with Iraq, a former top-ranking intelligence 
official told Congress today. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, who headed the National Security Agency 
during the Reagan Administration, said he had "no doubt that we could win" an 
offensive action against Saddam Hussein's forces. 
</P>
<P>
But Odom said attacking Iraqi forces in Kuwait -- or Iraq itself -- could mean 
an even longer U.S. military presence in the region than envisioned with the 
defensive posture now established. 
</P>
<P>
Odom's testimony came at the end of a week in which members of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee heard an array of witnesses, including two former chairmen 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urge caution on the Bush Administration as it 
seeks to end Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single witness we've had here with differing views on other things, all 
of them have felt we've over-deployed," committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
said at the conclusion of today's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Odom stressed in his testimony that he supports the Administration's buildup in 
the Persian Gulf but is bewildered by its apparent impatience with the results 
to date. 
</P>
<P>
"I am puzzled by the Administration's failure to take the credit for its 
success on this slow route to its objectives," said Odom, joining others in 
urging more time for economic sanctions to work.

SOYUZ TO LIFT OFF AFTER WORD FROM SPONSOR

A Soyuz rocket plastered with Japanese advertising was rolled into position 
today to carry a Japanese broadcaster into space Sunday after a truce was 
reached on money squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Broadcasting System, which is paying $10 million for the launch in a 
contract with the Glavkosmos space agency, complained that the Soviets were 
demanding huge sums of extra money for everything from spacesuits to $10,000 an 
hour for Soviet cosmonauts to hold a video camera during the eight-day mission. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not settled yet, but because the launch is so important to us and to the 
Soviets, we have stopped the negotiations and will return to them later, after 
the launch," said Ichiro Sasasi, a TBS executive. 
</P>
<P>
By tradition, all Soviet rockets leave for the launch pad at 7 a.m., because 
that is when Yuri Gagarin's Vostok rocket rolled out to make him the first man 
in space on April 12, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
And precisely at 7 a.m. today, the Soyuz rocket that will make Toyohiro Akiyamo 
the first journalist in space left its assembly plant on a rail line leading to 
launch pad No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Truck-mounted projector lights sliced through the morning darkness and lighted 
up the Soyuz as some of about 150 Japanese journalists scrambled to the rail 
bed to snap pictures of the booster emblazoned with advertisements for Sony, 
Ohtsuka Chemicals and Unicharm, makers of women's hygiene products. 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama, 48, will be accompanied to the Mir space station by two seasoned 
Soviet cosmonauts -- Musa Manarov, a joint holder of the record of 366 days in 
space, and Viktor Afanasiev. 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama's backup, Rioko Kikuchi, 26, the TBS network's first female camera 
operator, suffered appendicitis Monday and was operated on, increasing the 
pressure on Akiyama to stay healthy.

Fire swept through the Brussels stock exchange early today, causing extensive 
damage to the ornate 19th-Century building but no injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said smoke was billowing out of broken windows two hours after the 
fire started at around 6 a.m., apparently after an electrical main junction box 
blew up. 
</P>
<P>
The Belgian news agency Belga quoted a fire spokesman as saying the exchange 
would remain closed all day. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the trading floor and brokers' offices had been seriously damaged. 
Electricity supplies to the building, built in the 1870s and housing several 
works by 19th-Century French sculptor Auguste Rodin, had been cut as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers' computer terminals melted in the fire, but the main computer, which is 
in the cellar, appeared to be undamaged.

With more money in their pockets and more leisure time, Japanese are traveling 
abroad in record numbers, and the United States is the most popular tourist 
spot, the Japan National Tourist Organization said today. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of November, 10 million Japanese had already traveled abroad, which 
was more than the 9.66 million for all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
JNTO said the 1990 number could reach 11 million, with as much as $32.4 billion 
spent on overseas travel, including air fares. 
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese overseas travelers jumped 13.5% to 8.32 million from 
last January to September, up from 7.33 million in the same period a year ago, 
the tourist group said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese are expected to spend about $10 billion in the United States this 
year.

Oregon State basketball Coach Jim Anderson wants the NCAA to rescind a penalty 
levied against the Beavers, citing the NCAA compromise reached with UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA found in 1982 that some Oregon State players violated rules at a 
regional tournament in Provo, Utah, by exchanging game tickets for merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State was forced to return the money it made from the tournament, 
believed to be in excess of $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought from our case, from several years ago, they (NCAA) were pretty 
severe, but we really didn't have any ground to stand on," Anderson said. 
"Maybe now a lot of schools should go back and ask for the same courtesy 
extended to Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he was shocked by the compromise that allows the UNLV Runnin' 
Rebels to defend their national title. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel there's been pressure applied and that from the pressure, they've 
(NCAA) buckled under," Anderson said.

Greg Norman got the first double-eagle of his career today, holing out from 279 
yards with a three-wood, en route to a 4-under-par 68 that gave him a 
two-stroke lead after two rounds of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, whose 3-under par effort came on the fifth hole, also chipped in from 
25 yards for an eagle on No. 15. He had a 36-hole total of 138. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Maggert of the United States and Australians Brett Ogle and Peter Lonard 
were tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
Maggert and Ogle had 69s today on the 7,080-yard The Australian Club course. 
Lonard had a 70. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good," Norman said. "I had a good night's rest and my concentration 
wasn't clicking on and off. I've got no reason to be uptight about anything. I 
guess holing a 279-yard shot with a three-wood would make anyone feel pretty 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you do something for the first time, it feels wonderful. I saw it go 
in -- it was a perfect shot. The ball never left the line of the flag and 
rolled in like a putt." 
</P>
<P>
Norman also had a birdie and two bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
Vijay Singh of Fiji, who shared the first-round lead with Chris Gray of 
Australia, shot a 72 to fall three shots behind Norman. Gray slumped to 147 
after a round of 78. 
</P>
<P>
British Open and Masters champion Nick Faldo had a 70 and was six shots off the 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
"If I play well on the weekend, don't make any mistakes and make a few more 
birdies, I'll be up there," Faldo said. 
</P>
<P>
Maggert birdied four of the first eight holes but went on to bogey three holes 
while adding two more birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Ogle, who won the Australian PGA championship last week, putted superbly for 
five birdies and two bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm swinging well and I'm comfortable out there," Ogle said.

Having been told so much, Ty Detmer finally decided last Saturday that he must 
see this Rocket fellow for himself. So on a free night, in the hours after 
throwing for another few million yards in the afternoon, he sat in his rented 
house in Orem, Utah, and watched Notre Dame play USC on television. 
</P>
<P>
What he saw was the final act in an autumn-long curiosity. Notre Dame's Raghib 
(Rocket) Ismail was involved in 15 plays and, save two, was ineffective. But 
those two, both in the fourth quarter, totaled 80 yards and were spectacular. 
The whole thing baffled Detmer, like it has baffled others. "He's an exciting 
player," Detmer said. "Doesn't touch the ball very often, though." 
</P>
<P>
He cuts deftly, if unintentionally, to the root of the dilemma that will be 
resolved when the 56th Heisman Trophy is awarded Saturday at the Downtown 
Athletic Club. The field of a dozen or so is realistically whittled to two: a 
quarterback who loosed a blizzard of statistics and an all-purpose offensive 
player who accounted for only six touchdowns but whose on-field presence was 
cause for a collective breathlessness. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer and Ismail are among five finalists and the only two given a real chance 
of winning the Heisman, awarded to the player judged the best in college 
football. The other finalists are tailback Eric Bieniemy of Colorado and 
quarterbacks David Klingler of Houston and Shawn Moore of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The 917 Heisman voters (870 media members and 47 former Heisman winners) have a 
clear choice. A vote for Detmer is a vote for pure production. A vote for 
Ismail is a vote for fleeting thrills -- his long-distance touchdowns and the 
anxious moment that prefaces his every act. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer, with a season to play, already holds fistfuls of prominent NCAA records 
(single-season passing yardage) and obscure ones (most games of more than 300 
yards passing). 
</P>
<P>
Ismail shares only one (two kickoff returns for touchdowns in a game, in '89 
vs. Michigan). They keep no records for potential excitement unrealized. 
</P>
<P>
"As to who is more exciting, I guess that's all in what people perceive is 
exciting," Brigham Young Coach LaVell Edwards said. "I think we depend on Ty 
Detmer a lot more than they depend on Rocket Ismail." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe not. Notre Dame lost only two games: to Stanford when Ismail 
was in on only one play and to Penn State, when Ismail sat out the second half 
with a thigh injury and the Nittany Lions rallied from a 21-7 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining finalists, Moore is twice handicapped, by Virginia's three 
late-season losses and by a thumb injury, which caused him to miss the 
Cavaliers' last regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler has passed for 4,424 yards in Houston's high-tech offense, but a big 
loss to Texas (the Cougars' only credible opponent) and 11 rub-it-in touchdown 
passes against Division I-AA Eastern Washington killed his chances. 
</P>
<P>
Bieniemy rushed for 1,628 yards in 11 games and scored 17 touchdowns. He also 
missed the first game because of a suspension and benefits not at all from the 
scandal of Colorado's fifth-down win at Missouri.

LIZ SMITH: SARANDON TO DON APRON AGAIN FOR 'THELMA AND LOUISE'

SUSAN SARANDON has again put on her apron for the upcoming film "Thelma and 
Louise." She'll play opposite Academy Award-winner Geena ("The Accidental 
Tourist") Davis. Sarandon is a lunch counter waitress, Davis a housewife in 
Ridley Scott's MGM/Pathe thriller. 
</P>
<P>
Susan's gritty and sexy performance as a hamburger-handler in the movie "White 
Palace" may see her vying for an Oscar in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
By the by, the little diner in the movie has already become a popular St. Louis 
eatery. Universal spruced it up from its original state for the movie, and the 
owners changed its name from The Super Sandwich Shop to The White Palace. 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD'S ALL aflutter. Mr. Blackwell, infamous for his wounding 
worst-dressed list of celebrities, has been handpicked to become the Beverly 
Hills Post newspaper's new gossip guru. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to deal with his subjects in an even more caustic manner than he 
deals with his fashion victims. Mr. Blackwell himself says: "We must warn you 
that this column could be habit-forming and slightly dangerous to your nerves." 
</P>
<P>
TONIGHT, when Elizabeth Taylor speaks at the AIDS Masquerade Ball at the 
Waldorf in New York, some of her remarks will be in tribute to the late Malcolm 
Forbes. He was her good friend and escort to last year's Masquerade and donated 
millions of dollars to the fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
MANY WILL recall Chicago aviation heir Michael Butler. He was on the verge of 
going bust back in the '60s when he invested what was left of his inheritance 
in a hippie musical called "Hair." The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
But now Michael, who cut a wide path through the International Set, is said to 
be down to his last couple of thousand bucks. He is 64 years old and has, in 
his time, been wed to at least three women -- one of whom, Robyn, is now 
married to millionaire banker Rupert Hambro.

Author Garrison Keillor has an English class at the University of North Dakota 
to thank for spotting a discrepancy in one of his stories published in New 
Yorker magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Keillor thanked the class with a box full of his books and tapes of his radio 
show, and a letter inviting the class to dinner, his manager, Jennifer Howe, 
said Thursday from New York. 
</P>
<P>
Lecturer Lisa Lewis-Spicer's class wrote a letter two weeks ago asking Keillor 
to explain why a family suddenly grew from three to four kids in "Zeus the 
Lutheran," a story that ran in the Oct. 29 issue. 
</P>
<P>
He responded in a letter with the box of gifts that they should be commended 
for their close reading of his story, Lewis-Spicer said.

A scene in "Die Hard 2" in which Bruce Willis takes a power drill to an airport 
air duct ended up on the cutting-room floor, and now 20th Century Fox could end 
up in court. 
</P>
<P>
Black &amp; Decker Inc. has filed suit in federal court in Baltimore, accusing 
the filmmaker and the marketing firm Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam of failing to 
fulfill a promise that one of its drills would be featured in the film. 
</P>
<P>
Black &amp; Decker said in court papers filed Nov. 7 that it had planned an ad 
campaign based on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The company is seeking at least $150,000. It accused Fox, the film's 
distributor, and Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam of negligence and breach of 
contract.
