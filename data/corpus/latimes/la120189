WOLFGANG OTTO; ACQUITTED OF DEATH CAMP KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wolfgang Otto, 78, a former Nazi SS sergeant suspected of the 1944 death camp 
execution of German communist leader Ernst Thaelmann. In 1986, Otto was found 
guilty of complicity in the shooting death of Thaelmann at Buchenwald. 
Thaelmann had been imprisoned when the Nazis took power in 1933. Otto was 
sentenced to four years in prison but remained free pending an appeal. 
Prosecutors had argued that Adolf Hitler had personally ordered Thaelmann's 
execution and that Otto carried out the order, which Otto denied. The case was 
appealed to West Germany's Supreme Court, which overturned the verdict because 
of a legal error. Two years later, Otto was retried and acquitted of the murder 
charge by a state court which said there was insufficient evidence. On Sunday 
in Frankfurt, West Germany, of undisclosed causes.

LYNN BARI; SULTRY STAR OF MANY FILMS IN 1930S, '40S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynn Bari, the husky-voiced siren who starred in dozens of films of the 1930s 
and '40s, usually as "the other woman" in low-budget pictures for 20th 
Century-Fox, has died in Goleta, it was learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Daily Variety, the entertainment newspaper, said she died Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Goleta Valley Community Hospital confirmed Miss Bari's death 
of cardiac arrest and said she had listed her age as 69. But several film 
anthologies show she was born in either 1913 or 1915. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever her age, she came to pictures as a youthful chorine after moving to 
Los Angeles with her minister-stepfather from Boston, where she was raised. 
</P>
<P>
Statuesque and darkly beautiful, she was first seen in "Dancing Lady," a 1933 
musical in which a young Broadway dancer named Fred Astaire also made his film 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
She was born Marjorie Fisher in Roanoke, Va., but after taking acting lessons 
here she changed her name. She said in a long-ago interview she had devised 
"Lynn Bari" by combining the names of actress Lynn Fontanne and author Sir 
James M. Barrie. 
</P>
<P>
After appearing in such now-forgotten pictures as "Stand Up and Cheer," "Thanks 
a Million," "Sing Baby Sing" and "Return of the Cisco Kid," Fox ballyhooed her 
as a future star in 1940, giving her a long-term contract along with such other 
young hopefuls as Linda Darnell, Gene Tierney, Cobina Wright Jr. and Mary Beth 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of her pictures improved for a time and she was cast in two 
musicals featuring the legendary Glenn Miller band, "Sun Valley Serenade" and 
"Orchestra Wives." But with the exception of "The Bridge of San Luis Rey" in 
1944, she was never again featured in the quality parts she sought. 
</P>
<P>
She told Times drama editor Edwin Schallert in 1944 that she felt she was 
consigned to perfunctory roles because ". . . I worked in so many melodramas" 
and ". . . acquired a certain rugged experience and technique in 
cops-and-robbers films." 
</P>
<P>
Until 1968, when she made her final picture, "The Young Runaways," she 
continued to portray slinky villains or secondary leads in "China Girl," "Home 
Sweet Homicide," "I'd Climb the Highest Mountain," "Has Anybody Seen My Gal" 
and several more. 
</P>
<P>
Still lithe and slim into the late 1960s, she tried a brief stage career after 
receiving complimentary reviews in an extensive tour as "The Gingerbread Lady" 
and as a star of "Barefoot in the Park," but then retired to the Santa Barbara 
area near her son John. 
</P>
<P>
He had been the subject of a stormy custody fight between Miss Bari and her 
second husband, Sid Luft, who later married Judy Garland. Her first husband was 
Walter Kane, an agent, and her third was Dr. Nathan Rickles, a Beverly Hills 
psychiatrist. She worked for a time as his nurse. They divorced in 1972 after 
17 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Daily Variety reported that her ashes were scattered at sea.

DOROTHY STEBBINS BOWLES; WIFE OF LATE DIPLOMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorothy Stebbins Bowles, 86, who gained an international reputation as an 
independent-minded diplomat during her late husband's tours as U.S. ambassador 
to India. Chester Bowles, was a principal foreign policy adviser to President 
John F. Kennedy and served as ambassador to India twice, first from 1951 to 
1958, then from 1963 to 1969. Known as "Steb," Mrs. Bowles was an advocate of 
international peace, a down-to-earth emissary who invited Indian students, 
artists and musicians to the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi and became widely known 
in India. She delighted in Indian culture and raised eyebrows among other 
Americans when she began to wear a sari, the traditional, wrap-around Indian 
dress. She continued wearing a sari after returning to Connecticut, and wore 
one to her husband's funeral in 1986. On Tuesday in Essex, Conn.

MASS-KILLER KRAFT FLOWN TO DEATH ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A solemn Randy Steven Kraft, convicted of killing 16 young men in Orange 
County, was delivered Thursday by Orange County sheriff's deputies to Death Row 
at San Quentin state prison. 
</P>
<P>
A day after being sentenced to die in the gas chamber, Kraft was flown from 
Orange County to the Northern California facility in a private aircraft owned 
by a reserve Sheriff's Department aero-squadron member. 
</P>
<P>
During the hourlong flight, Kraft was "quiet and subdued," Orange County 
Sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not talk to the deputies during the flight and there were no incidents 
or problems," said Olson, adding that Kraft was formally handed over to state 
authorities upon his arrival at San Quentin about 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin issued the death sentence 
to Kraft on Wednesday more than six months after a jury found the 44-year-old 
former Long Beach computer consultant guilty of killing 16 men over a 12-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's trial lasted more than 13 months, and experts say the process of 
appealing the death penalty case could take as long as 10 years. Kraft has been 
in custody since he was arrested with a dead man in his car on Interstate 5 in 
Mission Viejo in May, 1983.

QUAKES AND SIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "We Need a Meter to Gauge the Richter Scale of Sin," by Brent R. 
Pitman, California Commentary, Nov. 13: 
</P>
<P>
For Billy Graham to implicate the earthquake with sin is unbelievable. What an 
insult to the people of Santa Cruz and Watsonville. "If there were no sin in 
the world, he said, there would be no earthquake and no suffering." I agree 
that if there were no sin, there would be no suffering for the simple reason 
there would be no people. There would still be earthquakes but the results 
would be academic. 
</P>
<P>
For the good reverend's information, there is no sin on the moon because there 
are no people. However, the moon still records about 8 moonquakes every day, 
some 3,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Makes one wonder about these so-called men of the cloth who claim to engage in 
a daily dialogue with God.

MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Iacocca is right on target (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 21) when he deplores American 
corporate management's obsession with short-term profits at the expense of 
long-range goals. 
</P>
<P>
But his solution to this problem is out to lunch. If Iacocca's management 
cannot see the benefits of long-term commitment to building up the industrial 
base and to capturing a solid market share without Uncle Sam providing bribes 
in the form of special tax benefits, there isn't much hope. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the real solution is to curtail tying management compensation to last 
year's profits, and to provide private incentives to pursuing long-term 
performance. The function of taxes should be primarily the raising of revenue 
for the government, not providing incentives to good management which is 
something good managers should be doing on their own. If they won't do that, 
they shouldn't complain.

UNIONS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that President Bush has awarded the Medal of Freedom to Solidarity union 
leader Lech Walesa maybe Bush and the radical right will stop bashing unions in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years the Reagan-Bush Administration praised the Solidarity union as 
fighting for freedom and rights of the workingman, while for the same eight 
years the same Administration destroyed the air controllers union, packed the 
National Labor Relations Board with anti-union (anti-worker) appointees, and 
made many other attacks on organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
The blue-collar union member was the backbone of this country because he was 
the middle-class. As the unions and blue-collar jobs decline so does our 
standard of living and our country.

S&amp;L REGULATOR SHOULD GO -- NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
M. Danny Wall continues to resist leaving his job as the top federal savings 
and loan regulator. This shows an insensitivity to public responsibility about 
on a par with his inept administration of the industry. Clearly the time has 
come for President Bush to usher him to his office door. 
</P>
<P>
Wall has justified remaining in office on the grounds that he is innocent and 
wants an opportunity to refute evidence to the contrary. He may well be right 
in arguing that there is no evidence of criminal activity. But the basic issue 
is competence. The collapse of the thrift industry and his own failure to 
intervene promptly in the $2-billion Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal bear 
witness to that lack of competence. 
</P>
<P>
Many others bear responsibility, too, of course. The investigations are only 
beginning, both on issues of criminal activity within the industry and on 
issues of ethics, including the eyebrow-raising intervention of the five U.S. 
senators who apparently sought regulation-bending on behalf of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the only thing that's totally clear at this point is that Americans 
will be paying something on the order of $200 billion for the bailout over the 
next few years, a burden that translates into thousands of dollars for each 
taxpayer.

TOWARD A GRAND SETTLEMENT -- NOW; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: AMERICA CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE THE CHIEF ARCHITECT OF A NEW SECURITY 
SYSTEM FOR THE CONTINENT, BUT IT MUST DO MORE THAN REACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICHARD J. BARNET, Richard J. Barnet is senior fellow at the Institute for 
Policy Studies. His latest book, The Rockets' Glare, will be published in 
January by Simon and Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 45 years, the opportunity is now at hand to write a peace treaty to bring 
World War II to an end. 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact has collapsed. Mikhail Gorbachev has given a clear signal to 
the regimes of Eastern Europe that Soviet tanks will not save them. The 
collapse of communist rule throughout the Soviet European security shield, so 
long feared in the West as the spark that could start World War III, has 
finally prompted the United States to downgrade the military threat in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
This extraordinary moment makes a political settlement in Europe both possible 
and urgent. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has been attacked for the limp rhetoric with which he has 
greeted mamy of the changes in Eastern Europe. What is needed, however, is not 
grandstanding at the Brandenburg Gate. It is a set of clearly articulated U.S. 
goals and strategies for a world undergoing dizzying transformation. 
Administration officials fear that an active rather than a reactive foreign 
policy increases the risk of costly mistakes. But the failure to push a new 
security arrangement in Europe when one is so clearly needed is much more 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented conjunction of forces and events offers not only the chance 
to write an end to a long, sad chapter of human history; it also imposes an 
obligation to put into place the pillars of a new international system to take 
the place of the one created by American initiatives 40 years ago. The changes 
are so great and they are coming so fast that nothing short of the grand 
settlement envisaged by Winston Churchill in the 1950s offers the hope of a 
stable security arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the 1940s situation, the United States is not in control of the action. 
Two weeks ago the European Community held a summit to plan reactions to the 
drama unfolding in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev is busily establishing new 
relationships with the other players in the West, and it should not be assumed 
that these relationships depend on his personal survival. This country cannot 
and should not be the chief architect of the new European security system, but 
it must do more than react. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, like all the other players, is unprepared. There are file 
drawers of contingency plans in the Pentagon for fighting all sorts of wars 
that can never be fought, but the White House clearly had no contingency plans 
for a Cold War victory. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly there is talk of cutting more than $180 billion from the defense 
budget over the next few years and accelerating the pace of troop reductions in 
Europe. But there are no plans for easing the conversion of military production 
to peaceful purposes, or for using a desperately needed peace dividend to 
address the underlying causes of America's deepening domestic problems. It has 
been more than a year since George Bush was elected, but his Bush 
Administration has not yet articulated either a set of post-Cold War goals or a 
strategy for achieving them. In the grip of unshakable Cold War assumptions 
about the limits of change under communism, the Administration has been 
displaying astonishment and calling it prudence. 
</P>
<P>
The German Problem is now ripe for solution. But the only one that can work is 
to encourage a political process leading to greater German unity within a 
progressively more united Europe. The United States can neither prevent 
reunification nor orchestrate the range of possible new relationships between 
the Germanys. But it can put its authority as a World War II victor and its 
still-considerable weight in world affairs behind flexible security plans that 
will give the two Germanys time to evolve a new relationship without 
precipitating severe economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The great contribution the United States can make is to push much faster for a 
radical reduction of military forces across the Continent. Peace can be built 
only on a NATO-Warsaw Pact consensus that, for the first time in 55 years, 
Europe faces no danger of war. Especially now, none of the nations on either 
side of the line can afford the charade of endless, mindless war preparation. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the time for grudging cutbacks in the military budget but for 
fundamental rethinking concerning the goals and missions of U.S. military 
forces in a world where the threat of war in Europe is no longer credible and 
the costly maintenance of military forces to fight communism around the world, 
most of which we dare not use, has become the modern day Maginot Line.

EAST EUROPE: THE SOVIETS AND THEIR BLOC NEIGHBORS ARE MOVING INTO A NEW SYSTEM 
-- BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush were scheduling their Malta summit a few 
months ago, the two leaders could not foresee that their dialogue would begin 
when almost all of Eastern Europe, with the exception of Romania and Albania, 
was in a state of total upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
The chain reaction of the reshuffling in the political leaderships and change 
in the political structures are so sweeping that no one can predict when and 
where they will end. Only one thing is clear: The East has changed, and so have 
specific and important vectors of world politics. 
</P>
<P>
These changes are real and irreversible. They have demonstrated to the West and 
to the world community that the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, Hungary, 
Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia are busy shaping new priorities in their internal 
and foreign policies. In short, the East European community is adjusting its 
movement to the new system of internal and external coordinates. 
</P>
<P>
But this means that a similar system of coordinates need to be defined for 
East-West relations. The one used now has many reference points marked in the 
Cold War period. 
</P>
<P>
In a new system, both sides will have to determine which of their estimates and 
expectations concerning changes in the East are the same and which are 
different. But even if differences remain, they should not be allowed to 
destabilize the situation. For instance, the future of the two German states 
should be approached with special caution, as it is a problem facing all of 
Europe. And each of the points in common should promote new forms of East-West 
cooperation, particularly economic, for this sphere has the largest number of 
detonators for instability in the East. 
</P>
<P>
We recognize that there are quite a few people in the West who prefer to stay 
on the sidelines, or openly oppose new forms of cooperation with the East. One 
should be cautious, they say, and not help the Soviets restore their ability to 
threaten the West or interfere in the affairs of their fraternal states. 
</P>
<P>
I think the ongoing developments have cut the ground from under their feet. 
However high the emotions may run from Budapest to Warsaw, not a single Soviet 
soldier has made a move. If any, the movement will be homeward. The Brezhnev 
Doctrine is dead -- not only because the drive for reform has assumed such 
proportions in the Soviet Union's allied states, but primarily because the 
Soviet Union itself was the first to step over the dead dogmas and move toward 
restructuring and renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Off the coast of Malta, George Bush will face the "chief troublemaker," the 
person who was at the onset of the change. I think Bush will find out from what 
angle to view the Soviet Union in future dealings. I am sure he would choose a 
changing Soviet Union. But will he be able to treat the Soviet Union as a 
partner and not as a rival? 
</P>
<P>
What Europe really needs is new approaches to the alignment of forces in 
nuclear and conventional armaments, the recognition that the old doctrines and 
armament levels are a wasteful and inadmissible luxury, as well as 
encouragement of the efforts to lower the level of military confrontation. 
Neither the Soviet Union nor the United States will lose anything. They can 
only gain if they find a way to accelerate the Vienna talks. The Soviet Union 
has made a series of unilateral steps promoting the arms-reduction process. If 
Bush declares his readiness to make meaningful cuts in the U.S. military 
contingent in Europe, the new system of coordinates stands a good chance of 
being shaped. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, in a changeable time like ours, it would be unwise to fall into 
euphoria. The chances of raising mutual understanding to a new level are good, 
but there is a tight knot of problems still to be untangled. Among them is 
Afghanistan and Washington's stubborn support for the irreconcilable 
opposition. Soviet-American relations still carries vestiges inherited from the 
"second Cold War" of 1980-84. Yet the five years of restructuring in the Soviet 
Union have seen examples of compromise solutions that, if applied toward the 
United States, would give a new impetus to the settlement of regional problems.

The nation's name in English is The Savior. Its capital is Holy Savior. At the

that may well shine the last light visible on the mountain after curfew.

On Sunday last, Maryknoll Father Ronald Hennessey distributed Communion in 
Cristo Salvador parish to the smallest and uneasiest congregation he had lately 
seen. Father Hennessey had left on the floor the litter of hymn sheets and 
mimeographed images of murdered churchpersons where the soldiers had thrown 
them on the Saturday night a week before, when they had commandeered the keys, 
then chose to make their entry with more vehement emphasis by shooting away the 
lock. 
</P>
<P>
Father Octavio Ortiz was killed by an army tank in January, 1979, and has his 
memorial in Cristo Salvador; his father still worships there. The 
black-and-white drawings of his head were still intact on the wall. But the 
portraits of the four American churchwomen murdered in 1980 had been tossed to 
the floor. There were the marks of boot soles on them. Father Ortiz's image had 
been done a special grace. It is a practice for soldiers to leave bullet holes 
in the portrait of a Catholic martyr of too recent standing. 
</P>
<P>
"I find this one of the more hopeful things in Salvador," a Protestant church 
worker said. "They recognize the power of the people on these walls, and they 
shoot them all over again." 
</P>
<P>
The congregants of Cristo Salvador chant the ritual as Catholics have since the 
Catacombs. But their words are often strangers to the liturgy of tradition. The 
Credo begins with the ancient invocation of a Father Almighty but then departs 
to affirm that he has charged us all to build a new Earth and justice and love. 
These are not amendments projected by rebels in the church but ratified by the 
hierarchy of a church that has raised itself in rebellion against the secular 
order. Therein lies this church's crime against this state. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Greene once divided Latin America into classes of the torturable and the 
non-torturable. When guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front held the alleys of San Salvador Norte, the army rained them with rockets. 
The torturable class lives there. When the FMLN briefly occupied part of the 
Sheraton, the army spared its surroundings. The non-torturable class lives 
there. The treason of the archdiocese of San Salvador is its identification 
with the torturable class and its gospel of Christ the worker and king at once 
grand and humbly born. 
</P>
<P>
And so men in uniform could come into Cristo Salvador, kick over the pine table 
that serves as its altar and mingle the wafers and the chalice in the rubble on 
the floor. Last week, soldiers distributed leaflets echoing the pronouncement 
of Josef Stalin's forgotten Leagues of Militant Godless with identification of 
local Catholic church workers as "enemies of the people." The rhetoric of 
anti-communism in extremis is a plagiarism of what used to be the rhetoric of 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
What must it mean to kill a priest or a nun if you are the child of a mother 
for whom the church was the only present hope in time of trouble? Very little, 
apparently. And yet the worst of medieval despots would have dared any infamy 
except laying violent hands on a priest and thereby making certain the fires of 
hell. But El Salvador is settled in the age of reason, where, troublesome 
though the conquest of conscience may occasionally be, triumphs over 
superstition come easily. 
</P>
<P>
Official Salvador prefers, of course, to assign reproaches in the name of 
Christ to the category of alien subversions. That mind-set accounts for the 
hatred of the Jesuits, whose history is one of invariable harassment as enemy 
agents by revolutions and counterrevolutions alike. But it hardly explains the 
murders of Archbishop Oscar Romero and Father Ortiz, or the treatment of the 40 
or so native Salvadoran Catholics and Protestant church workers who had been 
rounded up, held without show of warrant and released without charges in the 
last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The foreigners' lot is generally the gentler alternative of deportation. But 
even this comparative kindness may well have been thrown into jeopardy by the 
arrest of Jennifer Jean Casolo of Christian Educational Seminars after police 
unearthed a cache of ammunition, explosives and bayonets in the back yard of 
the house she had moved into two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The contraband had been removed when a visitor to Casolo's rental arrived 
Sunday afternoon; but there was about the greased rags remaining beside the 
diggings an air of the authentic that could scarcely have been contrived by a 
police force whose skills with frame-ups can only be minimal because it is so 
seldom pressed with overmuch need to bother mounting them. 
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, the visitor lingered to look at the piles of Casolo's 
books that the raiding party had heaped on the floor. Here were Scott 
Fitzgerald and William Faulkner and two Graham Greenes and not one of the 
tracts that young revolutionaries used to devotedly collect and infrequently 
read. This was a library suitable for a Sarah Lawrence freshman, circa 1962. It 
also included two novels by Barbara Pym. Does a young woman who reads Pym plant 
AK-47s and M-16 rounds alongside the silver bells and cockle shells of her 
garden's growth? To answer "yes" or even "maybe" seemed too close an 
encroachment on the borders of paranoia. But, then, if paranoia is your thing, 
Salvador is the place to indulge it.

OILERS END TWO KING STREAKS; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: A SEVEN-GAME UNBEATEN STRING AND A FOUR-GAME WINNING SKEIN AT FORUM ARE 
STOPPED IN EDMONTON'S 7-6 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
When asked, on the eve of Thursday night's game, if it seemed to be getting 
easier to play against his former teammates, Wayne Gretzky explained that it is 
never easy to play the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still hard," Gretzky said. "I think it's hard for everyone. Every game is 
like a playoff game. It's either a one-goal game or a tie game. It's physical 
and fast. It's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
He was right. 
</P>
<P>
Played before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum, the ninth sellout of the 
season, it was a one-point game, a 7-6 victory for the Oilers that included an 
empty net goal by Edmonton's Craig Simpson with 53 seconds left and a goal 17 
seconds later by the Kings' Bernie Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Kings' seven-game unbeaten streak (5-0-2) and the team's 
four-game winning streak at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' record dropped to 12-11-1 as they stayed in third place in the 
Smythe Division. The Oilers' record improved to 12-10-5 as they stayed in 
second place, still a point behind first-place Calgary and three points ahead 
of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge, huge win for our hockey team," Olier Coach John Muckler said. 
"It's been great. We've won three consecutive games on the road, after losing 
the first one, and any time you can do that, you must be doing something 
right." 
</P>
<P>
King goaltender Kelly Hrudey, who had played such a big role in the team's 
strong streak, was trailing by four goals and had given up six goals on 20 
shots when he was pulled with 7 minutes 7 seconds to play in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
When Mario Gosselin took over, the Oilers had so dominated the period that the 
Kings had taken only two shots to that point. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly let (Kelly) down," the Kings' Tom Laidlaw said. "We didn't help 
him at all." 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings did regroup right after that. 
</P>
<P>
It was with Gosselin in goal that the Kings fought back for two quick goals 
late in the second period to cut the Edmonton lead to 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille scored early in the third period to put the Kings within a goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost made a game of it in the second half," King Coach Tom Webster said. 
"But we had dug ourselves a pretty good hole. We showed some character and 
fought back, but we couldn't get out of the hole. . . .Grant Fuhr gave up some 
goals, but then he just shut the door again. He's one of the best in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The way Fuhr saw it, the Kings got a couple of "cheap" goals early, but things 
worked out down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Of the King comeback, Fuhr said: "(John) Tonelli scored and then I gave them a 
bad one right after that (to Mike Krushelnyski) and I think I got them back in 
the game. That gave them a little bit of life. We should have won 7-2, but 
we'll take 7-6. It's still a win." 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille had made it 6-5 with just over 15 minutes to play, and the score 
didn't change until the final minute, when Webster pulled Gosselin in favor of 
an extra attacker and Simpson scored on the empty net. Back it went to a 
one-goal game, though, when Nicholls poked a loose puck past Fuhr with just 36 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Getting three points for the Kings in his first game with the team was forward 
Mikko Makela, who said: "Those were lucky points. I never even made a play. But 
I'll take them." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happens when you play on a line with Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Makela was on the ice with Gretzky and Krushelnyski on their first shift, and 
he scored his first point as a King on their second shift. 
</P>
<P>
Makela, who was acquired Tuesday night in a trade that sent defenseman Ken 
Baumgartner and center Hubie McDonough to the Islanders, was threatening to 
match his 20-game total of five points with the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough night for Hrudey, who gave up his first goal just 29 seconds 
into the game when Mark Messier bounced a puck off Hrudey's skate that landed 
in the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers extended the lead to 6-2 in the second period before the change of 
goaltenders and the start of the Kings' rally. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was in the penalty box for hooking when Simpson scored on the power 
play at 6:16 of the second period. Petr Klima scored another power play goal 
for the Oilers on a rebound of a shot by Steve Smith. Muni scored his second 
goal of the night unassisted to end the game for Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli started the Kings on their comeback at 15:19 with a shot from the left 
circle, and Krushelnyski followed, just 30 seconds later, with the wrap-around 
goal to put the Kings back within two. Makela got the assist. 
</P>
<P>
Of Makela, Gretzky said: "I thought he played pretty well, with a great deal of 
speed. He'll only get better when he's more comfortable with the team." 
</P>
<P>
Makela admitted to being a little nervous in his first outing, "with all these 
big stars" but he said he and the rest of the team would make it work. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make it work," he said. "This could be a good trade for me. You 
never want to get traded, but I wasn't going well in New York. I was lucky to 
get to a team like the Kings." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
In a trade of players currently on American Hockey League rosters, the Kings 
sent Phil Sykes from New Haven to Moncton in exchange for Winnipeg's Brad 
Jones. . . . Thursday night's sellout was the eighth straight for the Kings at 
the Forum. . . The Kings play at the Forum Saturday night against the New York 
Rangers and Monday against Khimik, a team from the Soviet Union. . . . The 
seven-game unbeaten streak that the Kings took into Thursday night's game was 
better than any streak last season, when the Kings had three five-game unbeaten 
streaks

101-93, Thursday night at Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>

Deacons outscored the Aces, 13-8, in overtime. Wake Forest scored its final 
four points on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno St. 72, McNeese State 71 -- Wilbert Hooker's 14 points included a

Cam Neely extended his goal-scoring streak to eight games and the Boston Bruins 
ended a 10-game regular-season winless streak against the Buffalo Sabres with a 
5-1 victory Thursday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had been 0-6-4 in regular-season games against Buffalo during the 
last two seasons, including 0-1-1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 5, Minnesota 2 -- The Flames snapped a nine-game winless streak, their

</P>
<P>
The Flames began their 0-5-4 slide with a 3-2 overtime loss in Minnesota on 
Nov. 11. It was the defending Stanley Cup champions' longest non-winning streak 
since they lost 11 in a row midway through the 1985-86 season. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Ken Wregget had 34 saves for the Flyers at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Wregget was on the verge of his third career shutout until Kevin Stevens scored 
a power-play goal with 5:02 to play. Wregget has a 4-1 record and a 1.42 
goals-against average in his last five games. 
</P>

'DOUBLE AL'S'; 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACKS LOWE AND SAVEA WERE THE ANSWERS TO EL CAMINO COACH FEATHERSTONE'S 
PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE WARRIORS HAD GOOD PASSING AND DEFENSE. BUT WHEN THE TEAM LOST 
FOUR BALL CARRIERS, IT LOOKED LIKE A REBUILDING YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When El Camino College football Coach John Featherstone talks about his "double 
Al's," he is talking about the stars of El Camino's running game: Al Lowe and 
Al Savea. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of this football season, Featherstone knew he had good passing and 
good defense, but after losing four starting running backs he thought he was in 
for a rebuilding job. 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, a 5-10, 180-pound sophomore, relieved Featherstone's worries. He comes 
from a winning tradition at Carson High, and that confidence helped him to 
become the team's best running back (536 yards on 125 carries with seven 
touchdowns). 
</P>
<P>
Savea, a 6-foot, 250-pound native of Hawaii, was a walk-on. He phoned 
Featherstone last summer and asked to try out. In his freshman year, he has 
turned in the second-best performance on the team with 532 yards and five 
touchdowns on only 103 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost almost all of our backfield from last year, and Lowe was an untested 
quantity coming back from last year," Featherstone said. "Savea was a freshman 
walk-on and we didn't expect him to do as well as he did." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe was in a backup role last year, backfield coach Peter Sen said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't ready to do much else for us," Sen said. 
</P>
<P>
But a year of constant work in weight training paid off. Said Sen: "He put the 
time in at the training room and really turned things (around) for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe feels weight training helps him prepare for games mentally. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be confident about your abilities or you wont be able to compete 
out on the field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Savea's strength comes from natural ability, say coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"(He's) just a talent, a real nugget," Sen said. "He's quick and nasty and 
definitely the biggest guy I've ever coached at running back." 
</P>
<P>
Savea and Lowe were named to the All-Mission Conference second team. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino ended its season with a 10-0 record, tied with Navarro, Tex., for the 
top ranking in the country, according to JC Grid-Wire. The Warriors, 
California's second-ranked team, meet Riverside City College at 7 p.m. Saturday 
in the Orange County Bowl at LeBard Stadium in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all of the winning teams I've been on and all of the winning teams El 
Camino has produced, we stand out the most," Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Both players credit hard work for much of their success. As an example, Lowe 
gained 10 pounds to 180 since last year after daily workouts in the training 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone was pleased to see the difference: "To play in my backfield you 
have to be a three-dimensional player, and I think that shows in the yards 
we've been averaging this season," Featherstone said. 
</P>
<P>
Training is an important part of the daily regime for Lowe and Savea. Sen said 
he sees many physically talented players who don't spend the time needed to 
perfect that talent. Lowe and Savea have put in the time and that made the 
difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People out of high school have increased the weight they can lift by 50 pounds 
by the end of the season," Savea said. "Even that isn't enough to be able to 
play for Featherstone. You have to show that you're tough and can block, run 
and catch." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors are known for their passing. The team has produced five 
All-American quarterbacks in the past decade. This season they are led by 
All-American Frank Dolce, who completed 186 of 309 passes for 2,494 yards and 
23 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
That's why coaches point out that the Warrior running game has been overlooked. 
In the final game of the regular season against Cerritos College, the backfield 
gained 218 yards and scored three touchdowns, including one each by Lowe and 
Savea. Lowe gained 103 yards on 20 carries. Dolce completed 19 of 27 passes for 
185 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the season we (Lowe and Savea) were getting only three or four 
chances per game, but as we proved ourselves on the field and in practice we 
got to do more," Savea said. "It used to be only the pass that the opposing 
defense had to key on, but now with a running team we give them real problems. 
If they key on the pass, we just run it by them; and if they key on the run, we 
just pass the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have a family atmosphere, the pair said, and that has been 
important to them, more important, perhaps, than the game of football. Lowe 
said that the Friday night team bowling and the occasional team dinner make 
everyone dig a little deeper for each other when the game starts. 
</P>
<P>
"On some teams there are cliques of stars and cliques of race, but here 
everyone is just one of the boys," Savea said. "They feel like my family." 
</P>
<P>
The leadership on the running team has fallen on Lowe. He says it's because of 
the time he spent learning and running the plays correctly last year. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody on the running team doesn't know something about a play, they 
can come to me and know that they are going to get the answer they need," Lowe 
said. "I like to help people out. It makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Savea said there isn't much jealousy between the two running backs because the 
person who gets the ball is the best runner against that type of defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We are like brothers," Savea said. "We know that the coach knows what he's 
doing, so if he says that one of us should run the ball more than the other 
it's what we have to do to win." 
</P>

Moorpark 97, Rio Hondo 61 -- Jerry Markray, a 6-foot-8 center, came off the 
bench to score 17 points as the Raiders coasted in a first-round game at 
Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Winless Rio Hondo (0-7) turned the ball over to a scrappy Moorpark defense on 
its first four possessions. Guards Charlie Cangelosi and Sam Crawford each 
converted a pair of baskets for an 8-0 lead that would steadily increase 
throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cangelosi and Crawford each scored 14 points and forced numerous turnovers. The 
Roadrunners committed 21 turnovers in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I did some gambling on defense tonight but my team backs me up and we come up 
with the ball at the right place at the right time," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory puts Moorpark (5-2) into the championship quarterfinals against 
Citrus College tonight at 7. PAUL OLSON

MIRA COSTA'S VOLLEYBALL SUCCESS IS A LONG STORY; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: THE MUSTANG GIRLS TEAM WILL PLAY SAN JOSE LYNBROOK FOR THE STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mira Costa High formally began its volleyball season in September, but the 
quest toward the California Division I girls state championship started long 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
For middle blocker Heidi Eick it began in the seventh grade when she watched 
Mira Costa win the Southern Section 5-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
For serving specialist Jennifer Streatfield it began last year when she joined 
the team as a junior after spending a year at a Chicago high school. 
</P>
<P>
For setter Piper Hahn it began four years ago when she was a reserve on the 
varsity as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
For Eick, Streatfield, Hahn, Coach Dae Lea Aldrich and the rest of the players, 
the season, and perhaps the long struggle for the state title, ends Saturday 
night when Mira Costa, 27-0, plays San Jose Lynbrook at Cal State Fullerton at 
7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Lynbrook, 36-1 including abbreviated matches in tournaments, beat Corona Del 
Mar, 15-9, 7-15, 15-10, 17-19, 15-12, to reach its first state final. Mira 
Costa reached the championship by beating Livermore Granada, 15-4, 15-0, 15-13, 
led by Eick's 13 kills and four solo blocks. Erika Lawson had 10 digs and seven 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Mira Costa's players expected to see Corona Del Mar for a fourth time 
this year, but Aldrich said Lynbrook is a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
"We are emotionally glad we don't have to play Corona again," Aldrich said. 
"Each time they got closer." 
</P>
<P>
Corona came close to making the state final, but Lynbrook won the tight 
semifinal match in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Lynbrook is a big, strong team. The Vikings, Central Coast Section champions, 
are led by 6-foot senior outside hitter Holly Racine and 5-11 sophomore middle 
hitter Michelle Wagner. Junior setter Dawn Hill paces the Lynbrook offense. 
</P>
<P>
Lynbrook is also hungry. It won the De Anza League, usually dominated by 
Northern California powers Fremont and Los Altos, for the first time and also 
the Central Coast Section for the first time. Now the Vikings are looking for 
their first state title. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited to play somebody new," Aldrich said. "But I hope it doesn't 
matter who we play. If we play our brand of volleyball, which is fast-paced, we 
should be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich said Lynbrook's offense moves slower than Mira Costa's but that the 
experience of her players should allow them to adjust. Slower-paced teams have 
caused Mira Costa problems in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa seemed to have problems in the last game of the state playoffs. In 
each of the Mustangs' three playoff matches, Mira Costa has beaten its 
opponents by an average of 15-3 in the first two games. In the third game of 
those matches, they have won by 15-10, 15-10 and 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
But all problems the Mustangs have faced on the court have been solved. No team 
has won two games from Mira Costa, and only two -- Corona Del Mar and Laguna 
Beach -- have taken the Mustangs to a four-game match. 
</P>
<P>
Lynbrook needed four games to beat St. Francis of Mountain View in the 
quarterfinal before its tough match with Corona, while Mira Costa rolled to the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
If Mira Costa's biggest problems are concentrating while blowing a team out and 
not having played any five-game matches, then the Mustangs would appear to be 
in good shape coming into the final. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to go to a fourth or fifth game, we're not going to panic," Aldrich 
said. "That's why I like to see a team like Granada (in the state semifinal) 
get 13 points. We came back and we won, it builds confidence." Mira Costa was 
behind 10-5 at one point during the third game against Granada. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich said when Mira Costa does not face tough competition in a match, the 
team practices hard against each other. In this way, reserves such as Jennifer 
Smith, Allison Dean, Cindy De Garceau and Amy Banachowski play key roles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all together in practice; we mix our front lines," Aldrich said. "Our 
reserves do a great job, our bench has improved so much this year." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa is together in practice, but as a team they stand apart from other 
high school programs. Saturday marks the end of a decade that has seen Mira 
Costa win two CIF state titles and six Southern Section crowns. A victory would 
give the Mustangs a record third state championship and, in all probability, 
the mythical national championship, determined by USA Today and Volleyball 
Monthly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The match also marks the last high school appearance for Mira Costa's nine 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a wonderful four years with them," Aldrich said. "I am going to 
capitalize on every moment they're here." 
</P>
<P>
The players echo Aldrich's feelings. Setter Hahn leads the team in assists, 
smiles and having a good time. "We have so much fun, I haven't thought about it 
ending; it's a strange feeling," Hahn said after the match against Granada. 
"Tonight Heidi (Eick) came up to me and said this was the last game in our gym. 
It hasn't hit me yet." 
</P>
<P>
Streatfield had no time for sentimentality. "I'm not worried about that," she 
said. "I won't be satisfied until we win the state championship." 
</P>
<P>
Eick reflected on both the state title and the season ending: "We've worked so 
hard for this. It has been my dream to win the state championship since the 
seventh grade when I saw Piper's sister Lindsey play in the CIF final. That's 
what got me into volleyball. I suppose we'll be sad when it ends, but we have 
to win first, then we can be sad." 
</P>
<P>
If Mira Costa manages to beat Lynbrook, however, look for Eick and company to 
be shedding tears of happiness.

COLLEGE NOTES;

<P>
LOYOLA VOLLEYBALL HAS BIG WISH -- TALL PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Help Wanted: Tall women who can spike a volleyball and have college 
eligibility. Inquire: Loyola Marymount University. See Coach Mike Normand. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the women's volleyball season is over, the real game begins for 
Normand -- recruiting athletes who can compete with the likes of Pepperdine for 
the West Coast Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Normand, who took over the women's team this fall, saw his Lions lose their 
first eight matches, then win six out of seven, then eventually finish with 
another eight-match losing streak. In the opening weeks he lost two key 
players, and though he doesn't question the players' effort, he was sometimes 
dumbfounded by his team's physical shortcomings. The Lions finished 8-19 
overall, 7-7 in the WCC. 
</P>
<P>
But the former UCLA All-American remains upbeat and is looking for immediate 
help at all positions. Next year, he says, will be different. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned a lot, we got beat by some teams that were bigger and had been 
playing together longer, but we were improving," Normand said. "We will 
improve, we will get some good athletes, fill some spots. We need to get some 
size. We were the smallest team in the league -- I think that hurt us toward 
the end of the season, playing hard but having to jump on every ball. We were 
the best looking and in the best shape, but the smallest. We had some injuries 
that hurt -- we weren't real deep and that hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will return a solid nucleus -- notably all-conference hitter Kerry 
House, promising freshmen Raquel Glenn and Dana Bragado and starting setter 
Anita Irwin -- and expect to see action by setter Janeice Stimpfig and blocker 
Dawn Moon, who were felled by leg injuries in the first week of the season. But 
Bragado is the only 6-footer of that group. Against a team like UCLA, which 
averaged 6-2 across the front, matches were a real uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
So Normand says he's not worried about recruiting for specific positions. "My 
goal is to get good athletes with size," he said. "My job is to teach 'em. I 
can tell 'em how to play, but you can't teach size. We need to get a little 
more aggressive and some height to go to the next level, which is (conference) 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to build (the program) up but it will take some time. When they 
come back (next fall) we won't have to start at the bottom again. They'll 
understand the new system. There were times in the heat of battle they went 
back to the old ways. It's tough to rearrange everybody's thinking (in one 
season)." 
</P>
<P>
Normand optimistically expects Stimpfig, an anticipated starter who needed knee 
surgery in September, to return to training in December and said feedback from 
recruits has been positive. "But I guess we'll find out when the (February) 
signing period comes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team, off to a fast start at 2-0, will 
try to take a bite out of the Big Apple this weekend in the four-team Fordham 
Tournament. The Lions will face Georgia Tech on Saturday, then will play either 
Fordham or Lafayette on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Team leader Kristen Bruich, despite a foot injury, earned the West Coast 
Conference Player of the Week honor by getting 26 points, five assists and a 
WCC-record nine steals in a victory over Eastern Illinois, then came back to 
get 15 points and five assists in a win over St. Thomas of Minnesota. Another 
key performer was center Tricia Gibson, who had 23 points and nine rebounds 
against Eastern Illinois, hitting nine of 11 shots. "She was unconscious," 
Lions Coach Todd Corman said. In the two games Gibson has hit 12 of 16 shots. 
</P>
<P>
With forward Michelle Bettencourt also battling an injury, sophomore Joelle 
Longobardi has stepped in to average nine points and seven rebounds. 
Bettencourt missed the Eastern Illinois game but came off the bench against St. 
Thomas to register 10 points and eight rebounds in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount used to be the little basketball team that snuck up on people, 
but no longer. Going into this weekend's Gator Bowl Tournament at Jacksonville, 
the Lions are the co-favorite (along with host Jacksonville), and Lions Coach 
Paul Westhead now is wary that his opening-round opponent, Stetson, is in the 
sleeper role. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a very difficult game. I expect a full-blast game," Westhead said. 
"Stetson might sneak up on us. We're not sneaking up on Stetson. We have gained 
notoriety. That's OK. We sought it. People know our players. It's nice to go 
anywhere in the country and have people say, 'That's Loyola.' No more 
'Loyola-who.' " 
</P>
<P>
Traveling Man: Loyola starting forward Per Stumer, who doubles as a starter for 
the Swedish National Team, has had a hectic itinerary lately, trying to fulfill 
responsibilities to both teams. 
</P>
<P>
After playing for Loyola in its opening loss to Las Vegas, he flew to Sweden 
last week to play in a European qualifying tournament. He flew back to Los 
Angeles in time to play for the Lions against Nevada Reno over the weekend, 
then went back to Sweden early this week for another European tournament game. 
He was expected to rejoin the Loyola team in Florida today in time for the 
Gator Bowl Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Roadhouse Blues: Through Tuesday, West Coast Conference basketball teams were 
0-8 on the road and 5-0 at home. The opening week dichotomy continues a pattern 
from last season when seven of the eight WCC teams had losing records on the 
road while six had winning records at home. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Injury update: Loyola freshman Chris Scott (broken thumb) has 
resumed practicing with the basketball team and may be available tonight in 
Jacksonville. He hasn't played since the Lions met the Australian national team 
on Nov 4 . . . The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team hasn't 
started 0-3 since 1983-84 season when Toros were 0-4 on the way to an 8-17 
record . . . After the first two weeks of play, Khyra Anderson of Dominguez 
Hills leads California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball players in 
rebound average (10.8) and blocked shots (2.8) . . . The Dominguez Hills 
volleyball team finished the season 0-12 in the CCAA and has not won a 
conference match since October, 1987, a span of 30 straight CCAA losses. The 
women finished 7-22 overall . . . Karen Sutherland set a Dominguez Hills 
volleyball record for assists in a season with 461, and Maria Romero set 
records for kills (175), digs (183) and service aces (46) . . . Former Harbor 
College forward Bruce Turner scored 29 points for Cal State Los Angeles in a 
season-opening victory over Grand Canyon . . . Former El Camino College 
basketball Coach Paul Landreaux had a less than thrilling debut as a major 
college head coach. His St. Mary's Gaels lost two games by a total of 41 points 
in the Coors Classic at Fresno, shot 27.5% from the field and were 1-for-26 
from three-point range (3.8%).

SOUTHWEST COLLEGE WILL PLAY IN FIRST BOWL GAME SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
L.A. Southwest College will make its first bowl appearance on Saturday at 7 
p.m. The 15th-ranked Cougars (7-2-1) will meet College of the Desert in the 
Southern California Bowl at Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners, ranked 13th in the state, are the Foothill Conference champs 
with an 8-2 record under first-year Coach Steve Dostal. Desert is young, but 
balanced and often consistent. Its defense, which allows an average of 190 
total yards a game, ranks third in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a solid football team," said Southwest Coach Henry Washington. "They 
really play hard and they get after you. It should be a good game because we're 
pretty evenly matched." 
</P>
<P>
Desert's offense can also be productive. Freshman quarterback Joe Palomares 
ranks among the state's top 25 with 125 of 251 attempts for 1,457 yards and 9 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He won't find scoring easy against Southwest's fierce defense, which is ranked 
10th in the state and allows 249 yards a game, but in a much tougher conference 
than Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively the Cougars are in good shape with quarterback Craig Manigo in the 
driver's seat. The freshman finished second in the Western State Conference 
with 136 passes for 1,672 yards and 19 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We chose to play them because they're a young, up-and-coming football 
program," said Desert assistant Coach Richard Davis. "We're not on the same 
caliber as they are. They have a lot of athletic talent compared to us." IRENE

MAD MARLIN TAKES ON TWO BOATS AND THREE FISHERMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't any holiday weekend for fish as the denizens of the deep gobbled up 
bait. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Kowal of Long Beach and 7-year-old son Mickey were fishing from their 
skiff at Horseshoe Kelp over the holiday weekend for an hour without a bite, so 
Kowal raised anchor and made the run to Catalina Island within an hour through 
calm seas and no wind. 
</P>
<P>
His only stop there was the east end quarry. He was fishing a cast away from 
kelp when a marlin jumped over the bow of the small boat, missing the two by 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
It happened as the boy was reeling in a bass and the marlin followed it to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
"We both were using only 10-pound test line and could never hold that hungry 
jumper with light tackle," Kowal said. 
</P>
<P>
Switching to a rock cod rod and reel, he made several casts using bait and a 
jig. The fish hit. While Kowal tried to reel it in after peeling most of the 
line, the marlin started to move the boat toward another angler in a small 
rubber raft. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Landsfield of Carson was hooked up and following his fish as Kowal's skiff 
approached. When the two were only a yard apart they discovered the marlin had 
been snagged by Landsfield and had tangled with Kowal's line. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour the tired marlin was brought to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The three anglers also limited out on bass and had an 11 1/3-pound sheepshead 
to show for their holiday.

CLEVELAND'S BASKETBALL TEAM ALSO SUFFERING TOUGH LOSSES OFF THE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The names have changed after all. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland High's basketball team, which seemed as deep in returning talent as 
any in the area a few days ago, has been dealt a dual blow with the loss of 
Andre Chevalier and Brandon Battle to academic ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier, who would have been playing his third season on the varsity, is 
probably the team's best defensive player and ballhandler. Battle, who was in 
former Coach Bob Braswell's doghouse most of last season and played sparingly, 
was nonetheless expected to contribute from the forward position. Both are 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The academic problems have forced inexperienced players into the lineup sooner 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked out there once and I only saw one guy on the court who'd ever played 
in a varsity game before," Coach Marc Paez said after Cleveland's 78-75 loss to 
Westchester in its opener Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier might have an outside chance of regaining his eligibility. He 
received a failing grade, but the mark is pending review, Cleveland assistant 
Larry White said. 
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland's loss to Westchester, the Cavaliers' reserves scored only eight 
points. The starting front line of Bobby McRae, Brandon Martin and Trenton 
Cornelius wasn't very effective, either, accounting for 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
'Land of the loss: The Cavaliers lost one home game last season -- to Fairfax 
in the second round of the City Section 4-A Division playoffs. Wednesday's loss 
to Westchester technically gives Cleveland a two-game losing streak at home. 
</P>
<P>
East meets West: First-year Buckley basketball Coach Byrd Milic is from New 
York City, where basketball can be a way of life. It did not take Milic long to 
come to the following conclusion: "Kids don't seem to take it as seriously 
here." 
</P>
<P>
But Milic has found at least one player who shares his addiction for the game. 
And he comes directly from rubbing elbows with Jack and Dyan -- courtside at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Wallette, a 6-1 junior forward, is one of the Laker ball boys, Milic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He really knows the game," Milic said. "He tells me a lot of things, like, 
'Maybe we should do it this way.' " 
</P>
<P>
A dose of Doss: He stands on the sideline at Canyon High, hands cupped around 
mouth. His face strains as he yells at inside linebackers, running backs and 
members of the special teams. As the game grows more intense, so does he. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Harry Welch? 
</P>
<P>
No. This guy wears an earring. 
</P>
<P>
The coach is Kevin Doss. That's right, Coach Kevin Doss, a first-year assistant 
at Canyon and a senior linebacker on the 1987 Canyon team that reached the 
Coastal Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Doss, one of Welch's all-time favorites because of his tenacity, joined the 
coaching ranks this season while attending College of the Canyons. Doss works 
with inside linebackers, running backs and special teams. 
</P>
<P>
"He has all the marvelous potential in the world as a coach," Welch said. "He 
bridges the age-gap between players and coaches. That's always a concern, but 
he handles any challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Flirting with disaster: Kickoff returns for touchdowns can be sudden and 
momentum-shattering, and, in back-to-back games in the Division II football 
playoffs this season, Thousand Oaks -- seeded No. 1 -- has given up the swift 
six. 
</P>
<P>
The first return -- in the midst of a 33-6 whipping of Palmdale -- only cost 
the Lancers their sixth shutout. But in last week's quarterfinals, Leuzinger 
appeared to be a beaten team until Courtney Overton ran the second-half kickoff 
back 95 yards for a 10-6 Olympian advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger, which up until then had not been able to move the ball, suddenly was 
marching down the field with ease. The kickoff return had swung the game's 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers did not regain momentum until they recovered a late Leuzinger 
fumble and drove 29 yards to the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure it upsets me," Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards said. "We had better do a 
whole lot better job on special teams. There have been some (personnel) 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Safety first: One minute, 22 seconds remained. Laguna Hills was 95 yards from a 
touchdown that could have tied or won the game. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills quarterback Mark Wells had completed all of two passes so far -- 
none before the fourth quarter. Agoura, leading, 14-7, in the Division VIII 
quarterfinal game, looked like a lock. 
</P>
<P>
But then came Wells. He completed four of eight passes on the drive for 54 
yards. Agoura helped with a couple of penalties. So, with no time remaining, 
Laguna Hills was looking at one last chance from Agoura's 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"We played sound pass defense all along," Agoura Coach Frank Greminger said, 
"and then on this last series . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In a crowd, Darrin Chapman gathered in Wells' final pass on the five and sliced 
to the two before free safety Todd Cribari sealed the win. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he had a shot at going in," Greminger said of the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Cribari, however, stood Chapman up and Agoura lived to play again. In the past 
three weeks, Agoura has lost to Santa Ynez in quadruple overtime, 27-21; beaten 
St. Monica, 15-14, with a two-point conversion with 13 seconds left and won 
again, beating Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys play with a lot of heart," Greminger said. "A lot of emotion. They 
don't know when to quit. I've had other teams like that, but this one even more 
so."

AZTECS CATCH DIVISION II RIVERSIDE

Coach Jim Brandenburg talked with pride Thursday of what his San Diego State 
basketball team had accomplished in the final five minutes of a 67-61 comeback 
victory over UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
He had to. Anything else in the game might have been beyond words. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (2-2) had to rally past the NCAA Division II Highlanders (2-1) by 
scoring 16 of the final 18 points in nonconference home opener in front of 
1,931 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really concerned if we were going to get a wake-up call," Brandenburg 
said. "We didn't get started until the five-minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was really pleased with what our players did then. It was the first time 
we played like a team. The bench was up shouting, everyone was in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the Aztecs appeared to be in serious danger of losing to a 
non-Division I team for the first time in 10 seasons. They trailed, 38-33, at 
the half and were behind by as much as 10 in the second half. And Riverside was 
missing its leading scorer -- senior forward Chris Ceballos -- who broke a 
finger on his shooting hand in practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
With Ceballos out, guards Reggie Howard and Mike Ritter tried to make up for 
his absence by scoring from the outside. The pair split 28 points, 18 coming on 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs trailed, 58-48, with 7:57 to play but came back to win by scoring 13 
points in a row after Riverside took a 59-51 with 5:52 left. The streak gave 
SDSU a 64-59 lead with 1:52 remaining, the go-ahead points coming on a 
17-footer by guard Rodney Jones that made it 61-59 with 3:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first SDSU lead since the first six minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive inefficiency was again at the root of the Aztecs' problems, but their 
strong shooting from the free-throw line (23 of 29) helped keep them in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were led by junior forward Shawn Jamison's 13 points.

BOOKER SAYS HE'LL RETURN FOR AZTECS

When San Diego State football Coach Al Luginbill, who is out of town preparing 
to begin recruiting, phones to get messages from his secretary, he'll no doubt 
be pleased to hear one left by Tommy Booker. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be returning," Booker said Thursday night. "The desire was still there 
to play. I went to the BYU game, and it was still there. I got home and said 'I 
wish I was out there.' I'll just play my last two years, give it my all and see 
what comes out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Booker, a junior running back, quit the team for personal reasons this season 
after rushing for 460 yards and three touchdowns his first two. Luginbill asked 
him to make a decision by today as to whether he would return so the Aztecs 
could finalize their recruiting plans. With the suspension of Darrin Wagner and 
Ron Slack completing his eligibility, they looked to be short on running backs 
for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Booker said he stopped by Luginbill's office Thursday to tell him of his 
decision but was informed that Luginbill was out of town. Sunday is the first 
day coaches can talk with high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't be back until Monday, so I left a message with the secretary," Booker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Booker, Times back of the year and a first-team Parade All-American during his 
senior year at Vista High School, has two years of eligibility remaining. RICK

The thing about tonight's San Diego Section 3-A semifinal playoff game between 
Rancho Buena Vista and Point Loma is this: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista can move the football. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma can move the football. 
</P>
<P>
So what the Longhorns and Pointers will find out at 7:30 at Mira Mesa High 
School is which can slow down the other. That will determine who advances to 
the championship game next Saturday in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Neither coach -- Craig Bell of RBV or Bennie Edens of Point Loma -- expects his 
defense to completely shut down its opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has come close to stopping the RBV running game. The Longhorns averaged 
44.6 points a game during the regular season and were not held below 34 points. 
RBV's two playoff victories have also been high-scoring affairs -- 51-27 over 
Patrick Henry and 48-21 over Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Markeith Ross was second in the county this season with 1,341 yards behind 
Oceanside's Terry Vaughn. O.J. Hall broke the San Diego Section career rushing 
record by pushing his total to 4,073. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Point Loma has been able to pass on just about everybody. The 
Pointers averaged 29 points a game. They defeated Sweetwater, 42-10, in the 
first round of the playoffs and then Orange Glen last week in overtime, 48-35. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan White completed 157 of 255 passes (62%) for 2,722 yards and 21 
touchdowns this season. Brett Callan caught 65 passes for 1,107 yards (17-yard 
average), and J.J. Stokes caught 55 for 1,257 yards (22.9). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're ever going to stop Point Loma," Bell said. "You just have 
to do the best you can to contain them. You have to play as well as you can for 
as long as you can." 
</P>
<P>
RBV (9-3) may have the better record, but Point Loma (8-4) defeated the 
Longhorns, 42-35, in Vista Sept. 22. That is the only time RBV has been 
defeated on the field in its past 27 games. RBV's other two losses this season 
were forfeits when it was discovered the Longhorns had unknowingly used an 
ineligible player during victories. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, they're the most explosive offensive team we've faced all 
year," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, Edens saw enough to know how dangerous RBV can be. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look forward to playing them again," he said. "I think the key will be 
which one of us can stop the other. It could very easily turn into a game of 
which one of us has the ball last." 
</P>
<P>
Edens remembers that in order to beat RBV, everything came together just right 
for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember our emotion was very good that night," he said. "The electricity 
grew on our sidelines all night. I haven't had many experiences in coaching 
where everything came together as it did then -- the tempo, momentum . . . it 
was one of those nights where, as soon as a player came out, he couldn't wait 
to get back in there." 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma suffered a setback last week against Orange Glen when defensive end 
Mondola Wilkins broke a leg. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll miss him," Edens said. "We've had to revise our thinking."

TROUPE WILL SHOW ITS MELLOW SIDE; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: JAZZ UNLIMITED WILL EMPHASIZE A SOFT-EDGED, MODERN STYLE OF MOVEMENT AT 
ITS SEASON OPENER THIS WEEKEND.

Twisting torsos, gyrating hips and high-voltage leg work are basic ingredients 
in Jazz Unlimited's recipe for success. The San Diego-based dance troupe has 
mixed and matched these contemporary cliches many times, and they usually add 
up to sell-out concerts. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a mellow side to the Jazz Unlimited oeuvre that rarely surfaces in 
company concerts. It's this soft-edged, modern-based style of movement that the 
ensemble intends to thrust into bold relief during Jazz Unlimited's 
season-opener this weekend. The two- performance concert, slated for San Diego 
State University's Don Powell Theater, will take place at 8 p.m. Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving toward a more lyrical style -- a modern jazzy combination," said 
co-artistic director Alicia Rincon. "We'll still have some New Age, but we're 
(exploring) more of a lyrical style, and, in this upcoming show, you'll see 
that new direction." 
</P>
<P>
The modern dance influence will be strongest in Melissa Nunn's "Summons," a 
dance juxtaposed against the ominous percussive qualities of Lucia Hwong's 
Tibet Suite. 
</P>
<P>
"Melissa's piece uses Asian-style music, and it's very modern, very beautiful," 
Rincon said. "Pat's (Patricia Rincon's) piece, 'Sun Gods,' is similar, but it 
takes a different direction. It's more lyrical and dreamlike, but not 
necessarily softer. Both are very different from our typical works." 
</P>
<P>
With those two works, Jazz Unlimited is preparing to bridge the gap between its 
standard brand of contemporary jazz and modern dance. The company also has high 
hopes of expanding its dancer and audience base with this shift in emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"If we bring in more modern style dance, we can start bringing in more modern 
dancers," said Rincon. "We have Faith Jensen-Ismay (of Three's Company and 
Dancers) working with us this time. Faith came into the show because she saw us 
as a breath of fresh air for her. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of modern dancers we could attract with more modern," Rincon 
said. "We could really get something good going then, and we're very excited 
about that. And, of course, that would help us reach a new audience also." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Jazz Unlimited, most of the core 
</P>
<P>
dancers can make the crossover from jazz to modern. New additions, such as 
Jensen-Ismay, will concentrate on the modern mode and sit out the high-velocity 
jazz romps. 
</P>
<P>
As Rincon explained, "We're going to try this, and see how it works. I think 
we've found a happy medium for everyone. We've always been a flexible company 
and anxious to please our audience base." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz Unlimited is not forsaking the die-hard jazz dance buffs during this 
period of "upgrading," Rincon noted. To satisfy their appetite for hard-driving 
rhythms and brash, non-stop moves, the troupe will recycle its rambunctious 
"Company Break," an ensemble work that flaunts all the trappings of 
contemporary jazz in its whiz-bang maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
Rincon herself will premiere a funky threesome for Richard Bulda, Maria Parra 
and Stacy Scardino, titled "On the Road." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to have all the same style, so I'll do what I do best. My piece is 
more theatrical, and whimsical," she said. "It's more of my typical 
cartoon-style -- bright and offbeat." 
</P>
<P>
"Trilogy," a retrospective dance work by Rincon's sister and co- artistic 
director Patricia, who alone guided the company until this year, is another 
revival slated for this weekend's program. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Rincon also choreographed the third company premiere, "Grounded," 
although by the time the concert gets under way she will be thousands of miles 
from home. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat went back to Europe" as part of her sabbatical from UC San Diego's dance 
program, said her sister and kindred spirit. "That means I'm directing the 
show. It's my first show without Pat, so that's a big step. It's a good thing 
Pat was so panicked about leaving, she got her dances done early and left me 
the easy part. That's why we're really prepared for this concert." 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Rincon, a lead dancer in the troupe, will perform in only one piece this 
weekend. Her new administrative duties forced her to curtail the on-stage 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was always just to be a dancer," she said. "But I realized that Pat 
could not do it all (administrative work) herself. In order for the company to 
grow, I had to get more involved, since we had no money to hire people for 
that. Of course, this means I had to pull back my dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"What's really important to Pat and to me is that we have money for the 
dancers. We try to give them enough to meet their needs."

THEATER REVIEW;

<P>
AN UP-TO-DATE 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' AT THE REP 
</P>

<P>
Cheers to the San Diego Repertory Theatre for putting the true Christmas spirit 
into its 14th edition of "A Christmas Carol" on the Lyceum Stage. 
</P>
<P>
The theater could have trotted out the same wonderful, heartwarming sure-fire 
success that "A Christmas Carol" has always been for them -- and goodness 
knows, at the end of a tough, controversial season like this past one, they 
could have used something safe. 
</P>
<P>
They could have cut costs by dusting off old sets, freshening up old costumes 
and pulling out old props. Instead, director Walter Schoen looked at an 
oft-overlooked side of Charles Dickens -- his role as a crusader against the 
social injustices of his time -- and decided to address the sadnesses of our 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of focusing on the poor of Victorian England, Schoen set this year's 
"Carol" on a San Diego street where the homeless congregate. The prologue is 
simple and brief: Some of the homeless, to keep warm, are burning books. One of 
the books, pulled from the fire by a little boy who wants to hear a story, is 
"A Christmas Carol." As the boy's mother reads the story, the homeless 
community acts it out, using props from the street: a wastebasket with planks 
of wood for Bob Cratchit's desk, a shopping cart with a coin changer for a 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Once the mother, played with rousing spirit by Sylvia M'Lafi Thompson, begins 
reading the story, the script is the same sturdy, satisfying adaptation by 
Douglas Jacobs that the Rep has always used. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pluses of the contemporary opening is that it gives the show welcome 
room to play with a range of retrospective styles. The dances, smartly 
choreographed by Bruce Nelson, range from old English steps to break dancing by 
the agile Nelson as Mr. Fezziwig. And the music -- beautifully orchestrated by 
Linda Vickerman for one of the Rep's most able singing casts -- moves 
effortlessly from gospel singing to old carols to modern pop. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while the Rep's daring deserves praise, Schoen would have been more 
successful if he had pushed his concept further. 
</P>
<P>
The director seems to be after a "Man of La Mancha" effect, in which Dickens' 
book, like Cervantes' manuscript in "Man of La Mancha," needs to justify its 
existence if it is to survive. But he doesn't put enough force behind the idea. 
</P>
<P>
When the boy saves the book from the fire, the man tending the fire just shrugs 
instead of scolding him. There is an issue here for the man to raise; when 
people are cold, isn't concrete warmth more important than storytelling ? 
</P>
<P>
What needs to be pointed out more forcefully -- obvious as it may be to some -- 
is that this book is needed to warm these people's hearts even more than it is 
needed to warm their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Also, to elicit more sympathy for the homeless who act out the play, one needs 
to establish characters -- even briefly -- who can show themselves to be 
personally affected by the story in the end. 
</P>
<P>
Why not have someone -- perhaps the small boy's mother -- beseech the vagrant 
who is to play Scrooge for an extra piece of bread for her boy who is ailing? 
Why not have her plead for the sake of the Christmas spirit, only to be turned 
down by the fellow who -- in the true spirit of Scrooge -- doesn't see why 
Christmas should be used as an excuse to take away a starving man's last crust? 
</P>
<P>
Why not show the small boy, who does in fact play Tiny Tim, as being sick or 
handicapped in some way? And when the story is over, might the man not help him 
by offering him something to eat and an arm to help him walk? 
</P>
<P>
Still, what does come through overwhelmingly is that this is a story with its 
heart in the right place. The talented cast is a joy, from W. Francis Walters 
as a crusty bourgeois Scrooge to Kory Abosada as both Tiny Tim and the youngest 
Ebeneezer (a clever touch to help Scrooge identify with Tiny Tim), to Richard 
Soto as Scrooge's ebullient nephew, Fred. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson injects a welcome toughness to Mrs. Cratchit as well as to the part of 
first narrator (several people narrate as the book is passed from hand to 
hand), Damon Bryant lends weighty pain to Scrooge's dead partner, Jacob Marley, 
and Maggie Stewart suggests an ethereal, musty air as the gentle Ghost of 
Christmas Past. 
</P>
<P>
The contemporary squalor of the sets by Thomas Buderwitz are clever in a 
bittersweet way -- the vagrants' imagination of a feast is all wrapped up in 
buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Cheez-Its, with empty soda cans 
decorating the holiday wreaths. The costumes by Catherine Meachum find common 
threads, literally, between contemporary layering of faded cloth and Victorian 
layering of the same. 
</P>
<P>
The lighting by John B. Forbes is excellent, and Schoen's direction is inspired 
except for the curious beginning in which it is not clear when the play 
actually starts. 
</P>
<P>
The play's awkward opening is redeemed by an effective ending in which it 
becomes clear that this story about Christmas does not end at the theater 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
As the theater crowds exit through a glittering, bedecked Horton Plaza, with 
the homeless stretched out not far from the pretty and upscale stores, this 
"Christmas Carol" becomes a powerful reminder of how urgently the ordinary 
person, like Mr. Scrooge, needs to learn how to keep Christmas in his heart if 
anything is to change. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens would have liked this show.

Sinatra Changes Tune: Frank Sinatra says he changed his mind about crossing the 
picket line at Bally's in Las Vegas and has canceled a six-day engagement 
because there may be a settlement soon in a musicians strike. Sinatra had 
planned to open Dec. 4 as scheduled because of the holiday season, even though 
his son and musical director, Frank Sinatra Jr., has been acting as a 
go-between for the casinos and the musicians, who are striking five casinos to 
protest the use of taped music in showrooms. "I am informed that a settlement 
of the strike is possible before the holidays," Sinatra said in a statement 
issued Wednesday. "If such is the case, I do not want to jeopardize these 
conversations and am deferring my decision to perform in Las Vegas at the 
moment. Leave the fighting to (Roberto) Duran and (Sugar Ray) Leonard." CLAUDIA

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL IS OVER, BUT SOVIET ACTS WILL KEEP ON COMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor did not welcome Don Hughes as part of the official 
Soviet Arts Festival when he presented the Red Army Chorus and Soviet rock star 
Vladimir Kuzmin, but no matter. The Red Army Chorus pulled in an audience of 
16,000, Hughes' largest ever in San Diego; Kuzmin signed an exclusive contract 
with Hughes' organization, International Attractions, and the promoter intends 
to keep the exchange going with more Soviet fare through next year. 
</P>
<P>
The next event in the hopper is the high-jumping Soviet Acrobatic Revue at the 
Old Globe Theatre this Tuesday through Dec. 17. Hughes recently opened an 
International Attractions office in Moscow to facilitate other Soviet 
attractions. Coming up next year are: 
</P>
<P>
* The Rustavi Company, a group of Georgian singers and dancers, at Symphony 
Hall Feb. 27-March 4. 
</P>
<P>
* The Obraztsov's Moscow Puppet Theatre at the Old Globe Oct. 16-28. 
</P>
<P>
* The Koslov Youth Dance Ensemble of Moscow, a group of 49 child folk dancers, 
to be presented from September to November at a venue to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Combine those with the Old Globe's independent production of Fyodor Abramov's 
"The House," the Maly Drama Theatre of Leningrad show scheduled for 1990 or 
1991, and San Diego shapes up to be the Soviet performer's home away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes also plans to present the Moscow Boy's Choir in 1991, as well as the 
Peking Opera and the Peking Acrobats. He is also working on other attractions 
from the Soviet Union and other nations in the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said he has no problem attracting acts from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The ambition of every Russian performer is to work in the States," he said. 
"It is the absolute dream. I have people call me in New York and say, 'I don't 
believe it, I'm in America!' " 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' involvement with acrobats goes back to 1974, on the heels of near 
disaster. He was presenting Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music" while 
living in Johannesburg, South Africa. The show opened to critical raves, but 
the audiences never materialized. He canceled the show before the run in the 
theater was scheduled to end and figured it might take him a year and a half to 
recoup his losses. 
</P>
<P>
Then a stranger named Ken Hai called and asked Hughes if he wanted to book his 
show. Hughes said yes, and soon the Taiwan Acrobats arrived, filling up the 
house through the end of the run. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes took the Taiwan Acrobats to the United States, where he decided to 
settle himself. He hired Hai, who now runs his Asian division. Hai checked out 
the Soviet Acrobatic Revue, and when he told Hughes that "the Soviet acrobats 
are just as good as the Chinese acrobats, that was good enough for me," Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes once asked Hai why he called him that day in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'You have turned my life around, you know,' " Hughes said. Was it 
Hughes' reputation that prompted the call? His track record? The fact that he 
had an empty theater starving for an act? 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said Hai told him: "I looked in the Yellow Pages and your office was the 
nearest one to my hotel." 
</P>
<P>
It came as no great surprise to anyone -- especially not the principals 
involved -- that Harris Goldman, executive producer at Starlight Musical 
Theatre since October, 1988, officially quit as of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The words seemed friendly enough on both sides as Marshall Lucas, president of 
Starlight's board of trustees, spoke of his great respect for Goldman, and 
Goldman spoke of wishing Starlight well, but it was hard to miss the relief 
between the lines as Lucas and Goldman reached a final agreement on buying out 
the rest of Goldman's three-year contract, which was to expire Oct. 3, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman will continue as a consultant at Starlight and will be involved in 
union negotiations while he explores other opportunities in the performing arts 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas has assigned the interim job of acting business manager to comptroller 
Steven Bevans while Starlight searches for a replacement to Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
That search will be preceded by some soul searching on the part of the 
organization, according to Lucas, as Starlight, with the help of a committee of 
executive producers, reevaluates what sort of producer it wants, both for their 
own needs and in light of what is happening in the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a tremendous amount of respect for Harris Goldman, but maybe we weren't 
ready for some of the things he wanted to do," Lucas said. "We are going 
through tremendous growing pains, and, while we're meeting with success, we 
still have to keep the flavor of Starlight as we move into the '90s and do 
shows that people have never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
There's no rush to fill Goldman's post; the 1990 season is already in place and 
the theater is dark until May 23, when Stephen Sondheim's "Follies" will open. 
</P>
<P>
The new appointment might not be made until April or May, Lucas said. More 
important than filling the seat is determining just what Starlight wants from 
the person in it. 
</P>
<P>
"We could bring in Hal Prince and it could be a problem. Or Tommy Tune. It all 
depends on what our needs for the future are," Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Local composer Max Branscomb will give a workshop production of 
his new musical, "JFK," about President John F. Kennedy, at Southwestern 
College Dec. 8-9 in the Arena Theatre at Mayan Hall, Chula Vista. Admission is 
free. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company will give a benefit performance of "Hay 
Fever" on Nov. 11 for children with cancer and their siblings as part of its 
second Future Audience program. . . . Rumor has it that additions to the 
executive staff at the Gaslamp are imminent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse will announce Jan. 3 whether it has raised the requisite 
money to ensure a 1990 season. Raising $500,000 by Dec. 31 is the goal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look for some familiar faces in the Old Globe's "Uncle Vanya," opening the 1990 
season Jan. 11-Feb. 18. The cast includes Richard Easton ("Waiting for Godot" 
and "Measure for Measure"), Lynne Griffin ("The School for Scandal"), Richard 
Kneeland ("Waiting for Godot" and "Breaking Legs"), Jonathan McMurtry ("Waiting 
for Godot" and "Measure for Measure") and Byron Jennings ("Coriolanus") . . . 
</P>
<P>
Auditions for the California Young Playwrights Project at the Gaslamp Quarter 
Theatre are Saturday. Call Larry Hogue at 232-6188 to set up an appointment.

'MALA NOCHE': FIRST FLUSH OF A LOVE FOR FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Mala Noche," screenwriter-director Gus Van Sant has made a movie about 
passion that's actually passionate. Ardor is built right into the imagery. 
</P>
<P>
Made in 1985 for $25,000, shot in black-and-white 16-millimeter film, this was 
Van Sant's first feature (his second is the current critical hit "Drugstore 
Cowboy") and it has the rapturous quality that debut films by highly talented 
directors often have. 
</P>
<P>
The ardor in this film (at the Nuart through Tuesday) isn't only in its love 
story; it's also in Van Sant's experimental, poetic use of the medium. Maybe 
that's why the doomed, unrequited romantic passion at its core nevertheless 
seems weirdly, vibrantly hopeful. Van Sant can't pretend true nihilism because 
he's too enraptured by the possibilities of his new-found art. 
</P>
<P>
The unrequited passion is between Walt (Tim Streeter), who runs a Skid Row 
convenience store in Portland, and Johnny (Doug Cooeyate), a Mexican boy in his 
late teens. The down-and-outers who frequent Walt's store are a passing parade 
of winos and derelicts, and yet he feels at home here. He walks the littered 
streets like the neighborhood's self-appointed mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Since Portland is also a faraway gathering place for young men who have crossed 
the Mexican border illegally, Walt has a more than academic interest in 
cruising its byways. The sullen unreachability of these drifters touches off in 
him an obsessional quest for true love. Johnny, who taunts Walt's passion 
without satisfying it, becomes Walt's fantasy dreamboat. 
</P>
<P>
Adapting a semi-autobiographical novella by the Portland poet Walt Curtis, Van 
Sant makes Walt's tantalization believable, but he also has the wit to show us 
Johnny for what he really is -- that is, as less than a carnal deity. The film 
is caught up in Walt's avid, half-mad pursuit without endorsing it. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant is also canny in the way he sets up the racial caste system between 
Walt and Johnny and his friends. Low on the social ladder as he is, Walt 
realizes he's still in a privileged position compared to the Mexican drifters, 
who covet his conveniences. They covet them, and want to destroy them, too. 
Joyriding in Walt's car, Johnny gleefully bangs it up. The Mexicans' contempt 
for the gringo is mixed with cold calculation. At least one of the boys, 
Roberto (Ray Monge), is willing to have sex with Walt in return for money and a 
place to shack up. Johnny and Roberto's illusionless outlawry is their way of 
both surviving the streets and one-upping the gringos, whose homosexuality they 
abhor. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Streeter, the only professional actor in the cast, is the ideal performer 
for Van Sant. He embodies the film's intuitive shifts of mood -- you're never 
quite sure what he's up to -- but he's also a recognizably grounded character. 
A poetic shimmer may surround him, but he's for real. When he mouths broken 
Spanish to his inamorata, his halting speech is meant to convey the genuineness 
of his love. We can see how Walt survives his lustful obsession by delighting 
in it. He's tickled by the sheer force of his own folly. His self-amazement is 
implicitly narcissistic -- it's the source of his eroticized view of life. 
</P>
<P>
It may be the source of Van Sant's view as well. In "Mala Noche," as in 
"Drugstore Cowboy," Van Sant is working out of an exalted, self-reflective 
mindscape. Everything he looks at -- a waterfall, clouds, the white line on the 
highway reflected in a character's sunglasses -- has a mysterious, impacted 
force, as if they were pieces in a dream mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the characters are caught in a pop continuum not unlike 
Godard's or Warhol's: restaurant neon signs, cigarette packs, product displays 
all have talismanic import. There's something primitive yet deeply 
sophisticated and modern about Van Sant's approach: He recognizes the emptiness 
of the pop landscape but also understands how that emptiness validates people's 
lives. In "Mala Noche" (Times-rated Mature for brief nudity and strong 
language), emptiness is a kind of solace, a turn-on. In these lower depths, to 
experience it is at least to know you're still kicking. 
</P>
<P>

'DR. CALIGARI' AN IMAGINATIVE, HILARIOUS SATIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The consistently outrageous and imaginative "Dr. Caligari," the Nuart's new 
Friday midnight show, would have us believe that the evil director of the 
insane asylum in the classic "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" has a granddaughter who 
wants to take up where he left off 70 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It's an instance of not having broken the mold -- i.e., granddaughter like 
grandfather -- but times have changed. The current Dr. Caligari (Madeleine 
Reynal) presides over her asylum (by a toxic waste dump) like a mad dominatrix, 
and her victims/patients are all caught up in extravagant, crazed indulgences 
in sex and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
This Dr. Caligari is of course not interested in curing anyone, but in 
replicating her grandfather's experiments with the hypothalamus, that part of 
the brain that controls the primal urges. Her goal is to "interface" her own 
hypothalamus with that of her grandfather, whose brain she has preserved, 
apparently hoping to emerge as some sort of indomitable super-woman. 
</P>
<P>
Director-designer Stephen Sayadian and his co-writer, Jerry Stahl, whose last 
midnight-circuit hit was "Cafe Flesh," have created a darkly hilarious satire 
of contemporary aberrations and the gobbledygook we use to describe them. As a 
spoof, "Dr. Caligari" is remarkably well-sustained, and laced with amusing 
lines and observations. Says Dr. Caligari, in a reflective mood: "Funny thing 
about desire. If it's not crude it's not pure." 
</P>
<P>
What really counts the most is the film's terrific stylized look, which is 
bargain-basement surreal created by a striking use of miniature and minimalist 
settings (generally constructed against a black backdrop). The film's nightmare 
fantasy mood is heightened by Mitchell Froom's ominous humming, thrumming 
score. 
</P>
<P>
As deliberately outre a cult movie for those with far-out tastes as "Dr. 
Caligari" (Times-rated Mature) is, it is also the work of true visionaries with 
too much of a sense of humor to be pretentious. 
</P>

GRISWOLDS ON 'VACATION' AGAIN IN A SPLIT-LEVEL COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Hughes, Hollywood's resident humorist of the terrors beneath suburbia's 
halcyon surfaces, has at them again in the sometimes funny, sometimes tasteless 
"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" (citywide). 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' typical all-American family of previous Vacations, the Griswolds -- 
headed by Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) -- have only to hunt 
for Christmas trees or settle down to dinner for something awful to happen. The 
Christmas turkey dries up. Thousands of house lights refuse to glow. The 
Christmas tree explodes and sets Grandpa (William Hickey) on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Every ladder Clark climbs up collapses. Every yuletide decoration clunks him on 
the head. Hordes of relatives keep pouring through the door, a parade of 
undesirables that includes lushes, addle-brains and a matriarch (Mae Questel) 
who ties up her cat in Christmas packages and bumbles into the Pledge of 
Allegiance when called on to say Grace. Worst of all is the sudden arrival of 
Clark's belching bucko of a country cousin, indigent Eddie (Randy Quaid), who 
shows up in an RV with a full chemical toilet and plops himself and his family 
of four down for the duration, leering and handing over his gift list. 
</P>
<P>
This hideous vision of a suburban Christmas gone totally amok is, typical of 
Hughes, encased in a sentimental overview -- like a Norman Rockwell portrait 
with a punk rock backbeat, and spiders nibbling through the frame. 
</P>
<P>
In Hughes' movies, the teen-agers are usually realists, even when they're 
romantics, and their parents are usually crazy -- maybe because they'd rather 
be teen-agers. But, here, Chase's Clark is a mixture: a crazy romantic. There's 
such a fiery obsessiveness behind his desire, constantly thwarted, to construct 
the ideal Christmas that, in a way, he's like Terry O'Quinn's homocidal dad in 
the "Stepfather" movies. Hughes and director Jeremiah Chechik, must know this; 
they deliberately mix up horror movies and sentimental family comedies in their 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
Chevy Chase has not been on a roll lately, and to say that in "National 
Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" he's funnier than in his last six movies combined 
may sound like high praise, until you remember those six movies. "Caddyshack 
II" alone almost throws them into the "minus" laugh range. But here, he does 
what he does best: flat-out slapstick and subversive tear-downs of his own 
smooth image. This sweet, goofball, manic middle-class daddy brings out his 
sharpest reflexes and he gets good support from D'Angelo, the bulging-eyed 
slob-in-excelsis Quaid, and from Questel and Hickey as his dottiest relations. 
</P>
<P>
Chechik, making his feature debut is a TV commercial-music video specialist; 
he's done the glitzy-romantic "Night belongs to Michelob" spots. And the 
incongruous elegance of his style -- the grandiose frames, loaded with 
squeaky-clean suburban iconography -- makes a good setting for Hughes' 
flatulent grotesques. 
</P>
<P>
On the crass side there is some failed "Fish Called Wanda" style vicious animal 
slapstick, the usual loose multi-sketch Hughes construction and sophomoric 
badinage and so much bathroom-level humor that it's no surprise when the sewer 
blows sky high. 
</P>
<P>
That's the oddest thing about Hughes' satiric slant on suburbia: his commingled 
desire to celebrate it and blow it up. Throughout the film, there's a 
suggestion that Clark wants desperately to be free of his family, like the 
childless swingers next door -- which may be why those two are the most 
horrifically abused people in the entire movie. There's also a suggestion that, 
behind this modern, wired-up insanity, there's an ideal holiday gathering, 
which the characters are trying, and failing, to reach. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' demolitions of middle-class Midwestern suburbia have a weird schizoid 
intensity, as if he were fighting his way through to dreams he's rejected, 
while his satiric knife gets encrusted with chocolate globs. Sometimes 
sentimentality and sadism are reverse sides of the same coin -- which may be 
why one scene of "Christmas Vacation" (MPAA rated PG-13, despite raw humor and 
innuendo) fuses imagery from "It's a Wonderful Life" and "The Texas Chain Saw 
Massacre" in a single visual gag. At the end, this cruel and foolish suburban 
Yule twists into a happy, sappy grin. It's a fusion of Rockwell and Capra with 
the age of mass murder and media overkill, but it's really too slick to be 
soft, too cool to be warm.

COMPOSER HOUSTON IN LONG BEACH RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a very slow night at System M, a trendy, storefront nightclub in 
downtown Long Beach that features poetry readings, jazz combos, contemporary 
lizard art hanging on the walls and pumpkin cheesecake with espresso for 
dessert. William Houston, a composer of unabashedly minimalist leanings, 
presented a concert of his own music in a loft above the kitchen, with a 
handful in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. This wasn't a reflection on the quality of Houston's music, which 
may be unassuming but is certainly engaging and pleasantly attractive. On the 
first half of the program Tuesday, Houston, on keyboards, was joined by soprano 
Mary Billings and clarinetist Suzanne Solu for an extensive suite from his 
opera "The XTC of Saint Teresa." The basic texture of the music is simple: fast 
moving, swirling arpeggios from the keyboards, single, sustained chord tones 
from the clarinet, with the soprano singing easily, tunefully above. Harmonies 
are basic and tonal, changing bar by bar and repeated in four-measure chunks. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, there aren't complex cross rhythms (as in Philip Glass) or slowly 
shifting textures (as in Steve Reich). Houston gets in a groove, plays a while, 
then simply moves right on to the next section. His setting of words is direct 
and repetitive. The words "Why don't we wash it in the water" are given 
successive downbeats for each syllable. The words "Don't forget to call me in 
the morning" are repeated, appropriately, 10 times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Billings sang with warmth and conviction, though some of the words were lost in 
the lively acoustics. Houston provided a harpsichord-sounding accompaniment, 
with a bell-like upper register. 
</P>
<P>
A suite of piano pieces by other composers with connecting interludes by 
Houston concluded the program. He played on an old, out-of-tune upright piano 
in the shadows of the loft in a loose though attentive style. He's not a great 
pianist but he got the music across. His interludes effectively linked a 
Debussy Danse with a Schubert Impromptu to a Bach Gigue. The suite was topped 
off by Houston's "Red Fish on Television," a somber two-part piece with the 
naive, Satiesque opening building to a melancholy hymn in octaves, which on its 
final appearance the composer revealed, by singing, as the tune to the words of 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
Also heard were three songs: the urgent "The Busy Bee Has No Time for Sorrow," 
the easygoing "Better Weather" and the subtly contrasted "Dip Him in the River 
Who Loves the Water." TIMOTHY MANGAN

AT THE GALLERIES: PERUVIAN'S ART SOMETIMES POWERFUL, SOMETIMES GRATUITOUS

<TEXT>

Fernando de Szyszlo, Peru's best-known painter, practices an art of fusion, 
melding together European and pre-Columbian motifs, abstract and figurative 
styles. His current show, at the Iturralde Gallery (7592 Fay Ave.) through Dec. 
13, reveals his work also to be of hybrid quality, at one moment rich and 
suffused with mythical power, the next decorative and gratuitous. 
</P>
<P>
Szyszlo, who was born in 1925, studied architecture in his native Lima before 
shifting his focus to art. He lived in Paris, Florence and several American 
cities sporadically throughout the 1950s and '60s, but since then has been 
based primarily in Peru. His work has been collected and exhibited 
internationally, and was recently seen at the San Diego Museum of Art in the 
traveling exhibition "The Latin American Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
The paintings and prints in the Iturralde show, all from the 1980s, speak in 
the highly personal vocabulary of forms that Szyszlo has developed over his 
40-year career. Occasionally, his shapes and patterns resonate with those found 
in pre-Columbian art and architecture. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in each work in the series, "Mar de Lurin" (Sea of Lurin), 
Szyszlo sets a blocky vertical shape before a horizontally striated background. 
The vertical form vaguely suggests a human figure, but its articulated sections 
also recall ancient stele and the colossal columns of Toltec temples. While the 
background appears landscape-like, its undulating layers of patterns also echo 
the meandering geometric ornamentation of ancient Mesoamerican temples. 
</P>
<P>
Szyszlo's affinity with ancient cultures surfaces throughout his work, though 
subtly. In "Anabase," a gouache painting on paper from the series, the artist 
pictures a flat ocher plane studded with squat, pyramidal forms. A knot of hot 
color and swirling shapes rushes toward these structures on the horizon with 
the blind fury of an impending storm. Szyszlo may be pitting the flux and fury 
of modern civilization against the solidity and permanence of the ancients in 
this powerful image, just as he may be representing the classic dichotomy 
between nature (the horizontal) and culture (the vertical) in his "Mar de 
Lurin" series. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest of Szyszlo's images sustain and even encourage such lofty 
interpretations, but others trade this poetic tension for trite decoration, and 
abandon the artist's fiery hues and ominous shadows for a palette of lipstick 
pinks. 
</P>
<P>
After a generation of hard-edged abstraction, minimalism and conceptualism, 
painting has made a comeback on the American scene. Impassioned brushwork flung 
itself with fervor onto gallery walls in the early '80s in the work of 
neoexpressionists, while young "new image" painters and others professing a new 
romanticism have breathed life into an otherwise arid artistic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
For some artists, however, painting never died. Its potential to satisfy the 
senses and nourish the spirit never even waned during the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Geer Morton, for one, has been frosting canvases with lush, juicy pigment for 
30 years, undetered by opposing winds of taste and popularity. "East Coast, 
West Coast," at the Tarbox Gallery (1202 Kettner Blvd.) through Dec. 9, joins 
paintings from a short-term stay in San Diego with works from Maine and 
Northern California, where the artist maintains homes. 
</P>
<P>
Morton's work makes no intellectual claims and has no pretenses of conceptual 
currency. It is refreshingly free of rhetoric, relying only on rich color, 
genuine emotion and uncontrived gestures for its appeal. Morton's creamy tones 
and abbreviated representational style owe much to his mentors of the '60s, Bay 
Area painters Richard Diebenkorn, Elmer Bischoff and David Park, but his work 
feels more modest in intent. He clings to traditional themes -- landscapes, 
floral still lifes, figure studies -- and seeks in earnest to capture the 
fleeting light and mood of each arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Morton's fluid strokes have a natural affinity with their organic subjects, and 
it comes as no surprise that his paintings of cities, with their blocky, static 
monoliths, are the least convincing. Flowers, however, seem to continually 
regenerate his painterly energy, and each arrangement maintains its 
individuality and integrity. A dozen distinct brush strokes in a subtle range 
of tones define a small glass vase in "Porch With Flowers," exemplifying the 
artist's keen regard for even the most nondescript objects. 
</P>
<P>
Deep ochers, teals and violets balance against shimmering whites, golds and 
fleshy pinks in Morton's ceaselessly varied palette. Morton makes each canvas a 
celebration of the transitory moment, for he knows that color and light never 
meet the same way in the same place twice.

The tall rectangles of solid color Roy Thurston paints are dense, crisp blanks 
that unexpectedly soften with prolonged viewing. Rooted in the light and space 
tradition, the artist uses commercial lacquer colors that are thick, rich and 
unsettlingly difficult to pin down. From one angle a painting will appear a 
dull brown geometric scab, from another, it radiates the glossy deep reddish 
hue of fresh blood. 
</P>
<P>
Incised across each painting's surface are precise, needle-sharp horizontal or 
vertical lines that spread out reflected light and tenderize the hard, sanded 
surface. These near invisible lines fuzz color into a softness that belies the 
painting's formal geometry. On one almost black painting, Thurston filled 
grooves with bright blue pigment and burnished the entire surface. It shines 
like fresh asphalt trailing oily neon highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Comfortably mining the art-as-experience field that nurtured artists like Larry 
Bell and Robert Irwin, Thurston's paintings also recall the analytic painting 
of Robert Ryman. Devoted strictly to color and surface, they push the 
parameters of those two elements to make painting an object of formal as well 
as visual contemplation. (Kiyo Higashi Gallery, 8332 Melrose Ave., to Dec. 30.)

Bruce Richards' new weather-vane paintings sure know which way the wind's 
blowing. With his usual symbolic aplomb he looks at love, law, art and luck and 
comes to the unhappy conclusion that these much touted forces are prey to the 
whims and winds of popular opinion. Love is an arrow-shafted pointer 
capriciously turning in the morning breeze; law is blind justice -- a fixed 
lightening rod for change that never moves; art and luck are fickle and spin in 
any direction. 
</P>
<P>
Richards is an able realist painter with a strong feeling for the potent power 
of mundane objects to spill out witty narratives. Like Ed Ruscha, he has a 
particularly keen appreciation for Populist symbols, which he manipulates and 
alters within the painting. In "First Thought," an apple with heart-shaped love 
bites becomes a biblical narrative with a set of underlying assumptions that 
ignite when placed next to the rounded, Venus of Willendorf fertility symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Like a film director, Richards recognizes objects like burnt out matches and 
glass slippers as emblematic icons for thought and feeling. Simply by focusing 
tightly on the objects and aligning them with declarative titles he can unleash 
pent-up associations as entertaining as they are literal. Occasionally he gets 
carried away in the heart-shaped "Courtship" love letter envelopes. The 
envelope idea seems a bit labored, partly hiding a reproduction of a well known 
piece of art in envelopes ripped open in ways that suggest the imagery. But we 
still catch the reminder that in today's art world images have become cultural 
icons, indistinguishable from their makers. (Hunsaker/Schlesinger, 812 N. La 
Cienega Blvd., to Dec. 23.) SUVAN GEER

Part two of a three-part traveling exhibition of prints by artist Bruce Nauman 
is a hard-to-fathom glimpse of his work spanning 1974-1981. The graphics are 
only part of the artist's output in those years, so you can't get a sense of 
his career. But if you know something about his mildly sinister neon texts or 
his stubbornly contrary objects that defy perspective logic, you should be able 
to negotiate this chunk of the artist's unpredictable oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
For an artist who works in so many mediums, from videos to holograms, Nauman 
evidently finds printmaking particularly suited to the quirkiness of his 
message. He plays with the mirror reversals of printmaking. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally he goes for the conceptual jugular as in "Silver Grotto/Yellow 
Grotto," a threatening message about hidden motives buried between lines of 
text and image. 
</P>
<P>
Not known primarily as a printmaker, Nauman's are nevertheless thoughtful out 
and well executed. Some of the boldest images are the most congested with line 
and mark, purposely confounding readability. But even the simplest imagery like 
the box within a box in "No Sweat" can have a chilling sense of menace and a 
perverse sense of humor. (Earl McGrath Gallery, 454 N. Robertson Blvd., to Dec. 
14.) SUVAN GEER

PLAYWRIGHT, 17, BRINGS CHARACTERS TO LIGHT IN DARKNESS OF BARROOM 
</P>

Seventeen-year-old Logan Abbitt thinks his life lacks excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Life in itself is too mundane," he said. "If you don't have an escape you will 
wither and die. Take my life, for example. I wake up, eat breakfast, go to 
school, come home and do chores." 
</P>
<P>
To combat his restlessness, this Chatsworth High School senior has found an 
antidote. His elixir is his imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"I create," he said. "I can dream anything. I'm one of the world's greatest 
dreamers." 
</P>
<P>
Abbitt's fertile mind manifests itself primarily through his writing -- among 
them a one-act play titled "Scratch" that was one of three winning entries in 
the first Young Playwrights Contest sponsored earlier this year by A Directors' 
Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 70 entries, all one-acts, represented 23 high schools and junior 
highs in the Los Angeles Unified School District and Los Angeles County. 
Besides Abbitt, the other winners were Ji Yoon Francis Kim, 17, of Whitney High 
School in Cerritos with "La Fantasia," a play about a priest and his young 
penitent's quest for fulfillment, and Michelle Fugate, 14, of Hill Junior High 
School in Long Beach with "The Unborn Problem," a drama about teen-age 
pregnancy. The three winning entries -- which were not ranked -- were chosen by 
a panel of 12 readers and seven industry judges. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to having their plays produced in December at the Lex Theatre in 
Hollywood, the three winners each received a $1,000 savings bond, and their 
schools will be given $500, said Dorothy Lyman, founder of A Directors' 
Theatre, which owns and operates the Lex. 
</P>
<P>
Established as a nonprofit corporation in January, 1987, A Directors' Theatre 
focuses on producing plays by contemporary playwrights that deal with a variety 
of subjects. The producers, directors and actors are all professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Lyman was interested in developing the Young Playwrights Contest to encourage 
young people to write for the theater. "We're interested in developing writers 
from the next generation," she said. Described as a black comedy, "Scratch" 
deals with the struggle of Scratch, who learns that he is dying of cancer at 
the age of 40. Coming from a wealthy family that never quite met his needs, 
Scratch instead makes a "family" of his acquaintances at the bar where he plays 
pool. But when he learns of his illness, Scratch lacks the courage to tell his 
friends -- and thus he avoids having to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
A pool enthusiast, Abbitt said his mother was once a bar manager, "so I used to 
go to the bar sometimes to help clean up. . . . I got to know the inside of the 
bar. Mom told me so many stories about the people that would go there. Some of 
the jokes in the play are from actual stories she told me." 
</P>
<P>
Although "Scratch" includes the theme of dying, Abbitt says that "when you get 
right down to it, it's about relationships. It's about the separation of 
friends and the ending of relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Lyman chose Caroline DuCrocq Hesseman, the wife of actor Howard Hesseman, to 
direct Abbitt's play. (The cast of four men and one woman will be selected 
through open auditions.) Hesseman said she was particularly impressed with the 
way Abbitt handled the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a remarkable piece for a young person," she said. "He's dealing 
with a profound American tragedy -- parents giving in to material values and 
dedicating their lives to accumulating money. The individual that happens to be 
their child feels he has lost. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the case with the main character. He's incapable of building a life 
for himself. He has a terror of love and attachment," she said. "In pool, 
someone who cannot win is called 'Scratch.' Even his name means he has become a 
loser. He is a man who is doomed." 
</P>
<P>
"Scratch" was Abbitt's first attempt at a play. The idea came to him about 
three years ago but it wasn't until he saw a poster at school announcing the 
contest that he decided to turn it into a play. Abbitt said the writing took 
only about a week, although he did three rewrites before entering the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Since finishing "Scratch," Abbitt has started two other plays, both set in 
bars. "I like bars because they're social places," he said. "Everyone is equal 
there. All the regulars are like family. And it's dark. I like dark." 
</P>
<P>
Among Abbitt's other works in progress are two novels: One dealing with a group 
of friends who become shipwrecked, the other focusing on a challenge between a 
boy and his stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
Abbitt said he never considered writing as a career until about a year ago. 
After completing a paper on "Huckleberry Finn" and getting a good grade on it, 
he figured he must have some talent. "It hit me, if I enjoy doing this -- and I 
do it well -- why not do it for a living?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
To help with character development, Abbitt said, he relies on years of 
role-playing games, among them "Dungeons and Dragons." 
</P>
<P>
"I look at the situation from the character's point of view," he said. Since 
Abbitt is involved with acting at school, the role playing has also helped him 
develop the characters he portrays. 
</P>
<P>
Besides living in Oregon, where he attended grades seven through his sophomore 
year in high school, Abbitt has also lived in Kentucky, Indiana, Oklahoma and 
Northern California. His parents divorced when he was 6 and he lived with his 
mother until last year, when he moved to Reseda to be with his father, a 
theater professor at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Abbitt is undecided what he'll do after he graduates from high school. Along 
with writing, Abbitt has also toyed with the idea of moving to Alaska to study 
broadcasting. At 17, armed with abounding eagerness and optimism, the 
possibilities seem endless. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I want to do everything," he said. "I want to be in the entertainment 
field. I want to be like Woody Allen -- direct, act and produce. Anything 
that's creative, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lex Theatre is at 6760 Lexington Ave. in Hollywood. Performances of the 
three winning one-acts are at 8 p.m. Dec. 21-23 and 26-30, with additional 
performances at 2 p.m. Dec. 23 &amp; 30. For reservations and additional 
information, call (213) 465-8431.

TIME TRIP TO '50S STEAKHOUSE IS THE PAST WITH NO BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Want to travel through time without calling on Michael J. Fox? Drive to 
Chadney's steak and seafood house in Burbank. Inside, when your eyes become 
accustomed to the red-tinged gloom, you will think you've landed sometime in 
the steakhouse era of the late '50s and early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
The dim lighting, the hefty, carved dark wood, the burgundy banquettes, the 
menu (except for a couple of modern anachronisms) bespeak a time when ambience 
and alcohol, beef and lobster plus bar-maid-attentive service meant luxury. 
</P>
<P>
These days, mostly studio personnel relax in the past over good, stiff drinks 
at lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
But if you think that joining the regulars in this trip back in time will also 
bring back some fabled era of good, old-fashioned cooking, you will most likely 
be disappointed. Except for a first-rate T-bone steak, my experiences at 
Chadney's served mainly to increase my appreciation of the New American cooking 
that is all too easy to take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
An appropriately thematic preamble to a meal here would be a Manhattan or 
better still an Old Fashioned. But it's hard to stick to pure surf and turf 
when it comes to appetizers. Everything is in the right era, but, it would 
seem, the wrong restaurant. Egg flower soup -- the usual beaten egg in chicken 
broth stuff -- takes you to the chop suey houses of the '50s. Then suddenly, 
you're whisked to Little Italy with a traditional Italian-American mozzarella 
marinara that comes with an OK onion-based sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Split pea soup, the very smooth, slightly thickened sort, brings you safely 
back to steakhouse comfort. But the real blast from the steakhouse past comes 
with the asparagus appetizer: several large, white, soggy spears -- fresh from 
the can -- on some lettuce leaves. "Oh," replied the cheery waitress to my 
astonishment, "you thought the asparagus would be fresh?" I did. 
</P>
<P>
Of the entrees, only a superb, large T-bone steak (21 oz., $18.95) would lure 
me back to Chadney's for more than just nostalgia. It's loose-textured, fully 
flavored and tender -- but not fall-apart buttery. Unfortunately, other entrees 
aren't as good. Most of the steak cuts are fine but not wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Fish dishes can be slightly dry and painfully plain. Vegetables also. The odd 
token modern dish -- angel hair pasta with tomato, basil and olive oil -- isn't 
bad but not really worth a second go-round. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, desserts are of the sweet, sweet variety. 
</P>
<P>
My advice is to reprogram your time traveler to, let's say, December, 1989. The 
present is a very good time for cooking here in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Chadney's, 3000 W. Olive Ave., Burbank. (818) 985-5622. Open 11:30 a.m. to 
9:30 p.m. Mondays, 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 5 to

PREVIEW: A LITTLE HEAVY METAL IN THE NAME OF AMNESTY

<P>
The Nymphs' Inger Lorre knows how to work a crowd. Take last Saturday night at 
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. The sold-out arena was packed with a 
punk-nostagic crowd waiting for the reunion appearance of the Buzzcocks, whose 
last new album was released eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On stage were the Nymphs, fronted by Lorre, who strutted and sashayed about the 
stage with a microphone in one hand and a forest-green feather boa cuddled in 
the other. Her voice cut easily through a layer of guitars and drums and crowd 
noise that seemed to get louder and more impatient with each new song the 
Nymphs played. When Lorre tore into the Nymphs' version of the Badfinger 
classic, "Come and Get It," the tension in the audience was at its peak. They 
wanted the Buzzcocks, not the Nymphs. 
</P>
<P>
"Get off the stage," someone yelled. Others booed. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I know who you want," Lorre scowled back like some rock and roll Lenny 
Bruce handling a roomful of hecklers. "I see your mohawks. Don't you know punk 
was dead 10 years ago? Can't you think of anything more original?" 
</P>
<P>
The crowd roared . . . and not necessarily with disapproval. Lorre epitomized 
the punk attitude -- angry, tough, unrelenting -- that many in the audience 
were so nostalgic for. And here it was being shoved in their faces by a band 
that usually plays at . . . heavy metal shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going anywhere," she snarled. "We're getting paid for this." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, when the Nymphs take the stage at the Country Club in Reseda, they'll 
be headlining . . . but they won't be paid. Neither will any of the opening 
bands. It's a benefit concert for Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the show will be distributed to several Amnesty International 
college chapters, which function much like regular Amnesty chapters. But 
because college populations drastically change every semester, the campus 
groups work only on short-term projects, such as the letter-writing campaign 
earlier this summer to China after the massacre at Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to set up a table at the concert where people can send letters on 
behalf of prisoners in South Africa," said Sung Kim, the organizer of tonight's 
concert. She works for the Cypress College Amnesty chapter, which is sponsoring 
the concert. This is the largest fundraising effort the junior college chapter 
has attempted. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard at first, and a little scary," said Kim, a 20 year-old-business 
major. "But I found that a lot of the bands and the managers were excited about 
doing the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nymphs, Jasmine Bomb, Clyde, If Tommorow and Sativa Luv Vox appear at 
tonight's Amnesty International Benefit at The Country Club, 18415 Sherman Way, 
Reseda. Doors open at 8 p.m. Tickets cost $13 and are available through 
Ticketron. For information, call (818) 881-5601.

'DAY-CARE DILEMMA' WAS ACCURATELY TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with special interest "Day Care Dilemma" (Nov. 1). You accurately 
depicted a problem with which the County of Los Angeles is successfully coping. 
The county is a major employer in Southern California. As such it has the same 
concerns as any other major employer in assisting its workers to meet their 
family obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far the county has: opened two day-care centers with a licensed capacity 
for 156 infants and preschoolers (East Los Angeles, Sylmar); developed plans 
for opening four additional centers (Torrance, Downey, Alhambra, Civic Center); 
provided leadership and networking opportunities to businesses, labor and the 
community through the Child Care Advisory Board and the child Care Resources 
Committee; implemented telecommuting and alternative work schedules; instituted 
flexible benefit plans which allow employees to set aside up to $400 per month 
tax free to pay for dependent care services. 
</P>
<P>
Issues of recruitment and retention of a skilled work force and productivity 
are of great importance in the public sector.

WHAT ARE THEY EATING TO MAKE THEM CRAZY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to historian Mary Matossian, contaminated food may have played a key 
role in important historical events ("Rye Explanation for Past Craziness," Nov. 
24). For example, food poisoning brought on by a fungus that grows on rye grain 
produces a natural form of the hallucinogen LSD, and this may have been 
responsible for massive peasant outbreaks before the French Revolution and 
symptoms synonymous with witchery. 
</P>
<P>
Her theory seems very interesting. Now if only I could determine what 
contaminated food heavy metal rockers, TV evangelists and most politicians have 
been eating, I think I could make the world a better place. I guess we are 
indeed what we eat.

SPECIALIZATION POSES ITS OWN LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article discussing the views of biologist Stephen Jay Gould ("The Cosmic 
Lottery," Nov. 28) portrays man's existence as a mere happenstance. Gould 
displays the point of view characterized by the weakness of specialists in 
general: studying a part of the whole and extrapolating a conception of the 
whole based on an intensive, detailed knowledge of the part studied. 
</P>
<P>
The article refers to two other recent books, "Chaos", and "A Brief History of 
Time." These books develop some important concepts that, taken together, 
provide some important supplements to Gould's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Our universe has not always existed, having had a beginning with the beginning 
of time, space, and matter 15 billion years ago. Since this beginning, we have 
progressed from apparently simple and homogeneous "chaos" to the ever more 
complex and orderly. The universe at its initial creation had the capacity and 
propensity to so evolve, just as the apparent formlessness of water vapor has 
the capacity and propensity to form complex snowflakes. 
</P>
<P>
If a scientist studied only a single snowflake in his career, he might conclude 
that the pattern of the snowflake is a matter of chance; analogously, a 
scientist focusing on the emergence of a single species, e.g., Homo sapiens, 
might conclude that the emergence of this species was, likewise, a matter of 
pure chance. But both the specialist in the formation of a single snowflake and 
of the single species would be failing to perceive that a process of 
progressive evolution is at work in the formation of both. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the ever-more-complex, observable today, which has arisen from 
preceding stages of lesser complexity, is a process involving a 
15-billion-year-long chain of interactions of the elements that were produced 
at the instant of initial creation. Scientists today acknowledge that the 
capability for the formation of today's orderly universe, including all living 
and non-living, was a capability existing from the universe's beginning. Man 
can reap joy from bearing witness to this orderliness and contributing to it as 
a participant in the process of ongoing creation. 
</P>
<P>
By this view, man is not a fortuitous accident; rather, he is himself a 
creation that can find joy and purpose in his existence.

NO UNIFORM RESPONSE TO SCHOOL DRESS CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re your article "Following Suit" (Nov. 14), the idea of uniforms in public 
schools is not a new idea. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles junior high school I attended in the 1930s required us to wear 
navy blue pleated skirts and middy blouses. They looked great and, personally, 
I loved them. Further, there was no pressure about what to wear, which was the 
original purpose of the idea at Belvedere Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
After I left that school, uniforms were no longer required, due to pressure 
from parents to allow the young people more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Now parents across the U.S. are considering uniforms in public schools, because 
of the extreme pressures by children's peers to wear costly "in" clothes. In 
the '30s, all clothes were considered costly; hence the idea of uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
What goes around comes around -- with almost any idea.

ODD, LOVING LIFE WITHOUT FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sleeping Arrangements by Laura Cunningham (Knopf: $18.95; 195 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
The traditional nuclear family may be an endangered species, but the remarkable 
uncles in Cunningham's loving and witty memoir prove that we may have been 
defining "family" too narrowly. Gabe and Len fill the bill despite their almost 
complete lack of ordinary qualifications, providing all the care, support, 
understanding and love Lily needs. You can't write a book like this if you've 
grown up in a Cape Cod cottage with Mom, Dad, Sis and Junior. 
</P>
<P>
Lily's early childhood has been peripatetic from birth. Though her 
high-spirited mother Rosie claims to have been married to a war hero named 
Larry Moore, he's an invisible presence from the start; the only evidence of 
his existence a faded snapshot taken in an office. For Lily's first eight 
years, her father's absence is explained by a war in which he's a daredevil 
pilot, a perfectly satisfactory answer until Lily learns that America has been 
at peace since 1945. Happily for her, the Korean crisis erupts, and the fiction 
is maintained until Rosie decides that Larry has served his purpose and can die 
in action. He's briefly and intensely mourned, but by then, Lily has a vibrant 
world of her own. After years of being shunted from one relative's apartment to 
another, sleeping on sofas, cots, and floors, Rosie has managed to secure an 
apartment in a then-livable part of the Bronx, and the neighborhood supplies 
Lily with two marvelously recalled best friends, double the number most 
children have; triple if you count Rosie, the most adoring, fun-loving mother a 
girl could want. 
</P>
<P>
When Lily is 8, the Saturday afternoon adventures with Rosie are preempted by 
dreary sojourns in doctors' waiting rooms, and then, suddenly, by Rosie's 
hospitalization. Rosie's younger brother, Uncle Gabe, appears, an "old 
bachelor" at 38, deeply religious but marvelously high-spirited and 
imaginative. He's a poet and writer of Jewish gospel songs, a genre for which 
the market is severely limited. Within a tragically short time, he's joined by 
Uncle Len, a 6-foot 6-inch giant of a man, who turns up at midnight, haggard 
and unshaven, his possessions packed in Manila envelopes. At 40, he's also 
unmarried and eccentric in entirely different ways. His materialization 
indicates that Lily's mother has died, and together, the ill-matched brothers 
set about making a home for their niece. 
</P>
<P>
They succeed marvelously, though the home does not begin to fit the standards 
established either by the neighbors or by the Board of Education. The uncles 
allow Lily to choose the furnishings for the apartment, acceding to her 
selection of a gold lame couch and candy-striped walls as if she were a 
graduate of Otis-Parsons. Breakfast is tuna patties and popcorn, though 
eventually Uncle Len masters a pressure cooker, performing his chef's chores in 
pith helmet and apron. Unlike Gabe, he's an agnostic, but accommodating and 
willing to let Lily make her own choice between orthodoxy and pure reason. 
Neither uncle bothers with non-essentials, nor do they see any reason why she 
should conform to school standards of grooming, clothing, or attendance. As 
long as she's happy, they're content, having no basis of comparison whatever. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected arrival of their elderly mother, "Etka from Minsk" complicates 
matters, but soon everyone adjusts to the presence of a semi-rational woman 
convinced she's the most brilliant and beautiful creature on earth. Etka fits 
right in; her peculiarities causing only minor disruption. She arrives with an 
elaborate wardrobe and 100 spiral-pad notebooks containing her life's work, 
"Philosophy for Women," the gravamen of which is that Etka was right not to do 
housework. "She had cleaned her home once and realized that wasn't for her." 
Lily becomes Etka's editor and typist, agreeing to produce 50 copies of this 
oeuvre for the sum of $25, which, to a fourth-grader, seems somewhat more 
munificent than it actually is. Though it soon becomes apparent that Etka 
suffers from memory lapses and kleptomania, Lily is not only tolerant but 
helpful, quickly abandoning her romantic image of a cookie-baking, 
story-reading grandmother and accepting this extraordinary substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Compassion and wit are a rare literary combination, but "Sleeping Arrangements" 
is illuminated by both. Original, quirky, poignant and hilarious, the book is 
followed by a brief afterword, in which Cunningham questions the wisdom 
received from Tolstoy that "Happy families are all alike." Convinced that joy 
takes infinite forms but sadness only a few, she proves her point on every 
page.

CZECHOSLOVAKS TO DEMOLISH FENCE ON AUSTRIAN BORDER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government announced Thursday that it has ordered the immediate dismantling 
of security fences along Czechoslovakia's frontier with Austria, doing away 
with yet another stretch of the Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, negotiations intensified to form the first genuine coalition 
government in Czechoslovakia in 40 years, as the discredited Communist Party 
undertook to restore its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Marcel Jansen said that Interior Ministry work crews had 
begun dismantling the heavy fencing along segments of the Austrian border, 
concentrating first on tourist areas. Border posts, watchtowers, fences and 
electronic surveillance devices will all be dismantled, Jansen said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The move, intended to ease restrictions on Czechoslovak citizens and improve 
relations with Western Europe, will further diminish the Iron Curtain, a 
barrier that has suddenly become a relic of another time. 
</P>
<P>
In the moves toward a coalition government, those involved in the talks were 
working against a Sunday deadline set by the opposition group Civic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The new government, which is likely to have several non-Communist members, 
would be transitional. It would rule only until free elections can be held, 
most likely in the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Such a government was made possible Wednesday when the National Assembly voted 
unanimously to end the Communist Party's dominant role in the nation's 
political life. 
</P>
<P>
As the effort to form a new Cabinet went forward, a source close to Prime 
Minister Ladislav Adamec said its exact composition and balance would be "a 
reflection of how far he dares to go." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Adamec sees his job as building a "government of national 
reconciliation" capable of steering the nation through its present crisis to 
free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec, who broke with the Communist Party hierarchy early last week by making 
the first open contact with Civic Forum, was described as having a relatively 
free hand in approaching non-Communists for his Cabinet. It was not clear how 
much control he would have in selecting Communist members. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum spokesman Jiri Dienstbier said opposition representatives met with 
three senior Communist officials, including Politburo member Vasil Mohorita, 
and with members of the small People's Party and Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Dienstbier reaffirmed Civic Forum's initial stand that it does not want to be 
represented in the new Cabinet. Instead, he said, the group has established 
itself as a veto agency, reserving the right to block the nomination of 
individuals it considers unworthy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've said clearly that we'll monitor how the Cabinet is constituted for 
people who have no political, moral or any other competence, rejecting those 
directly responsible for the last 20 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum appeared to be consolidating its opposition role. It was given 1 
1/2 hours of prime time on Prague Radio on Thursday and is expected to move 
this weekend from its headquarters in the Magic Lantern Theater to offices made 
available by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the opposition group met with a U.S. senatorial delegation 
that arrived in Prague on Thursday and with senior Czechoslovak military 
officials about alleged harassment of army officers and their families since 
the collapse of the hard-line Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the group issued a statement calling on the public to refrain from 
such behavior, Dienstbier said. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party was attempting to adjust to its new role after Wednesday's 
vote abolishing its monopoly on political power. At Prague Technical 
University, reformist party members, who have formed a so-called Democratic 
Forum within the party, met for the first time in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
In a crowded lecture theater, they talked of abolishing the party militia and 
party units within the military. They appealed for volunteer help to get their 
movement going. 
</P>
<P>
They handed out a statement declaring that there is only one condition for 
membership in their group: rejection of any kind of power monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts regard the Democratic Forum as an attempt by reformists to 
capture the party and turn it into a West European-style social democratic 
party. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on the other side of Prague, the newly appointed spokesman 
for the party Central Committee, Josef Hora, told reporters that the Communists 
now are just one of several political parties. 
</P>
<P>
There was considerable back-pedaling by some party members. Josef Matekja, 
editor of the intellectual weekly Tvorba, told reporters attending the Central 
Committee news conference: "The era of dogma has gone. All that was presented 
as Marxism over the last six decades was in fact Stalinism in its very essence, 
which of course is no philosophy at all." 
</P>
<P>
Economist Valtr Komarek, a Communist who has been critical of government 
policy, also condemned the ideology. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been clear for several years that communism is nonsense," he said. "The 
only thing that can be a serious subject for discussion is socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Komarek, who has been mentioned by some as a possible candidate for prime 
minister, rejected that idea, saying he would prefer to be an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Dan Fisher contributed to this story.

THE MALTA SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH HEADS FOR MEETING 'FULL OF PROMISE' 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a departure speech remarkable for its warmth and optimism, President Bush 
headed for Malta on Thursday, saying that his meeting with Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev represents "the beginning of a process as full of promise 
as any that we've known." 
</P>
<P>
He said he and Gorbachev "can work toward a level of European security, 
prosperity and peace as yet unknown in our lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union "are not in some kind of competition; 
rather we're both working to make the world a more peaceful one," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush has stressed repeatedly that no agreements will be reached at the 
two days of meetings this weekend aboard U.S. and Soviet warships off Malta, he 
and Gorbachev are expected to discuss the revolutionary changes in Eastern 
Europe, regional conflicts and the general direction of arms-control 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a powerful and historic opportunity," Bush said, adding that it was 
made possible by the strength of the U.S. commitment to its Western allies. 
</P>
<P>
To reassure the North Atlantic Treaty Organization about the continued U.S. 
commitment to the defense of Europe, Bush has conducted a series of pre-summit 
consultations with other NATO leaders. He will give the NATO heads of state a 
post-summit briefing in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pentagon officials took pains to head off an anticipated 
Soviet initiative designed to engage the United States in negotiations on naval 
arms control. In Rome on Wednesday, Gorbachev offered to open discussions with 
the United States and Italy, and perhaps in the United Nations, aimed at 
eliminating permanent U.S. and Soviet naval bases in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
As the Malta summit has neared, the Soviets have drawn their naval forces in 
the Mediterranean down to unusually low levels: four warships and two naval 
support vessels. As U.S. naval officials have watched the withdrawals, they 
have girded for a Gorbachev initiative that some believe could go so far as to 
propose the withdrawal of all nuclear weapons from surface ships. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding in Rome to Gorbachev's hints, echoed 
nervous U.S. naval officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have absolutely no reason to believe that it's in our interest to enter into 
any kind of arms-control measure," Cheney told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Before Bush departed Thursday evening from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., for his 
overnight flight aboard Air Force One, he was sent several suggestions from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In one letter, 177 members of the House and 27 members of the Senate expressed 
opposition to the U.S. stand in favor of some role for the Khmer Rouge rebels 
in an interim government in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge is blamed for the deaths 
of 1 million Cambodians during its murderous rule in the late 1970s that was 
recounted in the movie "The Killing Fields." 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that any U.S. effort directly or indirectly to promote a 
power-sharing role for the Khmer Rouge -- no matter how minimal -- would 
represent an implicit legitimization of a movement the world finds abhorrent 
and would constitute a profound shift in our policy," said the letter written 
by Rep. Chester G. Atkins (D-Mass.) and signed by the 204 lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Another 31 members of the House urged the President to give priority to waiving 
the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which denies "most-favored-nation" trade status to 
the Soviet Union while that country restricts free emigration. The House 
members contended that rapidly increased emigration of Jews and others from the 
Soviet Union this year has entitled the Soviet Union to such a "reward," if 
Bush gets assurances that the emigration trend will continue. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 15 senators urged Bush to press Gorbachev to support independence 
for the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States has never recognized the Soviet Union's takeover 
of the three countries by military force in 1940, the senators said U.S. trade 
or economic assistance must be linked to progress toward self-determination for 
the Baltic republics. 
</P>
<P>
In another development related to the Malta talks, Rep. Stenhy H. Hoyer (D-Md.) 
said the Kremlin has resolved the vast majority of human rights cases on a list 
presented to Soviet leaders a year ago. 
</P>

Meanwhile, in Malta, preparations were near completion for the arrivals of Bush 
and Gorbachev today. 
</P>
<P>
The Maltese government has closed the Marsaxlokk Harbor, where the U.S. and 
Soviet ships will be anchored, to everyone but local fishermen. The large bay, 
normally a container shipping port, is separated from the Mediterranean by a 
narrow neck. It is one of several harbors in the Maltese islands and was chosen 
largely because it is less busy and easier to secure. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials insist publicly that they do not believe that Malta poses any 
unusual security problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's greater concern about Malta than other places," said 
Allan M. Cramer, spokesman for the Secret Service. "Sure, in some countries 
more things show up that we will have to contend with, but we still take all 
trips seriously -- whether it's Malta or England."

Rebel planes bombed President Corazon Aquino's presidential palace in Manila 
today in support of a coup attempt by troops who took over at least two 
military camps and closed the international airport. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were killed and 64 wounded in fighting between the rebels 
and loyalist troops. 
</P>
<P>
Early today, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced that 
President Bush has authorized U.S. military aid to help the Aquino government. 
The extent of the U.S. aid was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
However, Aquino said in a statement today that U.S. jets "are joining the fight 
to give air cover to our ground troops. This should complete the annihilation 
of the air assets of the rebel forces." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign military attaches said several U.S. F-4 jets flew repeatedly over 
Manila during the morning, but it was not clear whether they took part in any 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel pilots in World War II-vintage single-engine planes made at least three 
bombing runs over Malacanang Palace on Thursday night, less than three hours 
after Aquino first went on state television and vowed to crush the coup 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Renato de Villa, military chief of staff, said rebels had seized Villamor 
Air Base, headquarters of the Philippine air force; the army headquarters at 
Ft. Bonifacio; the government broadcast center; a private television station; 
and Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The airport was reported closed to all 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting also erupted around the Philippine military headquarters in 
Manila, with rebel forces rocketing units loyal to Aquino from helicopter 
gunships. 
</P>
<P>
Loyalist forces were fighting back but rebel troops reportedly had captured the 
military's logistics command center within the headquarters compound of Camp 
Aguinaldo. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel planes also attacked the nearby Philippine Constabulary headquarters, 
setting it ablaze, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
A bomb later damaged the transmitter of RPN television, knocking off the air 
the only station the government could use to broadcast assurances to the public 
and appeals to the rebels to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Fidel V. Ramos said earlier on Manila radio that he would 
bring up an "overwhelming force" to crush the revolt involving about 1,000 
troops. The revolt has been linked to a dismissed colonel, Gregorio (Gringo) 
Honasan, leader of a violent army mutiny against Aquino on Aug. 28, 1987, in 
which 53 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Honasan escaped from prison last year and remains at large. He gave clandestine 
interviews about a week ago threatening a move against Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, in a statement announcing U.S. aid issued from Air Force One as Bush 
was heading to a U.S.-Soviet summit in the Mediterranean, said, "At the request 
of President Aquino, the President has authorized U.S. military assistance to 
the government of the Philippines in defending itself against a coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"This assistance is intended to allow the democratically elected government of 
the Philippines to restore order. The President also is determined to protect 
the lives of Americans in the Philippines," Fitzwater said. The statement gave 
no details and the extent of the aid was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has continually voiced strong support for Aquino, who 
restored democracy in the Philippines after 20 years of authoritarian rule by 
the late Ferdinand E. Marcos ended in a coup in February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater on Thursday warned that all aid would be suspended if Aquino is 
removed in a coup. She has defeated five previous coup attempts. 
</P>
<P>
" . .According to U.S. law, all U.S. foreign assistance to the Philippines 
would be suspended if the elected government of the Philippines were removed by 
a military coup," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military restricted travel by its 40,000 troops, military dependents 
and Defense Department civilians stationed at the six bases here. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel warned Americans living in Manila to stay 
in their homes as violence escalated. Up to 100,000 other U.S. civilians live 
in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, U.S. officials said it appeared the coup attempt was 
confined to about 200 army rebels. "I think it's just another one of those 
flare-ups," said one Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
As three T-28 aircraft bombed and rocketed the compound of Malacanang Palace, 
presidential guards responded with small arms fire. "They're bombing us!" a 
palace staff member cried over the telephone. "We're going down!" 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes Sytangco, deputy presidential spokeswoman, said Aquino was safe. 
Sytangco said she could not give a damage report because no one could leave the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
No official casualty figures were available more than eight hours after the 
insurrection began. But witnesses and reporters said at least 10 people were 
killed and 64 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"An attempt to seize power by force is again being made," Aquino said in a 
nationally televised address. "Our forces have the situation under control. We 
shall smash this shameless and naked attempt once more. 
</P>
<P>
"This nation must never be allowed to fall unto the hand of tyrants. Those who 
wish to be kings are here once more, despite repeated rejections by the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Jaime Sin, Roman Catholic archbishop of Manila, urged his countrymen 
"to support the duly constituted authority." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Ramos said the rebellion began shortly after midnight 
Thursday when about 200 marines tried to enter Villamor. About two hours later, 
air force troops who had been guarding the gate left their posts and mutinous 
marines took over security at the base perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels fired heavy weapons at the headquarters of the 205th Helicopter Wing, 
setting fire to the building. 
</P>
<P>
Truckloads of mutineers, wearing white arm bands and carrying red flags, 
entered the government radio and television station and the adjacent private 
station ABS-CBN. The significance of the red and white colors was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Mutineers at the government television station cheered and shouted: "Cory is 
dead! Cory is dead!" when they saw the attack on the palace. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolfo Aguinaldo, governor of Cagayan province and a former lieutenant 
colonel, said in a radio interview that soldiers in his northern Luzon area 
supported the mutiny and "we are bringing in artillery and armor." 
</P>
<P>
Manila radio stations also reported units had mutinied near Legazpi, 220 miles 
southeast of Manila. Retired Brig. Gen. Jesus Hermosa, a security adviser in 
Cebu province, said a boatload of mutineers had landed near Cebu City's Mactan 
International Airport, 350 miles southeast of Manila. Mactan, the country's 
second major airport after Manila, is a major transportation hub. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a new coup attempt swept Manila last month after a dispute over plans 
to reorganize the Philippine Constabulary. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is considering a proposal to abolish the Constabulary, a branch of the 
armed forces, and replace it with a civilian-controlled national police. 
</P>
<P>
Honasan's coup attempt in August, 1987, was the bloodiest and most dangerous of 
the half-dozen revolts against Aquino. The colonel had played a key role in the 
military mutiny that started the uprising against Marcos, who died in exile in 
Hawaii on Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
He became disenchanted with Aquino, however, accusing her of failing to crush 
Communist rebels and rid the government of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in December, 1987, but escaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay 
the next April.

KEY W. GERMAN BANKER KILLED IN CAR BOMBING 
</P>

<P>
Alfred Herrhausen, the head of West Germany's largest bank and one of the most 
powerful men in Europe, was killed in a bomb attack Thursday while he was en 
route to his office in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
The office of the chief federal prosecutor said that the Red Army Faction, a 
terrorist organization, had claimed responsibility for the attack in a letter 
left at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The blast that killed Herrhausen destroyed his armored BMW limousine and was 
heard as far as three miles away from Bad Homburg, a Frankfurt suburb where 
Herrhausen lived. His driver was severely injured. 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old executive, a personal friend of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and an 
economic adviser to Kohl's government, was on his way to his office at the 
Frankfurt headquarters of the Deutsche Bank, of which he was chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, when informed of the killing, denounced it as a "cowardly and brutal 
murder." He described Herrhausen as a friend and patriot. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever knew him," Kohl said, "knows he was an outstanding businessman, an 
important banker and one of the most important spokesmen for the German economy 
around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Herrhausen had been "an eminent 
representative of responsible social and political policies in West Germany" 
and that he had "made a great contribution to aid programs for Third World 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, a spokesman for Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who was meeting with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said "the prime minister and President 
Gorbachev expressed their regret at Herrhausen's death." 
</P>
<P>
Herrhausen had strong ties to the Soviet Union and had recently made it clear 
that his bank was prepared to expand toward the East as a result of the decline 
in Communist power there. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday he had flown to London to complete arrangements for the Deutsche Bank 
to take over the British merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, a move designed to 
expand the West German bank's role in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But his status as West Germany's No. 1 banker had drawn criticism from people 
who said they feared the power of the banks, and particularly that of the 
Deutsche Bank because of the latter's interests in many important private 
companies, including key industrial enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank recently pressed for a merger between the auto maker 
Daimler-Benz AG, of which the bank is a major shareholder, and the aerospace 
concern Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm (MBB). This role helped make Herrhausen a 
potential target for terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything related to weapons," a fellow banker said Thursday, "is seen by the 
general public as immoral." 
</P>
<P>
Heribert Hellenbroich, former head of West German counterintelligence, 
suggested that Herrhausen's part in the Daimler-Benz-MBB arms industry merger 
could have drawn terrorist attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, for the extreme left wing, the largest West German bank and its chief 
executive were a symbol of the hated capitalist system. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Herrhausen) is an unusual phenomenon in terms of what one expects from the 
chairman of Deutsche Bank," the liberal weekly Die Zeit once commented. "He 
does not act like a traditional banker, but instead more like a captain of 
industry who by sheer force wants to transform his institution into a company 
with 'international identity' active in all areas of finance." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the bank's industrial holdings in 1,700 West German and 200 foreign 
firms, Deutsche Bank under Herrhausen recently began moving into such new 
financial areas as insurance and mortgage banking. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing attack occurred just after 8:30 a.m., about 500 yards from 
Herrhausen's heavily guarded residence in Bad Homburg, a fashionable spa. As 
Herrhausen's BMW moved along, followed by a vehicle carrying security 
personnel, an explosive device was detonated, apparently by remote control. 
</P>
<P>
The car was thrown into the air. Its doors, hood and trunk flew open, and its 
windows were shattered. The force of the explosion knocked out the windows of 
homes and other buildings in a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
Policemen found the letter claiming responsibility not far from the shattered 
car. It bore the Red Army Faction symbol of a Kalashnikov rifle superimposed on 
a star, but neither police nor the prosecutor's office made public the letter's 
details. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the chairman of the Deutsche Bank's French branch said that the 
Frankfurt office had been warned by West German anti-terrorist services of a 
possible attack. 
</P>
<P>
"For several weeks security measures had been tightened at the Deutsche Bank's 
headquarters in Frankfurt," Hesse Zu Leiningen told French television. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources here said the Red Army Faction, thought to have been all but 
extinct, was preparing "a new phase of its struggle." Until Thursday's 
incident, the group was not known to have mounted any such action for more than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Herrhausen, tall and elegantly dressed, looked 10 years younger than he was. 
Fluent in English and other foreign languages, he went into banking after 
working in the energy field. He joined Deutsche Bank in 1969 and became its 
chief executive last year. He brought a modern management style to the bank, 
emphasizing not so much titles and seniority as ability and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he had sought to reduce Third World debt, specifically promoting a 
plan to give financial aid to Poland. He also was talking about establishing 
banking links in the Soviet Union. On Wednesday night the bank had given a 
dinner for a delegation of high-level Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
The news of his death stunned the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Trading was 
interrupted for a minute of silence. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Army Faction dates back to the late 1960s, when it mounted the first of 
a series of attacks that made it one of the most notorious terrorist 
organizations on the Continent, targeting mainly industrial and economic 
leaders in an effort to destabilize the West German government. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years it was known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang, after its founders 
Andrea Baader and Ulrike Meinhof. Both committed suicide in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The gang caught the world's attention on May 11, 1972, when it killed a U.S. 
Army officer and wounded 13 other persons in a bomb attack on the headquarters 
of the U.S. 5th Corps at Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the next 11 years, it occupied the West German Embassy in 
Stockholm in an effort to bring about the release of two prisoners; killed a 
number of West German officials, financial leaders and industrialists; hijacked 
a Lufthansa airliner to Somalia; attacked U.S. Air Force headquarters at 
Ramstein, and set off a car bomb at the Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
In all, according to the authorities, the gang has been responsible for the 
deaths of more than 60 people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The terrorist Red Army Faction grew out of West Germany's student unrest of the 
late 1960s. Its depredations began with an arson attack on a department store 
for which Andreas Baader was arrested in 1970. He was freed by cohorts at 
gunpoint a few weeks later and went underground to form the Baader-Meinhof 
Gang. Its aims were violent overthrow of the West German social order, 
including "monopoly capitalism." Gang members sought contact with Third World 
guerrilla movements and were trained by leftist Palestinian guerrillas. When 
its leaders were arrested in 1972, the group tried through terrorism to force 
the release of the jailed figures: Baader, Ulrike Meinhof, Gudrun Ensslin, Jan 
Carl Raspe and Holger Meins. Meinhof committed suicide in prison in 1976. And 
Baader, Ensslin and Raspe committed suicide in jail in October, 1977, after 
West German troops ended a Red Army Faction hijacking of a Lufthansa plane in 
Mogadishu, Somalia. The faction has remained isolated in society, with 20 to 30 
men and women considered the current hard core. But it continues to find 
sympathizers who lobby for more rights for its jailed members. In recent years, 
the Red Army Faction has increased cooperation with terrorist groups in Italy, 
France, Belgium and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEUTSCHE BANK: A PROFILE 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank is the largest bank in West Germany by a wide margin. Here are 
some facts and figures: 
</P>
<P>
Its $175-billion volume of business ranks it No. 22 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
It has 55,000 employees and 1,530 branches serving 7 million customers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank was founded 117 years ago in Berlin. After World War II, the 
Allies shut down its Berlin headquarters, and all of its branches in the 
Soviet-occupied sector of Germany were closed. In 1952, the bank was broken up 
into three separate banking institutions, but five years later, these were 
re-merged into a single Deutsche Bank, with headquarters in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
About 62% of its business and 83% of its earnings in 1988 were in West Germany, 
underscoring the bank's strong influence in the economy and reflecting its 
powerful industrial holdings. The value of these holdings are estimated at more 
than $7.35 billion, including a 28.1% share of Daimler-Benz, West Germany's 
largest company.

BUSH REJECTS EXTENSION FOR CHINA STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Thursday rejected legislation that would have enabled tens of 
thousands of Chinese students to stay on in this country indefinitely, saying 
that he is opposed to "congressional micromanagement of foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush announced that he is acting on his own to grant the Chinese 
students some of the same protections that were contained in the bill passed by 
Congress. Specifically, the President said he is lifting the current 
requirement that students must return to China for at least two years after 
completing their studies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's action does not have the force of law and thus could be revoked at any 
time. But for now, it appears to ensure that Chinese students will not be 
forced to go home and face reprisals from the Chinese regime for taking part in 
pro-democracy demonstrations in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The President exercised a "pocket veto," meaning that he did not take any 
action on the bill within 10 days after receiving it, as is required for a bill 
to become law when Congress is not in session. The effect is to kill the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the bill, sponsored by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), 
was approved 413 to 0 in the House and by voice vote in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll pass it again," Pelosi told The Times Thursday night. She said Bush's 
contention that he is granting Chinese students the same protection contained 
in the legislation is "baloney. . . . If he was really serious, all he had to 
do was sign the bill. If he really wanted to do the same thing we did (for the 
students), why wouldn't he sign the bill?" 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials said they hope that the President's own actions to 
protect the students -- plus additional lobbying by the Administration and 
perhaps some changes over the next few months in the political climate inside 
China -- may help dissuade Congress from further action. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that China, as its leaders state, will return to the policy of 
reform pursued before June 3," said Bush in a written message explaining his 
reasons for rejecting the legislation. "I further believe that the Chinese 
visitors would wish to return to China in those circumstances. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chinese students criticized Bush's action. "We consider it 
a tragedy," said Zhao Haiching, a Harvard University student and chairman of 
the Committee on Chinese Student Affairs. "The key thing (behind Bush's veto) 
was the opposition of the Beijing government." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) termed Bush's action "a grave 
mistake." Bush, he said, "has made it easier for the Chinese government to 
succeed in its campaign of intimidation to silence the students' cry for 
democracy in China." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation passed by Congress would have applied to all Chinese students 
and scholars who have come to this country with the official sponsorship of the 
Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
According to State Department and congressional estimates, there are about 
40,000 students from the People's Republic of China in this country now -- a 
number larger than that from any other nation. About 70% to 80% of these 
students have come here on visas saying that they are sponsored by the Chinese 
government and thus have been subject to the requirement to return home for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Many students say that this classification of government sponsorship is 
misleading, because the Chinese government requires such visas even of many 
students who get their tuition and expenses paid by American universities or 
other private sources. 
</P>
<P>
Bush insisted Thursday night that he is "supportive of the humanitarian 
principles" that prompted Congress to pass the legislation protecting Chinese 
students. However, he said, such legislation "puts America in a straitjacket 
and can render us incapable of responding to changing circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The President also complained that passage of the legislation could jeopardize 
future educational exchange programs between the United States and China. A 
Chinese deputy foreign minister warned last week that there would be "serious 
consequences" for relations between the United States and China if Bush signed 
the legislation on Chinese students. 
</P>
<P>
Bush suggested that he believes the Chinese regime will follow through with its 
threats. "It is in the national interest of the United States to promote the 
exchanges of technical skills and ideas between Chinese and Americans," said 
Bush in his written message. "It is my hope that by acting administratively, we 
will help foster the continuation of these programs."

The double-decked Nimitz Freeway, or at least what is left of it, suffered a 
magnitude 5 earthquake Thursday afternoon -- for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
No, Mother Nature was not wreaking some strange vengeance on the remnants of 
the freeway that collapsed and killed 42 people during the magnitude 7.1 
earthquake that shook the Bay Area on Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, it was a team of civil engineers from UC Berkeley and Caltrans who were 
shaking an isolated block-long section of the freeway to determine why a 
mile-long section of it collapsed during the October temblor. By doing so, they 
hope to learn how to retrofit other freeways in the area -- and throughout the 
state -- so that they are less likely to collapse in a future quake. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many tragedies during the Oct. 17 quake," said UC Berkeley civil 
engineer Jack Moehle. "But the greatest tragedy would be if we didn't take time 
out to learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
During the next two to three weeks, the research team will gradually increase 
the amount of force applied to the Nimitz segment each day until they get up to 
about magnitude 7.5. Eventually, after the supporting columns have been 
reinforced using techniques that are expected to be applied to other damaged 
freeways, Moehle and his colleagues will shake it even harder to see whether 
they can make it collapse despite the reinforcements. If it does collapse, the 
engineers will know they will have to explore other types of reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
But it won't collapse very far. Construction crews have erected a strong 
supporting structure under the top deck and, if it falls, it will only fall 
about six inches or so. "The most anyone will hear is a dull thud," Moehle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Television crews and reporters who flocked to the test site here Thursday 
hoping to see the structure swaying violently were disappointed. A motion 
sensor on one end of the freeway, looking something like the antenna of a car 
radio, swayed back and forth, but the movement of the structure itself was not 
readily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
During the shaking, workers casually walked around on the top deck, monitoring 
instruments and videotaping the scene, seemingly oblivious to the simulated 
quake. Others went on with preparations for the ultimate test, in which 
powerful hydraulic jacks will force the top deck from side to side in an effort 
to knock it loose from its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The force for Thursday's simulated quake, however, was provided by a 
deceptively simple apparatus: two off-center weights connected to a two-part 
vertical shaft axis firmly attached to the top deck of the freeway. As the 
motor-driven shaft rotated the weights in opposite directions, it applied a 
sideways force to the freeway similar to that produced by a wet blanket in an 
out-of-balance washing machine, Moehle said. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum effect occurred when the weights were rotated at what is called the 
resonant frequency of the structure, about 2.2 cycles per second. At that 
frequency, each rotation of the weights reinforced the shaking of the structure 
in the same way that small pushes applied to a swing cause it to go higher and 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
To increase the size of the simulated quake in the coming weeks, the workers 
will simply add more weights to the shaft. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have offered a number of explanations for why the upper deck of the 
Nimitz collapsed unexpectedly during the earthquake. The growing consensus 
seems to be that the columns supporting the upper deck were not anchored to the 
lower roadway firmly enough. 
</P>
<P>
As the earthquake shook the freeway structure, those columns apparently broke 
free from the lower deck, straddling that deck and allowing the upper deck to 
fall straight down. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, by a quirk of fate, the shaking of the ground in the Oakland area 
apparently matched the resonant frequency of the structure. That and loose soil 
under some sections magnified the effects of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
After the preliminary studies now under way are completed, the engineering team 
will attempt to reinforce the points where the columns are anchored. Moehle 
noted, however, that they have not yet decided what might be the most effective 
way to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals include jacketing the column with an additional layer of cement, 
attaching steel girders to it and tying together the columns on opposite sides 
of the deck with steel cables. 
</P>
<P>
After all the tests are concluded, Moehle said, engineers will be able to be 
more confident that repairs being made on other freeways "will really do the 
job."

REAGAN STEALS SHOW AT FUND-RAISER FOR WILSON'S CAMPAIGN 
</P>

<P>
There is nothing quite like a Republican dinner starring Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Call it Hollywood Squares. 
</P>
<P>
Up on the dais Wednesday night at the Century Plaza were rows of faces you'd 
expect to see on that game show or on the covers of magazines in the 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
The event -- which kicked off a two-month period of campaigning for the 1990 
governor's race by Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson -- was Reagan's first 
political fund-raiser since he left the White House early this year. 
</P>
<P>
And though he is no longer President, Reagan is clearly still the star for 
California Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
But he had others with him on the dais. Such as the two guys with big shoulders 
and lethal hands: Sylvester Stallone and Chuck Norris. And Moses: Charlton 
Heston in a full beard. The truck drivers' favorite: Claude Akins. Not to 
mention Scott Baio, Bruce Boxleitner and Julie Newmar. 
</P>
<P>
Down in the well of the ballroom, more than 700 well-dressed folks ate and 
watched the famous people eat -- as though they really were watching Hollywood 
Squares. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly the audience stared at Reagan, whose gray hair was the main subject of 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Prez looks like a Supreme Court justice all of a sudden -- very 
distinguished," said Joyce Valdez, who goes back 25 years with Reagan in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez, considered by many to be the national Republican Party's best 
fund-raiser, put Wednesday's event together to round up $700,000 for Wilson's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But though the event was for Wilson, the senator was virtually a non-presence. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was he hard to spot among all the star power, when he spoke he did not 
take the opportunity to outline what he would like to do if elected to the 
highest office in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Wilson briefly introduced Reagan and credited his presidency with 
bringing about the tumultuous changes in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan in turn heaped on Wilson the kind of praise that the senator has never 
heard from the former President. 
</P>
<P>
Not all that long ago, Wilson was shut out of the Reagan circle because he 
backed former President Gerald R. Ford against Reagan in the 1976 GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday night, Wilson was formally handed the torch of the California 
Republican Party by the man who put that party in the vanguard of the country's 
conservative movement. 
</P>
<P>
"As California heads into the 1990s and prepares for the 21st Century," Reagan 
said, "we need someone at our helm who believes that our California must be 
beautiful, safe and prosperous. And since I've known Pete Wilson, he's been 
that man." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan reminded the GOP faithful that when he was elected California governor 
in 1966, "a kid state assemblyman named Pete Wilson" also went to serve in 
Sacramento for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan has now accepted Wilson to the extent that on Wednesday night he even 
used a speech written by the senator's spokesman, Otto Bos. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with Bos' brand of humor were tipped off right after Reagan 
began speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete's not one for raising taxes," Reagan said, "unlike the Democrats, who 
look at your paychecks the way Colonel Sanders looks at chickens." 
</P>
<P>
Bos later confirmed it had been his speech in the hands of the Great 
Communicator -- "I'm on a cloud!" Bos swooned. 
</P>
<P>
For Wilson, Wednesday night's dinner not only marked the passing of the sword 
in the California GOP (Gov. George Deukmejian was absent so Reagan got to do it 
by himself). The event was also the beginning of what Wilson's advisers hope 
will be an active two months in the gubernatorial campaign now that the U.S. 
Senate is in recess. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his Senate duties, Wilson has been trying to campaign from 3,000 
miles away, a handicap not faced by state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and 
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who are battling for the 
Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But things began looking up for Wilson right before the Reagan dinner. 
</P>
<P>
His quest for the governorship was endorsed earlier in the day by the National 
Latino Peace Officers Assn., a group that has backed Van de Kamp twice for 
attorney general and that last year supported Democratic presidential nominee 
Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday, Wilson will begin laying out his "agenda for the '90s" in a 
major address in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the Reagan dinner showed, the campaign dollars keep rolling in 
for Wilson. By the end of the year he will have more than $5 million in pocket 
on his way to what some political insiders predict will be a $20-million war 
chest.

BUSH SIGNS BILL CREATING CIA OVERSIGHT POST; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: CONGRESS GETS ITS WAY OVER A RELUCTANT PRESIDENT. THE NEED FOR AN 
INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR AROSE DURING THE IRAN-CONTRA INQUIRY.

<P>
President Bush on Thursday reluctantly signed into law a bill creating a new 
independent inspector general within the CIA, two years after such a move was 
called for by congressional investigators of the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of the new inspector general's office, similar to the oversight posts 
at other government agencies that review federal programs and seek to ferret 
out abuses, was part of a broader bill authorizing U.S. intelligence activities 
for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
While the precise spending authorized by the bill is secret, it reportedly 
involves between $25 billion and $30 billion for intelligence collection and 
analysis, upgraded spy satellites and other hardware, and covert operations 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Bush said the new inspector general post "could impair the 
ability of the CIA to collect vitally needed intelligence information by 
creating a perception that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
To secure cooperation, the CIA "must be able to assure foreign individuals and 
organizations that their identities, the fact of their association with the 
United States, and the information they provide are not subject to exposure," 
said Bush, a former CIA director. 
</P>
<P>
CIA Director William H. Webster said Wednesday that while the provision could 
damage confidence of foreign intelligence services in the agency's ability to 
keep secrets, he would seek to rebuild safeguards against compromising 
intelligence sources and methods. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said his objections were mitigated by a provision that would let the CIA 
director kill any inspector general's investigation he believed might 
compromise national security interests. 
</P>
<P>
The new inspector general would be appointed by the President and confirmed by 
the Senate, and the auditor's reports would be available to the House and 
Senate committees that oversee U.S. intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the agency's inspector general is appointed by the CIA director and 
reports only to him. That arrangement has caused friction with the House 
Intelligence Committee, which has been denied access to some reports. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional investigators who probed the Iran-Contra scandal said the 
agency's inspector general lacked independence and did not have "the manpower, 
resources or tenacity" to uncover arms-for-hostages transactions or the 
diversion of profits to Nicaragua's rebels.

A jury found Amtrak guilty Thursday of dumping raw sewage into Florida 
waterways in the national rail passenger line's first such criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
The state filed charges of commercial littering after Amtrak refused to stop 
dumping raw human wastes from moving trains onto the tracks and into the St. 
Johns River and Rice Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak contended that federal law exempts it from state pollution control laws. 
The dumping practice, dating back more than a century, has also come under fire 
in several Western states. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak has 20 days to file a motion for a new trial on the four littering 
convictions. Each count carries a maximum penalty of $5,000. A company attorney 
said Amtrak would appeal the decision.

MIAMI OFFICER TELLS JURORS MOTORCYCLIST 'AIMED AT ME'

A police officer who shot a black motorcyclist testified in his own defense 
Thursday, telling jurors he fired only because he thought he was about to die. 
</P>
<P>
"He just came straight at me and he just revved the motorcycle," officer 
William Lozano, 31, testified. "He was just aiming at me. I was just only able 
to turn my body, draw my gun and shoot." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony was broadcast live on television and radio in Miami, where three 
days of racial violence broke out following the Jan. 16 shooting. Cable News 
Network carried Lozano's testimony live nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Twice before in this decade, innocent verdicts favoring policemen accused of 
killing blacks have led to rioting, and the Miami and Metro-Dade police forces 
are on alert for renewed violence. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution witnesses testified that the Latino officer, who faces two counts 
of manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist and a passenger, coolly took 
aim and fired as the bike was about to speed past him while being pursued by a 
police car. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano told the court that he did not see the motorcycle until the last second 
because his attention was on the lights of the approaching squad car. He said 
he spotted the bike only after it crossed into the traffic lane where he stood. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano's attorney Roy Black asked how close the motorcycle came. 
</P>
<P>
"(So) close that I thought I might die, that I was going to be run over and I 
was going to die," he said. "I feared for my life." 
</P>
<P>
Lozano described how the situation quickly degenerated as an angry crowd 
gathered around the two victims. The bullet struck the driver, Clement Lloyd, 
23, in the head, killing him instantly. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, 
died the next day of head injuries suffered in the subsequent crash. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a target for every person there," Lozano testified, saying he was 
"getting hit right and left" by rocks and bottles at one point. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, prosecutors picked away at Lozano's testimony that he did 
not see the oncoming motorcycle until just before he drew and fired. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant State Atty. John Hogan pointed to testimony from two officers who 
interviewed Lozano after the incident. They said he told them he entered the 
street because he "became aware" a police car was chasing a motorcycle.

President Bush signed legislation Thursday giving members of the House a pay 
raise to nearly $125,000 by 1991 but giving a smaller boost, to about $100,000 
a year, to senators. 
</P>
<P>
The two-tier pay system was approved by Congress shortly before the end of the 
congressional session in November and was incorporated into a sweeping package 
of ethics reforms for lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The differences in the pay scales resulted because the House voted for a 25% 
pay increase in 1991 that the Senate refused to take. Senators voted to limit 
their raise to a 9.7% cost-of-living increase, but under the new rules senators 
will be able to keep more outside income than House members. 
</P>
<P>
Senators and congressmen currently receive $89,500. 
</P>
<P>
House salaries will climb to $96,600 next February, to about $99,500 on Oct. 1 
and to about $124,400 on Jan. 1, 1991. Senate salaries will increase to $98,500 
in February, and to $101,400 next Oct. 1 and stay at that figure. 
</P>
<P>
Honorariums for House members, such as speaking fees, will be banned at the end 
of 1990. For senators, the limit on such income will be cut from the present 
$35,800 to $23,586. 
</P>
<P>
The pay for federal judges and high-ranking officials in the executive branch 
will climb at the same rate as House members' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The President's action was announced as he left the White House for his weekend 
summit in the Mediterranean with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, Bush noted that the ethics portion of the new law is 
based on legislation he sent to Congress last April and includes "important 
adjustments to compensation for all three branches of the government." 
</P>
<P>
The ethics provisions put a ceiling on gifts that members of Congress can 
receive, except from relatives, and limits privately funded speaking tours to 
four days inside the United States and seven days for overseas travel. 
</P>
<P>
The law also repeals, effective in 1993, a provision of House rules that allows 
members elected before 1980 to convert campaign funds to personal use when they 
retire. It also freezes immediately amounts that can be converted before 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The new law also requires more detailed financial disclosure and bans lobbying 
by former members and top staffers on Capitol Hill for one year -- a rule 
similar to that already in effect for top executive branch officials.

HONECKER LIABLE FOR PROSECUTION

<P>
East German authorities Thursday stripped former leader Erich Honecker of 
immunity from criminal charges and began an investigation of alleged abuses of 
power by Honecker and other disgraced Communist Party officials. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also sealed off a country estate where Honecker and other ousted 
leaders have lived, apparently to prevent removal of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The moves were the strongest indications to date that the former leadership 
will be made to account for alleged abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is equal before the law," Communist Party chief Egon Krenz said on 
national television. He said the accusations against Honecker and others are 
"serious and unworthy of a Politburo member." 
</P>
<P>
The official ADN news agency reported later that more than 10,000 East Germans 
marched in the city of Erfurt to protest special privileges for top party and 
government figures. 
</P>
<P>
ADN announced a criminal investigation into alleged abuse of power by Honecker, 
former Premier Willi Stoph, and former Politburo member Guenther Kleiber, who 
are all in seclusion. Their whereabouts is not publicly known. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Honecker, who was dropped from power Oct. 18, was under 
investigation on suspicion of having misused his office for personal gain. It 
gave no details of the alleged abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz, a former protege of Honecker's, has been pressing for exposure and 
punishment of past errors and excesses as a means of repairing his party's 
tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz faces widespread opposition from many pro-democracy activists, as well as 
within the troubled party hierarchy, which is scheduled to meet in a crucial 
session Dec. 15-17. 
</P>
<P>
The party that has dominated government and society for 40 years also is 
wrestling with challenges and demands for broader power-sharing by the 
fledgling political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party last week announced an internal investigation of reported 
wrongdoing by Honecker, his top lieutenant Guenter Mittag and other party 
figures recently removed from positions of authority. 
</P>
<P>
Mittag was thrown out of the party Nov. 23 in the first punitive action against 
any of the ousted officials. 
</P>
<P>
The aging party figures who were part of the hard-line regime headed by 
Honecker for 18 years are accused by pro-democracy forces of having lined their 
pockets at public expense while the national economy slipped continuously 
behind that of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Regional government chief Hartmut Boecker said that the immunity Honecker was 
earlier entitled to was suspended "to facilitate a criminal investigation and 
inquiry," ADN reported. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities also have imposed a security cordon around Honecker's 
residential estate to "prevent the removal of material from the buildings," 
Boecker was quoted by ADN as saying. 
</P>

East German newspapers reported Wednesday that Stoph had abandoned his opulent 
home in a former nature preserve after hauling out artwork and furniture. He 
left behind expensive electronics, imported wine and other evidence of the 
lavish life style previously enjoyed by the party elite.

Honecker, 77, has not been seen in public since his ouster six weeks ago, and 
is reported to be seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz initially was seen as the former leadership's handpicked successor, and 
he was therefore widely mistrusted. But under public pressure for social and 
economic reforms, the new party leadership has agreed to talks on the nation's 
future, beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders have also promised to give up their constitutional mandate for a 
"leading role," and have agreed to work toward free elections.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jaroslav Hutka just didn't fit in after the Prague Spring. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he was a political dissident, at least not at first. But the songs he 
wrote and sang were a bit unorthodox. And with his long hair and beard, he was 
different from the humorless men who took power in Czechoslovakia after the 
reform movement of 1968 was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear to them that I was not one of them," he said Thursday over the 
kind of lunch that only a few weeks ago he thought he would never have again. 
</P>
<P>
Hutka lasted longer than a lot of others; but eventually the pressure, the 
surveillance, the police interrogations and, finally, the threat of prison, 
convinced him it was time to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Stripped of his citizenship, he climbed into his red Skoda on Oct. 17, 1978, 
and with his wife headed for the Netherlands. He was certain that the border 
crossing at Rozvadov would be the last he would see of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to thousands of university students, who were in grammar school when he 
left, and to some of his dissident friends who managed to stick it out, Hutka 
was proved wrong last Saturday, when he became the first of Czechoslovakia's 
well-known, post-1968 political emigres to be allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
A few others have followed in the heady days since, coming home to witness -- 
and take part in -- an extraordinary political transformation they hope will be 
more lasting than the one that occurred 21 years ago and shaped their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they will prove to be the vanguard of a mass movement remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
To some officials, the emigres represent an important pool of talent that could 
help rebuild the national economy with knowledge acquired in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be useful for us and our republic," said Valtr Komarek, head of the 
Economic Forecasting Institute and a supporter of the opposition group Civic 
Forum. "We will try to help them return." 
</P>
<P>
But Civic Forum complains that Czechoslovak embassy officials in some countries 
are refusing permission to political emigres who want to return. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how many of the estimated 100,000 Czechoslovaks who emigrated 
during the post-1968 crackdown want to come home, even if the reforms continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only a few individuals who are coming back now," an Interior Ministry 
official said Thursday. "It's too early to know what will happen in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat from a country with a large Czechoslovak emigre population agreed 
with this assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"The floodgates haven't opened yet," he said. "They may be waiting and 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who have been allowed back into the country in the last few days 
have already left again because of commitments in the West. For example, actor 
Pavel Landovsky told the Socialist Party newspaper Svobodne Slova that he drove 
from his home in Austria to the Czechoslovak border Sunday almost as a lark. He 
had been turned away the day before, but this time he was allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
"I came without even a toothbrush," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hutka, the singer who went to the Netherlands, said that he too will go back, 
to his new home in Cologne, West Germany, although he now expects to spend 
about half his time here. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will be a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even if they stay only a short time, these emigres are making their mark on 
the revolution of 1989. Hutka was scarcely off the plane from Cologne when he 
was whisked to Prague's Letna Parade Ground, where he performed for more than 
500,000 of his countrymen at a rally organized by Civic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
His first song, written in 1972 and familiar from underground recordings to 
most Czechs at the rally, was about smiling faces and human freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Hutka has also appeared on state television since his return, and last Tuesday 
he joined Landovsky and Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright and Civic Forum 
leader, at Prague's Theater on the Balustrade. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought it was a dream," a newspaper writer observed. "Landovsky, 
Havel and Hutka together on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
Hutka, who was 20 at the time of the Prague Spring, did not believe in it at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Russians came, I began to believe that there was something in it," he 
said. "But for me (the Czechoslovak reformers) were still all Communists. No 
better. So I couldn't believe them. 
</P>
<P>
"After the invasion came the question marks. What is the nation? What is our 
national identity? Before that I never thought of such things." 
</P>
<P>
He followed his own formula for survival: "You can't fight them because they 
are too strong." Besides, he said, "if you try to fight them, you are involved 
in their politics, so I had this idea -- to find another world as if they 
weren't here." 
</P>
<P>
He began to build his performances around a collection of early 19th-Century 
Moravian ballads. These, he said, along with new ballads, which he continued to 
write, "were part of our world, and this world was free of all those tanks." 
</P>
<P>
The ballads were not part of the accepted cultural agenda of the hard-line, 
post-reform regime, and that made them suspect. The pressure increased, and in 
1975 Hutka was thrown out of the official Union of Performing Artists. This 
made his professional situation even more tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the decision by many of his friends to sign Charter 77, the 
declaration of human rights. Within a few months, Hutka added his name, and the 
interrogations got worse. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to know everything I knew," he recalled. "I told them nothing, so 
they were very angry with me." 
</P>
<P>
The authorities opened a criminal case against him for engaging in 
"unauthorized enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
"At one moment, I was sure it was either jail or emigration," he said. "The 
time was terribly difficult for me. People were very frightened. I decided, OK, 
I'm going." 
</P>
<P>
In the West, he said, he spent his time singing, writing and thinking. For a 
long period, he thought there was no solution, but "then Gorbachev came." 
</P>
<P>
He recognized Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a potent force for 
change, not only in the Soviet Union but in Czechoslovakia as well, but he 
thought the process would be slow. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a month ago," he said, "I thought it would take two or three more years. 
No, not that long ago -- before Nov. 9." 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 9 was the day the East German authorities opened the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
When his friends called from Prague and promised to organize a welcoming 
committee for him, he said, he thought: "That's the way to do it. Alone I can't 
do it. But with people around. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
He had second thoughts, he said, even as his plane neared Prague. He was not 
afraid, just curious. 
</P>
<P>
Was he excited about coming home? 
</P>
<P>
Not really, he said. Rather, he felt "absolutely peaceful, a nice, peaceful 
happiness."

President Bush, trying to tighten the economic screws on Panama's Gen. Manuel 
A. Noriega "and his puppet regime," Thursday banned Panamanian-flag vessels 
from entering U.S. ports after Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"This ban is consistent with international efforts to further isolate the 
Noriega regime, which is currently shunned by the democratic nations of Latin 
America and around the world," the White House said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, announced as Bush prepared to leave for his weekend summit at Malta 
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is in addition to a wide array of 
U.S. economic sanctions already in place against Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who is under indictment in the United States on drug-trafficking 
charges, has resisted U.S. efforts to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
The action will affect about 1,500 merchant ships of more than 1,000 tons gross 
that call each year in U.S. ports, according to State Department estimates.

BUSH AIDES HOPE MALTA HAS SPARKLE; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: THE PRESIDENT IS AIMING TO END A LACKLUSTER YEAR ON A HIGH NOTE. HE 
SEES THE MEETING AS A 'POWERFUL OPPORTUNITY.'

<P>
Despite his efforts to lower expectations about his meeting with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush is aiming for significant 
understandings, if not formal agreements, that would put a positive finish on 
an otherwise lackluster first year of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Several Bush advisers said the President is approaching the summit with 
confidence that he is in a good position to reach understandings with Gorbachev 
on several issues, including a speedup in conventional arms reductions and a 
cooperative approach to addressing regional disputes and the emerging new order 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in his interest to lower expectations while at the same time planning 
moves that can tag the year a success after a rather mediocre beginning," said 
a Republican strategist and frequent Bush adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't ignore the drug issue or the budget deficit but couldn't do much 
about either," the adviser said. "His one big legislative objective -- capital 
gains -- went down the tube. So he turns to the foreign stage, where he may 
have more control, and (he) hopes anything he brings back from Malta will be 
played as an unexpected breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to White House staff members shortly before his departure Thursday, 
Bush acknowledged that the summit will provide "a powerful and historic 
opportunity" to address areas of mutual concern with Gorbachev, particularly 
the changes sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"And in that spirit, I will extend the offered hand with confidence, conviction 
and real hope," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday and Sunday meetings aboard U.S. and Soviet warships off the coast 
of Malta will climax a month of "expectations" game-playing by the White House. 
Even the President has engaged in "spin control," a process of trying to 
influence news coverage that usually is left to aides. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush has deplored "euphoric expectations" and denied that any deals will 
be made, several advisers have been busy -- both publicly and behind the scenes 
-- emphasizing that the President hopes to find common ground with Gorbachev on 
several subjects. The primary focus will be on the rapidly changing events in 
Eastern Europe that are bringing the Cold War to a close. 
</P>
<P>
At a briefing for reporters, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the 
President will be "exploring opportunities for mutual advantage across the 
board in our relations" with the Soviet Union. He said Bush will discuss at 
least five issues with Gorbachev: Eastern Europe, regional conflicts, arms 
control, the Soviet economy and Soviet political reform. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet support for leftist regimes and insurgencies in Central America "remains 
the biggest obstacle to an across-the-board improvement in United States-Soviet 
Union relations," Baker declared. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior Bush adviser said the President -- in pressing Gorbachev to ease 
up on the aid the Soviets send to Cuba and Nicaragua -- "will be very tough and 
(will) ask why, with the new thinking and loosening of the Communist grip on 
Eastern Europe, there is the old thinking of promoting Marxist guerrilla 
activity in Central America." 
</P>
<P>
However, the political and economic reforms in Eastern Europe and the Soviet 
Union are almost certain to dominate the agenda of the Malta summit. With the 
President having reacted cautiously so far to the reforms, the meeting will be 
Bush's first opportunity to put his own stamp on the historic developments. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the summit, polls show that Americans have a strong sense that Bush 
is responding to events, rather than leading them. But so far, they approve of 
the President's cautious approach, apparently because events have changed so 
rapidly and radically and because the changes generally have been viewed as 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if they thought Bush had "a clear blueprint for the future" or was 
"mostly trying to catch up with recent developments," fully two-thirds of 
respondents in a recent Los Angeles Times poll said he was following events, 
not leading them. Only 17% said they thought Bush had a clear blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
Although critics have faulted Bush for reacting too timidly to events in 
Eastern Europe and elsewhere, "the public doesn't buy that criticism," said Bob 
Teeter, the President's own pollster. "We've got tons of evidence to that 
effect," Teeter said. "The Democrats cooked that up back in September." 
</P>
<P>
Teeter said a poll he conducted in October showed that when asked how they 
thought Bush had been handling his responsibilities in general, 63% of 
respondents said "about right," while only 31% said "too cautious." Only 2% 
said "too bold." 
</P>
<P>
Such numbers reinforce the dominant view among Bush's advisers that the public 
does not want bold new adventures in either foreign or domestic policy and that 
it would be willing to reward the President with another term as long as 
nothing goes seriously awry during his watch. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bush's advisers are concerned that the public's attitude has made 
it difficult for the President to gain much credit for the changes sweeping 
Europe, changes that Bush personally called for in West Germany after the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization meetings last May. In a speech at Mainz, he 
declared the need for a Europe that is "whole and free," but said a common home 
is not possible as long as "the family within it is not free to move from room 
to room." 
</P>
<P>
These advisers see the Gorbachev summit, with the international spotlight it 
inevitably will throw on Bush, as his best opportunity to claim some credit for 
the changes. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of international politics, the President should get a big leadership 
plus out of this," Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, said in an 
interview. "In fact, he's going to a summit when the Western countries are in 
an incredibly strong position at the geopolitical level by virtue of the 
Communist countries turning to democracy and Western values." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, while not suggesting that Bush would provide surprises or offer bold 
initiatives at Malta, noted that the President, after being widely criticized 
before the NATO summit for failing to advance fresh ideas or proposals, 
surprised critics by offering a sweeping arms reduction proposal that he 
declared would "transform the military map of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
NATO enthusiastically embraced the proposal -- the boldest initiative of Bush's 
presidency so far -- setting the agenda for arms control negotiations with the 
Soviets for at least a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
The President has stressed that he will make no agreements on arms reductions 
at Malta and will consult the NATO allies before considering such proposals. 
Even so, Bush aides said he could reach an understanding with Gorbachev that 
would pave the way for a formal agreement when the two leaders are expected to 
meet again in the United States next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Bush supporters see the Mediterranean summit as almost risk-free for the 
President since both he and Gorbachev are supporting the changes taking place 
in East Europe and neither appears to have anything to gain by upstaging the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any pitfalls, only opportunities for Bush to think through with 
Gorbachev the problems that the Soviets have and explore how he can be 
helpful," said Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking Republican on the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. "This is a very important opportunity for the 
President, and he is approaching it vigorously." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has consulted widely in anticipation of his six or seven hours of meetings 
with Gorbachev. He has conferred by telephone or in person with leaders of all 
the NATO countries and has had numerous sessions with his own national security 
advisers and with a wide range of experts from various institutions. 
</P>
<P>
His advisers and supporters insist that, despite criticism to the contrary, the 
President has a clear idea of where he wants to guide U.S. foreign policy. But 
even his friends express a nagging doubt about how well he is communicating 
those ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never known a time when low-key professionalism was better suited to 
events," said Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), a longtime friend of Bush and a close 
ally in Congress. Leach said Bush and his foreign policy team exemplify that 
sort of professionalism, but he agreed with criticism that the President "is 
not articulating" his sense of where events are heading. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bush was widely criticized last month after he invited television 
cameras into the Oval Office to record his comments on the dramatic decision by 
East Germany to open the Berlin Wall. The President appeared pensive, almost 
downcast, in sharp contrast with the joyful scenes of Germans dancing atop what 
had been the starkest symbol of the Cold War division of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's aides were forced to spend most of the rest of the week creating 
openings in speeches and photo opportunities for the President to try to create 
an enthusiastic image. 
</P>
<P>
The President's tepid response to appeals for aid to reform movements in Poland 
and Hungary earlier this year also resulted in complaints -- even from some 
Republicans -- that he needed to do more. 
</P>
<P>
During visits to Poland and Hungary in July, Bush offered relatively limited 
financial assistance -- a $100-million Polish-American Enterprise Fund to help 
spur new business ventures and a similar $25-million enterprise fund for 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several months, as GOP leaders joined in a chorus of criticism 
that he was doing too little, the rapid changes in Eastern Europe forced the 
Administration to accept bolder measures. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than come up with a new plan that he could call his own, Bush left 
the decision up to Congress, which earlier this month approved a plan that 
would provide nearly $1 billion in different types of aid to Poland and Hungary 
over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of communications already has forced Bush to back away from his 
original plan to have only a small U.S. contingent of about 20 staff members 
accompany him and Secretary of State Baker to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Bush changed his mind after learning that the Soviets were planning to take a 
large number of officials to the summit to brief the press and present their 
side of the proceedings. The White House, fearing Gorbachev would steal the 
spotlight, quickly increased the number of officials making the trip.

A law student who attracted strong police suspicion in the nation's longest 
unsolved serial murder case is no longer considered a possible suspect, Seattle 
officers said. Gonzaga University Student Bar Assn. President William Jay 
Stevens II had been jailed in the deaths of 49 women, a case called the "Green 
River" killings, taking its name from a river near where the first five victims 
were found. Stevens, 39, is being held in the Spokane County Jail without bail 
awaiting trial on federal firearms charges.

A man shot his wife and raped two teachers in front of 19 children in a 
kindergarten classroom in Natchez, Miss., while holding police at bay with a 
pistol, authorities said. Officers from the Natchez Police Department and Adams 
County Sheriff's Department stormed the classroom after an instructor grabbed 
the .38-caliber revolver from the assailant, Assistant Police Chief George 
Rutherford said. Rutherford said Police Chief Eddie Jones had talked to Larry 
Bates, 35, on the school's intercom system and "distracted him long enough for 
one of the teachers to grab the weapon." The man's wife, Adria Bates, 40, a 
teacher aide at the school, suffered gunshot wounds to the scalp and back. She 
was listed in stable condition at Jefferson Davis Memorial Hospital.

COURT RULES AGAINST BUS DRUG SEARCHES

<P>
A divided Florida Supreme Court declared random drug searches of commercial 
buses unconstitutional, saying the practice invited comparisons to Nazi Germany 
and communist countries. The court, in a 4-3 decision that overturned six drug 
convictions, said the practice violated state and federal constitutional 
protections against unlawful search and seizure, even though the goal --

privacy rights caused by the Broward County policy is too great for a democracy 
to sustain," Justice Rosemary Barkett wrote in the majority opinion.

President Bush, on the eve of World AIDS Day, said the best way to fight the 
spread of "this terrible disease" is through education. He also expressed 
compassion for victims of the deadly virus, spread through sex or shared 
needles with an infected partner. The White House issued the remarks before 
Bush left for Malta and his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
The World Health Organization has designated today as World AIDS Day. A federal 
official said more than 112,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
have been reported in the United States.

PROP. 103 GROUP OFFERS ITS OWN PRICING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO INSURANCE: A COALITION OF GROUPS WOULD NARROW PRICE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN 
CITIES AND SUBURBS. BUT WHOSE RATES WOULD BE AFFECTED WAS NOT MADE CLEAR. 
</P>

With Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie scheduled to announce next Tuesday 
her decision on how to alter the pricing of auto insurance in accord with 
Proposition 103, the measure's author and a coalition of 20 minority, consumer 
and low-income groups joined Thursday in proposing their own pricing plan. 
</P>
<P>
In rough terms, the plan endorsed by Voter Revolt's Harvey Rosenfield would 
tend to narrow price distinctions that now exist between central cities and 
suburban areas. But how much, and whose rates would go up and whose would go 
down, were not precisely disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was largely drafted by State Board of Equalization member Conway 
Collis, Rosenfield's candidate to replace Gillespie as commissioner in next 
year's election. It would, in a literal interpretation of Proposition 103, set 
a driver's safety record, annual miles driven and years of driving experience 
as the most influential factors in pricing. 
</P>
<P>
To the extent that a driver's home address could continue to be used to 
determine prices, the plan would end use of individual zip codes, as is now 
often the case, and use 21 "standard metropolitan statistical areas" designated 
within California by the Bureau of Census. A flat geographically based rate 
component would be applied to drivers in each of these areas. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, if territory is used to make up 25% of a person's rate, that 
factor would be applied uniformly to all drivers either living in or commuting 
into a statistical area. (The commuter's destination would be introduced as a 
pricing factor for the first time). 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County as a whole and areas based on Orange, San Diego and Kern 
counties form four of the 21 statistical zones. In the plan proposed Thursday, 
the geographical-based price would be the highest in Los Angeles, but Orange 
County drivers commuting into Los Angeles would pay the Los Angeles rate. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield and Collis said they do not have statistics yet that would allow 
them to say what their plan would mean in terms of precise upward or downward 
adjustments of individual rates in various places. 
</P>
<P>
But Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP, who was also 
at the news conference, said that in general it would mean that auto insurance 
rates in the suburbs would go up, while those in the central cities would go 
down. He said this was the intent of the voters when they passed Proposition 
103 last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, by defining the rates according to the Census Bureau's statistical 
areas, the geographically based adjustments would be limited to a certain 
extent. Drivers in Northern California counties such as Humboldt or Sacramento 
would not be paying higher rates so that Los Angeles drivers could pay lower 
ones, as would be the case with an unqualified end to neighborhood-based 
pricing. 
</P>
<P>
Collis said the biggest increases would fall on bad drivers -- those with two 
or more traffic violations or with at-fault accidents -- no matter where they 
live. Gillespie has vowed to avoid most sharp adjustments of individual rates 
in her pricing plan next week. Unlike the plan proposed Thursday, hers will 
have the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
Among those joining in support of the plan were the California Council of Urban 
Leagues; the Latino Issues Forum; the League of United Latin American Citizens; 
the Mexican American Political Assn.; the American G.I. Forum; the Rainbow 
Coalition; the Filipino-American Political Assn.; the Chinese for Affirmative 
Action; the Center for Public Interest Law and the Consumers Union.

QUARTER-CENT STATE SALES TAX HIKE WILL TAKE EFFECT TODAY

<P>
Just in time for holiday shopping, the state sales tax increases one-fourth 
cent on each dollar of purchases today. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $800 million that the additional tax will raise over its 13-month 
duration will aid victims of the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake and help pay for 
quake-related repairs to freeways, schools and other structures. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers who approved the tax in a special session last month scheduled it to 
begin today so that it will be in effect during both this year's and next 
year's Christmas shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
For most counties in the state, the new sales tax rate will be 6.25%. 
</P>
<P>
However, voters in 13 counties previously approved local-option sales tax 
increases, mostly for transportation projects. The sales tax as of today will 
be 6.75% in Fresno, Inyo, Los Angeles, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San 
Francisco and Santa Cruz counties. It will be 7.25% in Alameda, Contra Costa, 
San Diego, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. 
</P>
<P>
And voters in five counties on Nov. 7 approved additional half-cent increases 
that will not take effect until April 1, 1990, at the earliest. They are 
Imperial, Monterey, San Bernardino, San Francisco and Santa Barbara. When those 
increases take effect, the tax will be 6.75% in all but San Francisco, which 
will rise to 7.25%.

UC'S 'SWEET POTATO MAN' SEEKS PERFECT PRODUCT

<P>
"I Yam a Sweet Potato Man" proclaimed the hat worn by University of California 
farm adviser Bob Scheuerman. 
</P>
<P>
The cap was appropriate. Scheuerman, 57, has been California's official sweet 
potato expert for 27 years. As such, he puts one age-old question quickly to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of confusion over the names yam and sweet potato," said 
Scheuerman, explaining the message on his cap. "They're both sweet potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
"A yam is a sweet potato with red, purple or copper-colored skin and moist 
orange flesh after cooking. The creamy-colored potato with yellow dry flesh 
after cooking is commonly called the sweet potato." 
</P>
<P>
Scheuerman works closely with sweet potato growers and processors. He has an 
experimental plot here, where he grows different varieties of sweet potatoes in 
his never-ending search for the perfect potato. 
</P>
<P>
"The best-looking, best-tasting sweet potatoes in America come from California. 
Yet, few Californians are aware sweet potatoes grow in this state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston, about 65 miles north of Fresno in Merced County, is the sweet 
potato capital of California. Within the 15-mile radius of this small farm 
center, 80% of the state's sweet potatoes are grown. Farmers have been planting 
sweet potatoes in Merced County since the 1860s. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina is the No. 1 sweet potato state, with 35,000 acres devoted to 
the crop. Louisiana is second with 19,000 acres, and California third with 
8,000 acres. Sweet potatoes are raised on 94,000 acres in a dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 farmers grow sweet potatoes in Livingston. The smallest farm is six 
acres, the largest 350 acres. Sweet potatoes are a $30-million crop for 
California farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Scheuerman says sweet potatoes are like turkeys: "Most people eat them only at 
Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. They're available year-round, rich in 
Vitamin A and can be prepared in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bake, fry, boil, steam, pan-roast and charcoal-broil sweet potatoes, 
make cakes, cookies, casseroles, souffles, croquettes, stuffing, salads, 
breads, waffles, biscuits, pies and puddings out of sweet potatoes. 
French-fried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips are delicious. There is even 
a sweet potato punch," Scheuerman said. 
</P>
<P>
People in the Southern states eat more sweet potatoes than any other Americans. 
"Southerners are raised on sweet potatoes. They love sweet potato pie. During 
the Civil War, there were over 1 million acres in the South in sweet potatoes. 
The Civil War was fought by the South on a diet of sweet potatoes," said 
Scheuerman. 
</P>
<P>
He publishes Sweet Potato Tips six times a year. It has a circulation of 300, 
mostly sweet potato growers and processors in California. He is a member of the 
state and national Sweet Potato Councils and also of the National Sweet Potato 
Collaborators, a research group of about 100 sweet potato scientists. 
</P>
<P>
"People laugh when I tell them I'm going to a sweet potato convention," allowed 
the farm adviser. 
</P>
<P>
On his quarter-acre experimental plot here, Scheuerman is currently testing a 
dozen different varieties of sweet potatoes. "Over the years I've tested more 
than 50 different varieties. I'm always trying to come up with a better sweet 
potato, better-looking, better-tasting, insect and disease-resistant sweet 
potato," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
More garnets -- red and purple-skin sweet potatoes with orange flesh -- are 
grown in California than any other type. Scheuerman introduced the garnet to 
California many years ago. The garnet and jewel, a copper-colored potato with 
deep orange flesh, are yams, and account for 90% of the California crop. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the state's sweet potato production is the Jersey, a creamy-colored 
potato with dry, yellow flesh preferred by certain ethnic groups, including the 
Chinese and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet potatoes do exceptionally well in the Livingston area because of the 
sandy soil here, and because the plants are irrigated. Water is pumped into 
ditch groves next to the plant and goes directly to the lower roots, without 
getting the sweet potatoes wet. Sweet potatoes grow on mounds higher than the 
irrigation ditches. 
</P>
<P>
"Because California sweet potatoes are not rained on, and don't get wet, they 
do not develop deep eyes, bumps, become misshapen or rot, problems often caused 
by rain in other parts of the country," said the farm adviser. 
</P>
<P>
The sweet potato harvest time in California is mid-September through October.

The state Department of Health Services has announced an end to the quarantine 
on mussels from the California coastline between the Oregon state line and 
Bodega Head in Sonoma County. The state's annual quarantine on the 
sport-harvesting of mussels typically runs from May through October. But it was 
extended this year in the North Coast because samples revealed high levels of a 
toxin which can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. Two non-fatal illnesses 
from mussels were reported in September in southern Mendocino County.

A 15-year-old Garden Grove honors student whose newborn baby drowned in a high 
school restroom toilet will not be charged with murder, authorities said. The 
Santiago High School sophomore remained hospitalized in good condition. Orange 
County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley said prosecutors have not decided whether 
to press involuntary manslaughter or child endangerment charges, or bring no 
charges at all. An autopsy showed the baby boy was apparently delivered into 
the toilet, where he drowned. However, authorities say they found no evidence 
that the girl deliberately drowned the child. Vietnamese culture frowns on 
unwed mothers, and girls who become pregnant are usually thrown out of their 
homes by their parents. "If it goes to court, it'll ruin her life for good," 
said Dr. Co Dang Long Pham, a Westminster obstetrician. "I feel she shouldn't 
be charged," said Mai Cong, chairman of the Vietnamese Community Social Service 
Center.

A water main break in San Francisco's Forest Hill neighborhood, just west of 
Twin Peaks, spilled thousands of gallons of water and caused a large street 
cave-in. "We lost a couple of hundred thousand gallons," estimated Marty 
Lieberman, manager of the San Francisco Water Department's distribution 
division. "We don't know what caused it. It could have been damaged in the 
(Oct. 17) earthquake. Who knows? But we've had other breaks in this area and 
don't know why." With water pouring down Laguna Honda Boulevard for more than 
two hours, auto, bus and underground trolley traffic was disrupted. The cave-in 
on Laguna Honda, where it meets Dewey Boulevard, stretched for about 150 feet 
and was about 25 feet wide at some spots. Municipal Railway underground trolley 
traffic through the Forest Hill station was stopped for a short time but then 
resumed officials reported.

A Navy A-4 Skyhawk jet with the elite "Top Gun" squadron crashed Thursday near 
Miramar Naval Air Station and the pilot ejected safely, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Stanley R. O'Connor, a 37-year-old Top Gun flight instructor, was 
approaching Miramar after a routine flight when he radioed the air traffic 
control tower that the single-seat attack jet was losing power. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, considered one of the Navy's workhorses, crashed shortly after 10 
a.m., six miles east of Miramar's runways. Officials are investigating the 
accident, which comes 13 days after an unprecedented 48-hour Navy-wide safety 
review ordered because of a rash of mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
After telling controllers he was losing power as he neared the runway, O'Connor 
guided the Skyhawk to a remote area of the 24,000-acre Miramar complex, 13 
miles north of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's A-4 plane is usually used in Top Gun squadron mock battles as the

NEW AGE: AFTER THREE YEARS AND $735,000, THE STATE'S TASK FORCE ON SELF-ESTEEM 
IS PROMOTING "YUPPIE EVANGELISM," SAN DIEGO'S LONE REPRESENTATIVE SAID.

<P>
San Diego County's lone representative on the much-lampooned state Task Force 
to Promote Self-Esteem says that the group's proposed final report is 
tantamount to "yuppie evangelism." 
</P>
<P>
Yogi devotee David Shannahoff-Khalsa, neuroscience researcher and director of 
the Khalsa Foundation for Medical Science in Del Mar, says that, after three 
years of hearings and $735,000, the controversial panel has yet to find proof 
that there is a link between self-esteem and the solution to social ills such 
as teen-age pregnancies, gang violence and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he says the report, scheduled to be released in mid-January, is 
sorely lacking in practical advice to help those on the lowest rungs of 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Task force members rejected his suggestion to include guidelines 
for special breathing exercises, which Shannahoff-Khalsa says help reduce 
stress, fear, anger, addictions, obsessive-compulsive disorders and dyslexia. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel (the report) is a bunch of yuppie evangelism," he said in a telephone 
interview Thursday. "It is superficial in content, and I don't think that it 
has the depth of understanding to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
A draft copy of the final report was circulated at a task force meeting Monday 
in Sacramento. The panel voted to approve the document and send it to the 
printer for its expected Jan. 16 public release. 
</P>
<P>
Shannahoff-Khalsa, a 41-year-old biologist-turned-devotee of kundalini yoga, 
was nominated for a spot on the 25-member panel by Sen. William Craven 
(R-Oceanside) and has attended every one of the task force meetings since it 
began in early 1987 to explore the social ramifications of self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Shannahoff-Khalsa said he has grown disillusioned with the group 
because of its reluctance to go beyond feel-good buzzwords, like "esteeming," 
and boldly go where no New Age committee has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw this task force, I believed that what it was mandated to do was 
look for the mother lode of cure for these social problem areas," said 
Shannahoff-Khalsa. "And ultimately, I find the final report not to be 
acceptable, that it is an ineffective prescription for those most in need." 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the Del Mar meditation expert said, the task force is mistaken in 
its conviction that self-esteem is the key to alleviating many of today's 
social plagues. Research in the link between a good self-image and being a good 
citizen is, at best, incomplete and inconclusive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The task force has wanted to hang its hat on a positive causal relationship, 
or strong linkage," he said. "Unfortunately, the findings of the academic 
literature cannot support that." 
</P>
<P>
Shannahoff-Khalsa also said that the task force became so engrossed in the 
concept of self-esteem that it virtually ignored the more difficult questions 
of what a person should do to feel good about himself in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't tell somebody to be creative. You can't tell somebody to be 
spiritual. You can't tell somebody to appreciate their mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can teach them ways to learn to have a conscious relationship with it, 
and there are a lot of techniques that are out in the community at large that 
lend instruction in that way. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are suffering from anxiety, and you use one of these techniques, and 
five minutes later you can reduce the anxiety and feel a stillness and a peace 
of the mind, you've engaged yourself to lift yourself out of your own 
negativity," he said. "If you can lift yourself out of your depression, you may 
not suffer from problems of drug and alcohol addiction." 
</P>
<P>
One such technique, he said, is informed breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Shannahoff-Khalsa -- the latter an adopted Sikh surname that means 
"consciousness and purity" -- said he tried in vain to interest his task force 
colleagues to include breathing exercises in their proposed final report. One 
of the techniques he suggested would be a simple way to check for the side of 
the brain that is in charge at any given moment. 
</P>
<P>
Those under the influence of the left side of the brain would be more prone to 
defense, aggression and up on their verbal skills; those under the influence of 
the right side would tend to be more sensitive to others, attuned to their 
health and possessing a "global perspective of what is right." 
</P>
<P>
The way to know which one is the strongest is by the "congestion-decongestion 
response" in a person's nostrils, said Shannahoff-Khalsa. If the right nostril 
is the more congested, the left brain is calling the shots, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Simple, but would the task force take heed? Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are their eyes closed to it?" he asked. "Why are their ears closed to this 
approach? And it is certainly nothing new, and I don't think it would shock the 
media if findings were addressed in the task force approach. I think it is more 
shocking that it was left out." 
</P>
<P>
Shannahoff-Khalsa said he is especially disappointed with the task force's 
reaction in light of the fact that the National Research Council has hired him 
to write a report on how meditation can help military personnel perform better 
under stress. 
</P>
<P>
Robert R. Ball, executive director of the task force, said Thursday that task 
force members "bent over backwards" to accommodate Shannahoff-Khalsa's views, 
and at one point agreed to the Del Mar resident's request that the final report 
recommend a Sikh drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted a 'how to' (in the task force report) on breathing, place the tip of 
your tongue on the roof of your mouth and so forth," Ball said. "Those are very 
specific exercises related specifically to his group that the task force as a 
whole did not feel were appropriate for a document that would be sent out to 
the whole state." 
</P>
<P>
But Shannahoff-Khalsa said such decisions were politically safe and resulted in 
a report that, in New Age terms at least, was pretty vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
"This task force is an effort to look beyond the mainstream of thought," he 
said, "but, from my perspective, we're still in the middle of the stream."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PSYCHIC OUT OF SPIRITS SINCE PLAZA; 
</P>
<P>
FORCED HER TO MOVE FROM PRIME POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY

<TEXT>
<P>
'Tis is the season to be psychic. Or: Switching channels for the holidays? 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Lee has been tending to the spiritual and metaphysical needs of 
Horton Plaza shoppers since March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
She reads Tarot cards and listens to her channeling voice (an ancient mystic). 
She talks of the future and the past and charges $15 to $20 per session. 
</P>
<P>
She has had a pushcart at the top of the escalator near Mervyn's and the 
Pappagallo clothing store. It's a choice spot: warm and highly visible. 
</P>
<P>
But now Lee has been involuntarily shifted to a lonely table outside Ernie's 
Tavern at the extreme southwest end of the plaza. It's chilly and semi-hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Pettitt, the plaza's general manager, says he wanted something more 
festive, more mainstream consumerish for the holiday season. Lee's former spot 
is now occupied by a woman selling ties. 
</P>
<P>
Pettitt also says he has gotten complaints likening Lee's specialty to devil 
worship. 
</P>
<P>
"We've stuck with her through the years, but she just does not fit into our 
holiday theme," he said. "We've gone far beyond what most commercial centers 
would have done in accommodating her." 
</P>
<P>
Lee says she has being pushed aside just when shoppers need her most: the 
high-stress holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole purpose is to help people feel better about themselves, to understand 
their lives better," she said. "People need me during the holidays when all 
types of conflicts arise." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Pettitt wanted Lee to leave the plaza altogether until after New 
Year's. She resisted. She found Ernie's. 
</P>
<P>
She's one of 23 independent vendors who rent cart space. The others sell sweat 
shirts, T-shirts, jewelry, crafts, etc. Lee is the only one forced to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
She says that, despite her ability to read the future, she was surprised by the 
mandatory move. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in the spiritual business will tell you the same thing: they can't 
read for themselves," Lee said. "I was totally shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman-To-Be Stands Ground 
</P>
<P>
Word from the political front: 
</P>
<P>
* Councilwoman-elect Linda Bernhardt, who publicly burned a Building Industry 
Assn. questionnaire during the campaign, has hired former BIA political 
strategist Jean Andrews as a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt needs to retire a campaign debt. But she says her orders to Andrews 
are clear: no developer money. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt says her slow-growth zeal is undiminished. She has added former 
Sierra Club leader Jay Powell to her City Hall staff to deal with land use. 
</P>
<P>
* A poll done after Bishop Maher's edict shows Lucy Killea ahead of Carol 
Bentley in their special state Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans hold a registration edge in the district, but Republicans are 
defecting to Killea, a Democrat, because of her pro-choice views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Killea sent a mailer to Republicans this week saying she would give the Senate 
a pro-choice majority for the first time. The anti-abortion movement would love 
to pour money and troops into the Bentley campaign, but they have been told it 
would be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
* Maher has given interviews to the New York Times, USA Today, Sacramento Bee, 
Associated Press, NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, Time and Newsweek. Also, 30 Days, a 
Rome-based Catholic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
He was willing to talk to the Washington Post, Newsday, and the New York Daily 
News, but his schedule and the reporters' deadlines didn't match. He turned 
down the Donahue show, "Hard Copy" and the CBS "This Morning" show. 
</P>
<P>
Father Knows the Best Punishment 
</P>
<P>
Bail was being set recently for a young defendant in a theft case in downtown 
San Diego. His lawyer said he couldn't afford bail. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant's father, a maintenance worker, asked that the youth be released 
to his custody. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what my boy's accused of," he told the judge, "but if I find out 
he's really done it, the punishment you'll give him won't be anything compared 
to the punishment I'll give him." 
</P>
<P>
The judge replied: "Maybe I should keep him in jail for his own protection." 
</P>
<P>
The judge retreated to his chambers. He came back a few moments later and 
granted the father's request.

NAVY JET LOSES POWER, CRASHES AT MIRAMAR; PILOT EJECTS SAFELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An A-4F Skyhawk jet operated by the Navy's elite Top Gun school crashed at 
Miramar Naval Air Station Thursday and ignited a brush fire. The pilot safely 
ejected from the stricken craft, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley R. O'Connor, 37, a Top Gun flight instructor, was 
approaching Miramar after a routine test flight when he radioed that the 
single-seat jet was losing power. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, considered one of the Navy's workhorses, crashed shortly after 10 
a.m. in mountainous terrain 6 miles east of Miramar's runways. The Navy is 
investigating the accident, which comes 13 days after an unprecedented 48-hour, 
Navy-wide stand-down for a safety review. 
</P>
<P>
After telling Miramar air traffic controllers that his craft was losing power, 
O'Connor guided the single-engine Skyhawk to a remote part of the 24,000-acre 
Miramar complex, 13 miles north of down town San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a stupendous job of bringing it to a safe area before he felt he had no 
power in the aircraft," said Chief Petty Officer Bobbie Carleton, a spokeswoman 
for Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, an 18-year Navy veteran who lives with his wife in San Diego, 
parachuted to the ground after ejecting from the plane, Carleton said. He was 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
The brush fire scorched more than 40 acres of chaparral-covered terrain about 5 
miles east of Interstate 15 in Sycamore Canyon, Carleton said. Smoke rising 
from the fire was visible for miles. Firefighters brought the blaze under 
control after six hours, Carleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Miramar is one of the Navy's four master jet stations and a hub for its 
sophisticated fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, 31 military aircraft, including the A-4 that went down Thursday, 
have crashed within 10 miles of Miramar, according to a report prepared by 
Miramar and the Naval Facilities Command in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Only Wednesday, residents from the neighboring communities of Mira Mesa, 
Scripps Ranch, Tierrasanta and University City had gathered to voice their 
opposition to suggestions that Miramar be converted to a civilian airport for 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At Miramar's Naval Fighter Weapons School, known as Top Gun, Skyhawks are used 
as adversary planes. They simulate Soviet MIGs in mock dogfights against F-14 
Tomcats, the Navy's top-line fighter. Actor Tom Cruise catapulted the school to 
national prominence with the 1986 movie "Top Gun." 
</P>
<P>
Although McDonnell Douglas stopped manufacturing the Skyhawk 10 years ago, the 
aircraft, which was used extensively in Vietnam by the Navy and Marine Corps, 
is still valued for being durable and nimble, Carleton said. The Skyhawk is 
valued at about $500,000, she added. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Thursday's crash, O'Connor was not engaged in combat-training 
maneuvers, Carleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Navy personnel say the crash comes at a particularly unfortunate time as 
the Navy tries to rebound from a string of accidents that prompted the safety 
stand-down, which brought the entire force to a virtual halt as it reviewed its 
operational procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The accident is the second involving Navy aircraft in two days. On Wednesday, 
an SH-2F Seasprite helicopter plunged into the sea off Okinawa, killing one 
crewman and injuring two others, including the pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Alan Batterman 
of Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot, Ens. Ralph A. Barile of Ewa Beach, Hawaii is missing and presumed 
lost, bringing the year's toll to 103 Navy personnel killed during training and 
operating procedures, the highest in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we strive for zero accidents, the nature of the business is that 
accidents will happen," said Lt. Frank Thorp, a Navy spokesman in Washington.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: SPROUTS ASIDE, CAFE IS TYPICALLY CONVENTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commerce will feed the new San Diego Convention Center, but where will the 
expected swarms of conventioneers from Paducah, Poughkeepsie and Peoria find 
sustenance? And where, for that matter, will those of us invited to lunch or 
dine with these visitors find ourselves lifting knives and forks? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to both questions is, fortunately, multiple-choice, because downtown 
offers plenty of options and more are on the way. But, just as many expected, 
the convention center quite suddenly has tilted downtown's geography toward it, 
and some south-of-Market Street neighborhoods that formerly held no attraction 
for those without business in them now look to be in the thick of things. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe 6th &amp; K, in the heart of the produce district at the Ramada Hotel, is 
one of those places that any day now will buzz with the same mixture of 
regional accents that makes convention hotel dining rooms in Atlanta and 
Chicago sound like all-American Babels. As is the case with such rooms 
elsewhere, Cafe 6th &amp; K may never catch on with locals, but it is 
interesting to see what will be presented to visitors as a typical taste of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is pretty much what might be found in a convention hotel anywhere, 
with the possible exception of the alfalfa sprouts that have been insinuated 
into some of the sandwiches. As its main attractions, it holds out prime rib, 
filet mignon with sauce bearnaise, fried chicken, several pastas and a 
hamburger named the America's Cup, which, the menu notes rather endearingly, 
excludes kiwi from its garnish. 
</P>
<P>
If the menu offers what the typical conventioneer might expect to find, the 
ground-floor room may certainly fulfill his or her expectations of what a San 
Diego hotel eatery should be like. Colored in the pinks and mauves that have 
come to be known as "California hotel classic," Cafe 6th &amp; K is built to 
handle a crowd, is staffed by servers who are glad to chat with out-of-towners 
during slack periods and offers from some tables a fine view of the convention 
center and the sail-shaped tenting on its roof, which at night looks somewhat 
like a tight formation of yachts. A menu liner treats visitors to snippets of 
San Diego history, including one that might make some locals weep: In 1867, 
Alonzo Horton bought 960 acres in what has become downtown for $265. 
</P>
<P>
An English chef named David Tweedle supervises the kitchen, but the menu looks 
to have been written by somebody in the market research department. Among the 
starters are such amiably named offerings as the "Maui Wowie," which baby 
shrimp "bask" on a bed of papaya and other fruits, and the "basta pasta," a 
combination of angel hair, vegetables and "Alfredo sauce." Everyone who knows 
cooking, presumably including chef Tweedle, knows there ain't no such animal as 
an "Alfredo sauce," but that point probably matters little in this context. 
</P>
<P>
The menu reassuringly offers several soups daily, including an always-available 
scallop chowder, served in a hollowed-out round sourdough loaf, that comes off 
as a good variation on San Diego's ever-popular clam chowder and is likable for 
its flavorful broth and chunks of smoked bacon. A seafood gumbo offered as a 
daily special showed the dangers of doing cookbook research; Tweedle evidently 
relied on one of the phony, pseudo-Cajun recipes that now plague us and 
concocted a thick, muddy soup that would have been fairly authentic except for 
the unholy dose of cayenne that made a guest choke on the very first sip. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a bit of light fare is offered, including several salads -- there is a 
Caesar, naturally; in this case fleshed out with strips of roasted chicken -- 
some vaguely localized pastas (the pasta Del Mar combines shrimp and scallops 
with linguine and a lemon-garlic cream sauce, doubtless a variant of the 
"Alfredo sauce" employed elsewhere) and a quartet of sandwiches, including a 
nicely stacked club served on a toasted croissant. To toast a croissant at 
least shows imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The entree list includes one definite local reference, the Stingaree Stir, a 
Chinese-style stir-fry of vegetables, cashews and a choice of chicken or pork 
that points to the early Chinese presence in what is now called the Gaslamp 
Quarter. The Sonoran Shrimp is, oddly enough, just about the only bow to nearby 
Mexico, but it is a cordial one. These large shrimp are thoroughly encased in 
strips of bacon and grilled to a nice finish, basted all the while with a 
smoky, Mexican-style barbecue sauce that cooks down to a nice glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Because conventioneers will come from all 50 states, and prime rib remains the 
lingua franca of American cuisine, this dish takes first position on the entree 
list and is offered in two differently sized cuts: large and very large. The 
smaller of the two seemed more than generous, and, although the meat was 
reasonably well cooked, it was neither particularly tender nor very flavorful. 
The horseradish sauce -- the creamed English version and very well done -- 
served not so much as an accent but as a principal flavor. Both this and other 
entrees were garnished with an excellent selection of tender-crisp vegetables, 
one of the few items that may leave visitors with a true impression of 
California-style cooking.

DONATED TOY MEANS ADMISSION TO PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors who donate a new or used toy between 4 and 5 p.m. today at the San 
Diego Wild Animal Park will get in free. 
</P>
<P>
The toy drive for needy children is part of a national campaign sponsored by 
Mattel Toys, said company spokeswoman Della Perry. It "encourages children to 
help other, less fortunate children by donating their favorite toys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Children who visit the Mattel booth there can also make Christmas cards for 
children who will be hospitalized during the holidays, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
The toys will go to Children's Hospital and the Hillcrest Receiving Home. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday festivities are planned for 3 to 6 p.m. today at the park. The toy 
drive coincides with the park's second annual Nairobi Festival of Lights. More 
than 85,000 lights will be lit in the park's African village in celebration of 
the holiday season.

SUNSHINE AND SANTA ANAS IN WEEKEND FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dry, gusty air, lots of sunshine and a few wispy clouds are on the horizon for 
San Diegans this weekend, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana winds are gradually going away but will gather strength for one 
last blow Saturday, forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"Winds will be light and gentle today, but the gusty Santa Ana winds will 
return on Saturday before fading away on Sunday," Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountains, the Santa Anas may reach 20 to 40 m.p.h. and may also surface 
in the coastal valleys and canyons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures will be mild during the day and chilly at night, he said. "We're 
getting reports of frost in Escondido, but it is not serious for agricultural 
growers." 
</P>
<P>
Beach temperatures may hit a high of 68 degrees today and range from 66 to 70 
on Saturday before falling 1 or 2 degrees on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean temperature will be 61 degrees, with waves reaching 2 to 3 feet at 
12-second intervals. High tides for the month are predicted on Dec. 12 at 7.7 
feet. Coastal temperatures will range from 68 to 74 today and rise to about 78 
Saturday before falling 2 to 3 degrees Sunday. Night temperatures over the 
weekend are expected to dip into the 40s. 
</P>
<P>
Inland residents will experience highs in the 73- to 78-degree range today, 
with temperatures rising to a high of 82 on Saturday before falling slightly 
Sunday. Nights will bring light frost and temperatures in the 34- to 44-degree 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"The coldest temperature in the agricultural areas should bottom out at 30 
degrees, but it will be nothing serious," Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountains, today's high will be 46 to 54, dropping a couple of degrees 
over the weekend. Night temperatures will be 25 to 35 degrees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the deserts, the temperature will range from 68 to 75 today and go up over 
the weekend a few degrees. Overnight lows will range from 35 to 45. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara predicted mild temperatures and little rainfall for the month. 
"December doesn't look like too radical a change from November," he said. 
"December looks like an extension of what's been happening, with highs of about 
66 during the day and 48 at night." 
</P>
<P>
A more dramatic change in the weather will come in January, normally the 
wettest month in the year with about 2.11 inches of rainfall, Shigehara said.

One of four signs erected last month renaming a 10-mile stretch of California 
94 as the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway was reported defaced Thursday morning 
with the letters KKK, according to the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A Caltrans crew went out shortly after the sign, on westbound 94 near the Lemon 
Grove Avenue exit in La Mesa, was vandalized with spray paint, said Jeff 
Morgan, a Caltrans supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's an important sign, we try to remove the graffiti as quickly as 
possible," he said. "If it becomes a repetitive problem, we may find a higher 
elevation to move the signs." 
</P>
<P>
The four green-and-white signs, paid for largely by private donations, were 
unveiled Nov. 20. The segment of the state route christened in honor of the 
slain civil-rights leader begins in downtown San Diego and ends at the 
interchange with California 125 in La Mesa.

JIM MURRAY: FILLY FROM NOWHERE COMES TO FOREFRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is the conceit of men who dabble in horse racing that there is a super 
strain of horses which, if found, can lead to all kinds of fame, glory and 
riches in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, they believe implicitly in an aristocracy, that certain 
families, whether by divine right or cluster of genes, are destined to dominate 
lesser beings. 
</P>
<P>
It is a notion that, in human terms, died out with the Hapsburgs and the 
Hohenzollerns in a miasma of hemophilia, psychoses, insanity and all the other 
dubious rewards of inbreeding. 
</P>
<P>
Horsemen remain unpersuaded. All men may be created equal, they allow, but all 
horses? Hell, no! If you can breed Man o'War to Nellie Flag or Secretariat to 
Genuine Risk, they are convinced to a man, you will have the game by the 
throat. The super-race theory may be discredited elsewhere but not on a race 
track. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence to the contrary is at least whelming, if not over. Man o'War's 
descendants are running in a lot of Grade I handicaps. But they are also 
running in a lot of cheap claimers at Evangeline Downs. Some of them can't run 
anywhere. It's no mirage at all to see a horse winning a Triple Crown race 
while his half-brother -- or even full brother -- can't keep up with allowance 
company in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Eclipse Awards are racing's Oscars and are usually given to horses who are 
as royally bred as Charlemagne, the ones who have kept the peasants in their 
place in the recent season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Eclipse cup for 2-year-old fillies this year just might go to a little 
lady who was born in the cinders or the maid's quarters and who, if she were 
human, might have spent her time scouring pans and waiting on her stepsisters. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer wasn't the result of any grand union between crowned heads of 
racing. Jamie Schloss bought her dam, Domini Arlyn, for the claiming price of 
$20,000. Now, if you know racing, you know what you get for 20 grand. What you 
do, you first make sureit isn't a burro. 
</P>
<P>
Then, owner Schloss arranged a romantic tryst for his mare with a stallion 
called Moscow Ballet. Now, we're not talking Romeo and Juliet here or Lady Di 
and Charles. First of all, the assignation cost $5,000. You get some idea of 
how far over the tracks this mating comes from when you know that an interlude 
with Alydar might cost you $275,000, and Mr. Prospector commands $260,000. 
Seattle Slew wouldn't even dance with you for less than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer was so earmarked for the scullery that when she was weaned and 
broken, Schloss sent her not to tracks where the claiming price might be 
$70,000, but to Stockton. If this was baseball, that would be the Three-Eye 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Schloss thought he had a minor league horse. "One morning, at 6 or 6:30, I get 
this call from my trainer, Don Harper," Schloss says. "Now, ordinarily when you 
get a call at 6 o'clock in the morning, it's bad news. But this time, Don says, 
'We just worked your filly, and I've got two words for you -- Eclipse Awards.' 
</P>
<P>
"She went a half so fast -- 44.3 -- that the clockers went around checking each 
other. They thought their watches broke." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Schloss: "Don used to gallop horses for Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons and he 
exercised Carry Back. So, he knew a superior horse when he saw one." 
</P>
<P>
The public didn't. They looked at the breeding, not the clocking. "We took her 
to Golden Gate (Fields), and even though she ran sensational works in the 
morning, they let her get away at 9-1," Schloss says. "All she did was win by 
three lengths and come within three-fifths of a second of King Glorious' record 
for the distance. Her second race, she bled. So, they let her get away at 12-1 
in her third race. We put her on Lasix, and she ran off and hid from colts. But 
she was the Rodney Dangerfield of the track. She couldn't get any respect. They 
kept saying it was a fluke. I said, 'Well, she just ran five flukes in a row.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Racing reporters were more impressed. They named her filly of the meet at 
Golden Gate, Hollywood Park, Santa Anita and Canterbury Downs. At Canterbury, 
she broke the track record for fillies and beat the third horse in the race by 
19 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Well, she beats cheap horses.' So we took her to Santa Anita, and 
she wins the Grade I Oak Leaf easily," Schloss reports. "What do they want her 
to do -- sing?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, what "they" really want her to do is win the Hollywood Starlet at 
Hollywood Park Sunday. Jamie Schloss thinks he has the best 2-year-old filly in 
the land. But so does Trainer Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas' filly, Stella Madrid, was the favorite for the filly juvenile crown (and 
Eclipse Award) in the Breeders' Cup. But she unaccountably got beat by Go for 
Wand, a horse who had never won anything but an allowance race and whom Stella 
Madrid had beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Lukas and owner Schloss agree on one thing: Whichever of their horses 
wins the Starlet should be Eclipse filly of the year. Go for Wand is the One 
Play O'Brien of the horse set, in their view. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer skipped the Breeders' Cup because of a melancholy set of 
circumstances. Schloss did not nominate her as a weanling for one major reason: 
He did not have the $500 at the time -- certainly not to waste on his little 
half-breed. 
</P>
<P>
After her stunning debut, he was perfectly prepared to put up the supplementary 
fee of $120,000 (his filly has won $412,470 for him), but she came out of the 
Oak Leaf race with a hematoma on her shin. 
</P>
<P>
Schloss is overjoyed at the chance to race against Stella Madrid, saying: "My 
horse has beat a lot of these $600,000 horses. You've never seen a story like 
this one!" 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sure we have. Disney does them all the time. It's a remake of that one 
where the prince is running around looking for the glass slipper to fit. It'll 
have a happy ending, too. If Cinderella can go a mile.

HARPER HAS LAST LAUGH; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: FORMER CAVALIER OVERCOMES EARLY SPEECH PROBLEMS TO MAKE IT IN THE 
NBA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man with a lightning bolt shaved into the hair on his right temple and 
thunder in his legs knows all about playing with pain. He'd done just that for 
most of his 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
In school, he hated it when teachers called on him to read aloud. He found 
comfort on the basketball court, even though his future in the game looked 
about as bright as his chances of making the Social Register. 
</P>
<P>
Long conversations? 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
"For a kid growing up with a speech problem, you might as well be in jail," Ron 
Harper said. "Jail is a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
Harper grew up with a speech problem. From elementary school through junior 
high to high school, peers mocked him, laughing as he stammered and stuttered 
through sentences. Basketball was an outlet, one of the few activities in which 
the youngest of six kids raised by a single mother in Dayton, Ohio, could find 
self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't much good at basketball, either -- the 12th man on the freshman team 
at Dayton's Belmont High, whom the coach told that next season he'd be welcome 
to come out, but don't expect to play. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper transferred across town to Kiser High, a smaller school with about 
325 students. He made the team, gained confidence and earned a scholarship to 
Miami of Ohio. He was a first-round draft choice of the Cleveland Cavaliers, 
the eighth player picked in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
By the week before last, when Harper came to the Clippers in a trade that 
included three former first-round selections and two in the future, he was 
better than ever, in several ways. He doesn't shy away from talking to people, 
strangers even, and oh, how people like talking about him. 
</P>
<P>
"In the transition game, he's as good as Michael Jordan," said Don Chaney, 
coach of the Houston Rockets. "And that's not an understatement. He can do 
everything Michael can do in that phase of the game -- handle the ball, run and 
dunk, and be quick enough to pull up for the jumper or go by the defender on a 
drive." 
</P>
<P>
That only makes Harper one of the best off-guards in the world. Get past 
Jordan, and it becomes dealer's choice among Dale Ellis of Seattle, Clyde 
Drexler of Portland, Byron Scott of the Lakers, Joe Dumars of Detroit, Rolando 
Blackman of Dallas and Harper, who last season averaged 18.6 points and blocked 
more shots than any guard and eight starting centers. 
</P>
<P>
"He can fly through the air," Blackman said of Harper. "He's a very acrobatic 
guy, a guy you have to contend with every time he's on the court." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers became believers some time ago. They had pursued Harper for six 
months before finally sending Reggie Williams and the rights to Danny Ferry to 
Cleveland for Harper plus a No. 1 draft choice in 1990, a No. 2 in '91 and a 
No. 1 in '92. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal was obvious. Harper, a 6-foot-6 1/2, 198-pounder, is only 25, yet 
has already been in the playoffs twice in a three-year career, averaging 18.8 
points in nine games. He went into this, his fourth season, with a career 
average of 19.4 points, and although the major knock against him is his outside 
shooting, he had improved from 45.5% to 46.4% to 51.1% from the field each 
season. In the first seven games with Cleveland this season, he averaged seven 
assists and 6.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor calls Harper a basketball junkie, with the 
perfect blend of experience and youth. Lenny Wilkens, his coach at Cleveland, 
talked of Harper's court sense in knowing everyone's role on every play, not 
just his own. Cavalier center Brad Daugherty said Harper plays to the fans and 
feeds off their energy. Blackman said the best defense against Harper is simply 
not to let him have the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavalier players had the day off when Baylor called to discuss the trade 
with Harper, who happened to be on his way out the door to play basketball. 
Baylor enjoyed that, but he shouldn't have been surprised. Harper plays 
basketball the way some people chain-smoke. It's an appetite more than 
something to do. 
</P>
<P>
He was the kid that neighbors would tell to knock off the racket and go to 
sleep -- it was 2 a.m., for goodness sakes. He and four older brothers would 
often play for so long in the back yard of their home in Dayton's ghetto 
neighborhood that they would start when the ground was covered by grass and go 
until it was Pig Pen regulations -- on a court of dirt and dust. Snow was not a 
deterrent, either. 
</P>
<P>
This was Harper's place to stand out, even if he was around only because of 
persistence, rather than talent. He could handle getting a shot blocked by a 
brother eight years his senior better than feeling the stares while struggling 
through a response to a teacher's question. Nobody laughs when the best answer 
is swishing a ball through the net-less bent rim. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me a chance to express myself," he said. "Once I got on the court, I 
always felt away from things. I felt comfortable. When I was on the court, I 
would lose all my problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everything changed for me once I got a lot of confidence in my 
basketball game. Off the court, when I had a good game the day before, I turned 
that into positive energy. That was the key." 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who became a college prospect after growing from 5-10 to 6-2 1/2 
between his sophomore and junior seasons in high school, began to concentrate 
on correcting his impediment. He picked Miami of Ohio because of its proximity 
to home -- Oxford is 45 miles southwest of Dayton -- and its emphasis on a good 
speech program. There, coaches and publicists limited his media exposure the 
first year, waiting until he felt completely comfortable before accepting all 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Harper left the university in 1986, he was able to handle the 
attention. Playing wasn't nearly as difficult; he is the Mid-American 
Conference's all-time leading scorer and No. 2 rebounder behind 6-11 Nate 
Thurmond of Bowling Green. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, who opened the draft by picking Daugherty, used the No. 8 choice 
on Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, only injuries have been able to slow him down. While playing all 82 
games in 1986-87, he averaged 22.6 points and finished second to Indiana's 
Chuck Person in voting for rookie of the year. The next season, Harper missed 
25 games, including 24 straight, after spraining both ankles, and his average 
dropped to 15.4. Healthy again in 1988-89, he climbed to 18.6 and led Cleveland 
in scoring 26 times, more than any player. 
</P>
<P>
Except for shooting 44.2%, his numbers with the Cavaliers continued to be 
impressive this season. Harper had heard the trade rumors like everyone else 
and was equally surprised when it was completed. He was a rare commodity with 
the Cavaliers -- a healthy starter -- when it happened. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, he is able to relive some of his Cleveland years. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers were once the Cadavers, the NBA's laughingstock. Slowly, after 
Wayne Embry became general manager and Wilkens' coach, they became known as a 
team of the 1990s, stockpiling young talent such as Daugherty, Harper and Mark 
Price, the All-Star point guard, and emerging as a contender last season. The 
Clippers, too, have stockpiled and are waiting for the next step. 
</P>
<P>
There are obvious differences. Now, Harper is expected to provide veteran 
leadership on a team full of prominent second- and third-year players. And he 
is in the Western Conference, which is more conducive to his open-court style 
of play. He is looking forward to both transitions. 
</P>
<P>
"It (being a leader) is a strange position to be in," Harper said. "When I 
played with the Cavaliers, there was always a person like Phil (Hubbard) or 
Tree (Rollins), always a person to look to, to pick me up. Now, I have to pick 
people up. It's definitely challenging and it will test me in the long run, but 
it will show whether I can be a good player or a great player. 
</P>
<P>
"The East is definitely more physical than the West. By far. On the East Coast, 
from the first game, people try to bang you. The East Coast is more of a 
half-court game, and the name of the game out here now is to beat teams 
downcourt and get easy baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel my game is an athletic game, where you run and jump a lot, make stuff 
happen, create things to happen. I'm a player who likes to take chances." 
</P>
<P>
This is a risky move in his career, taking him away from his home state and a 
team that won more games last season (57) than the Clippers did in the last 
three (50) and a niche in the community. Now, everyone wants Harper to speak, 
and he gladly obliges. 
</P>
<P>
He goes to schools, talking to students about self-motivation, and conducts his 
own basketball camp. The organization he enjoys helping the most is the 
Cleveland Hearing and Speech Center. 
</P>
<P>
A former keynote speaker at the group's awards luncheon and an honorary member 
of the board of directors, Harper still has a slight stutter and gets stuck on 
certain words. But he said he has improved 100% since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Often, he answers a string of questions without a glitch. Always, unlike in the 
past, he answers without hesitation -- whether it be Ralph Lawler interviewing 
him on the Clipper pregame show before his debut, or the media with lights, 
cameras and note pads circling his locker after that night's 21-point, 
15-rebound performance. 
</P>
<P>
The man with a lightning bolt on his head, thunder in his legs and confidence 
in his heart smiles at the attention. It's the payoff for having come so far in 
the NBA, and in other ways as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I just go," he said. "I go now. I feel I've worked hard enough in school over 
the years. It's time to put everything to use."

MASTERS TENNIS: IT TAKES THREE SETS, BUT 30-YEAR-OLD VETERAN BEATS 17-YEAR-OLD 
AGAIN TO ADVANCE TO SEMIFINALS.

<P>
The first time he played John McEnroe last year in Paris, Michael Chang said he 
felt like the kid carrying McEnroe's rackets. 
</P>
<P>
So on the occasion of their fourth meeting, it is perhaps noteworthy that the 
would-be racket-carrier sees something of a change in roles coming right up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping soon he'll be carrying mine," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
And for a few moments Thursday night at the $3-million Nabisco Masters in 
Madison Square Garden, it appeared such a role reversal might be taking place 
sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who was one point away from 0-5 in the third set, caused some very 
anxious moments for McEnroe, but not enough of them. McEnroe prevailed, 6-2, 
5-7, 6-4, in 2 hours 44 minutes to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the semifinals is Ivan Lendl, who defeated Aaron Krickstein, 6-1, 6-3. 
Lendl and McEnroe play tonight to decide the winner of their group and Boris 
Becker and Stefan Edberg meet to settle the winner and runner-up of their 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The McEnroe-Lendl loser plays the Becker-Edberg winner in one semifinal and the 
reverse makes up the second of Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
It took Lendl 20 minutes to win the first two games and seemingly about 30 
seconds to close out the match against Krickstein, who is winless in their five 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"He's scary," Krickstein said. "I think he's the best player in the world -- at 
least against me. Hopefully, he'll win Wimbledon and retire." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, 30 years old and 13 years Chang's senior, may have aged a little bit 
as he was forced to an extra set for the first time by Chang. 
</P>
<P>
There were 18 break point opportunities that cropped up for Chang, who cashed 
in just three of them, a rejection of opportunity that cost him the match. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chang had his moments and even McEnroe had to admit that. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real dogfight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In their previous matches, one of the dogs was a pup. But after falling behind 
two service breaks for 4-0 then 5-1 in the third set, Chang nearly evened the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually broke McEnroe in a momentous eighth game after McEnroe won an 
argument with chair umpire Gerry Armstrong over McEnroe's favorite nemesis, the 
electronic service line machine. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 3-5, Chang won his service game to 4-5 and held two more break points 
for 5-5, but he missed three more break point chances. Chang may have had 
another at deuce, but he mistimed a short ball that had clipped the net cord 
and banged the ball long with McEnroe hopelessly trapped at the net. 
</P>
<P>
That lost opportunity troubled Chang. "It was just bad luck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe whipped a backhand volley winner crosscourt to give him a second try at 
match point, which he cashed in with a forehand volley crosscourt. 
</P>
<P>
His work done, McEnroe retired to the training room to get a rubdown. McEnroe 
had barely avoided a letdown and he knew it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so low to the ground and gets to so many balls, he just attacks the 
court," McEnroe said. "He's got incredible legs." 
</P>
<P>
"If (Chang) is as strong mentally in five years as he is now, he should be very 
happy," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
There was an example of Chang's mental process early. 
</P>
<P>
"He won the coin toss and he thought about what to call for like 15 or 20 
seconds," McEnroe said. "For him, I think it was some kind of intense thing." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the chair umpire to penalize him for delay of game," McEnroe said. 
"But Gerry said the guy has 30 seconds. They always have an answer." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe has always had an answer for Chang, too, but Chang said he will 
persevere. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, he's still better than I am," Chang said. "But . . . hopefully, 
it's just a matter of time."

John Robinson, the former BCOC (Big Coach on Campus), remembers his first year 
as Ram coach and empathizes with Dallas' Jimmy Johnson, this week's opposing 
coach and this season's favorite punching bag. 
</P>
<P>
When Robinson joined the Rams in 1983, one holdover assistant coach told him 
point-blank that the power-blocking schemes he used at USC wouldn't work in the 
National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just this thing, 'You don't understand the NFL,' " Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson remembers veteran guard Dennis Harrah stalking after him following 
team meetings, pleading with the new coach to change his crazy blocking 
philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
"We did use that blocking scheme," he said. "Now we had a pretty good guy 
running (in Eric Dickerson), but he ran through some holes, too." 
</P>
<P>
In six years with the Rams, Robinson has produced five 1,000-yard rushing 
seasons and one 2,000-yard effort from the tailback position. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's point is that jumping feet-first into the league as the perceived 
slick-haired, hot-shot college coach isn't quite as easy as preparing for, say, 
Northwestern. Serious heat is to be expected. He wants Johnson to know that he 
knows. 
</P>
<P>
Their careers, in fact, offer interesting parallels. Robinson came to the NFL 
from USC, where he was a successful coach at an urban school in a pro football 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson went to the NFL this year after posting a 52-9 record in five seasons 
at the University of Miami, another urban school in a pro football city. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches took over losing franchises in the NFL. The Rams were 2-7 in 1982, 
the Cowboys 3-13 in 1988. Both had top draft choices from which to build, the 
Rams taking Dickerson with the second pick of 1983, the Cowboys choosing 
quarterback Troy Aikman with last year's first choice. 
</P>
<P>
And Johnson is certainly taking his share of first-year lumps, especially from 
longtime NFL establishment-types such as Philadelphia's Buddy Ryan, who has 
ridiculed Johnson at every turn, most recently claiming after a 27-0 victory 
over the Cowboys that Johnson's was the worst-prepared team he'd ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ryan, too, who warned Johnson that there were no East Carolinas on the 
schedule in this league. 
</P>
<P>
"It was to be expected," Johnson said this week of the comments, "as far as a 
young coach coming into the NFL (is concerned) and with the success we had at 
Miami. A lot of people are relishing us having problems now, but that's human 
nature. A lot of times, people like to build themselves up with the misery of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
A 1-11 season could be considered miserable, although Johnson says he has never 
looked back at the fast times in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew exactly what I was leaving," he said. "And I knew I was going into some 
difficult times, but I think now people understand why I made the statement I 
made when I accepted the job -- that it really wasn't a decision; it was 
something I had to do. I knew I'd accomplished all that I set out to accomplish 
at the University of Miami, and it was time to take a new challenge and go to 
another level, even though there were going to be some difficult times." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson received some strange glares, too, during his first season, but turned 
them around quickly with his 9-7 record and a trip to the playoffs. Robinson 
said he may have had an edge on Johnson because he'd spent one season in the 
NFL as an assistant coach with the Oakland Raiders in 1975. Let new coaches 
beware: It's a jungle out here. 
</P>
<P>
"There's kind of a dogged tenacity you have to have," Robinson said. "I mean 
you've just got to hang in there. You've got to set a plan, hang in there and 
keep it going, see it fail, fight through it and see it succeed." 
</P>
<P>
This, while the rest of the league harpoons fresh-faced coaches like fish in a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're dumb, they get you," Robinson said. "That's probably the most 
intimidating thing about the league. If you're weak somewhere, you've got to 
correct that weakness fast, or they're coming after you. But that's the best 
part of it. I wouldn't trade coaching in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't go back to college, the game part of college football, for 
anything. The games are so much more exciting in terms of what it takes to win. 
I'm not talking about the hoopla. I mean the difference between the Rams and 
Saints is pretty small." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is finding out the hard way about league competition. The Cowboys rank 
25th in total offense and 26th in defense. Johnson has already lost more games 
this season than in five seasons as the Hurricanes' coach. And the only "East 
Carolinas" on the schedule this year call Texas Stadium home. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you might say the soft spots right now are the opposing teams looking 
at Dallas," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of Aikman and the trade of Herschel Walker for draft choices has 
solidified the Cowboys' future, according to Johnson, who added: "I knew I was 
going to a last-place club. I knew there weren't going to be any quick-fixes." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Dallas' record, Robinson tends to agree. But coaching and playing are 
just part of it. A former college coach's ego must also be reckoned with in a 
league where the company line is often, "Just follow orders, baby." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have the power you had in college," Robinson said. "If you're good 
in college, you're the most powerful guy there. The president doesn't tell you 
what to do, the athletic director doesn't tell you what to do. You're kind of a 
king. There aren't many jobs in this league where you're king. There's an owner 
sitting there who may want you to run right, or a general manager who may not 
have wanted you in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
So Jimmy Johnson's longest season continues against the Rams Sunday in Dallas, 
before he closes out the schedule against the Eagles, the New York Giants and 
the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Nary a win can be found. Is Johnson ready for 1-15? 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the then-Miami coach and his staff visited Robinson at Ram training 
camp in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "He could have given me a little bit more insight about what I 
might be getting into." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are listing wide receiver Henry Ellard as doubtful for Sunday's game. 
"And we mean doubtful," Coach John Robinson said, clarifying any confusion 
about the injury report last week, when Ellard was listed as probable, then 
didn't play. . . . Tailback Greg Bell has been suffering back spasms, but he's 
probable. . . . Cornerback Cliff Hicks is questionable with a knee strain. . . 
. Robinson said the pass play called on the third-and-inches situation near the 
goal line against New Orleans, which resulted in a four-yard sack, belongs in 
"the Hall of Play-Calling Shame." . . . If the Rams win three of their last 
four games, they're almost assured of a playoff spot at 11-5. They would only 
be eliminated in a three-way tie involving Philadelphia and Green Bay.

THESE HUNTERS ARE ALSO THE HUNTED; 
</P>
<P>
BIGHORN SHEEP: THIRD ANNUAL HUNT BEGINS SATURDAY AMID PROTESTS AND HIGH 
EMOTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a strange, three-way confrontation: hunter armed with rifle, protester 
armed with air horn, bighorn sheep armed only with agility and wariness. 
</P>
<P>
There is little respect between the human principals, except that which they 
share for the animal. 
</P>
<P>
The Nelson (or desert) bighorn sheep is a magnificent creature. "Especially 
when you catch 'em on the horizon line in that 'Bambi's dad' pose," says Tracy 
Bartlett of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the ironies is that there is an overlap between hunters and people like 
those from EarthFirst! There have been times when environmentalists or 
anti-hunters have ended up in coalitions with hunters because they are some of 
the few people that appreciate wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
But that won't be the case in the eastern Mojave Desert the next two weeks, not 
during California's third annual limited bighorn hunt after a moratorium of 114 
years. If anything, the battle lines have been hardened and the emotions 
embittered by what has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
When the hunt starts Saturday at dawn, Bartlett will be back with EarthFirst!, 
the Hunt Saboteurs and others who go into the field to exercise their 
objections to trophy hunting. 
</P>
<P>
Wardens from the Department of Fish and Game will be ready for them, determined 
to protect the rights of eight hunters who are authorized by the state for this 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take one bighorn apiece. 
</P>
<P>
They are seven men and a woman. Their names were drawn from more than 2,500 
applicants. One is an archer. One is from Michigan, the hunt's first 
non-resident who was picked from 81 out-of-state applicants. 
</P>
<P>
A ninth hunter, Robert Senter of New Hampshire, has already killed his ram. He 
bought his permit in a $40,000 auction and was privileged to start hunting two 
weeks ago. The $40,000 will go to help restore the species he killed. Irony, 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when the protesters were loosely organized, all nine hunters got 
their sheep. In the process, two protesters -- Lyn Dessaux and Christie 
Bricknell -- were detained by Loren Lutz, who claimed he had made citizen's 
arrests. Lutz is past president of the Society for the Conservation of Bighorn 
Sheep that in concert with the DFG has worked to restore Nelson populations to 
historic California ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Dessaux claimed that Lutz struck him with a lariat from horseback and that 
Lutz's son Kennis punched him and broke his nose, then locked both in a horse 
trailer for about 11 hours until DFG wardens arrived to take them to jail. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of last year's hunt, Dessaux and Bricknell filed a $1-million suit 
against the Lutzes for assault and battery, false arrest and imprisonment (in a 
horse trailer), violation of civil rights and other complaints. Just last week, 
an arbitrator for the Sacramento County Superior Court denied the claim. 
</P>
<P>
But the anti-hunters had already taken a measure of revenge. Last year they 
came with two-way radios and a better game plan. Two of the eight lottery 
hunters failed to get their sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Vern Bleich of the DFG said: "The two hunters didn't get their sheep because 
the freakos were there." 
</P>
<P>
Bleich, an associate wildlife biologist based in Bishop, worked with Bob Vernoy 
and the retired Dick Weaver to compile much of the DFG's research data that 
persuaded the state legislature to allow a limited, experimental hunt until 
Jan. 1, 1993. The sixth and final hunt is scheduled for December of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Bleich has data to show how the bighorns have thrived through improvement of 
habitat -- primarily, the construction of year-round water holes, or "guzzlers" 
-- in the hunt sites among the Old Dad Peak-Kelso Mountains area southeast of 
Baker and to a lesser degree in the Marble Mountains farther south. 
</P>
<P>
Since July of 1983 the sheep population there has grown to about 500 despite 
hunting and the capture and transfer of 198 animals to other historic ranges 
where hunting is not allowed. The law allows the DFG to offer permits to hunt 
up to 15% of the population -- 75 sheep -- but only nine have been offered each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, Nelsons have grown in numbers from a DFG estimate of 2,371 in 1972 
to 3,764. 
</P>
<P>
Bleich doesn't think the anti-hunters would be impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot reason with those people," he said. "They've got a mind-set and 
nothing that anyone says is gonna change that. By God, they're on a mission and 
they are right, regardless of facts." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Mansfield, assistant chief of the DFG's wildlife management division, 
said: "I would challenge them to put their time and money and effort into 
bighorn or elk research projects. We get people on a bucket brigade carrying 
cement up a hill to build a little guzzler for the desert wildlife. Where are 
they when we are doing that?" 
</P>
<P>
The anti-hunters say that the DFG's projects artificially inflate populations, 
and that advocates only want to have more sheep so they can kill them. The DFG 
answers that only older rams past their prime at 6 to 11 years are taken 
because of the "legal sheep" rule requiring about a 270-degree curl in the 
horns, and the older sheep would soon die of attrition, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh-huh, sure," Bartlett said. "If they want to follow it around until it dies 
of old age, and then take the horns, they can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Young of Orange County hunted last year and took a ram with 
California-record horns. But his satisfaction was tempered because he was 
unable to do it with his preferred weapon, a bow, because with the protesters 
dogging him he wasn't be able to get close enough -- about 50 yards -- to get a 
good shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I switched (to a rifle) on the third or fourth day when (the activists) 
actually ruined the hunt," he said. "Part of hunting is being able to watch the 
animals in their natural environment . . . the birds and other things that live 
in the desert. The kill isn't the hunt, especially with a bow and arrow. The 
hunt is everything up until the point you get the animal. 
</P>
<P>
"But these people are running through blowing off their horns and disturbing 
the entire situation. You lose everything. The hunt is stolen. The chances of 
getting something with a bow and arrow under those circumstances would be just 
blind luck -- one in a million." 
</P>
<P>
The first year the activists tried to follow the hunters from their camps. Last 
year they waited for them. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd get up on the high ground in the early mornings and look for the 
hunters coming up, and then they would dog the hunters," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
At an orientation for this year's hunters, Young advised patience. He didn't 
take his ram until the 11th day. 
</P>
<P>
"The hunt will be harder because of these people, but by no means impossible," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the DFG and Bureau of Land Management wardens cited three protesters 
but made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want to get involved in taking positive action because . . . it's 
a political hot potato," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
This year may be different, but not because of a new state law prohibiting the 
harassment of hunters. That calls only for a citation on the first offense and 
doesn't become a misdemeanor until the second offense, by which time the hunt 
is over. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Fish and Game Commission has designated the two hunting zones as 
wildlife-management areas, meaning that protesters could be immediately 
arrested and jailed on misdemeanor charges of disturbing wildlife, 
demonstrating without a permit, disorderliness, refusing to obey a law officer 
or behaving in an unsafe manner -- such as getting between a hunter and his 
prey. 
</P>
<P>
That tactic wasn't used during the recent Cache Creek tule elk hunt in northern 
California, when seven of 15 permit hunters got their elks but four or five 
others indicated that they were foiled by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett said: "It will be interesting to see what strategic games go on this 
year. There are different plans for interference -- also new capacity for legal 
action. They didn't know what to do with us because there wasn't any specific 
statute on the books. Now there is."

Bighorn hunt: California law limits permits in the current hunt of desert 
bighorn sheep in two zones of the eastern Mojave to 15% of the mature rams, not 
15% of the estimated total population, as reported in Friday's editions. 
Surveys indicated that 16 permits could have been issued this year, but the

IT HAS BECOME HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: COMMUNITY SUPPORT IS A BIG REASON WHY FONTANA HIGH HAS ONE OF 
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FONTANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the football coaches' office at Fontana High School, a chart hangs on the 
wall near a window facing the school's football field. The oversized chart is 
really a composite schedule of the school's opponents this season. 
</P>
<P>
The results of every game are written in the square above the school's name and 
there is a noticeable diagonal line of scores reading: 0-47, 9-35, 14-30, 0-30, 
6-18, 0-46, 0-41, 0-41, 7-41 and 22-30. They are all losses to Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
As Fontana heads into its Southern Section semifinal game Saturday night 
against Edison of Huntington Beach, the Steelers are the top-rated team in the 
state with a 12-0 record and are ranked third in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes teams are overrated in national polls, but a lot of Southern Section 
coaches figure Fontana's rating is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Grady, whose Los Angeles Loyola teams have won their share of Del 
Rey League titles, gave a respectful chuckle when asked about Fontana's 
football tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think its program speaks for itself," said Grady, whose Cubs are 1-4 against 
Fontana. "They are always well coached and they play extremely physical, 
hard-nosed football. A major reason why they are so great is the support they 
get from their community." 
</P>
<P>
Fontana is in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains, 50 miles east of 
Los Angeles. In a city of 78,000 people with only one high school, prep 
football is a way of life. And since 1974, that way has meant winning. 
</P>
<P>
Overflow crowds of 8,000 fill Fontana's stadium for late-season games against 
Citrus Belt League rivals Riverside Rubidoux, Colton, Rialto Eisenhower and San 
Gorgonio of San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Having one of the 1,500 season tickets is recommended because, in order to get 
a seat on the home side with a general admission ticket, people start lining up 
at 5 p.m., even though the game does not start until 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
"When teams come to play us they get mad when they find out that our fans have 
bought up all the tickets on their side because our home side was filled up," 
said Fontana Coach Dick Bruich, in his 13th year as coach. "We have a unique 
situation, where the community gives so much support." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Coach Mike Milner told the San Bernardino Sun after the 
Steelers had defeated his team in the first round of the Southern Section 
Division I playoffs, 51-6: "You have to play a perfect game to beat Fontana. 
They're that good. And on this field . . . It's the one field in the CIF where 
there is a distinct home-field advantage with their fan support and tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Support is a word commonly used in connection with Fontana football. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm spoiled," Bruich said when asked about a new high school, planned for 
1992. "The situation here is so good that I am like an only child. I don't want 
to look ahead when I'll have to share (players and community support) because 
I've been spoiled all of this time. I don't think that there will ever be a 
situation like this again." 
</P>
<P>
How good is Fontana's football program? 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers have defeated seven playoff teams and have outscored opponents, 
436-64, shutting out six. In the tough Citrus Belt League, they have allowed 
opponents not even a touchdown a game. 
</P>
<P>
In Fontana's 28-0 quarterfinal win at Long Beach Wilson last Friday, the 
Steelers held the Bruins to 21 yards in total offense. One Wilson player said 
after the game: "We hit 'em and played hard, but they just dominated us." 
</P>
<P>
Fontana intimidates opponents before the teams even meet with its reputation 
for fierce hitting. And next year the Steelers will be strong again, with the 
entire offensive line returning, including 6-foot-4, 270-pound tackles Clay 
Hattabaugh and Robert Loya. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bruich, the Steelers have made 13 consecutive playoff appearances, won 
seven Citrus Belt League titles, one Southern Section championship, and a 
mythical national title. Bruich's teams have a 125-31-1 record and have shut 
out 51 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana High opened in 1953, when the city population was under 14,000. In its 
early years, the Steelers' football program took its lumps and after the 1973 
season had a 65-118-8 record. In 1974, John Tyree, now coaching at Pasadena 
Muir, took over the Steelers' program and quickly turned it around. In his 
three seasons at Fontana, Tyree had a 26-9 record, leading the Steelers to the 
Southern Section major division championship game against Los Altos at Anaheim 
Stadium in his final season. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers' success continued when Bruich, Tyree's defensive coordinator, 
became head coach in 1977. Bruich had no prior experience as a head coach, but 
he surrounded himself with talented assistants, such as Skip Fazio and John 
MacKinney, who still coach at Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
And the Steelers' program began to grow as rapidly as the community. Fontana 
eventually grew into the largest school in the Southern Section with an 
enrollment of 3,400. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started here we had only 50 kids on the team," Bruich said. "Now 
we have a total of 83 and that is counting varsity and junior varsity." 
</P>
<P>
As the team got stronger, so did the community support. Bruich said that the 
Steelers' philosophy of "success breeds success" has played an equal role. 
"Over the years we have had to make many adjustments," he said. "We used to 
have only kids who were Fontana-bred. Now, with people moving here at such a 
rapid pace, we have many kids who are not familiar with Fontana or the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Fontana used to be a town based on the Kaiser steel mill, but when that shut 
down (in 1983), different people started to move into the area because of 
affordable housing. I would say now the mix of kids here is 50-50, with 
Fontana-bred kids and outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the mix, Bruich and his staff have the players and the community 
committed to the Steelers' winning style. When Fontana lost to Rubidoux last 
season, some players did not know how to react. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in total shock," said Kenneth Cannon, a senior two-way starter for the 
Steelers this season. "Winning is a tradition around here, it is something 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, winning high school football programs are filled with talented 
players who have graduated from youth programs geared to match the high 
school's. That is not the case in Fontana, though. 
</P>
<P>
"We just take the players as 10th-graders and then start to work with them," 
Bruich said. "We do not have any control over the programs at the junior high 
level. We take them as sophomores and then try to work out any bad habits they 
may have." 
</P>
<P>
So how does Fontana continue to win? 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when we are not the best team on the field but we win," Cannon 
said. "We win because we have a group of guys who have worked hard and play as 
a team." 
</P>
<P>
For Fontana, the mixture has worked successfully for the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
And Steeler opponents? They can only hope that the second high school in 
Fontana is finished on schedule and that 1992 comes quickly.

A commission concluded that Chilean goalkeeper Roberto Rojas intentionally cut 
his own forehead to halt a World Cup qualifying match that Chile lost to Brazil 
on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas, who has denied the charge, complained of being a scapegoat for what has 
been characterized as the country's biggest sports scandal. On Oct. 25, FIFA, 
soccer's world governing body, banned him from international play for life and 
suspended him from domestic soccer for three months.

WHITE HOUSE AIDES TURN UP HEAT ON WALL TO STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's senior assistants said Thursday that embattled thrift 
regulator M. Danny Wall has no supporters in the White House -- a clear signal 
that they want him to step down from the government agency charged with 
supervising the nation's savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush so far has refrained from calling on Wall to resign as chairman 
of the Office of Thrift Supervision, he has offered no public support for the 
regulator, and the President's aides have made it clear that they believe 
Wall's days in the job are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Wall has been criticized for his handling of the thrift crisis, particularly 
the problems leading up to the $2-billion collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan of Irvine. Wall rejected recommendations to seize Lincoln in 1987, 
delaying a government takeover until last April. 
</P>
<P>
"The life signs are not great," said one senior Administration official. Though 
the White House does not believe that Wall has "done anything wrong," the 
official said, "the situation is such a mess, and he's such an integral part of 
it, it would be best if he stepped aside." 
</P>
<P>
One of Wall's senior aides, Karl T. Hoyle, brushed aside such comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Rumors of our demise are greatly exaggerated," Hoyle said. "The White House 
has not contacted us. The Treasury has not asked us to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Wall has come under increasing fire in recent weeks. On Monday, Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) called on Bush to replace Wall to enable the 
Administration to make a "clean break" with regulatory policies that may have 
contributed to the Lincoln debacle. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, three public interest groups said Wall should be fired because he 
had handled the savings and loan crisis incompetently. Wall responded that his 
agency had saved taxpayers $6 billion to $8 billion last year by selling failed 
thrifts rather than liquidating them. 
</P>
<P>
When he testified last month before the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee, Wall had no visible Republican support. Indeed, several 
Republican members of the panel asked critical questions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in an interview in early November that he was considering whether to 
remove Wall but that he did not want to prejudge him. The President has made no 
public comments on the matter since then. 
</P>
<P>
The critical comments by the President's aides Thursday clearly turned up the 
heat on Wall by several degrees, although the advisers stopped short of saying 
that Bush himself wanted Wall to quit. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the frustration that senior officials at the White House say they 
feel over Wall's refusal to act on what appear to have been the broadest of 
hints that he step aside, one Bush aide said: "I'm not sure how you solve the 
situation. If he didn't want to take the revolver from the drawer, it's not 
clear he'll want to take the revolver placed in front of him on the desk." 
</P>
<P>
Another Administration official commented: "You can huff and puff, and if the 
guy feels the wind, he gets out. If he doesn't, he stays." 
</P>
<P>
In the face of such pressure, Wall appears to have the support of a key senator 
on banking issues, Jake Garn (R-Utah). Wall is a former Garn aide who served as 
staff director of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Garn 
was chairman of the committee from 1981 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Garn secured Wall's nomination as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
in July, 1987, and helped him keep the job earlier this year when Congress 
placed the board under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department and renamed 
it the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Garn refused to support comprehensive legislation to clean up the 
savings and loan industry unless Wall was allowed to keep his post without 
facing reconfirmation hearings in the Senate, according to Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, 
recently ended six weeks of hearings into the Lincoln controversy and 
acknowledged that the sessions were intended in part to force Wall to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez has said that the bank board's failure to seize Lincoln in 1987, as 
recommended by regulators in San Francisco, was responsible for the loss of an 
estimated $2.3 billion in federally insured deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings yielded evidence that Wall encouraged bank board employees to 
settle the Lincoln investigation amicably and that he was still resisting 
federal seizure of the thrift only days before it was put into receivership 
last April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Wall insisted in his testimony before the House committee that he did not have 
sufficient evidence to seize Lincoln sooner. He staunchly denied that his 
reluctance to act was the result of pressure from Charles H. Keating Jr., the 
Arizona financier who controlled Lincoln's parent firm and who had visited him 
three times at the bank board during the investigation of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But, Wall said, "I acknowledge that if we had known then what we know now about 
this savings and loan, I for one would have done things different -- even 
though it appeared to be a solvent and well-capitalized institution at the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the House committee disclosed Thursday that Keating 
had purchased $750,000 in Phoenix Cardinals football tickets last year using 
Lincoln's funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We now add professional football tickets to junk bonds, speculative land deals 
and luxury hotels as favorites on the Keating list of recommended investments," 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Committee officials said some of the estimated 16,000 tickets were offered to 
guests of the Phoenician Resort, a $300-million luxury hotel built by Keating 
near Phoenix. Others were used as part of promotional efforts in selling homes 
in Estrella, a giant master-planned community 20 miles outside Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
In radio commercials, Keating offered 50 pairs of tickets to each of the 
Cardinals' eight home games to prospective home buyers who visited Estrella 
model homes on the Saturdays before the team's games. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Lincoln's parent company said the tickets were purchased by a 
Lincoln subsidiary and not by Lincoln itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to Congressman Gonzalez' allegations, the Phoenix Cardinals tickets . 
. . were not purchased by Lincoln Savings," the company said. "Instead, they 
were purchased by the Phoenix Resort Corp. as part of its overall advertising 
and promotional budget." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Resort Corp. is a Lincoln subsidiary that operated the Phoenician 
Resort and the Crescent in Phoenix. The tickets were offered for sale as part 
of the hotels' weekend packages, an American Continental spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a marketing tool," the spokesman said. "When we bought the tickets, the 
Phoenix Cardinals were the hottest item in town."

BUILDERS USE HEALTH SPAS TO GET TENANTS; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: SOME DEVELOPERS BELIEVE THAT POSH HEALTH CLUBS GIVE OFFICE PARKS 
AN UPSCALE EDGE. BUT OTHERS WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN AFFORD $1,500 A YEAR TO 
WORK OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When local developers want to put a little more pizazz into their office parks, 
they often try to get a hotel to locate nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It is also fashionable these days to have a restaurant or two around, 
preferably one with a chic name that sounds vaguely Italian or Southwestern. 
</P>
<P>
In some buildings you can even get your car washed and detailed or have a 
concierge take your suit to the cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
Now there a new wrinkle: health clubs. Not the sort of unassuming little places 
usually found at the end of a strip shopping center. No. We're talking kayak 
runs. Cocktail lounges and restaurants. Meditation rooms. Sushi bars. In short, 
everything a '90s kind of person needs to stay fit fashionably. 
</P>
<P>
It's good for the developer because he gets to tell prospective tenants that 
their employees will be happier in his building; when they get stressed from 
making those big deals or from briefing that big case, they can race over to 
the health club for a workout. 
</P>
<P>
It seems like such a good idea, in fact, that two developers have planned 
gargantuan health clubs just across the freeway from each other among the glass 
office towers near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
There's just one problem: Both clubs are so big that they are likely to need 
several thousand members to make a profit. And with two clubs competing for a 
limited number of health-conscious yuppies -- people who can afford a $675 
initiation fee and $75 a month -- finding that many new members may not be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters still further, one of the clubs has a long head start: 
Sports Club/Irvine will open soon, its owners say. The second club -- the 
Sporting Club -- does not even have a building permit yet, though one is close 
to being issued. The Sporting Club says it will not open until late next year. 
</P>
<P>
Its competitor contends that that is nothing more than an optimistic guess. "It 
takes a year and a half to build one of these things because it's such an 
unusual type of building," Michael Talla, co-owner of Sports Club/Irvine, said. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's OK. They were advertising back in 1987 that they were going to open 
in June, 1989. We'll pay attention to them when they finally open." 
</P>
<P>
If that sounds a little snippy, it is. The two clubs have been taking potshots 
at each other for two years. But even partisans of the Sporting Club admit that 
its late start is going to hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's nervous about what the first few years are going to be like," said 
Bill Kearns of Birtcher, a Laguna Niguel developer that is leasing the land to 
the Sporting Club. Birtcher is building two office towers called Lakeshore 
Towers next door. "The marketing war is going to get ugly," Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the San Diego Freeway, at Koll Center Irvine North, the contractors are 
putting the finishing touches on Sports Club/Irvine. Koll Center Irvine is a 
cluster of office towers built by the big Newport Beach developer Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our biggest marketing factors is the amenities our office projects 
offer," a Koll spokesman said. Another big thing is traffic: It helps 
developers get permission to build if they can tell city planners that all the 
restaurants, theaters, health clubs and the like in their projects will 
persuade the workers in their office buildings to tarry a little longer and 
keep them off the streets during peak traffic hours. 
</P>
<P>
The health club on the Koll property will have a lot to keep office workers 
diverted. At 100,000 square feet -- about the floor space of 40 new houses -- 
the club will have vaulted ceilings, skylights, marble, the usual treadmills, 
exercise bicycles, two full-sized basketball courts, a pool, a sports medicine 
clinic, a spa, a salon, private trainers, valet parking, a shoe-shine service 
and even a press conference room "for business people." 
</P>
<P>
The other club -- also 100,000 square feet -- has most of that, plus a kayak 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Club/Irvine is run by the same people who run Sports Club/LA, a 
celebrity hangout described by People Magazine as "the fanciest gym in 
America." The Sports Club Co., which operates seven other clubs, is owned by 
Talla and Marvin Davis, the oil and entertainment mogul. 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting Club is a joint venture of San Diego developer Naiman Co. and two 
Japanese companies. A Naiman subsidiary has developed a string of posh health 
clubs across the country with Japanese companies as minority investors. The 
companies in the Irvine club are Nissho Iwai Corp. and Hiroshima Yakult Co. 
</P>
<P>
Both clubs began heavy advertising blitzes two years ago, long before anybody 
had turned a spadeful of dirt. And they have been signing up prospective 
members for months. It may be hard, however, for the Sporting Club to hold on 
to the 1,500 members it claims to have signed once the other club opens. (The 
Sports Club will not disclose its membership total.) 
</P>
<P>
Both clubs are risky propositions, because if a club fails, it is difficult to 
turn a building that big and that specialized into something else. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the risks, more such mega-clubs are likely to pop up in Southern 
California's urban areas. Not only are they chic, but with vacancy rates for 
office space more than 20% in some areas, the competition for tenants has 
become intense. Any edge they can get over other landlords -- including a 
health club -- is likely to appeal to office developers. 
</P>
<P>
Both health clubs say they are already talking to other Southern California 
developers about building clubs near other office projects. 
</P>
<P>
But therein lies a problem. Developers have already built too many office 
buildings in Southern California, sending vacancy rates through the roof. They 
have also built too many hotels in most places, and vacancy rates at hotels are 
high too. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in Irvine, we have what may be the first case of overbuilding these big 
new health clubs, just as the little strip-mall health clubs have saturated the 
market. In short, what started out as a solution to the problems of an 
overbuilt office market may eventually turn into a problem as well. 
</P>
<P>
And some experts are not even sure that tenants really care whether their 
building is near one of these big new health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done a lot of tenant surveys for developers who were toying with the 
idea of putting in tennis courts or jogging trails around their offices," said 
Bob Dunham, president of Newport Economics Group, a Newport Beach consulting 
firm. "But what tenants really want are reasonable rents and good property 
management. The other stuff ranks way down the list. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never understood the appeal of those things anyway," he added. "I pay $8 
a month to go to Nautilus."

ARAB BOYCOTTS HITTING HARD ON ISRAELI ECONOMY 
</P>

BETHLEHEM, Israeli-occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fuad Abu Ayta, the noodle king of the West Bank, was careful to design macaroni 
to meet the tastes not only of his Palestinian customers but also for Israeli 
clients who prefer thick-strand spaghetti to the thin style of Arab choice. 
</P>
<P>
His business thrived in both Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
until one day this fall, when someone noticed that the noodles he sold in 
Israel were packed in plastic bags that carried red, white, green and black 
labels, the colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of industrialists in Israel, the army raided Abu Ayta's factory 
last month and burned the bags. As 60,000 wrappers went up in smoke, the 
authorities explained that the colors were considered an incitement to 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Ayta protested that they were nothing of the sort. He had used the same 
wrappers a year before the Arab uprising began two years ago Dec. 9. But his 
argument 
</P>
<P>
failed, largely because it was not really the colors that bothered Israeli 
manufacturers of spaghetti and other goods. Rather, it is the Arab boycott of 
Israeli goods that is on their minds. They want the Israeli government to stop 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was the flag colors, no problem," said Abu Ayta, who has been making 
noodles since 1953. "But I'm afraid they don't want us to sell at all." 
</P>
<P>
Abu Ayta now prints his labels in orange, blue and white. 
</P>
<P>
The "noodle war," as the affair is known in the West Bank, was a symptom of a 
larger economic conflict between Israel and Palestinians, with roots in the 
2-year-old uprising. Slowly and steadily, Palestinians have weaned themselves 
from a variety of Israeli products, often substituting home-grown goods or just 
doing without. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer boycott in the West Bank and Gaza has contributed to a yearlong 
recession in Israel. A captive market has escaped, and Israeli manufacturers 
are rankled. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians continue to work and sell inside Israel; although Arab 
manufactured goods are few, the income from Israel helps keep the uprising 
afloat by providing scarce cash to the rebellious population of 1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the rules to be the same for both sides. If we buy from the 
Palestinians, we want the Palestinians to buy from us," said Dan Bibro, who 
operates the Israel Cold Storage Co., a purveyor of fish and meat products. 
</P>
<P>
If the Palestinians do not buy, Bibro suggested, the government should force 
Arab manufacturers to print their labels in Arabic so that consumers can more 
readily identify products from the occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
The Israel Manufacturers Assn. estimates that Israel's food industry alone has 
lost $100 million in sales in the West Bank and Gaza because of the boycott. It 
was the association that complained to the government about Abu Ayta's labels. 
</P>
<P>
Total Israeli sales of about $1 billion a year have dropped by 30% to 50% since 
the uprising began in December, 1987, according to government estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the government resists cracking down on Palestinian products. Any such 
move, officials say, would further alienate the territories from Israel. It is 
government policy to maintain as much normal contact as possible under Israeli 
occupation and not create a de facto state of separation. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the boycott can almost never be total. Palestinians perforce must 
buy plenty of products from Israel because there are no viable alternatives. 
Israeli enterprises control the import of flour and fuel, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Trade and Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, a leading hawk, chastised the 
Defense Ministry for failing to take action against Palestinian businesses. "We 
have to stop playing bleeding-heart games," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott is not the only negative effect of the intifada on the Israeli 
economy. Construction has been slowed by the frequent strikes by Palestinian 
workers, who make up almost the entire work force on building sites. The 
uprising has also had "an adverse effect" on the willingness of Israelis to 
make new investments inside Israel, a recent Bank Hapoalim report said. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising is, however, only partly responsible for the Israeli recession. A 
Bank of Israel report published this summer noted that the government has no 
"well-thought-out, long-term economic policy." 
</P>
<P>
The government has been trying to reconcile its preoccupation with inflation 
and concern over growing unemployment, now at a decade-high 9%. The 
anti-inflation battle has slowed the economy; recently, the government began to 
increase spending, which will probably boost the nation's economic growth next 
year as well as the inflation rate, which will surge higher than the current 
20% a year. 
</P>
<P>
While Israel counts its economic woes, the Palestinians are faced with 
shattering prospects. Despite Israeli claims that the intifada has been a 
godsend for the Palestinians as Arab businesses try to replace Israeli goods, 
the overall effect of the turmoil has been devastating. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the damage is self-inflicted and results from the Palestinians' efforts 
to protest Israeli rule by all means available. Frequent commercial strikes 
reduce retail sales. Attacks on cars with stones and gasoline bombs have 
curtailed visits by Israeli businessmen and free-spending consumers, especially 
crippling commercial cities such as Bethlehem, Qalqilya and Ramallah that did a 
brisk trade with the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Many clothing and shoe factories that did piecework for Israeli firms are 
closed because of the hostility or threats of anti-Israeli activists opposed to 
doing business with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The small size of the Palestinian market inhibits any real effort to replace 
Israeli goods with local items. The main exception has been soft drinks. 
Back-yard vegetable gardens have been only marginally successful, and the lack 
of industry continues to force migrant labor into Israel to take low-skill 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's campaign to crush the uprising has spilled over far into the economic 
arena. Taxes were raised on Arab businesses to make up for declining revenues. 
Authorities have denied export permits for important cash crops, such as melons 
and grapes, as well as for quarried stone, a major West Bank product. The army 
has imposed curfews on wide areas during harvest time, reducing the amount of 
food that farmers can haul in from their fields. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is hard to move money in and out of the occupied lands: To prevent 
funds from being used to pay activists in the uprising, Israel limits 
remittances from abroad to $250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
All of this turbulence has hit an economy that was weak to begin with. The West 
Bank and Gaza were virtual mercantile colonies of Israel; the balance of trade 
was $814 million in favor of Israel before the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli government has continued a program of confiscating land, 
especially traditional communal holdings, and has put more than half of the 
territory under direct government control, either as military zones or land 
earmarked for development of settlements. Seventy percent of the water 
resources are diverted to Israel, and construction by Palestinians is virtually 
at a standstill due to stiff building rules designed to restrict the expansion 
of Arab towns. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these hardships, there appears to be little chance that the boycott 
will be called off or commerce regularized soon. Youthful members of rebel 
"strike forces" are constantly on the lookout for merchants selling Israeli 
goods.

MAN HELD IN PLOT TO KIDNAP, RANSOM TEXAS BILLIONAIRE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: A TENNESSEE MAN ALLEGEDLY PLANNED TO KIDNAP ROBERT M. BASS AND 
HOLD HIM FOR $5 MILLION.

A man was held Thursday on racketeering and extortion charges for an alleged 
plot to kidnap Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass and hold him for $5-million 
ransom, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
Austin James Veleff, 57, of Germantown, Tenn., was arrested by FBI agents on 
Wednesday after he had driven to Texas with an undercover agent he thought was 
going to help him. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest came after Veleff took pictures of City Place, a 33-story office 
complex built by the Bass family, where Robert Bass has his office. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll Andre, an assistant U.S. attorney in Memphis, Tenn., said Veleff had 
never met Bass and had no connection with him. He had made Bass the target of a 
kidnaping after reading about him in a business magazine, Andre said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities had been aware of the alleged plot since May. But Andre 
said Veleff told the undercover agent he had been planning to abduct Bass for 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Kelly, a lawyer for the Bass family, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent William Fallin of Memphis, the agent in charge of the investigation, 
said Veleff planned to ask for $5-million ransom after taking Bass to south 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Veleff, an advertising salesman for the Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper for 
about 20 years, had operated a swimming pool business for about eight years 
before becoming unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Veleff could face a maximum prison term of five years and a fine 
of up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Andre said that in addition to the $5-million ransom, Veleff talked about 
filming Bass "in distressing situations" and seeking an additional $20 million 
after the initial ransom had been delivered by plane to a mountain in Mexico.

SHOPPING RUSH STARTS WITH SPURT OF VIOLENCE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DOZENS OF FRIGHTENED SHOPPERS WITNESS ARMED ASSAULTS IN THREE SOUTHLAND 
INCIDENTS. THE CONFRONTATIONS RESULT IN ONE DEATH AND ONE INJURY.

Armed men confronted patrons at two busy shopping areas and a restaurant in a 
bizarre string of violent outbursts that occurred just as the holiday shopping 
season was starting. 
</P>
<P>
The unrelated incidents in downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood and Rancho Palos 
Verdes terrified dozens of people and resulted in one death and one injury 
Wednesday as police killed a man allegedly stalking shoppers with a 16-inch 
hunting knife and wounded another said to have aimlessly fired his gun into a 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth on Thursday called the actions 
"commentaries on the type of violence we are dealing with," but said he doubted 
it is an omen for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"They are coincidences in that they happened so close together," Booth said. 
"But there's no relationship between them. This is not an indication that the 
streets of Los Angeles will be riddled with gunfire while people are out doing 
their Christmas shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the first confrontation began at 4:15 p.m. Wednesday, when an 
unidentified man started threatening people with a knife he had stolen from a 
display counter at one of the shops located in the Arcade Building, a crowded 
indoor shopping plaza in the 500 block of South Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who appeared to be in his 50s, reportedly brandished the knife in 
front of two people before frightened downtown shoppers flagged down a 
motorcycle officer. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Espinosa, a security guard at the arcade, said a second police officer 
eventually joined in the pursuit as the man sprinted down the vendor-lined 
plaza jammed with afternoon shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Police repeatedly shouted to the man, "Drop the knife! Drop the knife!" but he 
continued to flee, Espinosa said. About two thirds of the way through the 
arcade, he stopped and grabbed a salesman in front of Nice Gifts, an 
electronics shop, and reportedly threatened to stab him. 
</P>
<P>
"The man with the knife said to the employee, 'You are my protection,' " said 
Herman Secena, the building manager. "He didn't pay attention to what police 
were yelling at him." 
</P>
<P>
Secena said police then shot at the knife-wielding man several times as 
shoppers looked on, hitting him in the leg and the midsection. As he was 
keeling over from the gunshot wounds, he made a feeble attempt at throwing the 
"huge" knife at the police officers, the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
The man died hours later at County-USC Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, a man identified as Francisco Salazar, 31, reportedly 
fired several shots into a crowd of shoppers in the vicinity of Santa Monica 
Boulevard and St. Andrews Place in Hollywood at about 5:50 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries, according to police, who said Salazar turned and ran 
from the hysterical crowd as two police officers in an unmarked car arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Hall said Salazar ignored the officers' orders to halt. 
</P>
<P>
"They got out of their vehicle and identified themselves as police officers," 
he said. "But the suspect continued to run." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the officers opened fire when Salazar stopped in a parking lot, 
turned and confronted them with his gun. Salazar, shot in the the neck and 
abdomen, was in serious but stable condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Sol Feldman, 65, owner of Music Center in the 5600 block of Santa Monica, 
across the street from the parking lot, said business has progressively quieted 
as the neighborhood has deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
"Incidents like this definitely affect business," Feldman said as he stared at 
two nickel-sized bullet holes in the showroom window of his musical instrument 
store. 
</P>
<P>
In line with one hole was a used parlor grand piano with a bullet lodged in it. 
Two pianos away, the leg on a new spinet had been shattered by another errant 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
"People find out where we are located, and they don't want to come here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Rancho Palos Verdes, meanwhile, sheriff's deputies were investigating a 
thwarted armed robbery that occurred shortly before midnight Wednesday, when 
three men entered Reuben's Restaurant in the 28000 block of South Western 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said one of the men grabbed a customer who tried to flee as another, 
who was holding a gun, walked over to the dance floor and told a handful of 
customers and employees: "This is serious. This is not a joke." 
</P>
<P>
As the gunman reportedly pushed one of the patrons to the floor, a waitress ran 
through the dining room, which was closed for the evening, and locked herself 
inside the manager's office. Deputies said the gunman fired a shot, but the 
waitress was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
When the gunman overheard the waitress calling the 911 emergency number, he 
reportedly ran back to the bar and fired another shot into the ceiling before 
fleeing with his accomplices, deputies said.

RENT CONTROL'S IMPACT ON HOUSING UNRESOLVED BY DEBATE AT HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As 150 elderly persons loudly protested outside, Assemblyman Dan Hauser 
conducted hearings in Los Angeles on Thursday into local rent control laws that 
he claims drive away badly needed apartment development in California. 
</P>
<P>
But a parade of officials from West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Berkeley and Los 
Angeles instead urged Hauser to turn his critical eye to cities without rent 
control, claiming that California's rent-control cities are leaders in the 
building and rehabilitating of low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Hauser's aide, Stephen Holloway, said the premise of the hearing was "that the 
more stringent the rent control, the less affordable housing is built." Hauser 
(D-Arcata), chairman of the Assembly Committee on Housing and Community 
Development, has authored a bill to allow the state to intervene in 
rent-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
Hauser's featured speaker, Anthony Downs, a rent-control foe and free market 
advocate from the Brookings Institution, said regulations such as rent control 
and downzoning are "a central cause of high housing prices and rents in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Downs singled out cities with strict rent controls, such as West Hollywood and 
Santa Monica, but was challenged by officials of those cities to compare their 
housing records with areas where no rent controls exist. 
</P>
<P>
"What you should focus on is the lack of affordable housing in non-rent control 
cities," West Hollywood Councilman John Heilman said. "What you'll find is that 
. . . their shortages of affordable housing and housing problems are far 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
In a testy exchange with state Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles), 
Downs claimed that housing construction in Santa Monica has fallen dramatically 
since the adoption of rent control 10 years ago, a situation that he said will 
drive up rents in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Demanding that Downs produce proof, Hayden responded, "Santa Monica in fact 
creates a higher percentage, per capita, of affordable housing than any city in 
the state. . . . It's the envy of the state. . . . There's no evidence after 10 
years (under rent control) that your ideology is correct." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was described by several city officials as the launching of a 
statewide effort by landlord groups to wrest control from cities and allow the 
state to decide when rent control is proper. 
</P>
<P>
Hauser, a rural legislator known for his timber and outdoor expertise, does not 
represent any cities with urban housing problems. He has proposed a bill that 
would allow the state to alter or abolish strict rent controls in cities if the 
state determines that the laws hurt housing development. 
</P>
<P>
"Hauser knows cows, not tenants," said Larry Gross, a longtime West Hollywood 
rent-control activist. "Why is he crusading against cities who are going out of 
their way to attack the housing crisis, and why is he bringing in a 
rent-control foe like Tony Downs?" 
</P>
<P>
Outside, a throng of mostly elderly protesters carried an effigy of an 
affordable home sitting in a coffin and chanted, "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Dan 
Hauser's got to go!" One man carried a sign reading, "Don't Make Grandpas 
Homeless," while another said, "More Housing, Less Hauser." 
</P>
<P>
Hauser insisted, however, that he was not fighting rent control but was instead 
trying to boost housing construction in cities where controls might dampen 
developer enthusiasm. He said he is concerned about laws in a handful of cities 
that prevent landlords from raising rents on vacant units. 
</P>
<P>
(By contrast, in Los Angeles rents are protected only until a unit is vacated, 
at which time the landlord can raise it to any level he chooses. Known as 
"vacancy decontrol," it has allowed rents here to escalate 110% since 1980 
while providing some protection to renters as long as they do not move, city 
officials said.) 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 study, Downs found that mild rent controls such as Los Angeles' do 
not hurt development. But he contends that cities that prevent landlords from 
boosting rents on empty units are wrongly keeping rents from rising to whatever 
the market will bear. 
</P>
<P>
Removing controls from a choicely located but still solidly middle-class city 
such as Santa Monica "may eventually exclude almost all low-income and 
moderate-income households and permit only wealthy residents to live there," 
Downs wrote in his study. "But that is an inherent and essential aspect of the 
free market system." 
</P>
<P>
Despite many studies on the rent-control issue, there is little clear-cut 
evidence that rent control is the underlying cause of downturns in housing 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that apartment development is more directly hampered by regional 
economic downturns, restrictive land-use laws and downzoning, the removal of 
federal tax incentives for investors, speculation that drives up residential 
land costs in boom areas, volatile interest rates and the shunning of poor 
areas by lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle, which has no rent control, suffered a 24% decline in apartment 
construction in the 1980s, according to Downs' study. Meanwhile, Los Angeles, 
with rent control, enjoyed a 14.7% surge in such construction in the 1980s. It 
bettered San Diego, which has no rent control and whose apartment construction 
increased 14.3%.

Driven in large part by the West Coast land boom, rents in both Los Angeles and 
San Diego have skyrocketed in the 1980s, according to the Joint Center for 
Housing Studies at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
The center found that, regardless of whether rent controls exist, rents in 
California have far outstripped inflation or minor increases in local family 
earnings. San Diego, California's largest city without rent control, is the 
most expensive city in the nation with a median rent of $628, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
Economists often argue that removing rent controls could increase the supply of 
housing and lower rental prices in the long run. But urban planners and 
sociologists often counter that low-income housing was abandoned by the free 
market years before rent controls were adopted in the late 1970s and early 
1980s. In fact, low-income housing in California is built largely through 
government subsidies and intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to a study on rental housing by Richard Appelbaum, chairman 
of the department of sociology at UC Santa Barbara, landlords "do not behave 
competitively" by lowering rents on long-vacant apartments as would be expected 
under natural laws of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
He found that landlords will not lower rents until vacancy rates in a region 
climb to 8% or 10% -- a rare condition that has not existed in most urban areas 
for many years. 
</P>
<P>

Figures below show the number of low-income housing units built or 
rehabilitated since 1986 by California cities with rent controls compared to 
the amount of low-income housing developed by cities without rent controls 
during the same period.

Atlantic Richfield Co. and Barmet Aluminum Corp. in Carson each were charged 
with two counts of air pollution Thursday by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor complaints, which carry a fine of $10,000 each, were filed in 
Compton Municipal Court. Last May, Arco negligently discharged air contaminants 
from a coke heater and gas unit incinerator, while Barmet unlawfully operated 
an aluminum melting furnace, said Deputy Dist. Atty. William W. Carter.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DMV OPENS ITS FIRST DRIVE-THROUGH WINDOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Motor Vehicles opened its first drive-through window this 
week at its Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
The window is designed for people with simple needs, such as picking up forms 
and pamphlets and vehicle registration, and offers a way to cut down on lines 
inside the office, said DMV Director Del Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
But DMV officials conceded the drive-through idea has some drawbacks, not the 
least of which is that few things at the DMV are simple. The office faces the 
ugly possibility that a string of cars will be backed up at the window as their 
drivers try to work out their DMV problems. Pierce acknowledged that the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District's ambitious clean-air plan could spell 
the end of all drive-through windows, including the one at the DMV.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPOSED GARBAGE PACT WOULD SET QUOTA FOR 
CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed agreement between the city and county of Los Angeles on development 
of a regional garbage dump in Elsmere Canyon would result in the city paying 
fines if it failed to deliver large volumes of trash. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said the provision could discourage recycling and make it 
more difficult for the city to comply with a state law requiring the volume of 
trash sent to landfills to be sharply reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed pact, already endorsed by county supervisors, would penalize the 
city if less than 6,000 tons per day of trash generated within city limits is 
hauled to the planned dump near the junction of the Antelope Valley and Golden 
State freeways east of the city of Santa Clarita. The city would pay a penalty 
of $1 for each ton less than that amount, although the fine could be raised by 
as much as 6% per year.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBIL PLEADS NO CONTEST IN 2 PIPELINE 
RUPTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. pleaded no contest Thursday to charges stemming from two 
pipeline ruptures in the San Fernando Valley last year that spilled more than 
130,000 gallons of crude oil into city sewers and the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil entered the pleas in Los Angeles Municipal Court to two violations of a 
law making it a crime punishable by up to a $1,000 fine to allow petroleum 
products to pass into state waters. 
</P>
<P>
The pipes -- which carry 2.6 million gallons a day from Kern County to Mobil's 
Torrance refinery -- spewed oil onto city streets in Encino on Sept. 10, 1988, 
and in Sherman Oaks on Sept. 27, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office said it will ask that Mobil be made to pay about 
$100,000 to various agencies that helped clean up the spill.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT SEIZED IN 1978 THEFT OF ORIENTAL 
ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of stealing a million-dollar collection of hundreds of ancient 
Nepalese and Tibetan art objects in New York 11 years ago was arrested Thursday 
at his South Los Angeles home, where he had been hiding the antiquities, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Warner, 40, was arrested at his home on suspicion of receiving and 
transporting stolen property and was being held on $5,000 bail, said Detective 
William Martin, the Police Department's art crimes specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The collection is made up of hundreds of Tibetan and Nepalese statues and art 
objects, many dating to the 8th Century. The antiquities, many of them 
depictions of Oriental gods, were stolen Christmas Day, 1978, from the 
Manhattan home of antiquities collector Jane Werner, Martin said. Martin said 
the suspect and Werner were acquaintances in New York and that Warner had been 
an original suspect in the case.

ELSMERE DUMP PLAN CRITICIZED FOR MINIMUM TRASH QUOTA; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE MANAGEMENT: THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT WOULD PENALIZE L.A. IF IT DID NOT 
PRODUCE ENOUGH GARBAGE. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH STATE 
LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed agreement between the city and county of Los Angeles to jointly 
develop a regional garbage dump in Elsmere Canyon would impose fines on the 
city if it failed to deliver large volumes of trash. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the fine provision in the proposed pact could discourage 
recycling and make it harder for the city to comply with a state law requiring 
sharp reductions in the volume of trash dumped in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed pact, already endorsed by county supervisors, would penalize the 
city if less than 6,000 tons per day of trash generated within city limits are 
dumped in the landfill planned near the junction of the Antelope Valley and 
Golden State freeways east of the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Initially the city would be fined $1 for each ton less than that minimum, 
although the fine could be raised by as much as 6% per year. The fine would be 
paid to a joint powers authority to be set up to run the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the minimum-dumping provision is inconsistent with a new state law 
requiring cities and counties to reduce trash dumped in landfills by 25% by the 
start of 1995 and by 50% by the year 2000, or face stiff penalties of up to 
$10,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
"That is an appalling provision," said Rod Miller, legislative director of 
Californians Against Waste, a pro-recycling group based in Sacramento. "It 
creates an incentive for producing garbage . . . as opposed to creating an 
incentive for reducing garbage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Elsmere proposal reduces the "pressure to put forward the recycling and the 
waste reduction that's so desperately needed now," said Fritzi Bernstein of 
Sherman Oaks, a member of the Sierra Club and the Los Angeles County Solid 
Waste Management Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials who negotiated with the county defended the proposal, which 
the City Council is scheduled to consider Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said "there is no question in the world" the city will 
generate at least 6,000 tons a day for Elsmere -- and still meet state 
requirements to cut trash dumping at least 25% in the next 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Deaton, the City Council's assistant chief legislative analyst, said he 
did not believe the Elsmere deal would undermine a proposed mandatory curbside 
recycling program being considered by the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Recycling is a high priority within the city and this decision does not affect 
that priority," said Deaton. "The situation is that there are not that many 
landfills. . . . Even if you assume substantial recycling, there still is a 
need to get rid of what's left over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city Bureau of Sanitation currently hauls 6,000 tons per day of household 
trash -- taking 4,000 tons to the city-owned Lopez Canyon landfill above 
Lakeview Terrace and dividing the remaining waste between the private Sunshine 
Canyon and Bradley West landfills in the San Fernando Valley, BKK's West Covina 
dump and the county's Calabasas landfill. 
</P>
<P>
However, refuse hauled by the city represents but a third of the 18,000 tons 
per day generated within the city limits. Waste trucked by private haulers from 
businesses in the city would also count toward the Elsmere quota of 6,000 tons 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
The 6,000 tons per day works out to just over 1.5 million tons per year. At $1 
per ton, the maximum conceivable penalty would be $1.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
Gage said the penalty clause would save taxpayers money because it would lower 
the interest rate on revenue bonds to be sold to finance development of the 
190-million-ton landfill. He said the guarantee of a minimum amount of dumping 
would lower the risk to bondholders and thus the interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the dump were startled by the mere mention of minimum dumping 
levels. Jill Klajic, a Santa Clarita resident and a member of the anti-dump 
Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee, called it "really bizarre" to set a 
floor rather than a ceiling on dumping. 
</P>
<P>
The state's new solid-waste reduction law, authored by Assemblyman Byron D. 
Sher (D-Palo Alto), requires that at least 25% of all trash now going to 
landfills be diverted by recycling or waste reduction programs by 1995, and 
mandates a 50% reduction by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 18,000 tons per day produced by households and businesses in Los Angeles 
would thus have to be cut to 9,000 tons per day in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In order for the city to satisfy the 6,000-ton minimum at Elsmere while holding 
its total landfill dumping to 9,000 tons, it would have to reduce its reliance 
on other landfills. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in 1985 inaugurated a voluntary curbside recycling program in 
parts of the Westside, pronounced it a smashing success, and said it could soon 
be expanded citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Four and a half years later, the program has grown to 95,000 households, but 
that's less than 15% of the 720,000 households served by the city's Bureau of 
Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, participants separate glass, metal cans, newspapers and 
plastic bottles from regular trash for pickup by special city trucks. 
</P>
<P>
A plan being considered by the City Council would expand the program citywide 
during the next three years and make participation mandatory. Eventually, yard 
waste and mixed paper would be included among the recyclable items -- with a 
goal of diverting about 40% of the trash now going to landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The city's investment in the program could be as much as $150 million over the 
next three to five years, Deaton said. 
</P>
<P>
City and county officials have hailed the Elsmere dump as a key to averting a 
crisis stemming from dwindling landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed city-county agreement, tentatively approved by county supervisors 
last week, would create a joint powers authority to finance and operate the 
dump, most of which is on Angeles National Forest land about one mile north of 
the Los Angeles city limit and 1 1/2 miles east of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
The authority would sell $195 million in revenue bonds to acquire and develop 
the site, and pay off the bonds with tipping fees of roughly $20 for each ton 
of trash dumped.

CHANGES IN EAST BLOC ENCOURAGE CHINESE, REFORM LEADER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

News of the dramatic changes sweeping Eastern Europe is bringing hope to 
Chinese intellectuals and others whose campaign for government reform was 
brutally crushed in June by the Red Army at Tian An Men Square, a founder of 
the Chinese reform movement said in a speech Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Su Shaozhi, who escaped prosecution by authorities in China by coming to 
the United States last summer, said reforms in his country will probably come 
only after the deaths of old-time party leaders such as Deng Xiaoping. Shaozhi 
spoke at the Cal State Northridge campus to about 80 people, mostly professors 
and a handful of students required to be there for class assignments. 
</P>
<P>
The government crackdown after the spring uprising by Chinese students 
demanding government reforms has galvanized public sentiment against the ruling 
powers, Shaozhi said. 
</P>
<P>
The military action on demonstrations in cities across China provided hard-line 
party leaders with a convenient excuse to end the few economic reforms that 
Chinese had begun to enjoy, he said. The result has been a worsening of 
economic conditions there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole Chinese nation is in crisis: political, economic and ecological," 
Shaozhi said. 
</P>
<P>
The news of government reforms in countries such as Poland, East Germany and 
Czechoslovakia is trickling into China, despite government efforts to keep the 
news out, Shaozhi said. Among Chinese students and intellectuals, those 
developments are helping keep alive hopes for reform. 
</P>
<P>
"But change will take time; one, two years or more," Shaozhi said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaozhi, 67, urged students and professors at CSUN to continue academic 
exchange programs with China. After the Tian An Men Square killings, CSUN 
President James Cleary ordered a temporary halt to such exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"I encourage you to go and talk to the Chinese people," Shaozhi said. "I 
encourage you to, as the party says, 'pollute' the Chinese people." 
</P>
<P>
Cleary's order to halt the exchanges came after university officials had 
difficulty securing the return of 15 students and nine professors who were in 
China when the military crushed student demonstrations in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Shaozhi's appearance at CSUN was the last stop of a two-month speaking tour. It 
was the second time he has spoken at the Northridge campus, which has 
established ties with 17 Chinese universities in nine cities. 
</P>
<P>
Shaozhi, who was director of China's prestigious Institute of Marxist-Leninist 
Research before falling out of favor with party officials two years ago, said 
the student demonstrators last spring represented millions of Chinese unhappy 
with widespread political corruption, nepotism and economic troubles in their 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Shaozhi, who is a visiting professor this year at Marquette University, said 
the government, in its attempt to spread its version of the June massacre, has 
called for the Chinese to rewrite entries in personal diaries for from May 15 
to June 15 to reflect the government's version of events.

China moratorium -- An article on Dec. 1 reported that Cal State Northridge 
President James Cleary had ordered a temporary halt to the school's academic 
exchange programs with China after the military crackdown against student 
protesters in June. In fact it was California State University Vice Chancellor 
Lee R. Kerschner who ordered the moratorium. Cleary said he argued 
unsuccessfully against the order.

MOBIL PLEADS NO CONTEST TO CHARGES IN OIL SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. pleaded no contest Thursday to misdemeanor criminal charges 
arising from two pipeline ruptures last year that spilled more than 130,000 
gallons of crude oil into city sewers in Encino and Sherman Oaks and the Los 
Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation entered the pleas in Los Angeles Municipal Court to two 
violations of a state Fish and Game code section that makes it a crime to allow 
any petroleum or residual product to befoul state waters. The maximum penalty 
is a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Vincent B. Sato said he will ask the court at a Jan. 4 
sentencing hearing to order Mobil to repay about $100,000 to government 
agencies that incurred costs as a result of the spill. The agencies include the 
U.S. Coast Guard and the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Sato said an investigation found that changes in the temperature of oil being 
transported through the pipeline caused it to corrode and to rupture the first 
time. The second break occurred while the pipeline was being repaired after the 
first leak. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, which carries 2.6 million gallons a day from Kern County oil 
fields to Mobil's Torrance refinery, released sticky oil onto city streets in 
Encino on Sept. 10, 1988, and in Sherman Oaks on Sept. 27. Some of the oil 
flowed into the storm sewer system, polluting the Los Angeles River from the 
San Fernando Valley to Long Beach and killing hundreds of fish and at least 33 
waterfowl, Sato said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was no evidence that the company had been negligent or had 
spilled the oil intentionally, which would have been felony offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest J. Getto, an attorney for Mobil, said the company revised its monitoring 
procedures and began replacing older sections of the pipeline after the 
ruptures occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Getto said the pleas entered by the company "just mean we're not going to 
contest the charges. It's not at all tantamount to a guilty plea." 
</P>
<P>
In August, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board levied an 
$85,000 fine against the company for the two breaks. Officials lauded Mobil for 
spending about $3 million to clean up the spills. But they said the volume of 
the leaks would have been less had the company installed more shut-off valves.

FINAL POLISH PUT ON HARBOR AREA PLAN BEFORE VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
ZONING: THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS FINE-TUNED A PROPOSAL FOR RESIDENTIAL AND 
COMMERCIAL USES AND HAS SENT IT TO THE CITY COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission on Thursday took its last look at the 
revised Wilmington-Harbor City Community Plan, tied up several loose ends and 
-- after more than six months of review -- sent the complex document along to 
the City Council for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
In their latest round of fine-tuning, the planning commissioners, who approved 
most of the plan in August, again confronted the harbor area's patchwork mix of 
industrial and residential uses, particularly in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Their final set of recommendations pertained solely to that community. Among 
them were: 
</P>
<P>
That several chunks of east Wilmington, now zoned for medium-density 
residential development and in some cases manufacturing, be zoned for 
single-family use, a designation that residents say will help them protect that 
part of town from urban blight. 
</P>
<P>
That a so-called "historic preservation overlay zone" be adopted to preserve 
the character of the Banning Park neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
That Watson Land Co., which stores shipping containers on its property, be 
required to stack the containers in stair-step fashion away from residential 
areas. The company would be required to maintain a 75-foot buffer zone between 
the containers and Q Street, with the outer row of containers stacked only 
three high and none stacked higher than five. 
</P>
<P>
That a triangular piece of property owned by the Department of Water and Power 
remain zoned industrial for another four years before being converted to 
commercial use. The DWP says it needs the land near the foot of Avalon 
Boulevard to store construction materials while it retrofits its nearby steam 
plant. But community activists want the property converted to commercial zoning 
immediately for inclusion in a waterfront development. The DWP has pledged to 
give up the land eventually. 
</P>
<P>
That property owned by Gunn Van Lines, a moving and storage company on 
McFarland Avenue, south of Pacific Coast Highway, be rezoned to conform with 
the single-family neighborhood around it. 
</P>
<P>
The move to rezone Gunn Van Lines came as a surprise to residents, as well as 
to Planning Department staffers -- who had not recommended it -- and to company 
officials, who were not present during the hearing at Los Angeles Harbor 
Department headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
If the rezoning is upheld, the company will constitute a so-called 
"nonconforming use," a designation that city planners say could force it to 
phase out its operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to fight it, of course," said company owner Dan Gunn, adding that 
company officials have been tracking the Planning Commission's actions to 
ensure their land would not be affected. "At the last meeting we thought we 
were pretty safe." 
</P>
<P>
According to city planner Don Taylor, Gunn operates under a court order that 
says the company may do business at its current location -- in an area zoned 
for duplexes -- so long as the zoning does not change. The court ruling stemmed 
from a 1980 lawsuit against the city by the previous property owner, Swift 
Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
In his report to the commissioners, Taylor recommended that the Gunn property 
be left alone. He told the commissioners Thursday that they would be "pushing 
Gunn Van Lines out" if they rezoned the land. 
</P>
<P>
But when residents complained Thursday that the rest of the neighborhood was 
zoned for single-family use, the commissioners said it made sense for the Gunn 
property to be zoned that way as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good planning reason for doing this," said commission President 
William G. Luddy, acknowledging that the decision may prompt a second lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
When Thursday's hearing was over, Luddy thanked residents, who have turned out 
for hearing after hearing since the plan was first presented to the commission 
in April. "You've put in a lot of time and effort on it," he told about two 
dozen residents who showed up Thursday, "and I think you're getting a good 
product." 
</P>
<P>
It has been nearly two decades since the current Wilmington-Harbor City 
Community Plan was adopted in 1970. The old plan left the two communities -- 
and Wilmington especially -- vulnerable to a pattern of development that 
allowed factories and heavy industry to crop up alongside single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan, which is designed to govern growth until the year 2010, attempts 
to correct that through rezoning and creating buffer zones. It also seeks to 
promote revitalization of Wilmington's downtown business district, preserve 
open space and curb truck traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Concerning that traffic, residents pressed the commissioners to include 
language in the plan that would call for construction of a "loop road" that 
would circle Wilmington's neighborhoods, forming a clear truck route in and out 
of the Port of Los Angeles. But commissioners were reluctant to do so, saying 
the matter should be taken up by transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Planning Commission has signed off on the document, it will be 
forwarded to the City Council for review by the council's Planning and Land Use 
Management Committee. After the committee reviews the plan, the full council 
will vote on it. 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, the planning commissioners delayed action on a plan to rezone 
industrial portions of North Gaffey Street in San Pedro, where residents are 
pressing the city to force out a scrap metal yard and oil tank farms. 
</P>
<P>
The matter was postponed until Feb. 1 at the request of the city attorney's 
office, prompting a complaint from a deputy to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores. The deputy, Mario Juravich, noted that the case was first 
scheduled for hearing before the commissioners last March. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been delayed on and on," he said.

AQUINO ALLIES, FOES IN CONFRONTATION AT CONSULATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland 7,000 miles away, 
supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match Thursday 
night with supporters of President Corazon Aquino at the Philippine Consulate 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better Philippines 
held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on Wilshire Boulevard to express 
sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio 
Honasan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for Mrs. Aquino to step down immediately," said Milo Castelo, 
45, a Los Angeles attorney. He said the Aquino government is "inept and 
incompetent" and guilty of "rampant corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Castelo and a handful of the protesters then entered the office building and 
took the elevator to the 12th-floor consulate, where a coalition of four 
Filipino groups in Los Angeles that support the Aquino government had just 
completed a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen television news crews watched as the anti-government protesters 
confronted the acting consul general for the Philippines in Los Angeles, Willy 
C. Gaa. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in sympathy with the coup in the Philippines!" announced Eli Swing, 49, 
a Los Angeles real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
The consul general remained silent, glaring at the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
But Danny Lamila, a representative of the Philippines Liberal Party, loudly 
defended the government. 
</P>
<P>
"These people staging the coup are criminals," Lamila yelled. "They are 
fugitives from justice!" 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, the 20 Aquino supporters in the room began chanting "Cory! 
Cory!" The anti-government protesters then left the consular offices and order 
was restored. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Santillas of the Campaign for Democracy and Independence said he believes 
that most of the estimated 350,000 Filipinos living in Los Angeles County 
oppose the military coup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here not only to support the president, but also the democratic 
institutions," he said. "The military is a dangerous leftover from the 
dictatorship (of Ferdinand Marcos). We don't want the government to be a 
hostage to the military." 
</P>
<P>
Also present at the press conference was Andrea Aquino, 50, the niece of 
assassinated Marcos opponent Benigno Aquino, Cory Aquino's husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I support democracy and the government against the coup," she said. "I think 
it's about time these renegades are punished."

TRAFFIC-CHOKED N. REDONDO LOOKS FOR SOLUTIONS, FINDS THEM PAINFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The morning sunshine, the brisk salt air, the twittering of little birds -- it 
used to be that when Dona Bauer thought "daybreak," these simple pleasures 
would come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
But that, she says, was "seven miserable months ago," before she and her family 
moved to North Redondo Beach. Now dawn brings the roar of engines and the 
rumble of wheels, and her double-paned windows rattle with the beginning of 
another morning commute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbearable," the 36-year-old lawyer says. "No one told me about this when 
we moved in. I'm tired. I'm haggard. I have a $451,000 home, and I can't get to 
sleep in it." 
</P>
<P>
On the neighborhood lanes of North Redondo Beach, rude awakenings are a fact of 
life. Each year, residents say, their narrow streets, built for moms in station 
wagons and kids on training wheels, grow ever more congested with breadwinners 
short-cutting their way to work. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has prompted a series of city-sponsored workshops and hearings 
aimed at finding a comprehensive solution. But many see it as just another 
chapter in what the city engineer calls the "lose-lose" dilemma of trying to 
control traffic in the booming South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Just 25 years ago, North Redondo was quiet and peaceful. Now it's a major 
commuter route," says Larry Cote, a bus driver and chairman of the city's North 
Redondo Traffic Committee. "Traffic starts coming as early as 5:30 a.m., 
rumbling up and down hills, disturbing the neighbors' sleep, making it almost 
impossible to back out a driveway. Sometimes the traffic is still out there at 
11 o'clock at night." 
</P>
<P>
Officials blame the problem on growth, geography and the history of Redondo 
Beach. The main thoroughfares that connect beach-city suburbanites and freeway 
drivers to the South Bay's offices and industrial complexes have become so 
jammed, they say, that, for too many people, cutting through North Redondo's 
neighborhoods has become the only way to get to work on time. 
</P>
<P>
The layout of the city's 40-year-old north side contributes to the problem, 
said Ken Montgomery, city engineer and director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
Suburbs nowadays are shielded from "commuter infiltration" through the 
installation of cul de sacs, dead ends, walls and "collector" streets that 
efficiently funnel cars away from residential streets and onto main arterials. 
But North Redondo Beach, which was subdivided just after World War II, was laid 
out in a simple grid pattern to maximize the number of residential lots, 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
"The concentration of major employers in the South Bay makes it an even worse 
problem," he said. TRW in Redondo Beach, Xerox and Hughes in El Segundo and a 
host of other high-tech and manufacturing concerns draw employees from 
throughout the area and beyond. In addition, many employees of Los Angeles 
International Airport live there. 
</P>
<P>
As main arterials such as Inglewood Avenue and Artesia, Manhattan Beach and 
Aviation boulevards become congested, motorists flee to side streets. A recent 
license-plate survey of commuters on North Redondo streets found that 
two-thirds of the cars were registered to people from other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Built to carry 2,000 cars a day at most, the 28-foot-wide streets of North 
Redondo now carry up to 15,000 apiece, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residents of the second-generation housing that characterizes the 
area -- yardless condominiums and narrow homes known as "tall and skinnies" -- 
are getting more and more fed up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crisis situation," said marketing executive Roberleigh Richester, 40, 
another member of the traffic committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very heavy traffic and very fast traffic, and there are children in this 
neighborhood who walk to school," Richester said. "One woman told me she almost 
got hit twice in a row trying to cross the street. My sister's cat got 
squashed." 
</P>
<P>
But solutions are elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts in the 1970s to widen the streets were struck down by voter initiative, 
Montgomery said. Later in the decade, a series of concrete diverters designed 
to detour short-cutters back to major thoroughfares was yanked out within a 
month amid public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
Even the three solutions being offered by the North Redondo Traffic Committee 
have serious shortcomings, Cote and Richester admit. One would cut the length 
of green lights in residential areas to five seconds. Another would seal off 
neighborhoods with a maze of one-way streets. A third would send short-cutters 
in circles with a proliferation of right-turn-only signs that would lead them 
back onto main arterials. 
</P>
<P>
These solutions look so painful that when they were discussed Tuesday night at 
the first of a series of neighborhood workshops, the audience suggested that 
the city scrap them all and stick to improving the major thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
Richester isn't sure what the reception will be at future workshops -- there's 
another coming up 9 a.m. Saturday at the Jefferson School cafeteria -- but he 
expects old commuting habits to die hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the people at the meeting said we had to do something about 
it," Richester said. "But almost every speaker who came up to the podium said, 
'We don't like your alternatives.' " 
</P>
<P>
The committee hopes to come up with a single proposal that the City Council can 
vote on next year. 
</P>
<P>
And if the politicians are skeptical about the problem, Dona Bauer, who lives 
off Rindge Lane, one of the commuter shortcuts to TRW, has a standing offer. 
</P>
<P>
"I invite every member of the City Council to spend the night at my house," she 
said. "Let them try to get some sleep."

GANDHI FAMILY REBEL CHARTS A NEW ROLE IN INDIA'S POLITICS;

<P>
The cordless telephone in Maneka Gandhi's lap simply would not stop ringing. 
</P>
<P>
There were offers of cabinet posts, hearty congratulations and, of course, the 
inevitable nastiness of political horse trading -- India-style -- as the young 
leader's newly triumphant political party scrambled desperately to form India's 
new opposition government. 
</P>
<P>
"What?" she demanded curtly of one of the scores of callers. "No. No, I haven't 
decided yet. What? No, I told you, I'm still thinking about it. . . . What?" -- 
and at this point her young freckled face turned to stone and her voice to ice 
and she sounded like she was talking to one of the 10 stray dogs she has taken 
in this year -- "Oh, my dear friend. What can you possibly be thinking. My vote 
isn't for sale." 
</P>
<P>
It was 10 a.m. Wednesday, the very hour that Maneka Gandhi's estranged 
brother-in-law, the man she has variously despised, pitied, insulted and 
cajoled through the years, was across town in the palace of Indian President 
Ramaswamy Ventkataraman, humbly resigning the highest office in the land. 
</P>
<P>
The moment seemed the ultimate vindication young Mrs. Gandhi. Brother-in-law 
Rajiv, her family nemesis, had finally led his ruling party down in defeat. And 
she, the family outcast, had finally won, taking her seat in Parliament by a 
131,224-vote margin as general secretary of the Peoples Party that will help 
form the new coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all Maneka could think about that morning was what lay ahead -- that, and a 
more universal message in a victory that meant far more to her than simple 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine," she said, angrily recounting the telephone conversation to a 
visitor, "this party man actually offered me money to support so-and-so for 
prime minister. One can only hope that we're not all here for the wrong 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, winning an election is no big deal. It's what you do with the power 
afterward that matters. And, well, for me anyway, it's proving you can do 
something entirely on your own, entirely your own way and for a commitment that 
is larger than yourself." 
</P>
<P>
At 33, it seems, Maneka Gandhi has finally come of age. 
</P>
<P>
India's most famous rebel daughter-in-law -- the angry young woman kicked out 
of the family home by Rajiv's mother, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, 
nearly eight years ago for trying to usurp the power meant for her son -- is 
poised to become one of the nation's new leaders. 
</P>
<P>
She will be a cabinet minister in the government that just buried decades of 
dynastic rule. 
</P>
<P>
As a symbol of India's new political order, Maneka Gandhi appears tailor-made, 
at least on the surface. She is open, progressive, dynamic, young, honest and 
fervently idealistic. More importantly, the widow of Indira Gandhi's younger 
son, Sanjay, has for years come to symbolize rebellion incarnate against 
India's ruling Nehru family dynasty, which, until this week, governed modern 
India for all but 30 months of its 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
Maneka, after all, invited her own eviction from the family house in 1982, 
after months of taunting her prime ministerial mother-in-law by denouncing her 
government at public rallies. 
</P>
<P>
So if India's recent watershed elections do indeed mark the fall of the family 
dynasty, then what better image for this moment in history than the woman who 
once dedicated her life to driving them out? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Maneka herself has to say about such symbolism: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a rebel of the Gandhi family. I love the Gandhi family, and I'm very 
proud of being a part of that family -- the good side of the family, not my 
brother-in-law's side. And I don't become less of a Gandhi because I'm not in 
the family house. 
</P>
<P>
"No, if my victory symbolizes anything, it's that one simply has to do things 
one's own way. This is what the last five years has taught me: If you follow 
your own heart, your own way, you cannot lose." 
</P>
<P>
And in that, perhaps, is a message that does indeed go beyond the Byzantine 
intrigues of Indian palace politics -- which is not to say that those 
intrigues, and bitterness, do not remain strong and just beneath the surface in 
India's youngest woman legislator. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining her conflicting emotions for the family she married into at age 
19, Maneka insisted she feels only affection and respect for Indira Gandhi, 
whose October, 1984, assassination opened the way for Rajiv's ascension to 
power as the only heir. Sanjay Gandhi was killed in a 1980 stunt-plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
"I still hold my mother-in-law in the very highest regard," she said. "Whether 
she was wrong or right, she cared deeply about this country. We disagreed about 
many things, but not her basic commitment. Her commitment was always 
</P>
<P>
to India and its people." 
</P>
<P>
"And Rajiv's?" she was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"His commitment has always been to money. He sees this country as a market -- 
as a toy shop -- where things are meant to be picked up, broken, bought and 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
"He's someone who got things so easily that he never really grew up. Maybe he 
has learned now. Maybe he's grown up now after this defeat. Maybe life has done 
him the same favor it did for me." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Maneka explained that she is still ashamed of her unsuccessful 1984 
election campaign against her brother-in-law in Rajiv's parliamentary district 
of Amethi, a rural, ruling-family enclave about 400 miles southeast of New 
Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
"I was young, and I was wrong," she said of the race, in which Rajiv defeated 
her by a huge margin. "Rajiv campaigned as his mother's son, and I campaigned 
as my husband's wife. Looking back, I'm glad I lost. If I had won, I'd probably 
just be another one of our empty-headed politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Maneka's defeat forced her to other pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
"I got back to the things that were important to me," she said. "The 
environment, animals, writing." 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, the defeated candidate took up ways that appeared eccentric 
to many. She began taking in stray dogs by the dozens as a symbol, she later 
explained, of concern for India's unwanted, as well as of her love of animals. 
She opened an animal hospital. And she began writing books, free-lance articles 
and a regular magazine column -- all crusading passionately against pollution 
and appealing for a massive cleanup of India's poisoned environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that, in these five years, I've learned a great deal," she said. "I've 
learned how to focus on the things that were important to me. I've moved away 
from trivial politics and learned how to make a commitment larger than me." 
</P>
<P>
So when Maneka launched her most recent election campaign -- this time she ran 
in a remote region of northern India, not in her brother-in-law's district -- 
she was determined never to mention her in-laws, or even her last name. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not anyone's widow or anyone's in-law," she shouted to crowds in more than 
350 villages during grueling 18-hour days on the campaign trail. "I'm not even 
your leader. I'm just a road for your life. And, if you think I can be your 
road to a better life, then give me your vote." 
</P>
<P>
She took pains not to insult her opponent, the ruling party or even Rajiv 
during her speeches. She focused on the corruption issue -- but differently 
than the opposition as a whole, which alleged that Rajiv had, at the very 
least, covered up tens of millions of dollars in kickbacks on a 1987 arms deal. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Maneka attacked India's entire defense Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are spending 26% of our budget on instruments of death," she told the 
crowds, "while we are spending just 1.6% on education and health." 
</P>
<P>
Now that she has come to power, Maneka insisted that she will not abandon such 
lofty idealism. Quite the opposite, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made it clear I will only accept one ministry -- the environment," she 
said. "But it will have to be expanded from what it has been. It's not just 
going to oversee zoos, parks and museums. I want it to become the last stamp 
for any new industry or factory in India." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that such power might be less than popular with Indian big business 
and the huge multinationals that have moved into India in increasing numbers 
under Rajiv, the would-be minister smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to be unpopular," she declared. "It's not important to be popular. 
Popularity, you cannot control. What you can control is what you want and the 
amount of work you're willing to put into it. And, as long as none of it is for 
yourself, you stand a 50% chance of winning in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that she had indeed just won her election, Maneka shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if this is a victory or not," she said, hinting at uncertainty 
for the first time in the hourlong interview. "I don't know anything about 
administration. I don't know anything about government. I don't know the nuts 
and bolts of it. I'll spend the next five years learning. 
</P>
<P>
"But in five years, come back and take a look around the country, around my 
constituency, and then we'll see if it was a victory or not."

A TOY STORE'S LONGEST DAY: CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SEASON RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's just before noon in a cavernous Valley toy store, where hundreds of people 
have squeezed inside. There's shopping-cart gridlock in Aisle 2, and someone 
has knocked over a shelf of Tonka toys in Aisle 4, causing an 11-car pileup. A 
voice on the intercom demands that parents stop their children from test-riding 
bicycles in the store. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas shopping has returned. At the Toys R Us in Van Nuys, it has returned 
with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets so packed in here that people are bumping into each other. People are 
running their carts into little kids," says Maria Arichea, one of the store's 
four managers. "If there's a hot item and we're running out of them, I've seen 
people try to take the toys from each other. They get crazy." 
</P>
<P>
With just 25 shopping days until Christmas, the toy industry is in the midst of 
what experts predict will be a $7-billion holiday season. Toys R Us expects its 
404 stores across the country to account for $2 billion of those sales. 
</P>
<P>
That's the cost of ten 747 jumbo jets. That's the gross national product of 
Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of toys," says Angela Bourdon, a Toys R Us spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
And it takes a lot of people to buy them. They aren't the genteel clientele of 
Bullocks Wilshire or Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. They are children tearing 
packages and flinging boxes. They are adults jostling to get at the "Altered 
Beast" video game or, perhaps, a "Cherry Merry Muffin" banana-scented doll. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to figure out who these people are, where they come from," says Ed 
Brunisholz, another store manager. "That's the fun of working here. Well, fun 
is one word for it." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, holiday shopping officially begins on the day after Thanksgiving, a 
day that Toys R Us officials call "Black Friday." The shopping crowds grow 
larger and larger, they say, right up to Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps getting busier," says Tom Matousek, director of the Toys R Us in Van 
Nuys. "You wouldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
On "Black Friday" in Matousek's store, shelves are well-stocked in advance. The 
staff, expanded from 80 to 200 people and hurriedly trained to handle the 
masses, stand ready for a marathon, 16-hour shopping day. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes before the opening, a dozen customers are lined up outside. 
Matousek rushes through last-minute preparations, checking with a uniformed 
security guard who will be in the parking lot and a plainclothes guard who will 
be watching the registers and the single exit door. 
</P>
<P>
"The first big day," Matousek says, "you always worry." 
</P>
<P>
When the store opens at 8 a.m., shoppers armed with carts rush in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all here for the same thing, right?" one woman says. 
</P>
<P>
Another yells a warning to a salesman in her path: "I wouldn't stand in the 
aisles with all these carts coming through." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone heads for the "hot" toys: Nintendo games, Teen-Age Mutant Ninja 
Turtles, the Oopsie Daisy doll that "crawls, falls and cries." No one can 
explain why they want to give their child a doll that exhibits pain. 
</P>
<P>
Early crowds are light, but by 11 a.m., the store is packed and stays that way 
for hours. Rani Johnson and Cathy Dubin, neighbors from the Santa Clarita 
Valley, struggle to the check stand with two carts full of toys. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't go too badly," Johnson says. "We've only taken two Advil apiece." 
</P>
<P>
The constant crying of children fills the air, as do the angry voices of their 
parents. "Shannon!" "Raymond!" "Justin! Where are you?" Above this din, jingles 
play on the intercom -- the same six or seven advertisements, over and over, 
like the ditty for the Oh Jenny! doll: 
</P>
<P>
 I know a girl and she's named Jenny / Oh Jenny! Jenny Oh! / She likes fun and 
she has plenty / Oh Jenny! Jenny Oh! 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really bad when you find yourself humming it," says Matousek, who has 
worked at Toys R Us for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers push their way down aisles that glare with purple bicycles, 
fluorescent green volleyballs, and an assortment of toys in pink, orange and 
red boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrible," says Arlene Clifton of Sylmar as she scans a wall of 
Fisher-Price toys. "There are so many boxes. I'm looking for something, and I 
don't know where to start. I'm looking for Big Bird Express, and I've seen 
everything but Big Bird Express." 
</P>
<P>
It could be worse. Clifton could have come unprepared like Joan Reuner of 
Sherman Oaks, who doesn't have the slightest idea of what to get for her 
granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been so long since I was 5," the 40-year-old woman says. "I guess I'd 
better locate a 5-year-old and follow her around, see what she likes." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Kirksey, 15, of Sylmar tries that strategy with her 3-year-old cousin, 
Richard. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants them all," Kirksey says. 
</P>
<P>
She should have known that grown-up logic doesn't stand a chance here. In this 
environment of games and playthings, adults are hopelessly out of place. A 
woman wearing a low-cut, black-lace blouse paws through infant toys. Another 
woman, with a diamond in her nose and a tattoo on her shoulder, searches 
through video games. 
</P>
<P>
"How about this?" she asks a companion, holding up a game. " 'Skate or Die.' " 
</P>
<P>
The kids know all the brand names, the specific attributes and limitations of 
each toy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good game," a small boy tells his mother, "but it's not worth 
$13.99." 
</P>
<P>
Invariably, customers want toys that are stacked above the shelves, some 20 
feet up, sending salespeople scrambling up ladders, leaning precariously to 
reach a heavy box. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people who work here won't even go on the ladders," says stock 
clerk Christian Raun after retrieving a board game from overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Business doesn't slow until after 8 p.m. By 10 p.m., the store is quiet. 
Shoppers continue to trickle in, but rarely are more than 30 people in the 
place at one time. 
</P>
<P>
The lull gives employees a head start on straightening aisles, many of which 
look as if they've been the site of terrorist attacks. Workers on the graveyard 
shift will clean and restock shelves. Toys that have been pulled from their 
boxes will be repackaged or, if damaged, tossed on the markdown pile. 
</P>
<P>
"People have no respect," says Louis Cotom, a stock clerk, as he rearranges toy 
cars. "People just throw things on the floor, leave them there." 
</P>
<P>
Cotom muses that only 14 hours earlier, the store was carefully ordered. Now, 
RoboCop figures have landed amid the Ghostbusters display. A plastic crayon 
bank has rolled two aisles over, into the electronic games. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, the Barbie section lies in ruin. Dance Club Barbies are mixed 
with Doctor Barbies, Island Fun Barbies with Animal Lovin' Safari Barbies. Who 
can make sense of it? 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to tear the whole place down and start over," Cotom says. "We'll 
be doing that until tomorrow morning, until we open again." 
</P>
<P>
By 11:30, only a few shoppers remain. A waitress, who just finished working, 
picks through toys in the clearance aisle. A young couple, who look as if 
they've 
</P>
<P>
stepped off a dance floor, stand transfixed before a video game display. A 
blonde in a skin-tight minidress and spike heels totters up to the Ninja Turtle 
rack. 
</P>
<P>
Mark and Sharon Blackman of Van Nuys are among the last customers making a few 
final selections as a voice on the intercom announces that the store will soon 
be closing at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never come into this store during the day," Mark Blackman says. "Too 
many kids." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, almost 2,700 separate purchases totaling $170,000 have 
been recorded. Managers estimate that most of the holiday buyers came in with 
one or two companions, so as many as 8,000 people may have passed through the 
store. That's about five times the usual daily number. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the week since "Black Friday," sales and crowds have continued to 
increase. Trucks bring new shipments every night, but they still have trouble 
keeping enough Oopsie Daisies and Ninja Turtles on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Yet employees insist that the holiday season isn't so bad. There is camaraderie 
under battle conditions, they say, and the store is so busy that workdays fly 
by. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the biggest test lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"The 10 days before Christmas will be hectic," Matousek says. "All the 
last-minute shoppers will be coming in, looking for a bike and two baskets full 
of toys for their kids. It's fun to see 20 cash registers going at once, but I 
guess by the time Christmas Day comes, we'll be worn out."

HOST WITH THE MOST SETS FAST PACE FOR WHITE HOUSE PROTOCOL; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: CHIEF OF PROTOCOL JOSEPH VERNER REED HAS BATTLED DRIPPING FAUCETS, 
BARKING DOGS AND POLITICAL WATERS TO SERVE HIS PRESIDENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
"OK, get this scene," Protocol Chief Joseph Verner Reed instructs his current 
chronicler. 
</P>
<P>
"Blair House dining room. President of Philippines at the head of a sit-down 
dinner for 18. Everything to perfection: glass, china, silver, flowers, guest 
list -- including Cabinet and senators. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, are you ready?" he asks, about to resume his rapid-fire burst of staccato. 
"You will not believe this. Somebody left the bathtub running upstairs! This 
was not a drip. This was not a glass of water. This was Niagara. This was an 
Indonesian downpour!" 
</P>
<P>
And how did the nation's chief host, protector of all things proper and right, 
handle the crisis? 
</P>
<P>
Says he, simply: "Equanimity under duress." 
</P>
<P>
He let it drip. 
</P>
<P>
No one expects the ship to sink, but one moderate rainstorm not unlike the one 
at Blair House three weeks ago could certainly dampen Saturday's historic 
Seabound Summit. After all, who would unobtrusively carry President George 
Bush's umbrella when he strides from U.S. to Soviet cruiser? Who would pick him 
up if he slips on deck? Who would produce the Dramamine if National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft starts to get that rocky feeling? 
</P>
<P>
No doubt it would be Joseph Verner Reed, the U. S. chief of protocol, Host With 
the Most, the man who must know Haviland from Herend at a glance, never confuse 
his forks and always stay on top of rhymes and rituals. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't go to the Middle East with an owl -- bad luck," he lets you know 
with a straight face. "And if, in your innocence, you present a letter opener 
(to foreign hosts), it would be a catastrophic -- a threatening gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"And never will I forget, as long as I live, the 40th President of the United 
States offering a luncheon for the king of Morocco," he says, still exasperated 
at the memory of Ronald Reagan's New York gathering for King Hassan II during 
Reed's tenure as U.S. Ambassador to Morocco. "You're not going to believe this 
but it's true. The first course was what? Melon and prosciutto!" 
</P>
<P>
The Moslem religion prohibits the consumption of pork. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his many elegant Savile Row suits, he sits in his office at the State 
Department and rolls his eyes heavenward. 
</P>
<P>
"The king," he says, "looked at me across the table with knowing eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Reed's affectations and flamboyance are renowned and have gotten him 
labeled everything from "devoted patriot" to "nitwit." 
</P>
<P>
He's also been called a very close buddy of the 41st President of the United 
States, a tie that goes back to their parents and social milieu in Greenwich, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why those who do not cotton to Reed's bursting-at-the-seams style feel 
much safer telling you that in confidence. 
</P>
<P>
When he was Ambassador to Morocco from 1981 to 1985, he once sprinted through a 
Moroccan marketplace during a visit by George Bush shouting, "The vice 
president is here" -- as the motorcade followed 100 feet behind. 
</P>
<P>
He's enormously rich, wears a broad-brimmed fedora and has acquired the 
nickname "Cuffs" for his many pairs of fancy cuff links -- and his habitual 
shooting of his crisp cuff to meticulously frame his suits. 
</P>
<P>
He was not hard to spot among the gray pinstripes and white button-downs 
earlier this month, listening to Lech Walesa on the House floor. Looking more 
regal than the Prince of Wales himself, Reed glowed in a glen-plaid suit and 
bold red-striped shirt with white collar. 
</P>
<P>
And while most White House aides adore parceling out presidential tie clips, 
Reed, the master of gestures big and small, has amused Washington by handing 
out the same personalized plastic ballpoints he's been giving away since his 
days with David Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
After a 20-year career as Rockefeller's gatekeeper and vice president at the 
Chase Manhattan Bank, his controversial walk through Morocco as ambassador and 
a stint as the undersecretary for political affairs at the United Nations, 
Joseph Reed, 52, may have found his life's work in the fussing, primping, 
traveling and very proper world of protocol. 
</P>
<P>
"People have asked me, why did I step down as the highest-ranking American (in 
the Secretariat) at the United Nations and accept chief of protocol?" he says, 
"and the answer is very simply, it was my President, my friend and my nation." 
</P>
<P>
He's serious. And very serious about the business of protocol, which he insists 
entails much more than just fancy table settings and foreign travel. 
</P>
<P>
"Protocol was invented by the Chinese," he explains, "in order to establish a 
set of rules of order that sets the stage of the conduct of substantive 
diplomacy. These arrangements are extremely important. . . . Setting the stage 
. . . is very important to a nation." 
</P>
<P>
Let's consider JVR's Rules for Proper Stage Settings and Success. 
</P>
<P>
* No. 1: Mix With the Middle Class. 
</P>
<P>
For all his privileged upbringing and theatrics, Reed did learn one critical 
lesson on his way up: Never step on the crickets. They'll get you on the way 
down. He's a master at receding into the woodwork, sharing credit and avoiding 
the dangerous "I" word. 
</P>
<P>
When an important visitor was expected during his years as ambassador to 
Morocco, according to a former embassy official, Reed would stay up around the 
clock with his staff, making great demands -- but also sharing in the menial 
tasks if needed. And when the visit was over, everyone received a handwritten 
thank-you note and a small gift. 
</P>
<P>
"Once, after we put David Rockefeller on a plane, Joseph just collapsed on the 
ground at the airport, as if to say 'I'm glad it's over,' " recalls Ted Curran, 
former deputy chief of mission. "It broke the tension. . . . It made you feel 
he was one of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, where Reed served, first as member of the U. S. 
delegation, then as the senior American representative on the U. N. staff, he 
made a special effort to reach out to non-superpower nations. 
</P>
<P>
With the African countries, for example, Reed courted their opinions, called an 
unusual special session on African concerns, and entertained them grandly at 
his New York apartment and Denbigh Farm, his Greenwich estate. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, he makes you feel so obligated to his appeals," says Kenya's 
ambassador to the United Nations, Michael Okeyo, "because he never treats you 
like a fool. He makes you feel special." 
</P>
<P>
And when Reed arrived in Washington last February, he pleasantly surprised the 
White House worker bees who were apprehensive about this scion of WASPdom and 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
In a town where proximity to the President means power, the advance team was 
rendered speechless when, preceding Bush's very first overseas trip, Reed 
requested a seat on the backup plane. 
</P>
<P>
"He actually asked for the plane that was not carrying the President," recalls 
Stephen Studdert, former assistant to the President for special activities. "It 
was amazing. It was like 'Give me instructions and send me in. It doesn't 
matter if I'm the quarterback or the water boy.' " 
</P>
<P>
No. 2: Let Nothing Interfere With the Show. 
</P>
<P>
When a perpetually barking dog at the adjacent Bulgarian Embassy started 
interrupting Reed's dinners in Morocco, the ambassador instructed his staff to 
feed the animal continually to shut him up. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, as Reed was in the midst of his protocol confirmation hearings, a 
caller to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee claimed that Reed also had 
ordered the dog shot. 
</P>
<P>
Reed has denied this. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have suggested that as a joke," explains Ted Curran. "And while we may 
have wanted to shoot him, that option was never considered seriously." 
</P>
<P>
No. 3: Know Your Guest. 
</P>
<P>
Reed dislikes surprises when entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
When Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto made a state visit to Washington 
earlier this year, Reed came across Peter Galbraith, a Senate staffer who 
happened to be a personal friend of Bhutto's from her Harvard days. 
</P>
<P>
For days preceding Bhutto's visit, he called Galbraith to seek his counsel, 
then took Galbraith's pulse daily during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith greatly appreciated the gesture. 
</P>
<P>
But the truth of the matter is that either you take to Reed's solicitous and 
exuberant style or you don't. 
</P>
<P>
And while he's fond of insisting "I am who I am who I am," he may have wished 
he were someone else the day former Sen. Tom Eagleton arrived in Marrakech. 
</P>
<P>
Probably nothing has damaged Reed publicly as much as a letter the Missouri 
Democrat sent then-Secretary of State George Shultz following his 1982 trip. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, which mysteriously finds its way into print every time Reed is up 
for a new post, is how many have come to know him in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton referred to his host as a "14 karat nitwit." 
</P>
<P>
"In short," Eagleton wrote, "he suffers from an acute strain of Yalerock. He 
runs around the hotel grounds in his Yale jogging suit with Yale emblazoned 
fore and aft. All he needs is a bulldog to make the act complete." 
</P>
<P>
Like all stories, this one has two sides. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's spin doctors insist Eagleton was simply put out when Reed, for all his 
professed closeness to the Moroccan king, failed to produce a meeting for the 
senior senator. 
</P>
<P>
"The king was not available," explains Charles Francis, an executive at the 
Hill &amp; Knowlton PR firm and a longtime Reed friend. "And Joseph was very 
dismayed that the senator so rebuffed his hospitality." 
</P>
<P>
But a Hill aide who was in the traveling party contends that Reed "used poor 
judgment, and had little sense" of his guest's increasing ire. 
</P>
<P>
"Why show up in a jogging suit when the senator is wearing a coat and tie?" 
asked the aide. "Eagleton was clearly miffed he couldn't see the king, so why 
rub it in by making it appear that he wasn't taking the trip seriously?" 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton says he stands by the letter. 
</P>
<P>
And Reed will say only this: "I was only sorry that I could not, as chief of 
mission, satisfy the aspirations and hopes of the senator of Missouri." 
</P>
<P>
However, as an aside, he does note that Eagleton, once a member of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, posed no objections to Reed's confirmation to the 
U. N. job in 1985, three years after the fateful trip, and in fact voted in 
favor of Reed's nomination in committee and on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
* No. 4: Check It Again. 
</P>
<P>
A perfectionist by nature, Reed drives everyone crazy by insisting on dozens of 
rehearsals -- for everything. 
</P>
<P>
He gleefully tells how, during a recent state arrival at the White House, he 
nudged the military office to check once again the music for that nation's 
anthem. Alas, the band was about to strike up the wrong note. 
</P>
<P>
"What did Fred Astaire say when they put the film in the can?" asks Reed. "All 
the producers said this is great and Fred Astaire came back and said, 'Let's do 
it again.' " 
</P>
<P>
No. 5: Wear Comfortable Shoes. 
</P>
<P>
As Rockefeller's first lieutenant, Reed handled the passports when the two 
bankers traveled abroad. The former chairman of Chase still marvels over how 
Reed once rescued him in Zurich after Rockefeller inadvertently wandered into a 
restricted customs area -- sans passport. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't let me out and they wouldn't let him in," recalls Rockefeller. 
"Finally Joseph leaped over a huge barricade. . . . The man knows how to get 
things done." 
</P>
<P>
White House aides agree. 
</P>
<P>
At Emperor Hirohito's funeral earlier in the year, Bush held a series of 
back-to-back meetings at the U. S. Embassy in Tokyo with just about every world 
leader in town. As presidents and prime ministers began to form something of a 
diplomatic traffic jam, Reed was in his element -- an impresario racing between 
rooms to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
The protocol chief jumps up in his office to demonstrate the scene: Two chairs 
serve as the drawing room and the library at the embassy. A third chair 
represents the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
"It was shuttle diplomacy," he says, explaining that the ultimate challenge was 
to keep each fellow from seeing the other. After all, says Reed earnestly, 
"that's not why they came." 
</P>
<P>
"Get this scene," the chief of protocol is instructing again. "The Ellipse. 
Beautiful fall day. Marine One, through a 21-gun salute, lifts off with 
President Corazon Aquino heading for Andrews for her departure. Marine Two 
doors close. Rotary blades up. Lift off. Follows Marine One. 
</P>
<P>
"I get in my car to go back to work. I look around. I find the foreign minister 
of the Philippines wandering around the monuments . . . HE GOT LOST! 
</P>
<P>
"I leapt out of that car and I did the 500-yard sprint as if I was an 
18-year-old. I got hold of a colleague in the military office and he brought 
Marine Two back and then kept Mrs. Aquino's helicopter on a sightseeing tour of 
Washington. Now that was high drama." 
</P>
<P>
There was some talk earlier in the year that perhaps Permelia Reed (Joseph's 
mother) and Dorothy Bush (George's mother) had gotten together in Hobe Sound -- 
the exclusive Florida enclave developed by Reed's father -- and cooked up this 
protocol job for Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
"Whole cloth," says Reed crisply. 
</P>
<P>
Reed first came to the attention of the Reagan White House in 1981 through 
Rockefeller, who had just retired from Chase Manhattan and believed his former 
aide-de-camp would be the quintessential protocol chief. 
</P>
<P>
The job ultimately went to Reagan loyalist and pal Lee Annenberg. But Reed was 
named Ambassador to the Kingdom of Morocco as a consolation prize -- a deal 
cinched by none other than "Poppy" himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Reed go back to Greenwich, where the two families would often convene 
for gamesmanship at either the Bush home or Denbigh Farm. Their fathers, 
Prescott and Joseph Sr., were good friends, and their mothers remain close. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when George Bush was tapped for Skull and Bones," Reed says of the 
secret society Bush belonged to at Yale. Reed would have been about 11 when 
George Bush entered Yale after the war. "We were all sitting anxiously by the 
telephone at my mother's house waiting for the news. . . . It was a big 
excitement. And we raised a glass of orange juice to his success." 
</P>
<P>
Reed is a direct descendant of Edward Doty, who arrived here on the Mayflower. 
His financial statement reads like a page out of the New York Stock Exchange, 
with investments listed for everything from Exxon to Hewlett Packard to IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to him say he spends considerably more than his $80,000-plus salary 
for things like flowers and gifts. (The pens alone must cover a month's wages.) 
</P>
<P>
When in Washington, Reed and his wife, Marie, reside at the Watergate. They 
have two grown daughters. 
</P>
<P>
The Reed wealth comes from grandfather Verner, an early oil-and-mineral man. 
His father, Joseph, worked the family investments, underwrote Broadway shows 
and was the major backer of the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, 
Conn., while mother Permelia became the matriarch of Hobe Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that Permelia Reed would show her disfavor with house guests by 
sending them a black sweater when they left -- a message that they were not 
welcome to return. 
</P>
<P>
"Whole cloth!" repeats Reed. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Yale in 1961, Reed became private secretary to the 
president of the World Bank for two years before going to work for Rockefeller 
at Chase Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's name first entered the public arena in 1979, when Rockefeller dispatched 
him to assist the ailing shah of Iran. Reed played a major role in bringing the 
shah into this country for cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, he was back in the news again when Reagan gave him the 
Moroccan appointment. "Of all the appointments we made, that one generated the 
most criticism," says one high-level Reagan White House official, "because it 
was so political." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, from the start, Reed had a rough go of it. 
</P>
<P>
One former Foreign Service officer who manned the cable desk at the State 
Department says that foreign service officers would sit around and guffaw at 
the verbose memos Reed sent. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, you read these things from all over and they usually say, 'Met with so 
and so. Meeting was uneventful. This or that discussed,' and so on," says the 
source. "But Reed's were like 'His Royal Wonderful, Gracious Highness, received 
me today in the grandness of his glorious palace as our flag waved in the 
Moroccan wind.' These things were hilarious." 
</P>
<P>
Histrionics aside, those who worked with Reed in Morocco say they quickly saw 
Reed's substance through the style. "I had heard all the stories before I got 
there," says one, who asked that his name not be used. "Once I got past his 
style, I found him very hard-working and eager." 
</P>
<P>
"The man knocked himself out," says Curran, Reed's deputy in Morocco. "He 
completely modernized the (Voice of America) office in Tangiers, which is 
critical for transmission to the Soviet Union. . . . He had a great 
relationship with the king -- all of which, I think, is a lot more relevant 
than how he shoots his cuffs." 
</P>
<P>
Reed, too, points out that he was greatly appreciated by the Moroccans, 
receiving the prestigious commendation of the Order of Commander of the Throne 
-- the first non-Moroccan to receive the honor. 
</P>
<P>
And in the end, Morocco was a cakewalk compared with the heat Reed would take 
at the U. N. for writing a letter to Ronald Reagan criticizing George Shultz's 
decision to deny PLO leader Yasser Arafat a visa to address the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Reed wants to make it clear that he was serving as an "international civil 
servant" when as undersecretary general for political affairs, he advocated a 
visa for Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was clearly unfazed by the United Nations flap because, as White House 
aides tell it, Reed was the President's first and only choice for chief of 
protocol -- just months after the Arafat incident. 
</P>
<P>
And what is the best part of this job for Joseph Verner Reed? 
</P>
<P>
"Serving George Bush, President of the United States, and Mrs. Bush, as a 
result of their personal request," he says without missing a beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so proud and so privileged to have their confidence. And I must say that 
every time I participate in an event at the White House, I just can't help but 
think how lucky I am to have the coincidence of the relationship between our 
two families."

TRASH IN SPACE HAS SCIENTISTS CONCERNED; 
</P>
<P>
ASTRONOMY: LIKE EARTHLY POLLUTERS, SPACEFARERS ARE FEELING GROWING PRESSURE TO 
CLEAN UP THEIR ACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When engineers and scientists discuss the vacuum of space these days, they may 
be yearning for a giant Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
Like other frontiers before it, the heavenly void has succumbed to human 
litter. Ground trackers report roughly 7,500 spent rocket stages, dead 
satellites, screwdrivers and other man-made objects whirling around the globe, 
passing each other at about 22,000 m.p.h. in relative velocity, at varying 
altitudes and in all directions. Most of the items are classified as junk. 
</P>
<P>
But that's only the big stuff -- at least 10 centimeters or about four inches 
across -- visible to the ground-based telescopes and radars of the U.S. Space 
Surveillance Network. 
</P>
<P>
What is giving fits to the orbital garbage gurus are the uncounted trillions of 
flecks, flakes and fragments of tiny trash too small to be tracked but 
traveling so fast that if a piece of aluminum one centimeter across (smaller 
than a marble) collided with a spacecraft, it would have the force -- but not 
necessarily the effect -- of a 400-pound safe traveling 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about global ring around the collar has increased steadily in the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the U.S. Space Command's Space Surveillance Network catalogued the 
20,000th man-made object to be launched into Earth orbit since Sputnik went up 
in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Most are no longer up there. Over time, orbiting items lose energy and fall 
into progressively lower orbits until they hit thicker atmosphere, slow down 
and burn up or, in rare cases, hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The greater bulk of the visible junk still aloft is in 3,000 large objects, 
mostly spent rocket stages and dead satellites, according to government 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are about 4,000 smaller but still trackable fragments, most of which 
resulted from about 130 "fragmentations" -- intentional or accidental 
explosions or breakups -- in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the debris got there through astronaut mishaps. In 1984, for example, a 
shuttle astronaut working outside his craft let go of 10 or 12 screws. A 
space-walking Soviet cosmonaut once dropped a screwdriver. A thermal glove 
floated out of Gemini 4 in 1965. And there is a nice camera adrift somewhere in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
In the infancy of the Space Age, it was the harsh natural environment of space 
-- the whizzing meteorites and cosmic radiation -- against which engineers 
armored their craft. Now the estimated mass of man-made stuff orbiting within 
1,200 miles of Earth's surface is 15,000 times the mass of all the natural 
objects passing near Earth at a given time. 
</P>
<P>
The debris shell has prompted National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
engineers to add at least five tons of costly shielding to the design of the 
proposed space station, and they are studying more exotic measures, such as 
collision-avoidance maneuvering. Space shuttles have collided at least twice 
with tiny objects. 
</P>
<P>
Space debris is also a problem for astronomers because of light reflecting from 
orbiting junk. 
</P>
<P>
Experts disagree among themselves over how serious orbital trash is now and how 
fast the problem will grow. Nobody claims to know for sure. In any case, like 
earthly polluters, spacefarers are feeling growing pressure to clean up their 
act, even though the impact, literally, of all the junk on spaceflight has been 
minimal -- so far. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, scientists at Johnson Space Center examined surfaces of the Solar Max 
satellite retrieved after 50 months in space. They found six small holes per 
square foot in some areas, most of them apparently caused by impacts with paint 
flakes from other spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
The first operational spacecraft damage attributed to debris occurred in 1983, 
when the shuttle Challenger was hit by something in orbit that left a crater on 
one of its 5/8-inch-thick glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists found components of white paint fused into the pit. They concluded 
the orbiter had hit a flake less than .01 inch in diameter, traveling two to 
three miles per second. 
</P>
<P>
And on its mission last month, the shuttle Atlantis' window was struck by 
something still being analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
But collisions are still rare in orbit, according to Don Kessler of Johnson 
Space Center in Houston, dean of space debris studies, who has been watching 
orbital hazards since 1963. Collisions may become significantly more likely in 
the 1990s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is because, as collisions happen, each creates many times more particles 
than mere explosions or breakups. Coming together at 22,000 m.p.h., "because of 
the tremendous pressures and temperatures generated in that instant, aluminum 
and other metals become actually fluid," said Jeanne Lee Crews, manager of the 
space center's Hypervelocity Impact Research Laboratory, where she uses 
gas-powered guns to simulate cosmic crackups. 
</P>
<P>
That causes a spray of millions of small pieces, like droplets, many times more 
than a breakup or explosion of the same mass would create. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, Kessler said, collisions will become so numerous they will begin 
a kind of chain reaction of ever more collisions and fragmentations. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps around 2050 or so," he said, the junk might reach "a critical density 
of matter in space and essentially it would grind itself to dust, and low Earth 
orbit would become unusable." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are under way worldwide to hold debris to a minimum, through improved 
spacecraft design and other measures, as well as to protect spacecraft with 
shielding. 
</P>
<P>
One step, for example, followed U.S. concerns years ago when it was found that 
six orbiting U.S. Delta rocket second stages had exploded, the last in 1981, 
apparently as a result of metal failure that allowed residual fuels to mix. 
Engineers since have modified the rockets to prevent breakups. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Soviet Union's practice of deliberately destroying failed military 
satellites, which has added much to the debris, appears to have ended more than 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Soviet, European, Japanese and other space programs now try to ensure 
that their rocket stages are emptied of fuel and pressure once in orbit, said 
Joseph Loftus, a top planning official at the Johnson center. That way, a 
collision with a small object will be no more traumatic than "a rifle bullet 
going through an empty soda pop can." 
</P>
<P>
To protect the space station, NASA has asked industry to develop, at a cost of 
$15 million to $20 million, a ground-based radar system that could spot a dime 
at an altitude of 360 miles. It would track some but not all small pieces of 
orbital debris that could threaten the space station.

'PERMANENT MAKEUP' RAISES SOME EYEBROWS IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Irene Hatate, every face is a blank canvas waiting for an artist's colors. 
</P>
<P>
Under her tiny, pigment-loaded needles, missing or faded eyebrows come to life. 
Pale, colorless mouths glow ripe with color. Shy, retiring eyes seem larger, 
commanding new attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Permanent makeup," as the process is called, has won growing acceptance in the 
beauty world. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of Torrance law, however, Hatate is no different than a tattoo 
artist etching dragons and butterflies on customers. And in Torrance, tattooing 
is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, city officials sent Hatate and permanent makeup artists for two 
other beauty salons a letter ordering them to stop doing the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Hatate, who now keeps her technique honed by practicing on turkey drumsticks, 
has enlisted the aid of an attorney friend to ask the city to either change the 
law or exempt her from it. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council will hear her case and decide whether Torrance's 
1959 tattooing law should be changed to catch up with modern beauty trends. 
</P>
<P>
Hatate, who says she has traveled around the country studying various 
techniques, says she does not think of herself as a common tattooist. "It is 
not a simple type of work," she said. "It takes a lot of technique and 
understanding of technique." 
</P>
<P>
Hatate said the procedure accounts for half her income and, without it, she is 
not certain she will be able to stay in business in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Irene is probably one of the most qualified people in the business," said Pati 
Pavlik of Laguna Beach, president of the newly created National Cosmetic 
Tattooing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Popular in the Orient for centuries, the procedure began to attract interest in 
the West about five years ago, when ophthalmologists and a handful of 
cosmetologists began advertising it here. 
</P>
<P>
Permanent makeup is applied with extremely fine needles, either loaded onto a 
pigment gun or dipped in pigment, which slip color into the skin beneath 
eyebrows, around lips and along the eyelash line. Cosmetologists use a topical 
anesthetic but doctors often inject a local anesthetic before the procedure 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
Women who have all three areas tattooed -- at a minimum cost of $250 per area 
-- appear to be wearing subtle makeup 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Although used by women who simply want to avoid reapplying makeup every 
morning, the technique has proved particularly popular among both men and women 
who have lost their eyebrows due to burns or accidents, arthritis victims who 
cannot grip makeup tools or whose hands are too unsteady to apply the color, 
and women who are losing their sight or are allergic to regular makeup. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, women who have undergone mastectomies go to permanent makeup 
artists to restore color in breast reconstructions. 
</P>
<P>
Eye doctors and plastic surgeons praise permanent makeup, when properly done, 
as an excellent way to restore a damaged face or enhance a plain one. 
Unfortunately, done by an inexperienced person, the procedure could lead to eye 
damage, infection, allergic reaction or a host of other complications, 
according to doctors and cosmetologists. 
</P>
<P>
State cosmetology regulators, however, say the Legislature has yet to create 
laws allowing them or any other state agency to oversee permanent makeup 
artists. As a result, they say, it is all but impossible to determine who has 
been properly trained to do the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"We have very few complaints," said Denise Ostton, executive officer of the 
state Board of Cosmetology. "Because it is unregulated, we're less likely to 
hear complaints because they don't know where to go." 
</P>
<P>
Hatate, who opened her Torrance salon 20 years ago, has been offering permanent 
makeup for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Murdoch, Torrance's revenue administrator, said he sent out the letter 
after a cosmetologist requested a business license for a salon that would have 
offered permanent makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'No, it's tattooing, and tattooing isn't allowed in Torrance,' " 
Murdoch said. "She produced these advertisements and said, 'It's already being 
done.' That's when we sent out a letter saying, 'Cease and desist.' " 
</P>
<P>
The city's order, mailed to the three Torrance beauty salons named in those 
advertisements, "was rather shocking because I had been doing it and 
advertising it without any reaction," Hatate said. "It just never occurred to 
me that we were doing tattooing." 
</P>
<P>
Li-Yuan (Lisa) Koo, who had been offering permanent makeup at the Rolling Hills 
Beauty Salon until Torrance ordered her to stop, said her difficulty speaking 
English prevents her from challenging the city's order. 
</P>
<P>
Koo said she spent "several hundred hours" learning the specialized tattooing 
techniques in Japan and Taiwan before she began practicing the craft here a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee it for a lifetime and I guarantee to do it a second time if they 
want it darker, but now I can't do that second time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tacheng Liao, whose parents opened the Cosmetic Beauty Center on Pacific Coast 
Highway two months ago, said the family had a store in Ecuador until recently 
that attracted as many as four customers each day. 
</P>
<P>
Their new salon specializes in permanent makeup. The city's letter, which 
effectively shut down their business, arrived four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials never asked specifically what kind of cosmetology services 
the salon would offer when they granted its license, Liao said. His parents, 
who were not aware they could appeal the city's ruling, hope to move the salon 
outside of the Torrance city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Council members declined to comment on the issue until staff members have 
briefed them on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even a port town, so I don't know why this law was passed," Mayor 
Katy Geissert said. "I just don't know enough about it." 
</P>
<P>
Ostton said the state will conduct hearings in January about possible future 
regulation of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmetology board recently asked the state's Medical Quality Assurance 
Board to issue a legal opinion on whether permanent makeup is a medical 
service, subject to medical regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's something that doesn't fall under anybody's jurisdiction," 
Ostton said. "Done properly and done well, it's fabulous. The problem is -- and 
this is where the board is focusing its attention -- there is a tremendous 
amount of risk." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Albert Davis, one of several Torrance ophthalmologists who continue to 
offer permanent eyeliner as part of their practice, said he considers the 
tattooing to be a medical procedure. 
</P>

"Picture, if you will, a rapidly vibrating needle less than a millimeter from 
the eyeball on the edge of the lid in a person who is not anesthetized," Davis 
said. "It's fraught with danger. One false move and that thing could puncture 
the eye." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch said he did not order the doctors to stop doing the procedure because 
he believed the city's anti-tattooing law would be nullified by state medical 
regulations. Assistant City Atty. Liz Clark said she is still researching that 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Pavlik of the National Cosmetic Tattooing Assn. said she hopes the city will 
recognize permanent makeup as a valuable service. 
</P>
<P>
"The people we see -- the cancer patients, the people with scars, the people 
with arthritis -- they have a need to be here and when somebody has a need like 
that, the word 'tattoo' and all its negative connotations goes right out the 
window," Pavlik said.

EMBEZZLERS MISS SENTENCING DATE; VICTIM IRATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple who may have embezzled as much as $150,000 from a San Pedro insurance 
agency failed to appear for sentencing Thursday in Long Beach Superior Court, 
and a warrant was issued for their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
James and Georgia Mulchahey apparently have fled to Texas after emptying their 
bank accounts of $200,000, said a prosecutor who pleaded with a judge to jail 
the couple at a hearing a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Richard F. Charvat, who ignored the warning that the 
couple would not show up for sentencing, issued the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's victim said he is angry that the Mulchaheys have gone free. 
</P>
<P>
And Deputy Dist. Atty. Glenn Sommers, who prosecuted the case, faces 
disciplinary action for arguing too zealously in court on Nov. 1 that the 
Mulchaheys should be jailed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The Mulchaheys pleaded no contest in July to a charge that they embezzled 
$34,000 from Harbor Insurance Agency and its 87-year-old owner, Bernard O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal said the crime was particularly painful because he had hired Georgia 
Mulchahey, 59, and trusted her enough to promote her to office manager. He said 
it was only later that he discovered Mulchahey stole his money, buying 
equipment for her husband's competing insurance firm and writing checks to 
herself. A continuing investigation has revealed that the couple actually stole 
about $150,000 from O'Neal, Sommers said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, facing up to four years in state prison, were to have returned to 
court Thursday. But the judge, the defense attorneys, a prosecutor and O'Neal 
waited the entire morning in vain. The Mulchaheys did not call to explain their 
absence, said one of their attorneys, Henry Salcido. 
</P>
<P>
Charvat set another hearing in the case for Jan. 18 and said he will sentence 
the couple in absentia if they have not been found by then. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing had originally been set for September, but Charvat granted 
continuances: first so that the couple could have private probation reports 
prepared, and then so James Mulchahey, 64, could complete an alcohol-treatment 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers protested the delays. 
</P>
<P>
He got a special hearing on Nov. 1, and told the judge he was convinced that 
the Mulchaheys, who were free on $7,500 bail each, would not appear for 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers told Charvat that the Mulchaheys had given a false address to their 
county probation officer, moved out of their home and used a false name to rent 
a condominium in Rancho Palos Verdes and then moved again to an unknown 
location. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy district attorney also said the alcohol-treatment program was a 
stalling tactic. James Mulchahey did not have a drinking problem and had no 
intention of enrolling in a treatment program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mulchahey's lawyers, Henry Salcido and Dennis Carroll, argued against 
locking their clients up. 
</P>
<P>
The couple moved to a new home and used a false name because the case had 
brought them so much adverse publicity, not because they intended to flee, 
Carroll told the judge. The lawyers said Mulchahey had been an alcoholic for 
many years and planned to seek treatment at the Veteran's Administration 
Hospital in Long Beach. They said there was no reason to suspect that the 
Mulchaheys would disappear, since they had not missed a court date before. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers countered with an emotional speech, telling the judge: 
</P>
<P>
"You have before you two convicted felons. They are not entitled to remain out 
on bail. They are con artists. They are first-rate con artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you honestly in your heart look at Mr. O'Neal and let these two people 
walk out of here, given the facts I have presented to you? You know in your 
heart that they are going to flee." 
</P>
<P>
Sommers spiced his arguments with profanity. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the hourlong hearing, Charvat said he sympathized with O'Neal. 
The judge moved the sentencing date up from Jan. 11 to Nov. 30, but he refused 
to jail the Mulchaheys. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted another outburst from Sommers, who accused the judge of "doing 
the political thing" and "paying off a political debt." 
</P>
<P>
Charvat did not respond to the outburst during the hearing but afterward filed 
a complaint with the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers has subsequently been removed from all cases in the Superior Court. 
Another deputy district attorney handled Thursday's hearing before Charvat. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers, a prosecutor for 16 years, said he has been told that he will be 
suspended for five days without pay for alleged professional misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers declined Thursday to explain his allegations about political influence, 
and he remained unrepentant. 
</P>
<P>
"If the judge has any integrity at all, he'll call downtown to the DA's office 
and request that the suspension not occur and withdraw the allegation against 
me," Sommers said. 
</P>
<P>
Denis Petty, the head deputy in the Long Beach district attorney's office, said 
Sommers will be disciplined, even though he correctly predicted the Mulchaheys 
would not appear. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all governed by the rules of professional conduct," Petty said, "and we 
always have to abide by those rules, no matter how strongly we feel." 
</P>
<P>
Through his clerk, Charvat on Thursday declined to comment on the case as long 
as it is pending. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal was permitted to give presentencing testimony Thursday because of his 
poor health. The octogenarian, who founded Harbor Insurance Agency in 1933, 
told the judge that he was disappointed in him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like the court has given more consideration to the criminals, the 
embezzlers, than it has given to the victim, me," O'Neal said later. "The judge 
didn't exercise his authority."

MOBIL WINS COURT ROUND IN 1988 FIRE AT REFINERY; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: A MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE DISMISSED SOME CHARGES BROUGHT BY CITY OF 
TORRANCE, RULING THAT THE FEDERAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION 
HAS JURISDICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Municipal Court judge Thursday threw out criminal charges filed against Mobil 
Oil Corp. and one of its contractors in connection with an August, 1988, fire 
at Mobil's Torrance refinery, in which one worker was burned over 40% of his 
body and another was also injured. 
</P>
<P>
The action, by South Bay Municipal Court Judge Thomas P. Allen Jr., could be 
reversed if the City of Torrance, which charged the companies with safety 
violations, challenges the ruling in the appellate division of Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"This ends the case for now, but I will certainly appeal," Torrance Prosecutor 
J. D. Lord said. "I am completely confident that the decision will be 
reversed." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Allen said he threw out the charges because the federal 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration has jurisdiction in the case. He 
said OSHA issued a citation in the accident before Torrance had filed its 
charges and is scheduled to hold a hearing soon to determine whether safety 
violations occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Once OSHA has jurisdiction, that's it. Nobody else has jurisdiction," Allen 
said. "I didn't feel the city could go ahead and prosecute when the federal 
OSHA already had jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
Allen made the ruling on the second consecutive day in which he held hearings 
related to incidents at the Mobil refinery. In addition to Mobil, Cal Cat 
Chemical Co. was represented at a hearing Wednesday into the July, 1988, 
explosion at the refinery, and Irwin Industries was represented at the Thursday 
hearing about the fire that took place a month later in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 5, 1988, fire at the Torrance refinery occurred when Ron Wagoner, the 
man who was burned, mistakenly opened a pipe containing flammable hydrocarbon 
liquids, which spewed onto hot pipes beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 4, 1989, Torrance filed criminal misdemeanor charges against Mobil and 
Irwin Industries, the company that employed Wagoner. At the time of the 
explosion, Wagoner was part of an Irwin Industries pipe-fitting crew that was 
preparing to replace a number of valves. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Allen's ruling marks the second time he has thrown out criminal charges 
filed over accidents at the Mobil refinery. On Oct. 30, he dismissed most of 
the accusations against Mobil and two top refinery officials stemming from a 
deadly explosion at the facility on July 15, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Still remaining are misdemeanor charges that Mobil and a former executive of 
the company allegedly obstructed a Torrance Fire Department investigation of 
the July blast, which left one man dead and two others injured. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, one Mobil employee at the explosion scene put his 
hand in front of a fire investigator's camera and several others persuaded 
Mobil employees to stop talking to fire officials. On Wednesday, Mobil and 
former assistant refinery manager Tom Gregory pleaded not guilty to the 
obstruction charges. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe anything like that took place," Max Gillam, an attorney 
representing Mobil in the case, said Thursday. "And secondly, if it had, it was 
very minor," he added, asserting that the investigation was never seriously 
hampered. 
</P>
<P>
Also entering not guilty pleas Wednesday were three managers of Cal Cat 
Chemical Co., which Mobil employed as a contractor to process sludge from 
storage tanks at the refinery. The company's president, chief chemist and 
project manager face misdemeanor charges of willfully violating safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Cat Chemical employees were processing sludge at the time of the explosion. 
City fire investigators concluded that the personnel had not followed proper 
safety procedures while performing the work. 
</P>
<P>
In related action, Judge Allen ordered Wednesday that the cases against Mobil 
and Cal Cat Chemical be decided in separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, the judge said he ordered the severance of the two 
cases because the charges against the two companies were of an entirely 
different nature. He said he also agreed with Cal Cat Chemical's argument that 
it might not get a fair hearing if it were to be tried alongside Mobil because 
of publicity about a string of mishaps at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"It could affect Cal Cat Chemical's ability to get a fair trial," Allen said. 
"I live in the (South Bay) area and the publicity that has come out on Mobil's 
activities has been extensive." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Ettinger, an attorney representing Cal Cat Chemical, said that he 
buttressed his argument to Allen with a pile of news stories: "I gave him 
(copies) of over 200 unfavorable articles regarding Mobil." 
</P>
<P>
Gillam said that, despite Allen's ruling, Mobil has no immediate plans to try 
to shift its trial on obstruction charges to a community other than Torrance.

WRONG-WAY DRIVER DIES IN HEAD-ON FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who drove the wrong way for at least four miles on the Golden State 
Freeway was killed Thursday when he collided head-on with another car on the 
freeway in Pacoima, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators identified the driver as Winfred McCollum, 86, of Altadena, who 
was killed in the 2 p.m. accident just north of the Van Nuys Boulevard exit, 
CHP Officer Tami Low said. The driver of the other car, Eric Deshon, 24, of 
Canyon Country, suffered major injuries and was being treated at Holy Cross 
Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
McCollum was going south at about 55 m.p.h. in a non-traffic buffer lane on the 
northbound side of the freeway's concrete center divider, Low said. He was 
first reported near Roxford Street in Sylmar, about four miles from where the 
fatal crash took place. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles police officer driving south spotted the wrong-way car on the 
other side of the center divider but was unable to stop the car. He told CHP 
investigators that the driver appeared to be confused. 
</P>
<P>
Low said investigators believe that McCollum saw a break in the oncoming 
traffic and attempted to veer across the freeway to the Van Nuys Boulevard exit 
but hit Deshon's car head-on. 
</P>
<P>
The accident closed two southbound lanes for 90 minutes and caused traffic to 
back up through the northeastern San Fernando Valley, Low said.

PALMDALE DAY-CARE CENTER GETS PROBATION IN ABUSE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Palmdale day-care center has been placed on three years probation as part of 
a settlement between the state and its owner, who had been accused of 
physically abusing children there and in her home, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A two-year investigation led state authorities to sanction the license of the 
Agapeland Center for Children, 1850 E. Avenue R, and its operator, Debra L. 
Sweeney, 34, of Palmdale. In addition, the state permanently revoked the 
license Sweeney and her husband held to provide foster care in their home. 
</P>
<P>
In a settlement with state officials, Sweeney admitted biting, pinching and 
slapping a girl in her home on East Avenue R-13 in 1987. Her husband, James, 
admitted hitting the girl and a boy there, "sometimes using a wooden board," 
numerous times between February, 1985, and July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the state did not press criminal charges against the couple and 
allowed her to continue to operate the day-care center. Additionally, the state 
agreed not to pursue other allegations of abuse against the couple. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian-oriented facility, licensed for 72 children, leases space from 
the First Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the Sweeneys could be reached for comment Thursday about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the settlement, Sweeney must not be alone with children at 
the center, must see a therapist until it is found "she poses no risk to 
children" and must provide training for all staff members to ensure that their 
disciplinary practices comply with state standards. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-count accusation filed by the state Department of Social Services earlier 
this year also accused Debra Sweeney of failing to hire qualified day-care 
teachers and of failing to comply with criminal record clearance requirements 
for center employees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she also allegedly battered a foster girl, who was under the age 
of 10, and forced her to work "as a servant" at home and at the day-care center 
for more than two years until July, 1987. County officials, acting on a 
complaint, removed the girl. The boy had already left the home by then. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation also said Sweeney suffered a miscarriage in 1985 and forced the 
girl "to carry the plastic bag of fetal remains to the doctor." It also accused 
Debra Sweeney of slapping the face of a child at the day-care center, screaming 
at an infant there and grabbing and pushing a third child.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GREENBELT SOON WILL BE CITY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hermosa Beach expects to close escrow Dec. 21 on its newest city park, the 
verdant pathway previously known as the old Santa Fe Railroad right of way, 
city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kevin Northcraft, in a status report Tuesday to the City Council, 
said most of the 20-acre strip -- recently dubbed the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt 
-- will officially belong to the city on Dec. 21, at a cost of $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 20% of the strip, worth another $1.5 million, will belong to the 
city as soon as a lawsuit over the ownership of the property is settled and the 
title is clear, Northcraft said. In the meantime, the city will have exclusive 
rights to the section under the terms of its lease with the railroad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The strip was the subject of controversy earlier this month when the city 
challenged pet owners who for years had allowed their dogs to run off-leash 
there. The dog owners lost when voters approved the city's plan to enforce 
leash laws on the greenbelt. The new ordinance will take effect Dec. 8.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRASH BINS PROMISE GOOD RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange recycling bins have been distributed to about 15,000 Manhattan Beach 
residences in anticipation of a recycling program that starts Monday. 
Newspapers, plastic soda pop containers, glass, and aluminum and tin cans will 
be picked up for recycling on regular weekly trash collection days, according 
to David Ludwig, contract manager for the city Department of Public Services. 
</P>
<P>
Ludwig said the city started the program to help relieve the pressure on 
landfills by removing recyclable materials that normally are dumped. He said 
residents now divert about 5% of their trash through recycling and the city 
hopes to increase the rate to 20% with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will pay an additional 70 cents per month on their trash bills for 
recycling. But if the participation rate is 50%, which Ludwig said is expected, 
residents will get a credit of 50 cents per month at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling has been added to the city's trash collection contract with Western 
Waste Industries, which has four years to run.

EL CAMINO COLLEGE WON'T OK SHOPPING CENTER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to turn an El Camino College parking lot into a shopping center has 
been set aside indefinitely by college trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees voted 4-0 not to proceed with any of three development proposals 
presented to them last month. Proposals had called for building a shopping 
center on the 1,100-space lot at Crenshaw and Redondo Beach boulevards and 
using profits from the development to build 2,000 spaces in structures 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be premature for the district to make a long-term commitment for the 
use of that property other than for education or other district purposes," said 
Donald Sorsabal, school vice president. Administrators began studying the idea 
in July after a builder said developing the lot would turn a profit.

CHANNEL 4 LEADS NEWS RATINGS AGAIN 
</P>

KNBC Channel 4 completed a clean sweep of this year's local news ratings by 
winning its third consecutive "sweeps" in November, scoring victories in all 
news time periods over rivals KABC Channel 7 and KCBS Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Thursday by A.C. Nielsen Co., Channel 4 trounced 
its two rivals by at least 74,000 households in the early-morning news and all 
afternoon/early-evening newscasts. It also won at 11 p.m. but only by a narrow 
margin, as KABC improved significantly over its performance in last May's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 also won the news race in Arbitron's ratings, but KABC was a much 
closer second in all time periods. Channel 2 was a distant third once again in 
both services, getting clobbered at 11 p.m. by reruns of "Cheers" on KTLA 
Channel 5 and only managing to tie "The Arsenio Hall Show" on KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Channel 2 was that, in its first sweeps with "Wheel of 
Fortune" and "Jeopardy" -- before September the game shows had aired on Channel 
13 -- it catapulted from last place to first in the competitive 7-8 p.m. time 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the November sweeps -- one of four critical 
ratings periods that help determine advertising rates -- was the sensational 
performance of "Hunter" on Channel 5 at 6 p.m. "Hunter" proved to be a killer 
in its first time out in syndication, winning its time period over local and 
national news and the debuts of such ballyhooed sitcoms as "Night Court" and 
"Growing Pains" on Channel 13 and "Who's the Boss?" on Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
Disney-owned Channel 9, which plans to unveil a three-hour prime-time newscast 
next March, also flopped in news during November, despite the debut of highly 
paid veteran anchorman Jerry Dunphy as the centerpiece of the station's news 
department. KHJ's 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. newscasts, anchored by Dunphy and Pat 
Harvey, mustered a high of only a 2.7 rating, down more than one full point 
from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In other sweeps highs and lows (using Nielsen numbers unless otherwise 
indicated, with each Nielsen point representing 49,315 households): 
</P>
<P>
Can We Talk?: Joan Rivers' return to television is off to, well, a rather shaky 
crawl. The comedian's afternoon talk show on Channel 2 was crushed by all three 
of her more established rivals. "Oprah" won as usual with a 7.2 rating at 3 
p.m. for KABC-TV while KNBC's "Donahue" scored a 5.5 and Rivers only a 2.2. 
"Geraldo" managed a 5.4 at 4 p.m. on Channel 2. Even "The Sally Jesse Raphael 
Show," which airs at 2 p.m. on Channel 9, beat Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
That's Entertainment: "Entertainment Tonight" gossiped its way to the top of 
the 7 p.m. time period, beating "Wheel of Fortune," which had previously held 
the top spot in this competitive time period. Though its ratings improved over 
last May, "Cosby" managed only third, nearly two full rating points behind. 
</P>
<P>
What Happened to Maury?: KTTV's Maury Povich and "A Current Affair," which had 
been dominating the 7:30 p.m. time period for at least the last year, slipped 
to third in November as "Jeopardy" on Channel 2 sneaked into the top spot. 
KNBC's new "Hard Copy" was second. KABC's "Eye on L.A.," formerly unbeatable in 
this time period, fell to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Play It Again, Hal: As always, KTLA, with anchorman Hal Fishman, wiped out all 
comers in the independent news race, scoring a 5.1 at 10 p.m. and drawing a 
larger audience than CBS-owned KCBS's 11 p.m. newscast. KTTV and KCOP were tied 
at 10 p.m. in Arbitron, but, in the Nielsen account, KTTV with a 2.5 rating was 
slightly ahead of Warren Olney and KCOP's 2.3. 
</P>
<P>
Still No Johnny-Come-Latelys: Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" is still king of 
late-night talk, registering a 5.9 rating for the month. "Arsenio" is still 
going strong with a 4.4 at 11 p.m. on Channel 13. "Late Night With David 
Letterman" garnered a 3.6 at 12:30 a.m. for KNBC, while the endangered "Pat 
Sajak Show" on KCBS checked in with an anemic 2.4. Even "Later With Bob 
Costas," which doesn't air until 1:30 a.m. on KNBC, outdrew "Sajak."

LATC FINDS NEW 'SALESMAN' TO REPLACE AILING PHILIP HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Murdock has stepped into the role of Willy Loman, replacing the ailing 
Philip Baker Hall in the Los Angeles Theatre Center's production of "Death of a 
Salesman." According to a spokeswoman for the theater, performances will go on 
without any disruption in the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Hall suffered a detached retina of his left eye in a staged scuffle during a 
Nov. 22 performance of the Arthur Miller play. The condition did not fully 
manifest itself until Tuesday, however, during a matinee performance for 
students. Hall successfully underwent emergency surgery at Midway Hospital at 
6:30 p.m. the same day. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, in the grip of financial cutbacks, was caught without an 
understudy for the role. (Actors' Equity, the actor's union, does require 
understudies, said a union representative, but it cannot make them mandatory.) 
</P>
<P>
Center artistic director Bill Bushnell, who also staged the play, had to 
perform the part, script in hand, at Wednesday's student matinee. (There was no 
scheduled evening performance Wednesday.) 
</P>
<P>
The theatrical community was immediately alerted that LATC was looking for 
anyone who had recently played the role of Willy Loman and would be willing to 
stand in for Hall. Murdock, who is a friend of one of the cast members and had 
seen the show Saturday, offered his services. He had played Loman at 
Southwestern University in Georgetown, Tex., about three weeks ago and was 
pressed into immediate service. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed up for rehearsal at 5:30 (p.m., Wednesday) with his costume and the 
words," said Bushnell. "All he needed to do was to learn the moves." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a miracle," said LATC producing director Diane White. "For a 
theater that had to give up understudies because of money problems and 
constrictions in our budget from the Community Redevelopment Agency, this was 
an amazing coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
Murdock is well known for numerous performances around town over the last 
decade, beginning with a memorably apoplectic Judge Julius Hoffman in the 
Odyssey Theatre's "The Chicago Conspiracy Trial" in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"Life has all these little potholes you don't know are there," Hall said from 
his home Thursday, where he is recuperating. The doctor's recommendation is a 
three-week convalescence, but Hall is not ruling out the possibility that he 
might return to the play next Friday for the final weekend (it closes Dec. 10). 
</P>
<P>
"I've waited so long to play this part," he said wistfully. It is not known 
whether the theater, whose workman's compensation insurance will foot the bill 
for this incident, will allow him to return. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock, in rehearsal, could not be reached for comment.

NETWORKS MAP STRATEGY FOR COVERING SUMMIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a week of showing viewers dramatic images of the "human face" of 
political change in Eastern Europe, from candlelit demonstrations in downtown 
Prague, Czechoslovakia, to a meeting in Rome between Pope John Paul II and 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the TV networks this weekend will face a new 
challenge: depicting diplomacy aboard two ships floating in the scenic 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
When President Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev meet to discuss the roles of 
their two nations at a time of sweeping change in the world, their summit 
meeting will take place in a tightly controlled environment: two warships, the 
U.S. cruiser Belknap and the Soviet ship Slava, anchored in the bay off the 
coast of Malta. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be interesting pictures to look at," says Jeff Gralnick, the ABC 
News executive in charge of the network's special coverage. "But summits are 
not picture stories. This is a talking-head story." 
</P>
<P>
The three major broadcast networks, plus Cable News Network, will anchor their 
evening newscasts from Malta tonight, continuing with live coverage throughout 
the Saturday-Sunday "Saltwater Summit." 
</P>
<P>
To provide live coverage from the two ships, the networks will use microwave 
dishes that will transmit TV signals to a receiver on shore, where they will be 
beamed up to each network's satellite in New York. American and Soviet navy 
launches will periodically ferry camera crews and correspondents from the shore 
onto the ship to report on the talks. (The network anchors -- who have logged 
many miles with their coverage from Europe over the past few weeks -- are 
likely to stay ashore to broadcast from the networks' own facilities on Malta.) 
</P>
<P>
A major storm could affect the microwave signal, but, says Gralnick, "The bay 
is large and protected from the heavy seas. In some ways, this is less 
difficult logistically than covering the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik, 
Iceland, where we were all focused on a little white house" where the talks 
were conducted. 
</P>
<P>
More of a challenge will be offering early analysis of the summit talks, which 
begin at 12:30 a.m. Pacific time. With the co-stars in the drama initially 
sequestered aboard the ships, notes Lane Vernardos, director of the CBS News 
special-events unit, "This isn't exactly the White House briefing room." 
</P>
<P>
Correspondents will be "working the phones," says Vernardos, and debriefing 
Soviet and American officials as events unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Originally planned only a few weeks ago as a get-acquainted session between the 
two world leaders, the Malta summit has assumed more significance with the 
avalanche of change in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the networks' own anchors and correspondents, experts who can 
provide analysis of the East Bloc, possible nuclear-arms topics and other areas 
are sought after as guests on the newscasts. In addition to academics and 
guests such as former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, CBS, in the new spirit 
of glasnost, has hired an expert from the Soviet Union, Sergei Plekhanov, as a 
consultant to analyze the talks from the Soviet perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to pair Plekhanov with an expert from Princeton, who will be able 
to separate any mis- or dis-information -- not that we expect any," says 
Vernardos. In addition to coverage throughout the day Saturday, the networks 
will provide live coverage of Bush's and Gorbachev's respective press 
conferences on Sunday. They will offer extended versions of their early-morning 
news programs such as NBC's "Sunday Today," CBS's "Sunday Morning" and ABC's 
"This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
Cable News Network will have updates "virtually every hour" during the two days 
on its regularly scheduled newscasts, according to Jane Mitchell, the CNN 
executive in charge of the special coverage for the cable-news channel. 
</P>
<P>
Some TV critics have criticized the networks' new emphasis on having the anchor 
fly to the scene of a major story such as the summit, saying that the message 
to viewers is that, like a tree falling in the forest, a story doesn't exist 
unless it's covered by Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw or Bernard Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the responsibilities of the media is to set the agenda for the country 
in terms of what is and isn't important," says Joe Angotti, senior vice 
president of news at NBC. "TV does that with the anchor. When we send an 
anchor, it places the story on the nation's agenda."

NO STUNTS NECESSARY TO PUT NBC ON TOP IN NOVEMBER SWEEPS

<P>
In a November sweeps period where special episodes of regular series supplanted 
expensive, long-form miniseries as the way to attract viewers, top-ranked NBC 
scored an unsurprising win. 
</P>
<P>
Outranking the other networks during the crucial period when stations measure 
their ratings for advertisers, NBC came in first, ABC second and CBS third in 
the fall sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
"Our win was based on our regular schedule, with little 'stunting' or 
preemptions," Robert Niles, NBC vice president of research, noted at a news 
conference here. "With the performance of our regular series, multiple-part 
miniseries have to pass a hurdle with us." 
</P>
<P>
For the four-week period, NBC averaged a 15.1 rating and a 25 share of the 
audience, while ABC posted a 13 rating and a 21 share, and CBS had a 12 rating 
and a 20 share. A Nielsen rating point represents 921,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
There were no multiple-part miniseries and only three two-parters broadcast 
during the November ratings period. ABC's docudrama "Small Sacrifices" was the 
big hit among the miniseries, with a 21.7 rating and a 34 share of the 
audience. NBC's "Cross of Fire" had a 13.6 rating and 22 share. CBS' "Till We 
Meet Again" had a 12.9 rating and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
Overall viewing levels were off slightly from the November sweeps a year ago, 
but the networks' combined share of the prime-time audience remained at 66%. 
"While there is network erosion, it tends to come off shows at the bottom of 
the ratings," Niles said. JANE HALL

DISNEY KOS KHJ-TV . . . NOW IT'S 'KCAL, CALIFORNIA 9'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: A FRESH IMAGE IS CITED AS THE REASON. THE CHANGE FOLLOWS THE 
DEPARTURE OF VETERAN STAFF MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
KHJ-TV, the station that brought Southern California viewers everything from 
Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, to a live call-in show with local politicians to 
the Lakers' new Yugoslav center Vlade Divac reciting a station identification 
in his native tongue, lives no more. On Saturday, the Walt Disney Co.'s first 
and only television station will change its name and call letters to "KCAL, 
California 9." 
</P>
<P>
"In our research, KHJ, after all these years on the air, had a non-entity 
image," said Blake Byrne, Channel 9's president and general manager. "And we 
decided we would like to have a name that at least had the potential to create 
a positive image." 
</P>
<P>
Since Disney took control of KHJ-TV last December after buying the troubled 
station from RKO for $320 million, the station has seemingly been intent on 
severing all ties to the past. Longtime general manager Chuck Velona was 
ousted, as were veteran news director Stephanie Rank Brady, news anchors Wendy 
Gordon, Tom Lawrence and Lonnie Lardner and sportscaster Scott St. James. Walt 
Baker, Channel 9's vice president of programming, who had been with the station 
since 1967, resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
Changing its name and logo apparently exorcises the last ghost from Los 
Angeles' perennially last-place VHF TV station, which, before the Disney sale 
was consummated, had been in trouble for more than 20 years because of a 
licensing dispute between its parent, RKO, and the Federal Communications 
Commission. Those problems had forced the station to air an unusually large 
amount of public-affairs programming, which contributed to its dismal ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"KHJ was known as such a rag for so many years, this change might make the 
people at the station feel good," said Rick Feldman, station manager at KCOP 
Channel 13. "But odds are it doesn't mean anything in terms of adding 
viewership. It didn't mean anything for KNXT to become KCBS (in April, 1984). 
This is not going to change a thing. It's a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said that the station looked at lists of new call letters before settling 
on KCAL. Two radio stations in Redlands already were using those letters, 
however, so, Byrne said, KHJ paid them a "large (undisclosed) fee" for 
permission to use them too. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought (KCAL) was terrific," Byrne said. "California is what we're all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
The thinking, Byrne continued, is that the new name will give the station a 
more local flavor. Since KTLA Channel 5 and KLAC-AM (570) already had Los 
Angeles in their names, "California 9" was the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern Californians and Northern Californians all identify themselves as 
Californians," Byrne said. "It ties into the self-image we would like to have. 
I would hope that it would help people in all of Southern California -- in 
Riverside and San Bernardino and Orange County as well as L.A. -- to identify 
with the station." 
</P>
<P>
The station first went on the air experimentally in 1931 as Don Lee 
Television's W6XAO. It became KHJ in 1951. The call letters, one ex-employee 
said, stood for kindness, happiness and joy. The latter was often difficult to 
muster in the years before the sale to Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to be more innovative than would normally be expected because of the 
lack of financial support that we had," former program director Baker said 
Thursday. "RKO was spending a ton of money on lawyers in a gigantic battle to 
save the license. At one point for more than a year we had at least one 
Washington attorney in the building at all times and I was flying to Washington 
every other week. And even with all of that we managed to present a pretty good 
front." 
</P>
<P>
KHJ started "The Million Dollar Movie" and, with a couple of "Elvira" specials, 
was the first station in the city to broadcast in 3-D. The station was home for 
"Groovy," "Boss City" and "The Real Don Steele Show" as well as the annual 
"Your Choice for the Oscars." "Government on the Line" enabled viewers to call 
in and talk directly to local and state politicians. A "Save Our Sports" 
telethon, Baker said, was instrumental in saving the sports programs at Los 
Angeles city schools in the wake of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, such local television personalities as Baxter Ward, Hal 
Fishman, George Putnam, Larry Burrell, Nathan Roberts, Geoff Edwards and 
Meredith McRae have called KHJ home. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said that he and others felt some uneasiness about obliterating the name 
of a station that had been part of Los Angeles for 38 years. The "H&amp;J" are 
history, Byrne conceded, but at least some of the history remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
"We have in our lobby a great fresco mural which RKO has had here forever, with 
lots of pictures of famous stars that have been involved with RKO," Byrne said. 
"That's history. Somebody said, 'Oh, we have to paint that over,' and I said, 
'Not on your life.' We can't preserve the good things in the history of KHJ in 
the call letters, but we can preserve something like the mural."

EAST GERMANY ABOLISHES COMMUNISTS' POWER MONOPOLY, KEEPS SOCIALIST LABEL

<P>
Parliament abolished the Communist Party's 40-year guaranteed monopoly on power 
today but retained East Germany's designation as a socialist state. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected move reflects a national fever for swift and thorough reform and 
was a concession to one of the major demands of pro-democracy opposition 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany became the second East European country to abolish the Communists' 
guiding role this week in the rapid pace of reforms sweeping the Soviet-allied 
region. Czechoslovakia's Parliament scrapped the same provision Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Poland named its first non-Communist government, and 
Hungary's Communist Party transformed itself into a Social Democratic party. 
Bulgaria also has embraced reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The 500-member Peoples Chamber, long a rubber-stamp body that translated 
Communist Party policy into law, had been scheduled to devote today's session 
to discussion of new regulations on foreign travel. 
</P>
<P>
But non-Communist Parliament Speaker Guenther Maleuda opened the session by 
saying the leaders of all parties represented in the People's Chamber jointly 
proposed a constitutional revision to strip the Communists of their guaranteed 
leading role. 
</P>
<P>
Without debate, a show of hands was called on the motion to drop a passage from 
Article 1 describing East Germany as "under leadership of the working class and 
its Marxist-Leninist party." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist-dominated chamber broke into applause after all but five of the 
420 deputies present voted in favor of striking the Communist power monopoly 
from the constitution. The five abstained. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best we could have wished for," said Carla Kawalt of the leading 
opposition group, New Forum, when told of the decision. "We are very happy with 
this action." 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency ADN said the full, 163-member Communist Party Central 
Committee will meet Sunday to weigh necessary "consequences" on the situation 
in the party. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency session could decide to expel from the party Honecker and other 
members of his ousted leadership, after reports of massive corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The party has already expelled top Honecker lieutenant Guenter Mittag, the 
former economic chief.

Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged in a historic meeting with Pope John Paul II today 
that the Soviet Union will guarantee freedom of religion at home and establish 
diplomatic ties with the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Navarro, a Vatican spokesman, said that Gorbachev also invited the Pope 
to visit the Soviet Union and that John Paul thanked him and expressed the hope 
that developments will allow him to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
The beaming Pope welcomed today's visit -- the first between a Kremlin chief 
and Roman Catholic pontiff -- as a "promise-filled sign for the future" and 
pledged support for Gorbachev's attempt to reform Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Gorbachev told a news conference that a freedom of 
conscience law will soon be adopted in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"People of many confessions, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists and 
others live in the Soviet Union. All of them have a right to satisfy their 
spiritual needs," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader also said the Vatican and Moscow had reached agreement in 
principle to give "official status to our interstate relations" with the 
details to be worked out by diplomats. The Pope has long sought to re-establish 
relations with the Soviets, broken since the Russian Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Departing from his prepared text, Gorbachev said: "We discussed a future papal 
visit." John Paul has frequently expressed the wish to visit the Soviet Union, 
provided he can meet with his flock all over the country, including Lithuania 
and the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope has disclosed on two occasions that he had been barred from visiting 
Lithuania, the Roman Catholic stronghold in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro did not provide a date for such a trip. "I don't know when, but 
certainly the Pope will be going some day," Navarro told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, as Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, entered the Apostolic Palace, they 
were greeted by bemedaled Vatican dignitaries and received a salute from a 
detachment of Swiss Guards. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gorbachev's red dress raised eyebrows at the Vatican where protocol 
normally calls for women to wear dark dresses. But she seemed at ease as she 
toured the palace and asked questions about its artworks.

Three days of informal talks between coffee producers this week ended with no 
promise of new world coffee negotiations and no agreement -- except to let the 
free market continue to rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The positions are still the same as they were in July," James Wapakabhulo, 
chairman of the International Coffee Organization executive council, told a 
news conference when the talks ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to call a meeting until I am convinced we can meet and 
succeed," said Wapakabhulo, Uganda's Minister for Cooperatives and Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The export quota system of supply restraints of the 74-nation ICO broke down 
July 4 amid bitter disputes among producers about market shares and consumer 
frustration with availability of desirable coffees, especially high quality 
"mild" or washed arabicas. 
</P>
<P>
The basic problem was changing consumer tastes, which increased the value of 
milder coffees at the expense of more traditional strains like robustas. The 
inability of the 1983 coffee agreement to satisfy this demand was what brought 
the house crashing down.

FORECASTING GAUGE FOR ECONOMY DROPS; 
</P>
<P>
LEADING INDICATORS: DECLINE OF 0.4% IN OCTOBER IS NO SURPRISE. ANALYSTS WARY, 
BUT DON'T EXPECT RECESSION.

<P>
The government's chief economic forecasting gauge fell 0.4% in October, the 
sixth month of declines or no gain this year, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which is designed to 
forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance, followed gains of 
0.3% in September and 0.6% in August. Both gains were revised in today's report 
to reflect a slightly better increase than earlier reported. 
</P>
<P>
The October drop was in line with most economists' expectation. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of 1989, the index has fallen five times, risen four 
times and remained unchanged in one month. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the index at 144.6% of its 1982 base of 100. That 
represents a 0.4% decline at an annual rate for the year so far, compared with 
a 3.8% gain in the first 10 months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at a moderate 
2.7% rate in the July-September quarter. But analysts say the economy has 
slowed sharply in the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A few economists believe the country is on the verge of toppling into a 
recession after an unprecedented peacetime expansion of seven years, but most 
express confidence that the Federal Reserve won't let that happen. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll skirt the edge of a recession, but not fall in," said Bruce Steinberg, 
an economist at Merrill Lynch brokerage. "The reason is . . . interest rates 
are coming down substantially." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, an expansion of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board was one 
of four forward-looking business statistics that partly offset six negative 
indicators in the index. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices, despite the Friday-the-13th plunge in October, were a neutral 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
The two biggest negatives were an increase in claims for unemployment insurance 
and a drop in the average work week for factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
The other weak signs were a drop in unfilled orders at factories; a decline in 
a consumer confidence survey; faster deliveries of factory goods, indicating 
slackening demand, and fewer new orders for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
An increase in building permits, a rise in prices for sensitive materials and 
an increase in capital investment spending by businesses were the positive 
factors in addition to the money supply. 
</P>
<P>
The recent economic weakness is considered the result of a yearlong 
anti-inflation program by the Federal Reserve, which cooled the economy and 
inflationary pressures by boosting short-term interest rates through this 
spring. But in June, the central bank began nudging rates down again, hoping to 
stave off a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the slowdown we're looking at now came as a result of Fed tightening 
between March, 1988, and March, 1989. Now the Fed has reversed those moves and 
we will start to see some recovery," said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. 
Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities dealer in New York.

WBA FUND REACHES OUT TO JOE LOUIS' INDIGENT WIDOW

<P>
Martha Louis, the penniless widow of boxing great Joe Louis, is the first 
recipient of alms from the World Boxing Council's Friendly Hand Foundation, a 
new fund for old boxers and their families who have fallen on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
"The often heard complaint against boxing is that the sport quickly abandons 
its champions whose careers are over," said Stephen Crosson, treasurer and U.S. 
spokesman for the Mexico City-based WBC. 
</P>
<P>
"The actions of our foundation will demonstrate to the world that we are 
serious about taking care of our own," Crosson said. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Louis, an indigent patient in poor health at a Detroit nursing home, 
will be wired $5,000 today, Crosson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of this money will buy her some false teeth. It's a terribly sad 
situation she is in. She is in her 80s and very sick. She has absolutely not a 
cent to her name," Crosson said by phone from his Dallas home early today. 
</P>
<P>
Crosson said he would wire the money to Dr. Stuart Kirschenbaum in Detroit, who 
will be in charge of administering the funds. Kirschenbaum is the chairman of 
the Michigan Athletic Commission and a WBC judge, Crosson said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we are considering is moving Mrs. Louis to Las Vegas, where 
she has some friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Louis held the world heavyweight boxing championship longer than any other man 
-- from June, 1937, when he knocked out James Braddock in the eighth round, 
until he retired in March, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
He successfully defended his title 25 times -- 20 by knockout. He later failed 
in two comeback attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Crosson said that Louis had bad financial handlers throughout his career and 
when he died on April 12, 1981, his widow was left with almost nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Their story is not an unfamiliar one, the WBC said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many other great champions of the world are now in the streets of cities all 
over the world," Crosson said. "They had such bad money managers that they went 
broke, especially in the '40s, '50s and '60s. There are some real horror 
stories about great athletes who end up in rags on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the last 15 or so years, boxers have realized they need to take 
better care of their money." 
</P>
<P>
The WBC Friendly Hand Foundation -- also known as the Martha Louis Fund -- is 
based in Dallas and is soliciting nominations from its eight WBC continental 
federations. It will distribute $125,000 to old boxers and their families in 
1990, the WBC said. 
</P>
<P>
Crosson said he has nominated Sandy Sadler, who won the world featherweight 
championship in 1948, for a grant next year. Sadler, he said, "was found this 
year walking the streets of New York in a very bad way." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to help all those great former champions that gave all of us so many 
thrills over the decades," Crosson said. 
</P>
<P>
The WBC also established a pension plan which went into effect in November. 
</P>
<P>
The WBC, organized in 1963, recognizes world titles in 16 weight divisions and 
ranks the top 30 contenders in each. It also sanctions certain title fights.

SENIOR PUTTS TO AUSTRALIAN OPEN LEAD

Australian Peter Senior took a three-stroke second-round lead over Nick Faldo 
of Britian and Jeff Woodland of Australia with his second 66 in the $400,000 
Australian Open golf tournament today. 
</P>
<P>
Senior, who has improved his touch on the greens by switching to a long-handled 
putter, has played 36 holes without a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to jump up and down just yet," Senior said. "There are a lot of 
good players on the leader board. I've tended to rush things before, so I'm 
going to take my time and think about my game over the next two days." 
</P>
<P>
First-round leader Curtis Strange and Mark Calcavecchia are four shots behind 
Senior at 136. Strange, the U.S. Open champion, followed his course record 
tying first round of 65 on the 6,847-yard, par-72 Kingston Heath course with an 
inconsistent round of 71 that included seven birdies and six bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to say," Strange said of the round that began with four 
consecutive bogeys and then four straight birdies. "I can't remember playing a 
round like that. I made a number of birdies, but I never felt in control of my 
game. I was never comfortable, but I kept fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, the British Open champion and defending Australian Open champion, 
added a 69 to his first round of 67. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can keep shooting scores in the 60s, I'll be there at the end," 
Calcavecchia said. "I'm kind of hanging around and I'm playing well, so I'm in 
good shape. I'm putting well, which takes a lot of pressure off the rest of my 
game. The greens are fast, but I like them that way. The faster the better." 
</P>
<P>
Faldo shot a 67 in the second round to tie Woodland, who had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite tricky judging the wind direction and the strength of it, but I 
made some good guesses," Faldo said. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Greg Norman, seeking his fourth Australian Open title, followed his 
opening round of even-par 72 with a 70 and is 10 shots off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a chance to get into contention and I let it slide on 16 and 17, and 
that's basically it," Norman said. "I played a lot better than I did yesterday, 
but if you're going to be in contention, you've got to make a lot of putts, and 
I missed a lot of makeable putts." 
</P>
<P>
Scotland's Colin Montgomerie equaled the course record of 65 held by Gary 
Player, Ronan Rafferty and Strange to move into contention at 137. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Chris Gray had a hole in one on the par-3 10th but was unable to 
claim a $32,000 automobile because of his amateur status.

BILL STOUT, VETERAN CBS COMMENTATOR, DIES AT 62

<P>
Bill Stout, whose gravelly voice and acerbic manner proved both an endearing 
and enduring aspect of television news and commentary through nearly four 
decades, died early today. 
</P>
<P>
The former anchor on KCBS-TV, the CBS-owned outlet in Los Angeles, who was most 
recently known for his trenchant commentaries on the station, was 62. 
</P>
<P>
He died at 9:30 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of cardiac arrest. He had 
been admitted there Thursday night complaining of flu-like symptoms, said 
hospital spokesman Ron Wise. 
</P>
<P>
Stout, who was CBS News' West Coast correspondent for nine years in the 1960s 
and early '70s and who had won several Emmys and numerous other awards, 
suffered a heart attack two years ago. It forced him off the air for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Stout spent 39 years with CBS, nearly all of them at the network's Los Angeles 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS news director Michael Singer called Stout "irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
"He represented the best that journalism has to offer," Singer said. "He was a 
professional through and through and a keeper of that little flame that lights 
up the dark for all of us."

<TEXT>
<P>
The first aerial pesticide spraying in Orange County history was concluded over 
a 10-square-mile area early this morning, with officials calling the bid to 
stamp out the destructive Mediterranean fruit fly a success. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seemed to go as planned and scheduled," Frank Parsons, chief deputy 
agricultural commissioner, said this morning. "It went just like clockwork." 
</P>
<P>
Today hundreds took time out to clean off patio furniture and wash cars. At 
several lots, operators hosed down Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Business has been brisk since we opened," said Jose Ramirez, manager of the 
Brea Car Wash. "We have done almost double the business we usually do on a day 
like today." 
</P>
<P>
Parsons said that the spraying was finished shortly after midnight, an hour 
ahead of schedule, and that the "Santa Ana winds didn't present any problem." 
</P>
<P>
Traps in the area will be closely monitored to determine if a repeat spraying 
will be needed, Parsons said.

ANGELS SIGN PITCHER LANGSTON TO 5-YEAR, $16-MILLION CONTRACT

<P>
In a bold move sure to send the skyrocketing price of baseball free agents even 
higher, the Angels today signed Mark Langston to a five-year contract worth $16 
million, making the 29-year-old left-hander the game's highest paid player. 
(Details, Page P10) 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who had a combined 16-14 record with the Mariners and Expos last 
season, got the longest contract awarded a player since the mid-1980s. Only 
Tuesday, Rickey Henderson broke the $3-million contract barrier when he 
re-signed with the World Champion Oakland A's for $12 million over four years. 
That was the first contract of that length since October, 1985, when Ken 
Oberkfell signed a four-year, $3-million agreement with the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
This off-season, which promises to be the busiest free-agent market ever, has 
seen Bryn Smith leave Montreal to sign a $6-million, three-year deal with the 
St. Louis Cardinals, Kirby Puckett re-sign with the Minnesota Twins for $9 
million over three years and Pascual Perez sign with the New York Yankees for 
$5.7 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, a native of San Diego, had held discussions with the Dodgers and 
Yankees before signing with the already pitching-rich Angels. The staff last 
season had a collective earned-run average of 3.28, second-best in the American 
League.

The Sandinista government of Nicaragua refused to allow a four-member 
congressional delegation to visit the country to observe national election 
campaign activities, the lawmakers said today. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation was rebuffed by Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto, who objected 
to the financial aid Congress and the Administration have provided to 
opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush and the U.S. Congress cannot have it both ways. They cannot 
attempt to buy the election of one candidate and then present themselves to us 
as impartial election observers," D'Escoto said in a letter to Rep. G. V. 
(Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.) and other members of the delegation.

The shareholders approved waiving the restriction by more than 99%. The measure 
required approval of at least 75%. 
</P>
<P>
The approval was widely expected and clears the way for Ford to buy more Jaguar

Australia's richest man, Kerry Packer, today launched a $39.8-million bid to 
buy back the television network he sold to entrepreneur Alan Bond two years ago 
for $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Bond's flagship, Bond Corp., said it would not sell out of the Channel Nine 
network, despite mounting pressure over its $6.2 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we're just not interested," Bond Corp. director Peter Lucas told 
Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
A rejection by Bond Corp., which controls 51.6% of stock in Channel Nine owner 
Bond Media, could foil Packer's bid because it is conditional on acceptance by 
holders of 90% of Bond Media shares. 
</P>
<P>
But Packer said Bond Media faced collapse unless it obtained more money. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Bond group's debts is $150 million owed to Packer, to be repaid by 
March, 1990.

The union representing Boeing Co.'s engineers and technical workers will give 
its members a chance to vote on a company contract offer, though it won't 
recommend passage or rejection, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Mahoney, general counsel for the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees 
Assn., said negotiations between Boeing's second-largest union and the company 
concluded Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney declined to give details of the contract other than to say it contains 
"a lot of significant improvements." 
</P>
<P>
SPEEA represents nearly 28,000 Boeing workers, with nearly all its members in 
the Seattle area. It has been in talks to reach a new three-year contract since 
Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Boeing's largest union, the International Assn. of Machinists &amp; 
Aerospace Workers, ratified a new three-year contract Nov. 20, ending a 48-day 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEA originally sought a 35% salary boost over three years. The union has 
since scaled back its demands, but neither it nor Boeing has released details. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney said the union will vote by mail on the contract offer, with ballots to 
be counted Dec. 18.

Bally's Hotel officials say they are looking for a replacement act for Frank 
Sinatra, who surprised the resort Thursday by canceling an upcoming engagement 
because of a six-month strike by musicians. The resort said it is seeking a 
replacement for Sinatra's engagements Monday through Dec. 9 and Dec. 26-31 
because the singer has been "so inconsistent" in his statements about 
performing despite the strike. "Bally's can no longer rely upon any schedule of 
performances previously agreed to by Mr. Sinatra's representatives," the hotel 
said.

Carol Burnett and Julie Andrews say that coming from homes with alcoholic 
parents gives them a shared emotional background that has made them great 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's issue of Parade magazine, Burnett and Andrews say they have 
discovered an almost spiritual tie between them. 
</P>
<P>
"If I believed in reincarnation, I'd say we were sisters in a previous life," 
Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whaddaya mean, chum? I think we're sisters now!" Burnett replied. 
</P>
<P>
"We're both caretakers," Burnett said. "You see, what Julie and I now realize 
is that we were initially drawn to each other because . . . I hope I'm not 
talking out of turn, but we're both adult children of alcoholics." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews confirmed the link between them, saying: "I know Carol's family 
situation was far, far worse, but I think both of us grew up with the same 
kinds of needs and insecurities." 
</P>
<P>
"As adults, Julie and I both try to control situations because as children we 
were trying to cope with what was essentially an uncontrollable problem," 
Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
The two will appear in a television special to be broadcast Dec. 13 on ABC.

Ivana Trump asserts that her new, younger appearance is due to a change in her 
makeup and hair, not a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
"No! No plastic surgery," the 39-year-old wife of tycoon Donald Trump told USA 
Today. "Why? Do I look like I've had plastic surgery?" 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, yes," USA Today wrote Thursday, noting that "wrinkles around the eyes 
and excess chin folds" were apparent in a 1988 photo but not in pictures taken 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Trump, president of the Plaza Hotel, said she merely "got rid of all my 
makeup. I gave it to my housekeeper. I went from reds to pinks, from rust to 
beige. I let my hair grow and I let it be straight." 
</P>

The former model also said workouts three mornings a week with a personal 
trainer has brought her weight down from 114 or 116 pounds to 110 pounds.

RANDY QUAID A HIT AS A NERD

<P>
Randy Quaid has excelled in such heavy dramas as "A Streetcar Named Desire" and 
"Of Mice and Men." But the actor says he has made his mark with audiences as 
the nerdy Eddie in "National Lampoon's Vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Quaid is back as Eddie, backwoods cousin to the character played by Chevy 
Chase, in "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation." 
</P>
<P>
"I did the first movie six or seven years ago, and I was amazed," Quaid said in 
a recent interview. "People still come up to me and quote lines from that part. 
I get a lot of recognition from that role -- probably as much, if not more, 
than any other." 
</P>
<P>
Quaid tackled mostly serious roles when he first got into movies and 
television. He received Emmy nominations for "Streetcar" and the miniseries 
"LBJ: The Early Years." 
</P>
<P>
But after appearing on "Saturday Night Live," Quaid followed with a string of 
light films, including "Parents," "Out Cold" and the upcoming "Quick Change."

The Flyers signed defenseman Mark Howe and left winger Derrick Smith to new 
contracts, with Howe's deal making him the highest-paid player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said he will earn $1.925 million for the next three years. He said he has 
a two-year contract with an option year that will pay him $1.7 million up front 
over the next three years, with the other money deferred. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Howe is the team's top-scoring defenseman this season with five goals and 14 
assists, and all-time with 129 goals and 307 points.

DUKE'S FASHIONABLE, FLASHY SPURRIER IS ON MANY WISH LISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY JENKINS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there is a rumor, Steve Spurrier is the subject of it. If there is a job, he 
is supposedly about to be offered it. Will he stay at Duke or will he go, and 
to where -- Atlanta, Phoenix, Florida? Spurrier has provoked a swirl of hearsay 
and speculation simply with the come-hither words, "I'll listen." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that every team in need of a fix has given Spurrier at least an 
admiring glance. "Even in Pop Warner," Duke quarterback Billy Ray said. Named 
the Atlantic Coast Conference coach of the year twice in a row, ambitious 
creator of an attention-getting offense, Spurrier has the unmistakable glint of 
success at Duke, rarely known for its football until his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far Spurrier has been formally contacted only by alma mater Florida, with 
another meeting scheduled with Gators representatives in two weeks. They had 
better hurry, because it appears several other teams may talk to him. The 
Atlanta Falcons seek a replacement for retired Marion Campbell, the Phoenix 
Cardinals for fired Gene Stallings, and Joe Walton is said to be on unsteady 
footing with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a position to listen if other teams or schools want to talk to me," 
Spurrier said. " . . . I'm the Duke coach until something changes. But if 
there's an opportunity to do something you think you want to do in life, you 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier said he is in no hurry to meet the Florida people again, and will not 
make any decisions until after he coaches Duke through its first bowl game 
since 1961, the All American against Texas Tech in Birmingham on Dec. 28. Of 
the other oft-mentioned potential job candidacies, he would only say: "There is 
a possibility I may talk to other people." 
</P>
<P>
So the Blue Devils must wait and watch. 
</P>
<P>
Duke Athletic Director Tom Butters has offered Spurrier a comprehensive 
financial package that would make him the highest-paid ACC coach, and clearly 
will not let him slip away for lack of effort. Spurrier is the flashiest, most 
fashionable thing in college football at the moment, and may very well have the 
substance to back up his growing reputation. In his three years as Duke's head 
coach, the Blue Devils have won 20 games; that is compared with the 13 they won 
in the four previous years before he assumed control of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier may deserve a higher salary by virtue of the fact that he embodies the 
three-fold duties of head coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. 
The offense was designed by him, and it has given the Blue Devils their first 
eight-win season and share of the ACC title since 1962. For the last three 
years, they have led the conference in total offense and passing. This season 
they set an all-time ACC record of 501.7 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
After starting 1-3, the Blue Devils won their last seven straight, including a 
21-17 upset of Clemson after trailing by 14-0 at halftime, a game that Spurrier 
had calculatedly told them they had only a "one-in-a-million chance of 
winning." They won their last six games by a margin of at least nine points. 
"We played better than we know how to really," Spurrier said. "But it wasn't 
any fluke either." 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier's offense is designed with one overriding intent: to gain as many 
yards as possible. All-American receiver Clarkston Hines has caught at least 
1,000 yards worth of passes for three years. "It's swift, it's intricate," 
Hines said. "We have people going all different places." It's also balanced: 
Randy Cuthbert this season became the Blue Devils' first 1,000-yard rusher 
since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (Spurrier) sees it," Ray said, "If we don't gain at least 400 yards, 
it looks bad on him." 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier naturally speaks to a player's mentality, as he has the distinction of 
being the only Heisman Trophy winner to hold an NCAA Division I head coach's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
He describes his offensive philosophy in typically casual terms. "If they've 
got eight or nine guys on the line, we'll throw. If they've got a lot of guys 
in the secondary, we'll run." When Ray faced third and long against Clemson, 
Ray said, "Coach, it's third and forever." Spurrier shrugged and said, "Just 
throw it as far as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier's entry into coaching was unplanned. He spent the uncertain year of 
1977 sitting in an armchair in Gainesville, Fla., watching football on 
television. His career as an NFL quarterback, with San Francisco for nine years 
and Tampa Bay for one, had ended. Doug Dickey, then the coach at Florida, 
offered him a job as an assistant, but Dickey was fired the next season. So 
Spurrier caught on with Pepper Rodgers at Georgia Tech, then Rodgers was fired 
a year later. So Spurrier went to Duke as an assistant and has remained save 
for his two years (1983-85) with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the USFL. 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier, unashamedly upwardly mobile, said the moves gave him a resume. 
"Looking back on it, that's what helped my career," he said. " . . . You 
actually need to move as an assistant coach. You develop a track record, people 
see how players played when you were there. . . . You learn things all the 
time. I'm still learning." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Spurrier will move is pure conjecture at this point. His ties to 
Florida are strong, and some Gators factions view the former quarterback who 
took them to the Sugar and Orange bowls as a uniting influence in the wake of a 
wide-ranging NCAA investigation. But reportedly Athletic Director Bill 
Arnsparger is among those who seem less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils and Gators must contend with Spurrier's obvious attractiveness 
to the NFL, and the fact that many say he does not care for the recruiting 
necessary in college coaching. In his two seasons with Tampa Bay, he amassed a 
record of 35-19 and went to the USFL playoffs twice. 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier has been candid with Duke players and officials about his intention to 
listen to other offers. When Florida Coach Galen Hall resigned in October, 
Spurrier told them not to be surprised if his name surfaced as a candidate. 
"They knew I'd be talking to people after the season," he said. "But I told 
them I'll coach them as hard as I can. It didn't bother us." 
</P>
<P>
So the Blue Devils have a certain realism. "He never promised to coach here for 
the rest of his life," one official said. Yet there is also a sentiment among 
them that if Spurrier does depart, they would rather see him take an NFL job 
than one at another college. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, it's a compliment. People are saying they respect his 
ability," Hines said.

MCCARRON SURPRISED RECORD HELD UP 15 YEARS

<P>
After hearing that Kent Desormeaux had broken his 15-year-old record of 546 
winning rides in one year, Chris McCarron sent a telegram congratulating the 
rider Marylanders know as "Superman" or "The Kid." 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me it lasted this long," McCarron said from Hollywood Park, where 
he is riding. "Nowadays you can ride seven days a week. The probability of it 
getting broken got greater each year. I'm proud it lasted this long." 
</P>
<P>
Then, obviously kidding, he said, "I'd like to borrow a quote from John Longden 
when (Bill) Shoemaker broke his record (of 6,000-plus career winners). 'I knew 
it must have taken a hell of a man to break it. Because it took a hell of a man 
to set it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago as McCarron waited to ride Sunday Silence to victory in the 
$3-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park in Florida, he relaxed and 
talked about Desormeaux, his apparent successor. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron took the record in stride in 1974 when he established it while riding 
at Laurel Race Course. But two years later he switched to Southern California, 
and he bought one of those "vanity" plates for his car with the legend "546 
WINS." 
</P>
<P>
The tags are not on one of his cars now, but they are among his trophies. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the record gave him a great deal of satisfaction through 
the years and that he, in the same manner as Desormeaux, had set it as a goal 
long before the big day. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Kinlaw, his agent, had said that Sandy Hawley's record of 515 winners set 
at Laurel the year before, 1973, was easily attainable with a little luck, no 
falls and some day-night riding. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron said he could relate to Desormeaux's drive to excel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy for him that he's going to break this record because he set a 
goal for himself a couple of years ago," McCarron said while he was at 
Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was there (in Maryland) visiting for one of the races, I asked him when 
he was going to move out of Maryland and he said, 'Not until I break your 
record,' so its been a goal of his for a couple of years now. 
</P>
<P>
"He's set his sights on it and he's worked very hard this year to get it and 
things have fallen in place for him. I'm really very happy for him that he's 
going to accomplish it." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron had excelled in Maryland, just as Desormeaux has, but he learned much 
more when invading California, and he thinks Desormeaux can also improve when 
he makes the inevitable move.

"I'm very impressed with his style of riding," McCarron said. "He gets a lot of 
run out of horses. He's a good, strong finisher, has a very aggressive style. 
He likes to ride a (rival) horse very close, but he knows when to cross and 
when not to cross the fine line."

TROUBLED TICKETS: Even as the scandal over Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan seemed ready to claim another victim -- embattled thrift regulator M. 
Danny Wall (D1) -- a House committee disclosed that Charles H. Keating Jr., the 
Arizona financier who controlled Lincoln's parent firm, bought $750,000 in 
Phoenix Cardinals football tickets with Lincoln's funds. . . . This drew a 
sarcastic comment from Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), who led hearings into 
the Lincoln controversy: "We now add professional football tickets to junk 
bonds, speculative land deals and luxury hotels as favorites on the Keating 
list of recommended investments." A Keating aide called the tickets a 
"marketing tool." Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky

PANEL REBUKES NEWPORT JUDGE FOR FAVORITISM

<P>
Calvin P. Schmidt, Orange County's longest-sitting judge, was publicly scolded 
by state judicial authorities Thursday for giving preferential treatment to a 
wealthy friend's stepdaughter and making improper campaign contributions. But 
he was cleared of doing legal favors for a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the Commission on Judicial Performance appeared to mark the close 
of the sex and influence scandal that has embroiled several judges for more 
than two years at Harbor Municipal Court in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In sharply worded criticism, the San Francisco-based judicial watchdog agency 
announced that Municipal Judge Schmidt, 59, had "undermined public 
</P>
<P>
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the judges -- Schmidt and Municipal Court Judge Brian R. Carter -- 
were targeted in formal disciplinary proceedings. Similar allegations against 
Carter, 63, were dropped by the commission after he retired from the bench in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt hailed his vindication on some of the allegations and said that 
contrary to a news report, he has no plans to retire. His current six-year term 
ends in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"This exoneration by my judicial peers ends what has been for me the most 
painful time both professionally and personally in my 23-year career as a judge 
and community servant," he said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt's lawyer, H. Warren Siegel, said the scandal was "a real trauma" for 
Schmidt because he is "a man dedicated to his community." He is active in the 
charitable organizations of Hoag Hospital and the Newport Beach Chamber of 
Commerce. He is also national director of the Girl Scouts of America. 
</P>
<P>
In its action against Schmidt, the commission chose what is considered to be 
one of the mildest forms of discipline it has available. It declined several 
tougher punishments, including recommendations that the state Supreme Court 
censure the judge, remove him from office or disbar him. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Atty. Gen. Roy Hewitt, who presented the case to the commission, 
said the action still carries a strong message. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is clear that some of his conduct is not to be condoned or 
practiced by other judges," Hewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the public can be assured it may trust Schmidt's integrity, Peter 
Gubbins, the commission's investigating attorney on the case, would only say, 
"I think the public can have confidence that the system as a whole works 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn A. Mahler, presiding judge of Harbor Municipal Court, praised Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
During his years of judicial service at the Harbor Municipal Court, Schmidt has 
gained "an outstanding reputation with the legal community as a fair and honest 
jurist," Mahler said. "We are pleased that Judge Schmidt will continue as a 
judge of the Harbor Municipal Court and as the senior judge in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the commission's two-page ruling dealt with the way Schmidt handled the 
1988 case of Terri Ann McMullen, stepdaughter of longtime friend Robert 
Guggenheim of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen, 28, was arrested twice on cocaine charges. Twice Schmidt called 
detention officials and ordered her freed on her own recognizance, despite 
another judge's order that she be held on bond and despite her failure to 
appear in court between her first and second arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"The obvious and sole reason for Judge Schmidt's actions was his friendship 
with McMullen's stepfather," the commission wrote. "Judge Schmidt's 
(recognizance) releases of McMullen were arbitrary and capricious exercises of 
(his) judicial discretion and undermined public confidence in the integrity and 
impartiality of the judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
The commission found that Schmidt acted "in patent violation" of the judicial 
canon of ethics when he contributed money from his own campaign to candidates 
for political office, including former Democratic state Sen. Paul Carpenter of 
Cypress. The judicial canon of ethics limits the amount a judge may contribute 
to political candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, however, found no evidence to support the allegation that Schmidt 
offered to reinstate the driver's license of convicted prostitute Della 
Christine Johnson in 1984 in exchange for a promise of sex. She told police 
that Carter called her later and collected on that promise by having sex with 
her, an allegation Carter denies. But the commission said it heard no evidence 
on the alleged exchange of sexual favors and determined that the "case 
disposition was not unusual." 
</P>
<P>
The commission also rejected an accusation that Schmidt intervened on behalf of 
a friend whose marriage ceremony he had performed, using his influence to help 
the friend obtain a plea bargain in a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Public criticism was added to the commission's array of disciplinary 
possibilities this year under a constitutional amendment. Reprovals, which rank 
in severity between private admonishments and public censures, have been given 
to two judges so far, including Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he still believes that based on the information he had on 
McMullen, he acted in good faith when he released her. But he added that he 
"accepts the commission's finding that my decision might have given the public 
the impression of a lack of impartiality on my part." 
</P>
<P>
The judge he said accepts the commission's findings on his political 
contributors but said he still believes he acted legally and "did not knowingly 
violate" judicial ethics.

ORANGE COUNTY GETS FIRST DOSE OF MEDFLY SPRAY 
</P>

<P>
Hundreds of gallons of a sticky, semi-sweet mixture began raining down on North 
County streets Thursday night as state agricultural officials sought to wipe 
out the destructive Mediterranean fruit fly with the first aerial pesticide 
spraying in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
Despite early concerns that recent Santa Ana winds might jeopardize the mission 
by scattering the pesticide, helicopter pilots left El Monte Municipal Airport 
as planned at 9:05. They then began to spray an estimated 550 gallons of a 
malathion mix over about 30,000 to 40,000 homes and businesses in a 
10-square-mile area of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Agricultural Commissioner James Harnett, reviewing the scene in 
El Monte as two specially equipped Bell 204 helicopters took off, said: 
"Perfect; it's going just the way we planned it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We hope (the Medflies) will be enticed by the bait, eat it, keel over and 
die." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those living in the spray zone appeared to heed the advice of 
agriculture officials and stayed inside their homes. But a few, such as Raul 
Luna of Fullerton, ventured outside to watch the helicopters cruising at about 
500 feet overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable," Luna said as he sat on his front porch with his children. 
"It's unreal when you see this stuff on TV, but now it's our place." 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly's rapid spread in the Los Angeles Basin in recent weeks has 
threatened a repeat of the devastation that racked the state's 
$16-billion-a-year agriculture industry in 1981. The insect, originally from 
West Africa, burrows into more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables, 
rendering them unsalable. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, its emergence in Orange County has been limited to the find of 
a single pregnant fly in Brea two weeks ago. And agriculture officials hope 
that, if no more flies appear, the spraying Thursday will be the last for the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
While many North County residents seemed concerned about the health effects of 
the pesticide mixture, it was the specific task of covering cars that dominated 
their last-minute preparations on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
State officials assert that the mixture -- three parts protein fly bait and one 
part malathion pesticide -- poses no significant health hazard to humans. But 
they did warn residents to cover their automobiles during spraying to prevent 
possible discoloring from the chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"All this for one fly," complained Jim Gomez of La Habra, as he taped clear 
plastic sheets over his silver Toyota truck and a 25-foot trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Brea, Gene and Rose Amaral were puzzling over what to do about 
the eight cars parked in their driveway and yard. With only two tarpaulins on 
hand, they went to a nearby hardware store to buy some more. 
</P>
<P>
But like other last-minute shoppers, they discovered that the store was sold 
out of tarps, overrun by local residents who also needed something to cover 
cars and outdoor items such as patio furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"They started lining up early (Thursday) morning," said John Hutcherson, a 
salesman at Cannings' hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Pack, of Seal Beach, saw the spraying as a chance to make a buck. By 
Thursday evening, he said, he had sold several hundred car covers at $5.99 a 
crack from four street-corner locations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But Pack wasn't sticking around for the malathion shower. "When I hear the 
choppers come," said Pack, "I leave." 
</P>
<P>
Those who weren't able to find car covers on Thursday might not have much 
better luck today finding a place to get the pesticide mix washed off. 
</P>
<P>
"Judging by the number of calls we've been getting, I suspect they'll be lined 
up down the street and around the corner to boot," said La Habra carwash owner 
Robin Deal. 
</P>
<P>
With the spraying expected to be completed by early today, the waiting now 
begins: It will be four to five months -- or three generational cycles of the 
yellow and black flies -- before agriculture specialists know if the operation 
was successful. 
</P>
<P>
"The proof of the spraying will be finding no more flies," said Frank Parsons, 
chief deputy agricultural commissioner for Orange County. "If no more show up 
(within five months), we can assume they've been eradicated." 
</P>
<P>
County technicians will continue to routinely check the 1,500 Medfly traps set 
up in the North County region for any sign of the pest's return. If any more 
fertile flies do emerge, agriculture officials say, the area will have to be 
sprayed again. 
</P>
<P>
That is because a shortage of sterile Medflies -- sometimes released by the 
millions to try to kill off a population by slowing reproduction -- has 
eliminated that option. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated sprayings in the Los Angeles area have spurred some protests from 
residents and elected officials, who question the need for continued 
applications of malathion and challenge the government's assertion that the 
pesticide is incapable of hurting anything more than a fly. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the spraying process has been almost routine for many residents 
elsewhere around the Southland: 
</P>
<P>
Since August, state officials have had to conduct 10 different sprayings in 
East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt 
to spread the worst outbreak of Medflies ever seen in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until Nov. 17 that the bug surfaced in Orange County, with the 
discovery of a pregnant Medfly in a 15-foot-high guava tree in Brea. 
Agriculture officials believe that the transportation of home-grown fruit out 
of quarantined areas, along with strong Santa Ana winds, aided the infestation 
area's rapid growth around the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, residents in the 10-square-mile spray target area, immediately 
surrounding the spot where the Brea fly was found, became the first in Orange 
County to undergo the process, causing more than a few jitters in the area. 
</P>
<P>
State officials blanketed the affected North County neighborhoods earlier this 
week with flyers asserting the safety of the pesticide and telling people what 
precautions to take, such as staying indoors and covering cars. 
</P>
<P>
But the hundreds of calls that flooded the county's "Medfly hot line" this week 
-- there were more than 300 by 5 p.m. Thursday alone -- were a clear sign that 
many were still on edge. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new experience for us -- we've never been through it before, and 
there's some concern about that," Brea Mayor Gene A. Leyton, who lives in the 
spray area, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like the idea of chemicals being dropped over our neighborhoods -- 
who knows whether they're going to find out in 20 years that this stuff is bad 
for us?" Leyton said. "But the alternative -- the destruction of the state's 
agriculture -- isn't very good either, so what can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Many callers from outside the spray area telephoned a county hot line to 
express concern over hearing the helicopters overhead. Operators assured them 
that the helicopters needed to fly beyond the spray zone to turn around but 
always stopped releasing chemicals at the borders. "They're very accurate," 
said operator Rick Kinsella. 
</P>
<P>
One self-styled environmental activist group called the Green Party had planned 
a protest in Brea during Thursday's spraying, but it was scrubbed when only two 
members of the group showed up. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Jim Carlton, Mary Lou Fulton, Matt Lait, Lisa Mascaro and 
Tom McQueeney contributed to this report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THURSDAY'S MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
<P>
ABOUT THE SPRAYING: 
</P>
<P>
No repeat spray application has been planned at this time. Officials will 
continue to monitor the 1,500 traps distributed over an 81-square-mile area 
that includes that spray zone plus surrounding area. If additional flies are 
found, a second spray would be possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly hot line in the county Agricultural Commission office will be open 
from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. for residents with questions. The number is (714) 
447-7118. The hot line will be shut down after Friday. Inquiries after that can 
be made to the agricultural commissioner's office at (714) 447-7100. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered new tests of 
malathion, state officials assert that it is "one of the safest insecticides in 
use today." State officials say that the doses used in aerial spraying pose no 
health threat to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THE SPRAYING: 
</P>
<P>
All patio furniture, play equipment, tools and household items left outdoors 
during the spraying should be hosed down. Cars should be washed with soap and 
water.

COURTS, PARENTS CALLED TOO SOFT ON DELINQUENTS

<P>
After three years and $735,000, the state Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem has 
braved lampooning in "Doonesbury"and persistent snickering around the Capitol 
to come to an old-fashioned conclusion: Spare the rod, spoil the child. 
</P>
<P>
In a draft of its final report, to be released in January, the task force 
concludes that the California juvenile justice system has contributed to low 
self-esteem and a high crime rate by being too easy on delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
While California imposes some of the nation's harshest jail sentences on 
budding criminals, it is still too soft and has "neglected the offender's need 
to accept responsibility for his or her choices and behavior," says the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"When a youthful offender gets arrested for a relatively minor crime, such as 
petty theft or vandalism, penalties are almost never imposed. The child is 
counseled . . . or merely sent home to his or her parents," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
"The message that the system gives this youngster is that society is not really 
serious about expecting people to obey the law, and that very little, if 
anything, happens when a juvenile breaks the law. . . . As a result, today's 
juvenile justice system inadvertently encourages some youthful offenders to 
continue criminal behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The answer, the report says, is to get tough from the very beginning and 
"attach a reasonable sanction to every criminal act, regardless of how minor." 
Forcing a rookie criminal to face the consequences would make him accountable 
and, thus, enhance his self-esteem, the report suggests. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-line advice is perhaps the biggest surprise in the proposed final 
report, circulated and discussed at a meeting Monday of the California Task 
Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Task force members also pointed out that their report concludes -- albeit 
indirectly -- that Californians need to become more effective parents, and 
suggests that classes in child-rearing be part of the public school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
The report culminates three years of hearings and discussions by the 25-member 
panel. A number of the members are proponents of the "human potential 
movement," which started work in 1987 to explore the suspected link between low 
self-esteem and social ills such as substance abuse, teen-age pregnancies, 
school drop-outs, gang violence and the poverty cycle. 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), the state 
effort has been ridiculed around the country as a California classic: a 
touchy-feely "New Age" effort to grapple with some of society's most endemic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The most persistent lampooning came in a series of "Doonesbury" comic strips, 
in which cartoonist Garry Trudeau chronicled the imaginary task force 
appointment of actress and out-of-body traveler Barbara Ann (Boopsie) 
Boopstein. 
</P>
<P>
But Vasconcellos, who concedes his task force was first received as a "flaky" 
effort, said Thursday that the laughter has died amid a wide-spread 
appreciation for the state's landmark investigation into self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
As proof, Vasconcellos said that 46 of the state's 58 counties now have similar 
self-esteem task forces; state government and citizen groups in New Mexico, 
Florida, Colorado, Virginia and Washington also are establishing such panels. 
</P>
<P>
"What's emerged that I didn't foresee is the enormous readiness of many, many 
people to give this serious attention," said Vasconcellos, who emphasized that 
the panel included traditional conservatives as well as members of the "human 
potential movement." 
</P>
<P>
Another task force member, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. Raymond Gott, 
said he was satisfied with the report's recommendation to get tough with 
juvenile offenders, a view he cultivated among his colleagues by recounting the 
failures of the court system. 
</P>
<P>
"I cranked a little real world in there, didn't I?" asked Gott, head of the 
Sheriff's Department's anti-gang units. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time a kid crosses the line and violates the law, he or she should have 
to pay a price," he said.

LAW: A 'DEPUTY' CUT INTO BOB VINCENT'S CHRISTMAS TREE SALES IN DANA POINT. AN

Start with an old law everyone ignores, add a mystery man masquerading as a 
deputy, throw in a few Douglas firs and what you have is a plot befitting a 
detective novel. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the way Bob Vincent sees it. And all over a few Christmas 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
It all started last week when Vincent, an entrepreneur from Portland, Ore., 
staked out ground at the corner of Del Prado Avenue and Street of the Golden 
Lantern to sell his bright-green Douglas firs. 
</P>
<P>
A bit early, maybe, but Vincent has been selling trees at the Dana Point 
location for the past four years, and business has been good. And no one, let 
alone the police, has ever protested. 
</P>
<P>
But last Saturday all that changed when a man, dressed in the uniform of an 
Orange County Sheriff's deputy, paid him a visit and ordered him to shut his 
business. The deputy cited an rdinance prohibiting the sale of trees before 
Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to set up and sell Christmas trees on the Fourth of July, 
if you were stupid enough to do that," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem, according to police, was that the uniformed man was no deputy 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't anyone from our department," said Lt. Dan Martini, speaking on 
behalf of the department, which provides police coverage for Dana Point. "This 
isn't a case of the deputy who stole Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
If he wasn't a deputy, then who was he? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent isn't sure, but he speculates that some of his competitors may be out 
to get him. Vincent said that a competitor, angry over the Del Prado Avenue 
lot's early start, confronted him earlier this week and threatened to have his 
permit revoked for the entire holiday season if he didn't close. The competitor 
would not identify himself, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, city officials said no complaint had been filed against 
Vincent, but conceded that there were grounds for legal action. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that when the city was incorporated last year, Dana Point adopted a 
set of county laws, including an obscure one that prohibits the sale of 
Christmas trees before Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Vincent's case was the first time they had heard of the 
ordinance and added that it was unlikely it would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to rush back from my home this weekend to place a stop-work 
order on these guys," said Ed Knight, city director of community development. 
"We'll probably revoke this section by next year so we don't run into the 
problem again." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, meanwhile, said he plans to reopen his tree lot today, -- with or 
without the law on his side.

DIANNE KLEIN: MARRIAGE WILL SURVIVE, EVEN IF IRONMAN COMES CALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickie Shapiro, a marriage, family and child therapist, gave me a call after 
reading my column about my husband's transformation from exercise dilettante to 
bicycling maniac. 
</P>
<P>
Mickie, who also teaches sports psychology at UC Irvine, has been there. Oh, 
the stories she could tell, about herself, her friends and her clients. 
</P>
<P>
Spouse A gets fed up with the usual work-eat-TV-sleep routine and starts 
exercising, vigorously. Spouse B, who thought things were fine just as they 
were, can't relate. 
</P>
<P>
Spouse B begins to resent all the time that Spouse A spends exercising, away 
from home and with God-only-knows whom. 
</P>
<P>
Then Spouse A starts saying things like: "If you'd start exercising yourself, 
you'd feel better and look better, too. I know I feel great." 
</P>
<P>
This is a couple in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"So you think my marriage is on the rocks?" I ask Mickie. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," she says. "I thought you sounded very supportive." 
</P>
<P>
I liked this woman immediately. Boy, did she have me down. Supportive, loving . 
. . I could go on. 
</P>
<P>
So I went to see Mickie at her home in Costa Mesa. I figured, what the heck, 
even an obviously well-adjusted person such as myself could use a couple of 
pointers now and then. 
</P>
<P>
Then when Mickie came to the door, something else popped into my mind. When we 
had talked on the phone, she'd mentioned something about having just competed 
in "Ironman." The truth was I had no idea what she had been talking about. 
</P>
<P>
I was ready to guess that Ironman was a new Saturday morning cartoon show 
before Mickie explained that it was a triathlon, essentially the athletic 
equivalent of taking the SAT, GRE and the bar exam back-to-back, for fun. 
</P>
<P>
All of this began to sink in when Mickie, 53, mother of four, greeted me at her 
front door. Jane Fonda should look this good. I wondered if Mickie's lack of 
superfluous padding made it difficult for her to sit for long distances. 
</P>
<P>
Let me tell you, exactly, what Ironman is so that you can better picture what 
I'm talking about. 
</P>
<P>
There are five of these triathlons in the world, in Japan, Canada, New Zealand, 
Germany and in Kona, Hawaii, the most rigorous of the bunch. That's where 
Mickie went, one of 1,250 lucky winners of previous competitions. 
</P>
<P>
It took her 14 hours and 45 minutes to swim 2.4 miles in the ocean, (they do 
that first so they don't drown), then pedal 112 miles on a bike and then run a 
marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"But it flows," she tells me. "It just goes. It's like the SAT. You get 
yourself prepared and you just do it." 
</P>
<P>
OK, by this time I must have had a look on my face or something. Mickie looks 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw it, I thought it was ridiculous, crazy," she says. "I thought 
who would ever do that?" 
</P>
<P>
Exactly, Mickie. 
</P>
<P>
So this is my opening. I ask about the state of her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Mickie, a woman who was raised for marriage and motherhood, says she is happily 
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
She has analyzed the reasons for this, of course, and concluded that her love 
of athletics, dawning almost by accident at the age of 40, is directly 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Running made her feel alive, invigorated. She gained confidence and made new 
friends. She entered competitions and came out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't like her husband opposed all this, she says. Fact is he was too 
supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt real intrusive to me," Mickie says. "It was like he was making my 
accomplishments his own." 
</P>
<P>
Then she says her husband tried a little different approach. He started 
running, around the neighborhood, on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"But he was jogging," Mickie says. "He wasn't racing." 
</P>
<P>
So at this point in our conversation, I'm beginning to think about what Mickie 
had told me earlier. "Supportive," she had called me, and I, naively, had 
thought that was probably a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you wouldn't counsel someone like me to hop on a bike next to her 
husband?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," she says in a reassuringly emphatic tone. "He needs his own thing." 
</P>
<P>
I knew that, of course. I was just testing. Now I'm beginning to feel good 
about our talk. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is that you have two equal partners," Mickie goes on. "Each 
partner should have their own interests, but at the same time they should be 
able to communicate with each other, share with each other. . . . The whole 
thing I preach is balance." Balance. Right. That sounds eminently reasonable. 
But then visions of Ironman pop into my head again. I give Mickie another look. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not possible to be a triathlete and have balance," she says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Right. I knew that. I may be supportive, but I'm not crazy. 
</P>

NO MURDER CHARGE FOR TEEN MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old honors student whose newborn drowned in a high school toilet will 
not be charged with murder, authorities said Thursday. Vietnamese community 
leaders said she should not be prosecuted at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Santiago High School sophomore was released from police custody Thursday, 
but remained hospitalized at UCI Medical Center in Orange, where she was 
reported in good condition Thursday night, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley said that prosecutors, while 
ruling out murder charges, have not decided whether to press involuntary 
manslaughter or child endangerment charges, or bring no charges at all. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a real agonizing case for everyone," Conley said. As head of the 
juvenile unit, he must personally decide whether to prosecute, and said it is 
one of the toughest cases he has faced in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Unwed mothers are viewed with disfavor in the Vietnamese culture, and unwed 
Vietnamese-American girls who become pregnant are usually rejected by their 
mortified parents and often thrown out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it goes to court, it'll ruin her life for good," said Dr. Co Dang Long 
Pham, a Westminster obstetrician. 
</P>
<P>
The young mother had concealed her pregnancy from her parents, and the school 
guidance counselor and classmates who knew of her condition believed she was 
only a few months' pregnant until Tuesday, when she delivered the full-term, 
6-pound boy in a girls' restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary autopsy reports show the child was apparently delivered into the 
toilet, where he drowned. However, authorities say they found no evidence that 
she deliberately drowned the child. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel she shouldn't be charged," said Mai Cong, chairman of the Vietnamese 
Community Social Service Center. "She should have been referred while she was 
pregnant for crisis intervention." 
</P>
<P>
Cong said fellow Vietnamese she has spoken with generally feel sorry for the 
girl and her family. Police and local newspapers have withheld the girl's 
identity, and since her last name is a common one, Cong said there is still 
hope that she can remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Conley said that lesser charges might be filed if prosecutors determine that 
the killing, while not intentional, was the result of criminal neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what a reasonable person would do in the circumstances," Conley said. 
"You have to look at the fact that she's 15. If she had been an OB-GYN 
(obstetrics and gynecology) nurse aged 26 and the exact same facts, you'd look 
at it differently." 
</P>
<P>
Conley said that prosecutors may not judge the girl by a gentler legal standard 
because of Vietnamese cultural factors, but will take into account her age and 
her reluctance to confess her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't blind ourselves to any set of facts and pretend they don't exist," 
Conley said. "On the other hand, there's only one penal code." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Pham said that even lesser charges are inappropriate, given the girl's lack 
of medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
"If she knows she will be due that day, and she doesn't go to the hospital, and 
the baby dies, that's child endangerment," he said. "She doesn't know when 
she'll have the baby. She went to the restroom, she had the baby in the toilet 
and the baby drowns. That's not manslaughter, either. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Her life is maybe already ruined," Pham said. "To charge her, it's the coup de 
grace." 
</P>
<P>
The baby's father, also a Vietnamese-American high school student, has been 
interviewed by police but does not face charges. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the girl lost a great deal of blood. Conley would not comment on 
whether she was in shock during or after the birth, but said that would also be 
a factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs said police were obliged to release the 
girl Thursday afternoon, despite fears that she might run away, because no 
charges have been filed against her. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said the girl was technically released into the custody of her parents, 
but the county Department of Social Services has assigned a social worker to 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
"In a case like this, DSS will take over and watch over the kid for her 
welfare," Gibbs said. A department official declined to comment on what 
arrangements would be made.

CITY OKS 64% HIKE IN DEVELOPER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a 64% hike in developers' fees 
to pay for construction of the Eastern Transportation Corridor tollway. 
</P>
<P>
The increase is on the amount developers pay per home. Two-thirds of the cities 
represented on the county's tollway agencies must approve the higher developer 
fees for them to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill/Eastern and San Joaquin transportation corridor agencies have 
asked the cities to approve the fee increase to help offset the escalating cost 
of constructing the three new tollways. 
</P>
<P>
"The developers will just add this fee to the cost of homes, so the buyers 
eventually pay," Councilman William Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Fees for houses east of the corridor would rise to $2,327 per single-family 
home. For those west of the corridor, fees would be $1,655, according to a 
tollway agency report. 
</P>
<P>
A higher fee is levied on homes east of the corridor because development there 
will create most of the traffic the new tollway is designed to handle, said 
Orange city engineer Gary Johnson.

OLD TOWN IS NEW TOURIST ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE BEL BRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What was the center of James Irvine's ranching and farming operations nearly 
100 years ago exists today in the form of the town's biggest tourist attraction 
-- Old Town Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Irvine Co. and several other partners broke ground on a project 
that would transform many of the city's historic buildings into a commercial 
and retail center. 
</P>
<P>
Located near the intersection of Sand Canyon Road and the Santa Ana Freeway, 
Old Town attracts thousands of visitors a year, mostly travelers going to and 
from Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But for many local residents, Old Town is a living link to the past. Such is 
the case with the Irvine Historical Society's Judy Liebeck, who has worked to 
preserve and save many of the old city landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Town Irvine is a wonderful place to spend the day and walk around," said 
Liebeck. "It is one of the last remnants around that proves to Irvine residents 
that this city has a past to it." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Ranch, formed by the Irvine family from large Spanish land grants in 
the 19th Century, raised lima beans and cattle. James Irvine is said to have 
introduced lima beans to Orange County in the early 1900s. Until the federal 
government bought the 20,000 acres that is now El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, the Irvine Ranch was the world's largest producer of lima beans, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The society also operates the Irvine Historical Museum, just outside of the Old 
Town complex. Open from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Tuesdays and Sundays, the museum 
features pictures and actual artifacts of the Irvine Ranch. The current exhibit 
is on the lima bean operations of the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of old towns in California that preserve everything, which is 
something they didn't do in Irvine," she said. "Instead, most of the buildings 
dating back to the glory days of the Irvine Ranch have been converted into 
offices and restaurants -- but at least they are saved for future generations 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
Among the converted buildings is a two -- story general store built in 1911; a 
two-story hotel built in 1913; a one-story house built in 1915 as the home of 
the ranch foreman; a blacksmith shop and a silo and granary built in 1947. 
Several of the buildings, some of which had been moved to the seven-acre 
complex from other parts of the city, are listed in the National Register of 
Historical Places. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the collection of shops and restaurants is a good place to entertain 
friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in a lot of other Orange County cities, and it becomes repetitious 
taking visitors around the corner to a place that they probably have where they 
live," said Barbara Ellingsworth an Irvine resident who brought relatives from 
New Jersey to dine. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of unusual, something that makes going out to eat more memorable 
than going around the corner." JOE BEL BRUNO

AILING GIRL'S PALS, TOWN PITCH IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noemi Serrano laughs and smiles, exuberant in her youth, optimistic even in the 
face of illness. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost Christmas, she says, a time to be thankful for the family and the 
gift of life. But doctors say the 18-year-old Buena Park resident is in 
desperate need of a heart and lung transplant, and her friends have rallied 
around her in a drive to raise enough money to make sure that finances do not 
stand in her way. 
</P>
<P>
Diagnosed as having pulmonary hypertension, Noemi first noticed the symptoms in 
1987 while visiting relatives in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't walk around and do things like everyone else. At first I 
thought that I was just lazy, and then I remembered that a few months before 
that I was getting really tired in physical education and when I walked to 
school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Taken to a cardiologist in Mexico by her grandfather, she learned that there 
was a problem with her heart. Her family immediately returned to California and 
took her to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where doctors confirmed that her 
blood pressure was dangerously high and that she needed a heart and lung 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University and UCLA will place Serrano on the waiting list for a 
suitable transplant if she can raise $25,000 toward the estimated $100,000 cost 
of the surgery. The remainder will be paid off in installments. 
</P>
<P>
The Buena Park Firemen's Assn. has started a trust fund in the amount of $5,000 
and is urging residents to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Living in a modest home with her mother and father, the oldest of four brothers 
and two sisters, Serrano says her days consist of doing her home studies and 
watching television. Because of all the time she missed in school because of 
her illness, Serrano was unable to graduate with her class at Buena Park High 
School in June but hopes to finish in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Noemi's mother, Soledad, speaks no English but said through an interpreter that 
"the hardest part of the situation is when Noemi has to be hospitalized." The 
latest hospitalization came earlier this week when her blood pressure dropped 
far below normal. 
</P>
<P>
Friends drop by once in a while to visit, but Noemi notes that it is hard for 
them to see her ill. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems so difficult that this should be happening to someone they know," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Noemi plans to do when she gets healthy again -- and she has no 
doubt that she will -- is to "go back to Mexico and finish that vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Donations can be made by sending checks payable to the Noemi Serrano 
Trust/BPFA, Buena Park Credit Union, 6650 Beach Blvd., Buena Park, Calif., 
90620. -- DEBORAH CARPENTIER

BOY, 9, KILLED, 2 HURT IN SPORTS CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 9-year-old boy was killed and two teen-agers were critically injured Thursday 
night when their car hit a fire hydrant and then crashed into a light pole, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 6:37 p.m. at the intersection of Rolling Hills Drive 
and Brea Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police said the boy, whose name was not immediately available, was 
killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was identified as an 18-year-old man, and the second passenger as a 
19-year-old woman, both of whom were rushed to UCI Medical Center in Orange, 
where they were listed in serious to critical condition late Thursday. Their 
identities also were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Police said none were wearing seat belts and that all three were crowded into 
the front of the two-seat vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the Pontiac Fiero, driven by the man, was traveling 
faster than 50 m.p.h. in a 35-m.p.h. zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit a dip in the road," Fullerton Police Sgt. Steve Matson said of the 
small, low-slung sports car. The vehicle "went end over end into a fire hydrant 
and then it collided with a light pole, splitting the car in half." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether the people in the car lived in the area or 
were familiar with the abrupt dip in the road. "Everyone who lives around here 
knows about" the dip, Matson said. 
</P>
<P>
As Fullerton paramedics used the jaws of life to get to the injured couple, 
water gushed from the fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who was sitting with the 9-year-old in the car's passenger seat, was 
taken by helicopter to the medical center. She was listed in critical 
condition, Matson said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, who was taken by ambulance to the same hospital, was listed in 
serious condition.

ANIMAL-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS LOCK HORNS WITH HUNTERS AT PARTY

A black-tie banquet for big-game stalkers at the Four Seasons Hotel turned ugly 
Thursday night when hunters ripped up a banner carried by animal-rights 
activists and physically threw them out of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A small scuffle ensued as some guests dressed in tuxedos threw their drinks on 
some of the 11 animal-rights activists who had infiltrated the "Big Game Trophy 
Banquet" to protest the killing of animals. The banquet is an annual event 
hosted by the Roy E. Weatherby Foundation of South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured and no arrests were made, although police were summoned to 
break up the disturbance at the ceremony, where Jack Youngblood, a former Los 
Angeles Rams player, was scheduled to present awards. 
</P>
<P>
Ava Park, founder of the Costa Mesa-based Orange County People for Animals, 
said her members had carefully mapped out the hotel during the last week to 
ensure access for the activists who had not made dinner reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Making an entryway into the hotel through a side door, Park and other activists 
quietly entered the banquet room undetected since they too wore tuxedos, 
business suits and evening dresses. 
</P>
<P>
With stuffed animals in the background, about five female activists held aloft 
a banner declaring "Hunting -- Killing for the Fun of It." 
</P>
<P>
Taken by surprise, about four hunters ran to the protesters and quickly ripped 
up the sign. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Carone, a member of Los Angeles-based Last Chance for Animals, sought to 
present the group's own award -- that of "Coward of the Year Award." The award 
stemmed from what the activists said was the killing of defenseless animals by 
hunters with high-powered rifles and other technological advantages. 
</P>
<P>
But a few more hunters surrounded Carone. As they ripped up the certificate, at 
least two guests threw their drinks on him as he was shoved him out of the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
As the activists were jostled out of the hotel by guests and hotel security, 
they yelled chants of "Cowards, Cowards!" at the hunters. Some of the hunters 
responded by swearing and screaming at them to "get out." An unidentified guest 
spat in the face of activist Mary McDonald-Lewis as she was led outside. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm scarred for life," joked McDonald-Lewis a few minutes later. "Now I 
have to go home and scour my face." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach police who were summoned to the hotel told about four activists 
that they should leave peacefully or face trespassing charges. The activists 
opted to leave.

REDUCED AWARD AGAINST THE KRISHNAS UPHELD 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court, acting in a bitter, 12-year battle over religious 
practices, on Thursday let stand an appellate ruling that sharply reduced a 
multimillion-dollar award against the Hare Krishnas and rejected charges that 
the group had "brainwashed" an Orange County girl when she was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
The justices refused to hear an appeal by Robin George and her mother 
contending that there was ample evidence that George had been deceived and 
coerced into leaving home and joining the group at age 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Georges also sought to reinstate the original $32-million jury verdict 
against the Krishnas in 1983 that was reduced first by a trial judge to $9.7 
million and then cut to $2.9 million last August by a state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
However, at the same time, the high court also refused to hear a separate 
appeal by the Hare Krishnas, arguing that even the reduced award should be 
overturned as a "gross and irreparable injustice" that undermined their 
constitutional right to freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action came in a brief order signed by Chief Justice Malcolm M. 
Lucas that, while leaving the appellate decision binding on the parties in the 
case, barred that ruling from being used as a precedent in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
Alan G. Martin of Beverly Hills, an attorney for the International Society for 
Krishna Consciousness, said there was "a pretty good chance" that the group 
will now ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its contentions that the award 
violated First Amendment guarantees of religious liberty. 
</P>
<P>
While pleased that the Georges' appeal was rejected, Martin expressed concern 
that even the reduced $2.9-million award would have "a very dramatic" adverse 
effect on the group's activities. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Niddrie of San Diego, an attorney for the Georges, expressed 
disappointment that the high court allowed the appellate decision to stand. 
</P>
<P>
"The implication is that a prior member of these organizations cannot collect 
for false imprisonment and emotional distress," Niddrie said. "I'm troubled 
that a 14-year-old girl was deemed to somehow have consented to what happened 
to her in this case. . . . The (reduced) award is insufficient in that it 
doesn't compensate Robin for what happened to her." 
</P>
<P>
Robin George -- who is now married and goes by the name of Robin George 
Westerkamp -- also expressed mixed feelings about the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certainly glad the award was not reduced further, but I don't think the 
court went far enough," she said. "The evidence we presented showed that 
without a doubt, I was completely brainwashed and the things that I did are not 
things I would do in my 'right' mind. They (Krishnas) used their influence to 
manipulate people." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, an interior designer who will say only -- out of fear of retribution 
from the Krishnas -- that she lives in northern Orange County, said she was 
disappointed that the case cannot be used as a legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
She contended that the Hare Krishnas prey on minors. "The only way I came to my 
senses was that my parents were able to get me out of it and away long enough 
that I could think for myself again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was brought in 1977 by the family, claiming that the group had 
brainwashed the teen-ager into joining the movement and then conspired to 
conceal her from her parents. 
</P>
<P>
The Georges said that in 1974, Robin George had begun braiding her hair and 
wearing a sari to school and had constructed a Hindu-style altar in her 
bedroom, arising each day at 2:30 a.m. to pray and chant. Later, after her 
parents objected, the girl was told by a Krishna official that she must leave 
home and live in a temple if she were sincere about her belief, the suit 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving and spending most of a year in Krishna temples in New Orleans and 
Ottawa, Canada, Robin returned home. Four months later, her father, James 
George, died of a heart attack that the suit claimed was brought about by 
stress over the affair. 
</P>
<P>
After a five-month trial, an Orange County Superior Court jury upheld the 
family's wide-ranging legal claims and returned the $32-million award for 
compensatory and punitive damages that was subsequently reduced by Judge James 
A. Jackman to $9.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
In its ruling on Aug. 30, the state Court of Appeal, in an opinion by Appellate 
Justice Howard B. Wiener, held that Robin George was not entitled to damages on 
the ground of false imprisonment. The panel noted that the girl never claimed 
that she was physically restrained by the Krishnas and it rejected her argument 
that the group improperly employed "coercive persuasion" or "brainwashing" to 
force her to remain a member. 
</P>
<P>
Those charges were invalid because they were aimed at Krishna practices -- such 
as diet restrictions, methods of worship and communal living arrangements -- 
that the family considered objectionable but that were protected by the First 
Amendment, the appeal court said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel, however, found there was sufficient evidence to support 
an award of $2.9 million to Robin's mother, Marcia George. The group was not 
protected by the Constitution for the emotional distress it caused in deceiving 
the parents by pretending not to know their daughter's whereabouts, the court 
held. 
</P>
<P>
"Feigned ignorance was only one aspect of this reprehensible suffering," Wiener 
wrote. The Krishnas, by providing Robin George with plane and bus tickets and 
supplying a wig and glasses to help her disguise herself, engaged in 
"outrageous conduct" that amply supported the emotional distress claim by the 
mother, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel held that Robin George was entitled to $75,000 for her 
father's death.

PARENTS OF BOY PARALYZED IN CARE CENTER POOL ACCIDENT SUE;

LITIGATION: THE COUNTY IS A PARTY TO THE SUIT ON THE GROUND THAT IT SHOULD HAVE 
CLOSED OR TAKEN SOME OTHER ACTION AGAINST THE UNLICENSED FACILITY.

The parents of a 2-year-old boy left paralyzed and brain-damaged after tumbling 
into a swimming pool at an unlicensed North Tustin day-care center sued the 
center's owners, the county and the state Thursday, contending that stricter 
regulation of the facility could have prevented the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Christy Kolbet, 40, and Derek Weston, 29, of Santa Ana seek unspecified damages 
for the March 30 accident at the Cowan Heights home of Diane and Orvel Brooks. 
The lawsuit also names the Brooks' daughter, Carol, who was in charge of the 
children when the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a terrible catastrophe which we believe could have been prevented had 
county and state authorities intervened in a timely and appropriate manner," 
said Gloria Allred, the lawyer who filed the Superior Court lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Derek Weston, who will be 3 in May, and two other children fell into 
the Brooks' pool when Carol Brooks allegedly left them unattended for a short 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-month-old boy, Arthur M. Griese, died about 24 hours after Orvel Brooks 
pulled him from the water. Jonathan was brain-damaged and paralyzed. Another 
2-year-old, Melissa Dianne Polsfoot, also suffered permanent brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Diane and Carol Brooks were charged with willful failure to obtain a day-care 
license, a misdemeanor. They face a January trial in Municipal Court in Santa 
Ana. Deputy Public Defender Deborah Barnum said the women had done everything 
that they were instructed to do by county day-care regulators to ensure the 
safety of their charges. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Weston said he has to fight tears when he thinks of the "gorgeous, 
bright, active" little boy Jonathan used to be. The bouncy child who used to 
help his father rake leaves in the yard now requires round-the-clock medical 
care. His lungs must be suctioned hourly and medications administered through a 
gastrointestinal tube, Weston said. 
</P>
<P>
Weston and Kolbet care for Jonathan in the evenings, then a hired nurse arrives 
at their home to supervise him while his parents sleep. When they leave for 
work in the morning, they drop him off at a specialized care center in Santa 
Ana, Kolbet said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had just known the place was unsafe, this never would have happened 
because we would have taken Jonathan out of there," Kolbet said. "This has 
completely destroyed our lives. We've suffered emotionally, financially. Our 
relationship and our jobs suffer. No one can ever fix what's happened to us." 
</P>
<P>
Kolbet and Weston said in the lawsuit that the Orange County Department of 
Social Services should have made sure that the day-care center was shut down. 
Prompted by calls from a concerned neighbor, the agency twice visited the 
Brooks home and ordered the family to halt its child-care operations. But 
Weston and Kolbet blame the agency for failing to take stronger measures such 
as obtaining a court order or levying fines. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the county should have done more than simply fill out a form and 
have the Brooks sign the cease-and-desist order," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the agency should have warned parents that the facility was 
unsafe, Allred said. But because that was not done, "every parent's worst 
nightmare became a reality for Jonathan and his parents," she added. 
</P>
<P>
State and county social services officials were unavailable for comment.

DEVELOPER SAYS COUNTY OWES FIRM $1.6 MILLION 
</P>

An Orange County developer that figured in an earlier investigation of the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development has asked the county's planning 
department to reimburse it $1.6 million for road construction done years ago at 
the Robinson Ranch project. 
</P>
<P>
In a cost-sharing program, the county agreed in 1981 to reimburse the original 
developer of Robinson Ranch part of the $3.1 million it paid to build a highway 
to its project. That refund was acquired by the William Lyon Co. when it bought 
the project in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In a Nov. 13 letter to Ernie Schneider, then director of the Environmental 
Management Agency, lawyers for Lyon said the $1.6-million payment came with the 
rural development near Mission Viejo and Coto de Caza when the company bought 
it from HUD for $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although county lawyers are studying the request for the money, most county 
officials surveyed believe that the county will have to pay Lyon as outlined in 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials said the original developer of the project, Ridgewood Development 
Inc., paid $3.1 million to extend Santa Margarita Parkway and that the county 
had agreed to refund the firm $1.6 million for the work. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with financial problems, Ridgewood assigned its rights to the development 
back to HUD, which was insuring $30 million in loans that Ridgewood had 
borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Matzoll, deputy manager of HUD's Santa Ana office, said the agreement 
stated that the county agreed to refund the developer $1.6 million for the work 
on the parkway. According to the purchase agreements, those rights were 
transferred from Ridgewood to HUD, then from HUD to Lyon when that company 
bought the development. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been put over on anyone," Matzoll said. "It was agreed to and 
lawyers in Washington had studied it. The department was throughly aware of the 
agreement and contract of sale." 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from losing bidders after the controversial sale of the Robinson 
Ranch prompted HUD to issue a report, which indicated that possible favoritism 
was involved in the sale to Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 HUD report said Lyon's original bid on the project of $8.5 million was 
the lowest of the four considered by HUD officials. The report criticized the 
sales process because Lyon was then allowed to submit a second bid based on a 
higher rate of development on the land than others bidders had considered. 
</P>
<P>
The other companies, including Kaufman and Broad, were never given a chance to 
prepare a bid on a higher rate of development, the report said, and if they 
had, their bids would have been better than Lyon's. 
</P>
<P>
According to the internal report, company owner William Lyon, a retired Air 
Force brigadier general and a major contributor to the Republican Party, was 
friends with a key HUD official who was instrumental in deciding that Lyon Co. 
got Robinson Ranch. That official, Shirley M. Wiseman, then an acting assistant 
HUD director, denied she had a personal friendship with Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Lyon letter to the EMA requested a reimbursement for $1,617,605.95, plus an 
additional $184,172.75 for what was described as a "double payment" made by the 
company for the construction of a 3 1/2-mile extension of the Santa Margarita 
Parkway connecting the South County project with El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lyon said the company is seeking the money now -- nearly five 
years after the contract was signed -- because the county now has sufficient 
funds to cover the payment. But Kenneth R. Smith, EMA's director of 
transportation, said he does not believe there is enough money in the fund to 
reimburse Lyon in one payment.

CORONA DEL MAR KICKER WILLARD GETS CHANCE FOR REDEMPTION IN PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: A MISSED FIELD GOAL NEARLY ENDED THE SEA KINGS' SEASON. BUT AN 
AT-LARGE BID HAS GIVEN HIM ANOTHER SHOT.

<P>
Jerrott Willard will always remember the bus ride back to Corona del Mar High 
School on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
It was a short ride, a mere five miles from Newport Harbor. But for Willard, it 
seemed to take an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
A linebacker by trade, a running back on request and a kicker out of necessity, 
Willard blamed himself for the Sea Kings' 8-7 loss to Sea View League rival 
Newport Harbor. With nine seconds left, his 44-yard field goal attempt had 
hooked wide to the left. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of the miss were devastating to Willard. 
</P>
<P>
By winning, Newport Harbor had assured itself the No. 3 spot in the Southern 
Section Division VI playoffs. The Sea Kings, on the other hand, dropped to 
fourth place and their playoff hopes were in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"All I could think about on the way home was that we weren't going to the 
playoffs and it was my fault," Willard said. "Coach (Dave) Holland always tells 
us we shouldn't leave a game wondering if we could have done more. I was going 
to spend the rest of my life wondering about that kick." 
</P>
<P>
Willard, though, was given a reprieve. The Sea Kings, the defending Division VI 
champions, received an at-large bid into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings (9-3) will try to extend their season tonight when they play 
Sunny Hills (12-0) in the semifinals (7:30 p.m. at Buena Park High School). 
It's a second chance that Willard doesn't want to waste. 
</P>
<P>
"The Newport Harbor game will always bother me," Willard said. "They're our 
rivals and I had a chance to beat them. But at least I won't have to wonder 
what would have happened in the playoffs. Thankfully, we got there anyway." 
</P>
<P>
And Willard is a big reason why the Sea Kings are in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, he was part of a linebacker corps that was the best in Orange 
County last season. However, Brandon Bento, Pat Callaghan and John Kastovsich 
graduated, leaving Willard to fend for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Now a senior, Willard has responded not only on defense but on offense. As the 
Sea Kings' fullback, he has gained 348 yards, mostly in short-yardage 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the kicking. 
</P>
<P>
Callaghan left two holes to fill. Besides playing linebacker last season, he 
was the team's kicker for two seasons. Willard has accepted that responsibility 
as well, kicking field goals of 47, 45 and 43 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
But the miss against the Sailors is the only one he remembers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing that makes Jerrott a good football player," Holland said. "He 
doesn't remember the great plays that he makes. He only remembers the things he 
could have done better." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings returned few players on offense from last season's team, which 
finished 12-0-2 and beat Valencia, 17-7, in the title game. It was left up to 
the defense, with Willard in the middle, to keep Corona del Mar competitive 
until the offense developed. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has done the job for the most part. Corona del Mar has allowed 118 
points this season, and only 16 in its past four games. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Sea Kings struggled in league play. Estancia and Tustin beat them 
before the loss to Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"We had so many new players, it took us time to find ourselves as a team," 
Willard said. "We were starting to roll during the preseason and then we had a 
bunch of injuries right when league started. We just didn't have the depth we 
had last season." 
</P>
<P>
This was not how Willard envisioned his senior year. Until this season, he had 
lost only one high school football game. 
</P>
<P>
Willard's class was 9-1 as freshmen, losing only to Saddleback. The following 
year, the Corona del Mar sophomore team was undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings went beyond Willard's expectations in 1988. With 12 players 
returning who had played together since they were freshmen, he felt another 
undefeated season was on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought we would lose," Willard said. "Last year was a surprise. I 
thought we would be good, but not undefeated. This was the year I figured we 
would go undefeated." 
</P>
<P>
Said Holland: "I think that was part of the problem. The slow start brought 
everyone back to reality. They realized we needed to get some of the new 
players some experience." 
</P>
<P>
Willard, too, was getting used to a new position or two. 
</P>
<P>
He played outside linebacker in 1988 but moved inside this season. Willard 
prefers the inside position because teams can't run away from him and he can 
get to the ball more often. 
</P>
<P>
Willard is among the team's leading tacklers. Against Saddleback, he made 16 
solo tackles. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Willard is playing more on offense. He is the team's starting 
fullback, and his main responsibility is blocking for tailback Brian Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerrott has that linebacker mentality," Holland said. "He has that intensity 
about him and he loves the contact. That made him perfect as a blocking back. 
His blocks are vicious sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
But the extra work has been exhausting at times. Playing both ways has given 
Willard little chance to catch his breath. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little bit of a problem earlier in the year," Willard said. "I would 
run off the field and someone would have to spray me with water. But my stamina 
has improved." 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the kicking. 
</P>
<P>
Willard had only limited experience at the position. As a sophomore, he filled 
in for two weeks when the team's kicker had a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Willard has made six of nine attempts this season. But since the Newport Harbor 
game, every kick has been an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
In Corona del Mar's 10-0 victory over Pacifica in the first round, Willard 
kicked a 31-yard field goal in the first quarter for a 3-0 lead. He also missed 
one, had one blocked and a third was foiled by a bad snap. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what's been happening," Willard said. "Every time we lined up to 
kick one, I wondered 'what's going to go wrong this time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last week in a 10-0 victory over Brea-Olinda, the Sea Kings worked the bugs out 
of their kicking game. Willard made a 26-yard kick in his only attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for Jerrott because he's playing the whole game," Holland said. 
"Most kickers get a chance to warm up before going out there to kick. Against 
Newport Harbor, he carried the ball three times and then had to kick." 
</P>
<P>
Although kicking for a living is not what Willard has in mind, he would like 
one more shot at a game-winner. He has had only one opportunity -- against 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could kick one game-winner, then maybe I can forget the Newport Harbor 
game," Willard said.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Haley, the youngest of three boys in a competitive family, was destined to 
become a good athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Haley's father, Jim, played basketball and baseball at Colorado College and 
later coached his three sons' Little League teams. He recently began a business 
building indoor batting cages. 
</P>
<P>
Haley's oldest brother, Tom, was a starting right guard on El Toro's 1982 
Central Conference championship team. 
</P>
<P>
And Haley's mother, Linda, is an active member of the Lake Forest Club tennis 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo is the most athletic kid in the family," Linda said. "It seemed whatever 
sport he played, it came naturally to him. His older brothers were always 
playing with him . . . throwing balls to him. He never collected baseball 
cards, he was always too busy playing." 
</P>
<P>
Haley began playing soccer as a youngster and took up baseball in the third 
grade. He added football to his busy schedule in the seventh grade at Serrano 
Intermediate School and has blossomed into a two-time all-league tight end at 
El Toro High. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Haley will attempt to become the second member of his family to reach 
a Southern Section championship game when El Toro meets Mission Viejo at 7:30 
in the Division III semifinals at Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Haley has been instrumental in El Toro's playoff success. He caught a 
school-record 86-yard touchdown reception in a 43-8 victory over Gahr in the 
first round, finishing with four receptions for 150 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He scored another touchdown on an end-around play in a 28-14 victory over Villa 
Park in the quarterfinals. Haley has caught 24 passes for 495 yards and has 
scored nine touchdowns on the season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his football success, Haley's first love remains baseball. He was a 
starting left fielder as a sophomore when the Chargers advanced to the Southern 
Section's 2-A division championship game. He batted .263 and was looking 
forward to a big junior season. 
</P>
<P>
But Haley slumped to .190 as a junior although he did show signs of power with 
nine doubles. And the senior is confident his future will be filled with fly 
balls rather than fly patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather play baseball," Haley said. "I enjoy baseball more than football; 
it's more fun. Football practice can be hell. Sometimes, the toughest part 
about practice is just thinking about it in sixth period. 
</P>
<P>
"I love playing the games on Friday night, but practice isn't much fun. 
Baseball is fun, whether you're practicing or playing. My dream is to play 
professional baseball, but I would rather play college baseball than sign if I 
was drafted out of high school." 
</P>
<P>
But first there's the rematch with Mission Viejo. El Toro defeated Mission 
Viejo, 21-14, in their first meeting this season. Haley's role was primarily 
blocking for running backs Jerome Oakman and Danny Maestas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all right at blocking, but I think I catch the ball a lot better than I 
block," Haley said. "Mission was the best defensive team we've played. I know 
they'll come ready to beat us, but we're excited to be playing them again. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense played awfully well the last time we played them. It might have 
been our best defensive game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's victory over Mission Viejo set up a showdown with Capistrano Valley 
for the South Coast League title. The game matched two undefeated teams 
battling for the No. 1 ranking in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley won the game, 22-21, when El Toro missed four field goal 
attempts and had a touchdown called back. 
</P>
<P>
"We had all the opportunities to score and we didn't," Haley said. "Everyone 
was in shock afterward. We're looking forward to playing them again, but we 
know we have to beat Mission first. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone says it's tough to beat a good team twice, but we're looking forward 
to the challenge. We have to beat Mission to get the second shot at Capo." 
</P>
<P>
Haley caught five passes for 47 yards in the one-point loss to Capistrano 
Valley. El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said Haley's ability to catch the ball in a 
crowd separates him from most tight ends. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo has been consistently good for two years," Johnson said. "He run-blocks 
extremely well and is very talented. He's very popular with his teammates and 
the coaching staff. A very unselfish kid who at 6-2 and 195 pounds, runs 
extremely well for his size."

Page Bartelt of Capistrano Valley High School is in an unenviable position. 
</P>
<P>
Her task today is to beat Keri Phebus of Corona del Mar, the top-ranked 
16-year-old division player in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus, who happens to be Bartelt's best friend, has never lost to Bartelt. 
</P>
<P>
When the sophomores face each other today, they will be playing for a spot in 
the finals of the Southern Section individual tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus, who won the individual title last year, will play Bartelt in one 
semifinal, and Anne Mall of Dana Hills will face Nicole Hummel of San Marino in 
the other. The matches begin at 9 a.m. at the Racquet Club of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus advanced by defeating Palos Verdes' Melanie Fountain, 6-1, 6-1, in the 
round-of-16 and then needed only 30 minutes to beat San Marino's Michelle Kong, 
6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus and Bartelt have been friends since they were 7. They are former doubles 
partners and sometimes travel together to junior tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to play her (Bartelt), because we're very good friends," said 
Phebus, who last year became the first Orange County girl to win an individual 
championship. She has not lost a match in more than a year. Her most recent 
loss was a 6-4 defeat to Kim Po of Miraleste in the 4-A team final last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bartelt said, "I've played her all my life, so I pretty much know her game. I'm 
not intimidated by her. I'll just have to go out and try and beat her." 
</P>
<P>
Bartelt advanced with victories over Pasadena Poly's Sandra DeSilva, 6-4, 6-1, 
and Agoura's Trish Silverman, 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mall advanced to the semifinals by defeating Becky Huereque of Etiwanda, 6-3, 
6-0, and Molly White of Camarillo, 6-0, 6-0. Jenny Marques of Laguna Hills was 
eliminated by Jennifer Wall of Arcadia, 6-4, 6-2, in the round-of-16. 
</P>
<P>
None of Orange County's four doubles teams in the round-of-16 qualified for the 
semifinals.

TOP COUNTY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAMS IN IRVINE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 16-team Irvine girls' basketball tournament begins today at University, 
Westminster and Woodbridge high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' top preseason picks, No. 1 Brea-Olinda High School, featuring Aimee 
McDaniel, the Division III state player of the year, and No. 2 El Toro will 
compete in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Brea and El Toro are on different ends of the draw, and if they meet in the 
final, it will give fans an answer to one of the most intriguing questions in 
county girls' basketball this season: Can somebody in Orange County beat 
Brea-Olinda? 
</P>
<P>
The early rounds of the tournament are today, Saturday and Monday. The 
semifinals are scheduled at 8:15 p.m. Tuesday at Westminster and University, 
and the final at 8:15 p.m. Wednesday at Woodbridge.

SUPER SPAS USED TO LURE OFFICE TENANTS; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: SOME DEVELOPERS BELIEVE THAT POSH HEALTH CLUBS, SUCH AS TWO ORANGE 
COUNTY PROJECTS, GIVE OFFICE PARKS AN UPSCALE EDGE. BUT OTHERS WONDER HOW BIG A 
LURE THEY REALLY ARE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When local developers want to put a little more pizazz into their office parks, 
they often try to get a hotel to locate nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It's also fashionable these days to have a restaurant or two around, preferably 
one with a chic name that sounds vaguely Italian or Southwestern. 
</P>
<P>
In some buildings, you can even get your car washed and detailed or have a 
concierge take your suit to the cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
But now -- you'll pardon the expression -- there is a new wrinkle: health 
clubs. Not the sort of unassuming little places usually found at the end of a 
strip shopping center. No, we're talking big here, fancy. We're talking kayak 
runs. Cocktail lounges and restaurants. Meditation rooms. Sushi bars. In short, 
everything a 1990s kind of person needs to stay fit fashionably. 
</P>
<P>
It's good for the developer because he gets to tell prospective tenants that 
their employees will be happier in his building; when they get stressed-out 
from making those big deals or from briefing that big case, they can race over 
to the health club for a workout. 
</P>
<P>
It seems such a good idea, in fact, that two developers have planned Gargantuan 
health clubs just across the freeway from each other among the glass office 
towers near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
There's just this one small problem: Both clubs are so big that they'll likely 
need several thousand members to make a profit. And with two clubs competing 
for a limited number of health-conscious yuppies -- the kind who can afford a 
$675 initiation fee and $75 a month -- finding the proper number of members 
isn't going to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters further, one of the clubs has a long head start: Sports 
Club/Irvine will open early next year, say its owners. The second club -- the 
Sporting Club -- hasn't yet obtained a building permit, though one is near to 
being issued. The Sporting Club says it won't open until late next year. 
</P>
<P>
And, its competitor contends, that schedule is nothing more than an optimistic 
guess. "It takes a year and a half to build one of these things because it's 
such an unusual type of building," says Michael Talla, co-owner of Sports 
Club/Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's OK. They were advertising back in 1987 that they were going to open 
in June, 1989. We'll pay attention to them when they finally open." 
</P>
<P>
If that sounds a little, well, snippy, it is. The two organizations have been 
taking potshots at each other for two years. But even partisans of The Sporting 
Club concede that its late start is going to hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's nervous about what the first few years are going to be like," says 
Bill Kearns of Birtcher, the big Laguna Niguel developer that is leasing the 
land to the Sporting Club. Birtcher is building two office towers called 
Lakeshore Towers next door. "The marketing war is going to get ugly," Kearns 
predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Birtcher's first office tower is also nearing approval for a building permit 
from the city of Irvine, but the developer has problems, too: It has no major 
tenant yet for the 18-story building. One prospect -- the law firm of Gibson, 
Dunn &amp; Crutcher, which was looking for 100,000 square feet of office space 
-- chose a rival Irvine Co. building recently. Birtcher says it has a 
construction loan and is going to build the first office tower anyway. 
</P>
<P>
(Speaking of amenities, though, Birtcher will also have a day-care center.) 
</P>
<P>
Across the San Diego Freeway, at Koll Center Irvine North, the contractors are 
putting the finishing touches on Sports Club/Irvine. The Koll development is a 
cluster of office towers built by the Koll Co. of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It's known that several hotel chains would have liked to put a hotel on the 
Birtcher property, and rumor has it that a hotel was once slated for the Koll 
property where the Sports Club is going up. But the developers apparently 
wanted the snazzy health clubs instead. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our biggest marketing factors is the amenities our office projects 
offer," a Koll spokesman says. Another big thing is traffic: It helps 
developers get permission to build if they can tell city planners that all 
their restaurants, theaters, health clubs and the like will persuade the 
workers in their office buildings to tarry a little longer and keep them off 
the streets during rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
The health club on the Koll property will have a lot of stuff to keep office 
workers diverted. At 100,000 square feet -- about the floor space of 40 new 
houses -- the big club will have vaulted ceilings, skylights, marble, the usual 
treadmills, exercise bicycles, two full-size basketball courts, a pool, a 
sports medicine clinic, a spa, a salon, private trainers, valet parking, a 
shoe-shine service and even a press conference room "for business people." 
</P>
<P>
The other club -- also 100,000 square feet -- has most of that stuff, plus a 
kayak run. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Club/Irvine is run by the same people who run Sports Club/LA, a celeb 
hangout described by People Magazine as "the fanciest gym in America." The 
Sports Club Co. operates seven other clubs. It's owned by Talla and Marvin 
Davis, the oil man and entertainment mogul. 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting Club, on the other hand, is a joint venture of San Diego developer 
Naiman Co. and two Japanese companies. A Naiman subsidiary has developed a 
string of posh health clubs across the country with Japanese companies as 
minority investors. (Since building the giant clubs is risky, the Japanese are 
among the few lenders willing to take a flyer on loaning the developers money. 
But in return, they want a piece of the action, Naiman says.) The two companies 
in on the Irvine club are Nissho Iwai Corp. and Hiroshima Yakult Co. 
</P>
<P>
Both clubs began a heavy advertising blitz two years ago, long before anyone 
had so much as turned over a spadeful of dirt. And they've been signing up 
prospective members for months. It may be hard, however, for the Sporting Club 
to hold on to the 1,500 members it claims to have signed once the other club 
opens. (The Sports Club won't disclose its membership.) 
</P>
<P>
Why is the Sporting Club so late? You get a couple of different answers, but 
basically it seems to have taken longer than anticipated to shepherd the 
Lakeshore Towers project safely through the Irvine bureaucracy. At one time, 
the slow start prompted speculation that the second club wouldn't be built, and 
in fact both clubs talked about merging earlier this year. The talks, however, 
stalled, and the war of the advertising brochures and the potshots in the press 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Both clubs are risky propositions. That's because if a club fails, it's hard to 
turn a building that big and that specialized into something else. And if 
Naiman wants out of running its club at some point in the future, Birtcher -- 
as the landlord -- gets the building at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the risks, you're likely to see more such mega-clubs popping up in 
Southern California's urban areas. Not only are they chic, but with vacancy 
rates for office space more than 20% in some areas, the competition for tenants 
has become intense. Any edge they can get over other landlords -- including a 
health club -- is likely to appeal to office developers. 
</P>
<P>
Naiman, for instance, has been building smaller health clubs next to its office 
buildings since 1974. Now, however, the clubs are getting bigger and other 
developers are taking notice. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the brochure for every office building within blocks of here," says 
Darren Hodgdon, a Naiman executive who was discussing the company's new 
Illinois Center health club on Chicago's lakefront. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been paid incentives by developers to build a club on their property 
because that's allowed them to secure long-term leases from tenants," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both health clubs say they are already talking to other Southern 
California developers about building clubs near other office projects. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies another problem. Developers have already built far too many 
office buildings in Southern California, sending vacancy rates through the 
roof. They've also built way too many hotels in most places, and those vacancy 
rates are high, too. 
</P>
<P>
And what may be the first case of overbuilding these big new health clubs, just 
as the little strip-mall health clubs have saturated the market, may have 
arisen in Irvine. In short, what started out as a solution to the problems of 
an overbuilt office market may eventually turn into a problem of its own. 
</P>
<P>
And some industry observers aren't even sure that tenants really care whether 
their building is near one of these big new health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done a lot of tenant surveys for developers who were toying with the 
idea of putting in tennis courts or jogging trails around their offices," says 
Bob Dunham, president of the consulting firm of Newport Economics Group. "But 
what tenants really want are reasonable rents and good property management. The 
other stuff ranks way down the list. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never understood the appeal of those things anyway," Dunham says. "I pay 
$8 a month to go to Nautilus."

National Education Corp. on Thursday said it has reached a tentative agreement 
with lenders to extend the due date of $62 million in loans for a year, but the 
announcement failed to help the company's stock -- its value tumbled 14.9%, the 
largest percentage loss on the New York Stock Exchange.

Officials of the struggling vocational and educational training firm also told 
financial analysts and portfolio managers in New York that it was considering 
such alternative financing as a joint venture or private placement to help the 
company during seasonal fluctuations in business. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman David C. Jones and President Jerome Cwiertnia told analysts Thursday 
that they intend to reduce costs at their beleaguered Applied Learning division 
by at least $20 million over the next year through several means. Included 
would be additional layoffs beyond the 140 jobs NEC announced earlier for its 
Naperville, Ill., subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
NEC management also said during the 90-minute presentation, which analysts 
termed as generally upbeat, that it hopes to reduce corporate overhead by $5 
million during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"At best it's doable," said Jeffrey Kessler, analyst with the New York 
brokerage of Shearson-Lehman Hutton. "It certainly is not a sure thing." He 
said the odds that NEC will report a profit is "virtually nil for the next six 
to nine months." 
</P>
<P>
Those in attendance seemed caught off guard by the strong stock market's 
reaction, particularly since the company said it had gotten a handle on its 
problems. The company's stock fell $1.25 to close at $5.75 during heavy 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been anxiety the company might be forced to sell an asset and 
therefore sell it at a discount if they are in a distressed position," said 
Arthur Rade, analyst with the New York brokerage of Merrill Lynch. "I'm 
surprised about the stock-price action." 
</P>
<P>
NEC officials, who were in New York for the presentation, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculated that the company's desire to pursue alternative financing 
could have caused some jitters on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock -- which has traded for as much as $28 during the past year 
-- has steadily eroded in recent months because of severe problems at its 
Applied Learning division, which sells educational materials and services to 
corporations. The subsidiary accounts for about half of NEC's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
During the last six months, NEC has reported losses of $8 million and seen its 
stock plunge more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Learning has suffered from computer and billing problems, among other 
things, following a disastrous merger. The company's customers were either 
overbilled, undercharged or given free services. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably take until 1991 before you would see some significant profits 
in Applied Learning," said one analyst. "It's not going to be an overnight 
turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
Jones and Cwiertnia did not issue any 1990 forecasts, a move some analysts said 
contributed to the stock slide Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"They were cautious in giving any projections," said an analyst. "Maybe people 
were looking for more specifics, as to how soon they would turn things around." 
</P>
<P>
NEC was hit with a class-action lawsuit in October by a New York investor who 
alleged that the company and its top executives promulgated false and 
misleading information about NEC's financial condition during the summer 
months. Analysts said the lawsuit hampered executives from making any kind of 
projections at Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives said Thursday that enrollment at the company's vocational 
schools is down about 10% but that a flat market was partially offset by a rise 
in tuition, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
NEC is the nation's largest provider of educational training services and 
employs about 5,200 people.

FLUOROCARBON SETS UP EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN 
</P>

<P>
Fluorocarbon Co. on Thursday joined the growing ranks of U.S. corporations 
putting more of their equity into workers' hands by creating an employee stock 
ownership plan to buy as much as $5 million of the company's shares. 
</P>
<P>
The company, a manufacturer of rubber and plastic industrial products, plans to 
buy $500,000 of its own stock on the open market, beginning Feb. 3, 1990, and 
place it in the plan. Fluorocarbon's directors also approved the purchase -- at 
an unspecified date -- of up to $4.5 million in stock for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the amount of stock bought for the plan will depend on its 
financial performance and certain other factors. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe our stock is a good investment," Chairman Peter Churm said. "We 
also believe that employee ownership will encourage more involvement in the 
operating performance of the company." 
</P>
<P>
The firm's stock closed Thursday at $13.625, up 12 1/2 cents in trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Fluorocarbon's stock has traded in a narrow range in 
the last year, hitting a high of $16.25 and a low of $12.125. 
</P>
<P>
At current market prices, Fluorocarbon employees would own about 5% of the 
company's outstanding shares if the firm bought the entire $5 million in stock 
authorized by its directors. 
</P>
<P>
Employee stock plans have become increasingly popular in corporate America in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp., Lockheed Corp. J.C. Penney &amp; Co. and Procter &amp; Gamble 
Co. are among the major corporations that have set up such plans. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Gallup survey found that such plans give about 10 million U.S. workers 
a stake in more than 9,600 companies. 
</P>
<P>
The plans have proven popular for several reasons. Companies believe that 
workers who own stock will be more involved and productive in their jobs 
because they have a greater stake in the firm's success. Such plans also give 
corporations a tax break, can help defend against a hostile takeover and, in 
some cases, help control the cost of pensions. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of such plans say it has never been proven that the plans actually 
encourage increased productivity. And they say the plans place employees' 
pensions at more risk because a greater share of their retirement package is in 
company stock -- subject to the whims of Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Hathaway, Fluorocarbon's senior attorney, said the main reason for the plan 
is to encourage more employee involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Protection against an unfriendly takeover "wasn't a consideration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company employs 3,200 workers worldwide. Employees will become eligible to 
participate in the stock plan after one year of service, Hathaway said.

COUNTY'S JOBLESS RATE DROPS TO 2.9% BECAUSE OF SEASONAL HIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Orange County's unemployment rate for October fell to 2.9% from September's 
3.2% due to a seasonal hiring surge, the state Employment Development 
Department reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The official number of jobless residents dropped to 40,500 from 44,400 as 
teachers and other school employees returned to work, said Eleanor Jordan, 
Orange County labor market analyst for the EDD. 
</P>
<P>
Retailing was the only other industry segment with a sizable job increase, up 
1,000 for a total of 215,200 jobs, Jordan said. Tourism declined by 1,110 
because of seasonal layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The county's 2.9% unemployment rate remained the third lowest in the state -- a 
position it has held for nearly a year -- bested only by Marin County, with a 
2.2% rate, and San Mateo County, at 2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the October jobless rate was 5.3%, unchanged from September, while 
the statewide rate of 4.6% was down from 5% in September. 
</P>
<P>
Among other Southern California counties, San Diego posted a 3.8% rate; Los 
Angeles, 4.2%, and San Bernardino, 4.7%.

Newport Corp.: The Fountain Valley manufacturer of laboratory equipment posted 
a 33% decline in fiscal 1990 first quarter income, to $1.1 million from $1.7 
million for the comparable period a year ago. Sales for the quarter ended Oct. 
31 decreased 2%, to $13.8 million from $14.1 million. Tom Galantowicz, 
president of Newport Corp., said net income was affected by lower margins on 
sales to Japan, under-utilized capacity and the impact of receivership 
proceedings instituted against the company's Canadian representative.

A 'POST-MODERN' VERSION OF 'TWELFTH NIGHT'; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: THERE'S MUCH TO LIKE IN THIS UC IRVINE PRESENTATION OF SHAKESPEARE'S 
LIVELY COMEDY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" is all about love and the disorder it brings, the 
chaos of the human spirit when seen in the shape of a heart. 
</P>
<P>
It's a wonderful comedy, both light and deep in pathos on an intellectual and 
emotional level, and bustling with puns and the cleverest of humors. 
</P>
<P>
As for its house-of-mirrors plotting, "Twelfth Night" isn't the easiest of 
Shakespeare's plays to follow. There's a tart complexity to it, from the 
gender-blending of the role playing to the ideas the play contains, and 
relieving confusion should be one of a director's first priorities. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine, director Shelley Souza (a graduate student) doesn't always 
delineate what Shakespeare provides as well as she could. 
</P>
<P>
And her "post-modern" version, which amounts to a mingling of classic gestures 
with an abstractly inconsistent point-of-view, doesn't help to clear the 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is much to like in this lively production, which continues through 
Saturday. It's fun -- not always that smart, but always unbridled and kicky. 
Souza misses some of the opportunities, both comic and otherwise, but plumbs 
many as well. Best yet, she uses youthful invention to come up with a few of 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
I could have done without the Ricky Ricardo conga line shenanigans when those 
dangerous clowns Sir Toby Belch (Joel Goldes), Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Gerard 
Babb) and Feste (Elihu Goretsky) break into song. But the same trio's antics 
behind a few skinny tree branches, as they trick the self-important Malvolio 
(Tamiko Washington), were a pleasure to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Those unfamiliar with the play may have had a hard time understanding why 
Malvolio was being hoodwinked, but the humor came through. 
</P>
<P>
It helps to know that Malvolio is Olivia's (Jane Spigarelli's) major-domo. 
Olivia is loved by Duke Orsino (Michael Robinson). In turn, Olivia digs 
Orsino's page Cesario, who's really Viola (Stacy Ross), a young woman disguised 
in men's wear. Viola loves Orsino. Then there's Viola's twin brother, Sebastian 
(Joe Wein), who loves Olivia. See, everybody needs a score card. 
</P>
<P>
One of the production's strengths is the well-spoken cast (mainly graduate 
students), not a minor accomplishment when tackling Shakespeare. Some of the 
actors rush their lines, but there's a general breeziness to the proceedings 
that is suitable. 
</P>
<P>
Ross stands out as Viola, a role that provides so many opportunities. In her 
first scene we are introduced to an evanescent creature, almost floating in her 
femininity. And then, in men's clothing, she's a young man who's not quite sure 
of himself. Ross makes it all believable, and her comic takes have the timing 
that's required. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the clowns excel. Goldes' Sir Toby is a howling, walking pinball 
machine, drunk on himself. Babb's Aguecheek is a complete fool, and he knows 
it. Feste, the quintessential Shakespeare fool, is the joker who knows the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
There's imagination in Stuart R. Baur's set and Jessica Chen's costumes, 
although it isn't always plain what the wittiness means. Baur has come up with 
a series of minimalist constructions full of shifting classical columns and 
sharp angles. Chen's costumes are eclectic, a mix of Melrose Avenue wise-guy 
duds, MTV flash and dinner-date elegance.

GRAPPA BURSTS ON THE NEWPORT BEACH CULINARY SCENE WITH SOME GUSTO

<TEXT>
<P>
Grappa is a type of Italian brandy distilled from the grape remnants left after 
a wine pressing. It's also the name of a smart new Italian restaurant on the 
beachfront in Newport. 
</P>
<P>
You may remember Grappa as Zeppa, and the new owner hasn't changed much about 
the place. It still retains its sleek, handsome Tuscan decor with plenty of 
blacks and grays; its wispy, trompe l'oeil ceiling painted sky blue and white; 
and its tile floor that wouldn't seem out of place in a Florentine villa. The 
room is elegant and comfortable, with only one flaw -- an often strident noise 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Grappa certainly has blasted onto the scene impressively. The two times I ate 
there the place was overbooked. The owner was forced to stall us repeatedly 
while assuring us that our table was "only minutes" from being ready. We 
loitered on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant almost a half-hour one 
Saturday night until our table cleared. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the dinner proved to be worth the wait. Current owner 
Vincenzo Gentile hasn't changed former owner Mark Zigner's original concept 
much, either: this remains a place for simple, rustic Italian dishes. (Zigner, 
by the way, is relocating Zeppa to Fashion Island.) 
</P>
<P>
The only thing I would avoid, ironically, would be any dish with the word 
grappa in the name (e.g., scampi alla grappa, penne alla grappa). Grappa has a 
syrupy flavor and a slightly bitter aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the high-concept attempts, the food is uniformly excellent. No 
surprises, these are dishes you can eat every day, dishes you want to eat every 
day. Most are surprisingly light and deftly prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The house bread, a terrific, flying saucer-shaped round of raised dough baked 
in the restaurant's brick pizza oven, is dense, with steamy butter and Parmesan 
lathered on top. It's deceptively filling. If you lack discipline this bread 
may prevent you from making it through the salad course. 
</P>
<P>
I recommend starting with the fried calamari alle due salse, a basket of 
greaseless, crispy fried squid with two sauces -- a light garlic sauce and a 
coarse, flavorful marinara sauce. It's terrific. Piatto rustico is a plate of 
wonderfully fresh poached bufala mozzarella, roasted green and yellow peppers, 
and grilled Japanese eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
Insalata primaverile is similar to piatto rustico; lettuce and goat cheese 
substitute for the bufala mozzarella. Insalata della casa, the house salad, is 
a version of the chopped salad originated at Jean Leon's La Scala and it's a 
considerable improvement. This salad is crisp and refreshing, not at all soggy, 
and is served with minced chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Of the pastas, only agnolotti, half moon-shaped pillows of dough stuffed with 
spinach and ricotta, are made on the premises. They're fabulous. But I wasn't 
impressed with capelli d'angelo, angel hair pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil, 
and sweet garlic. The noodles were properly chewy but the garlic tasted 
slightly burned. Fettuccine all'arrabbiata had a fiery, elusive appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Because appetizers and pastas are so satisfying in Northern Italian 
restaurants, I always think of main courses as an afterthought. But at Grappa, 
they deserve consideration. There is an excellent veal chop, nodino alla 
griglia, grilled with aromatic herbs -- the scent of rosemary was as sweet as 
it would have been on a back road in Lombardy. Petti di pollo are chicken 
breasts marinated in olive oil and lemon, lightly grilled, then surrounded by 
sauteed vegetables. A daily selection of fresh fish is treated with similar 
wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts too are not without their charms. You will find a fine, house-made 
fruit tart with papaya and strawberry, good ice creams and a rich semifreddo. 
</P>
<P>
People may linger over their espressos, but it isn't because of the taste. The 
coffee I drank was bitter and didn't merit a second sip. Of course, if you want 
a grappa after dinner, you've come to the right place. 
</P>
<P>
Grappa is moderately expensive. Antipasto are $6.25 to $9.50. Salads are $5.50 
to $8.50. Pasta dishes are $11.95 to $14.50. Entrees are $15.50 to $22.75. 
Service is nimble and engaging.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Faraday's Grill and Spirits, 13102 Newport Ave., Tustin. (714) 730-3442. Open 
Sunday through Thursday 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 7 a.m. to 
11 p.m. MasterCard, Visa accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Faraday's is a family restaurant with cheerful service, juicy burgers, and 
some mighty devoted fans. Why else would anyone wait a half-hour for 
institutional food on a Tuesday evening? Everybody goes ape over onion strings, 
mountains of flour-dredged onions deep fried until crispy, and the sappy sweet 
barbecue that kids favor so shamelessly. Breakfast is actually quite credible 
here, with fluffy pancakes, homemade muffins, and squeezed to order OJ. 
Portions are predictably generous and prices are modest. 
</P>
<P>
Baci, 18478 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 965-1194. Open Wednesday 
through Sunday for dinner only, 5:30 to 10 p.m. MasterCard, Visa accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Baci is just a storefront restaurant with modest decor, but young New Yorker 
Angelo Parisi gives his food a rough sophistication; nearly all his dishes are 
touched with originality. All of Italy finds its way onto Parisi's small menu. 
Complimentary appetizers might be a superbly light chicken minestrone, or some 
cold, garlic-infused broccoli. Dishes like fettucine agnello, flat noodles with 
stewed lamb, and linguine tuttomare, with scungilli and shrimp, sustain the 
enthusiasm. The best dessert is panna cotta, the poor man's creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. (714) 750-4321. 
Open Friday through Tuesday for dinner from 6 to 11 p.m. Call for lunch times. 
All major cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant, but other aspects of dining 
there can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room 
is predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu 
features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad, 
and some highly credible entrees including filet mignon that melts in the mouth 
and great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is extensive and 
intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan's Cafe, 3325 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4668. Open for 
lunch from Tuesday-Saturday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and for dinner from 
Tuesday-Sunday, 5:30 to 11. Closed Monday. All major cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan's Cafe specializes in the cuisine of Lebanon, a hybrid of Turkish, 
French, and local influences, and the restaurant is relaxing and exotic. Mazza, 
one of the world's great noshes, is the absolute must here, a splendid array of 
Middle Eastern appetizers like mutebel, a smoky eggplant dip, and warrab ennaq, 
vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice. There are interesting main dishes like 
kibbe nayya, raw ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, sort of an Arabic version 
of steak tartare. Kebabs are first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
Nui Ngu, 10528 McFadden Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 775-1108. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays and Sundays 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pagolac, 14564 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 531-4740. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Little Saigon is always an arresting place to browse when in the mood for 
adventurous, inexpensive dining. Nui Ngu, in a misbegotten strip mall on 
McFadden Avenue, specializes in the wonderfully obscure cuisine of Hue, in 
Central Vietnam. Bun bo Hue, a peppery beef noodle soup, and banh bot loc, 
sticky tapioca flour dumplings, are unforgettable. At Pagolac you can 
experience a phenomenon known as bo bay mon, literally "seven courses of beef." 
The Vietnamese are mad for it. Unload a truck before you go. 
</P>
<P>
Bagatta, 3012 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4020. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The early returns show Bagatta out to a healthy lead in the Newport Beach 
Italian restaurant sweepstakes. It's a terrific addition to the local dining 
scene. Chef Andrea Rogantini brings heavyweight experience to the kitchen. 
Owner Tony Bagatta makes a charming host. Such dishes as salmon carpaccio, 
latticed with a moss green pesto sauce, and dry cured bresaola make spectacular 
beginnings. Pastas are beautifully textured. Desserts, such as zucotto and 
homemade spumoni, are other-worldly. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori, 1080 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-4220. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., till 11 p.m. weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori is a modish, elegant neighborhood trattoria where the cooking is 
serious. Chefs Adriano and Franco Maniacci hail from Palermo, Sicily, but play 
no favorites with regard to the many regions of Italan cuisine. Bruschetta di 
pane Saracena, triangles of roasted wheat bread with a garlic puree, are 
delightful, and many pastas come blanketed in savory sauces. Suprema di rombo, 
turbot in a leek and watercress sauce, pays homage to nouvelle. Veal Milanese 
is the best you'll find anywhere.

NEWSBITES: MOST RESTAURANTS ALSO HAVE THEIR HOLIDAY TRADITIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Thanksgiving '89 is behind us, that busy, happy, exhausting time of 
year known as "the holiday season" is upon us. And just as most families 
develop their own traditions, so, too, have many restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Le Meridien hotel in Newport Beach will host its third annual "Toys for Tots" 
Holiday Brunch on Sunday, Dec. 10, at 11 a.m. Cost for the buffet, which 
includes roasted turkey, soups, salads and again, the French Yule log dessert, 
is $24.95, and each guest is asked to contribute an unwrapped toy for the Toys 
for Tots drive. Information: (714) 476-2001. 
</P>
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel, which is already a dazzle of Christmas 
lights, caters to the young set with a 12-foot-high gingerbread house and a 
series of children's teas and puppet shows on weekends and during the week 
preceding Christmas. Children 10 and under enjoy holiday punch, peanut butter 
and jelly tea sandwiches, miniature fruit tarts and Christmas cookies, plus the 
marionette show, for $15. Adults will be served the hotel's regular afternoon 
tea menu for $20. Guests will also be encouraged to bring a new toy to the 
hotel's Toys for Tots campaign. Information: (714) 240-2000. 
</P>
<P>
HEART SMART: The Westin South Coast Plaza hotel has launched its newly 
remodeled Cafe Dining Room and Garden Court (formerly the Orange Grove Cafe) 
with a new menu featuring California health-conscious cuisine with Asian flair. 
Many items meet the low-fat, low-sodium, low-cholesterol guidelines of the 
American Heart Assn., including swordfish with banana-mango chutney, salmon in 
orange-pine nut sauce and Pacific chicken in hot sour pineapple sauce. 
</P>
<P>
CHANGING COURSES: Jack Kalustian takes over as executive chef at the newly 
opened Radisson Plaza Hotel, across MacArthur from the Orange County Airport. 
He has served as chef at Portofino Inn in Redondo Beach, executive sous chef at 
the Newporter, and apprenticed at Perino's . . . Robert Reash Jr. recently 
joined John Dominis in Newport Beach as executive chef, after overseeing the 
kitchens at the Hotel Hana Maui in Hawaii. Reash plans to introduce new 
specialty dishes featuring a blend of tropical flavors and Oriental spices . . 
. Ed and Donna Carroll bought Gen Kai in Laguna Beach this week and changed the 
name to The Top of Laguna. The mother-son team will retain the Gen Kai sushi 
bar and accent California cuisine with touches of Italian and French. Their 
chef, Chris Fagan, most recently of Five Feet Two, is a past recipient of a 
Southern California Restaurant Writers scholarship . . . The International 
Coffee Mill, an espresso bar and purveyor of fine coffee and tea, debuts Dec. 
13 in Woodbridge Village Center, Irvine, on Barranca Parkway at Lake. The shop, 
with indoor and outdoor seating, will also serve pastries and four different 
coffees at the tasting bar. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGNATE YOUR DRIVER: 94 restaurants, hotels and bars participate in the 
Orange County MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) Designated Driver Program -- 
the largest in the nation. When you go out in a group of three or more, 
designate your driver and he or she will receive free non-alcoholic beverages 
at participating restaurants and hotels. Call MADD, (714) 835-6233, for a list 
of participants in your area. Designated drivers may also enter MADD's holiday 
sweepstakes for a weekend for two at the Anaheim Marriott with passes to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
HERE AND THERE: Remicks in Irvine, which was closed for a week, has reopened, 
all "spiffied up" for the holidays. The menu features new specials in the 
classic manner of New Orleans and Acadiana, such as oysters Bienville, scampi a 
la Louisiane, New Orleans bouillabaisse, chocolate voodoo cake and almond creme 
brulee . . . Salud! in Huntington Beach, in an effort to give greater value, 
recently debuted a Wednesday night "Family Fiesta Buffet." From 5 to 10 p.m., 
select from a variety of salads, entrees (carnitas tacos, sizzling fajitas and 
tostadas) and desserts for $7.95 for adults. Children 10 and under eat free. 
(Children also eat free at Salud! every day between 4 and 6 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
HOT LINE FOR DINING: A call to (714) 979-DINE can help you select a restaurant 
in a specific area with a particular type of cuisine.

Want to give a fabulous holiday soiree but you're stumped on how to make it a 
memorable occasion? Creative ideas -- and the people behind them -- are 
available for fees that range from reasonable to outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
If, after going over your holiday budget, you find yourself with an extra 
$3,300, you may want to contact J. Schwartz, a party planner whose Los 
Angeles-based company, Entertainment Contractor, will furnish a sleigh and live 
reindeer -- and a Santa Claus -- to complement your Christmas celebration. And, 
should you desire real snow for authenticity, Schwartz -- who boasts that half 
his clientele hails from Orange County -- can arrange that, too. 
</P>
<P>
And for considerably less (about $225 per hour) the former actor-comedian-mime 
will send a professional photographer -- complete with Dickens-style costumes 
and backdrops -- who will snap party guests and provide "antique" portraits 
that they can take home as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
Elves -- played by little people -- are available for $175 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
A bawdy marionette show with a holiday theme -- adults only -- runs $300. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Stern, manager of Santa Ana-based Regal Rents, can accommodate large and 
small events, supplying dance floors, lighted canopies and tents ranging in 
price from $1,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
R.W.B. Party Rentals in Orange has been renting out party props for more than a 
quarter century. Although husband and wife owners Bobby and Lori Babcock 
specialize in convention and hotel events -- they recently outfitted a local 
hotel with a life-size "Nutcracker Suite" scene, including old-fashioned street 
lights and a snow-capped mountain backdrop -- the company accommodates home 
parties, too. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-foot wooden soldiers rent for $100 each; eight-foot snowmen, $50 each, 
and a six-foot stuffed Santa Claus, $40. A hand-painted winter backdrop -- 30 
feet long and 15 feet high -- rents for $100. Props are delivered in time for 
the party and picked up the next day. 
</P>
<P>
For children's parties or less formal events, R.W.B. rents hot dog, popcorn, 
cotton candy and snow-cone concession carts at $75 for five hours (for $250 
they will throw in servers and supplies). 
</P>
<P>
Roscoe-Cottrell, a full-service event planning company, subcontracts everything 
from party themes and invitation concepts, location scouting and menu planning 
to party decorating, entertainment and guest transportation. The latest stretch 
limo runs about $60 per hour. A helicopter with pilot will set you back about 
$350 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
"We can work with any budget," said Betsy Beatty, marketing director for the 
Costa Mesa-based company. "Some clients only want us to arrange food and 
flowers or rent our living Christmas tree." (A person hidden inside a foam 
tree-like sculpture greets guests -- $300 for two hours.) A bickering Santa and 
Mrs. Claus are another party favorite, Beatty added. 
</P>
<P>
The most unusual request Beatty has received, she said, was from a client who 
recently asked to rent Rodeo Drive (in Beverly Hills) for a day. "He wants us 
to close it down so he can bring in out-of-town guests for shopping. We're 
checking on it now." 
</P>
<P>
For those who wish to blend their culinary and decorating talents with rented 
goods and services, a classic Christmas party, said Roscoe-Cottrell co-owner 
Sandy Cottrell, might include a "traditional Christmas goose with all the 
trimmings, steamed plum pudding with hard sauce and wassail (a traditional 
English grog)." 
</P>
<P>
For an elegant flair, she also suggests "a buffet table trimmed with gold lame 
and matching ribbon drapings, pine bough branches wrapped with miniature 
blinking lights, and lots and lots of candles in old-fashioned candlestick 
holders. We can furnish fine English china to set it all off, and Dickens-style 
carolers strolling about throughout the evening." 
</P>
<P>
Or you may want to rent live music through Jolene Anderson-Shubin, founder of 
Seaside Carolers, a San Clemente-based singing group. For $275 the first hour 
and $100 each hour thereafter, groups of four, six or eight USC music graduates 
will sing -- a cappella -- traditional carols and jazzed-up holiday favorites. 
</P>
<P>
If you're all thumbs when it comes to decorating, lack the extra time -- or 
prefer that someone else handle the job -- you may want to call in a holiday 
designer to deck your halls with boughs of holly. 
</P>
<P>
Don and Barbara Pickler of Yorba Linda started working with specialist Claude 
Davis 18 months ago during construction of their new home. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Davis, a designer for Associated Design Studio, a Newport 
Beach-based firm, worked with existing family decorations and added new ones to 
create a "Phantom of the Opera" theme for the Pickler family's first holiday 
season in their new home. 
</P>
<P>
"Black and white masks trimmed with silver, black and white mylar ribbon 
streamers with the same theme carried out on banisters and fireplace mantles, 
and silk garlands with matching accents created a dramatic, one-of-a-kind 
look," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Pickler, who is Jewish and does not celebrate Christmas, and wife Barbara, 
who does, together host two annual holiday parties -- one week apart. 
</P>
<P>
"First, I decorate the house for Mr. Pickler's party -- leaving out the tree 
decor and any religious items, then I add them for Mrs. Pickler's party," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This season a Far East theme was chosen. Davis wanted to highlight Barbara's 
collection of antique Japanese kimonos and obis, which adorn the walls of the 
eclectic two-story hilltop home. Hot pink and shades of purple dominate the 
holiday decor; silk garlands entwined with silver rope bedeck the library. 
</P>
<P>
Miniature Japanese paper dolls -- dressed in silk kimonos -- accent the garland 
on the main entryway staircase and the formal Christmas tree in the living 
room. "The nice thing about working with a holiday designer," Barbara said, "is 
that your own ideas can be enhanced -- that way, your own personality isn't 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
Although Davis admits that outfitting a house from scratch can be costly, once 
decorations are purchased, subsequent seasonal design fees are drastically 
reduced, he said. "We charge about $250 to decorate an entire house once the 
client already has decorations." 
</P>
<P>
With everything in place -- food, entertainment and decorations -- you are free 
to enjoy your guests. And with one phone call to a local cleaning service, you 
can go to bed after your party assured that your house will be shining brightly 
in time for your next holiday bash -- New Year's Eve.

CREATE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS BY THE YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Know any transplanted New Yorkers who this time of year send family and friends 
back East greeting cards showing Santa jogging on the beach? 
</P>
<P>
In the cards, they complain that there are no seasons in Southern California, 
no snow and not even much cold. 
</P>
<P>
They can't wait to get home to a real Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
But local residents with a creative eye can detect a bit of Christmas outdoors 
and transform raked leaves, clipped trees and trimmed hedges into garlands, 
centerpieces and wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
While there are those who jump in with plenty of imagination and a yard full of 
possibilities, others with the same resources lack the assurance to create. 
</P>
<P>
A little instruction can turn the latter into the former. 
</P>
<P>
"Even floral designers had to start somewhere," said Celia Gallardo, manager of 
Cummings European Fresh Flower Market in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone had to show us. Anyone can do this, but you'd be surprised at the 
number of people who lack the confidence to try it. They end up paying a 
professional to make it for them. It's really a lot easier than they think." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a glue gun, floral tape, floral wire and floral foam, just about 
anyone can turn odds and ends from house and garden into Christmas creations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the easiest decorations to make is the garland, which can be draped over 
a door frame, sprayed across a fireplace mantle or coiled around a banister. 
Aside from its aesthetic value, the beauty of a garland is that it can be 
constructed quickly and easily from Christmas-tree cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
As Gallardo observed: "Christmas trees are rarely perfect. They're usually too 
bushy at the bottom or on one side or the other. By trimming the stray 
branches, not only is the tree neater, but you have the materials to make other 
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
"Or if you don't have enough greens, just go to any Christmas tree lot and ask 
for their discards; they're usually available for next to nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Transforming tree cuttings into a garland for the fireplace is as simple as: 
</P>
<P>
* Placing few of those clipped branches across the mantle with the cut ends 
back to back, tucking one under the other. 
</P>
<P>
* Dotting the greens with pine cones and leftover ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
* Securing these with floral wire, adding bright red candles. 
</P>
<P>
To make a garland for a banister: Overlap branches across the railing and, 
using floral wire, fasten to the railing in spiral motions down its length. 
</P>
<P>
Finish by attaching an assortment of tree ornaments, candy canes, bows and 
bells. 
</P>
<P>
One of Gallardo's favorites is a garland for the front door: 
</P>
<P>
"All I do is take three or four of the longer branches, gather them at the top 
by the cut ends, wind some floral wire around the ends to keep them together 
and attach a big red bow to hide the ends. Then I glue on some pine cones and 
bells, throw on a couple of candy canes, and I have a beautiful decoration for 
my door that took me no time to make. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas is the best time of the year," she added. "It's really about 
families doing things together, and making decorations is something that 
accomplishes that. 
</P>
<P>
"If some of the resources are not readily available in the yard, make an outing 
of packing everyone in the family car, taking off for Big Bear or even a local 
park, giving the kids a large trash bag and sending them on a scavenger hunt 
for acorns, pine cones, seed pods or interesting looking twigs and leaves." 
</P>
<P>
Such found materials allow for more intricate designs, though they are hardly 
more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fancy table arrangements are merely dried flowers, leaves and twigs 
that have been spray painted gold or silver for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Inexpensive baskets or vases can serve as the base of a centerpiece using these 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first steps is to dry the mulch, which requires no more effort than 
tying string around the stems of flowers, twigs or leaves and hanging them 
upside down on a nail in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
In two to four weeks, they should have dried sufficiently to be painted. 
</P>
<P>
Once the paint has dried, the creative juices can flow. 
</P>
<P>
To make a centerpiece, place floral foam in the bottom of a basket or vase and 
punch the dried stems into the foam. For color, add fresh carnations, 
bottlebrush branches or whatever else is in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Then insert a few pine cones, a small clipping from the Christmas tree, the 
front hedge or the eucalyptus tree, and add candy canes, ornaments or even some 
children's building blocks arranged to spell noel. 
</P>
<P>
For a hearth decoration, simply fill a fireside basket with pine cones and 
several brightly colored ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities are nearly endless once the basics are established. 
Arrangements of pine cones, spray-painted hedge clippings, fresh flowers, holly 
and dried leaves are simple, quick and inexpensive ways to transform a snowless 
Christmas into a traditional one.

COOKS GO TO THEIR ROOTS FOR FESTIVE FOOD FROM OTHER CULTURES

<P>
For every Christmas as far back as Maria Elena Avila, 36, of Fullerton can 
remember, the women of her family "get together around this big table and we 
make tamales." 
</P>
<P>
When Mary Nguyen, 45, of Huntington Beach gathers her diverse family for 
Christmas, she creates a celebration to encompass two cultures. Food for 
Christmas Eve is Vietnamese, while food for Christmas Day is typically 
American. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday preparations for Stella Lento of Anaheim include making dishes she 
enjoyed during her girlhood in pre-World War II Poland. 
</P>
<P>
And at this time of year, Arlene Rose of Fullerton is thinking about 
preparations for a Hanukkah party, which always includes potato latkes and 
jelly doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
Food is always an important part of holiday celebrations, and for many Orange 
County residents, it's an opportunity to salute their ethnic ancestry and 
traditional foods. 
</P>
<P>
Avila says "it's like an assembly line" every year when aunts, cousins, her 
daughter Lisa, 19, and her sister, Margarita, gather about a week before 
Christmas to make tamales at the Corona del Mar home of her parents, Salvador 
and Margarita Avila. Last year, that assembly line turned out more than 1,200 
tamales for the annual Christmas Eve feast, which includes up to 40 people. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody looks forward to the time of gathering, and they're joking and 
they're laughing," Avila says of the annual tamale-making. "We all change our 
work schedules to be there and carry out that tradition." Avila owns Avila's El 
Ranchito restaurant in Brea, while other members of the family own six more El 
Ranchitos. 
</P>
<P>
And the tamales are just a part of the special closeness of the Avila holiday 
celebration. "We're a combination of Catholics and born-again Christians, and 
we've been very blessed to combine them . . . and find common ground," Avila 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
At midnight on Christmas Eve, the Avilas light a candle and family members 
share something about how "Christ brought light into our world this past year," 
Avila says. "It becomes a beautiful, very special time." 
</P>
<P>
But before that part of the celebration, there's a feast that includes bunuelos 
(Mexican fritters) with caramel, a beverage called atole, flavored with orange 
or chocolate, a hot toddy called ponche caliente and, of course, tamales, which 
are made of corn dough and stuffed with a variety of fillings. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular filling is red chili and meat, but a family favorite with the 
Avilas is Tamales Rajas y Queso. Avila is willing to share that recipe and add 
a few shortcuts, including: making tamales ahead and freezing them, using 
already-prepared masa (corn dough) and canned chilies and using wax paper to 
hold tamales together, rather than the traditional tying with string. (See 
recipe on this page.) 
</P>
<P>
But, she cautions, tamale-making still isn't easy. The best approach for 
novices, she says, is to learn by helping someone who already knows the 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese cooking can take some time to master too, according to Nguyen. For 
instance, she says, a sticky rice cake filled with meat, beans and vegetables 
is formed in a square shape by people who come from North Vietnam and in a 
cylinder by people from the south. And people from the central portion of the 
country may make dishes differently from those favored by the other two 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, owner of La Thu Dancewear in Fountain Valley, is not Vietnamese 
herself. She has, however, readily embraced Vietnamese culture during her 
15-year-marriage to Phung Nguyen, whom she met when she was helping resettle 
Vietnamese refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm more Vietnamese than I am American anymore," she says. She speaks 
fluent Vietnamese and teaches English in Garden Grove to Vietnamese residents 
age 60 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the Nguyens have built quite a family. She has three children from a 
previous marriage, and they have three children together. They also have five 
adopted Vietnamese children, all of whom are adults now. And over the years, 
they were foster parents to 29 children, most of whom were Vietnamese. The 
largest number of children to live in the house at one time, she says with a 
chuckle, was 13. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen is well aware of the regional differences in Vietnamese cuisine, 
because, she says, "some of my kids are central, some of them are south and my 
husband's north, so lucky me!" 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to holidays, Nguyen does her best to blend American and 
Vietnamese foods and cultures. Though Christmas is not widely celebrated in 
Vietnam, the Nguyen Christmas Eve feast includes such typical celebration or 
party foods as egg rolls, barbecued beef on a stick, sticky rice, fried rice, 
noodles, pork or roast duck. 
</P>
<P>
She says a lot of Vietnamese recipes are popular with Americans, but a 
marinated chicken she makes is "really a favorite with everybody I know. It's 
wonderful." In this recipe, chicken is marinated in fresh ginger, soy sauce, 
onions, cloves, cinnamon and pepper, and then baked or grilled. She says the 
unusual spices really give it a special flavor. (See recipe on N13.) 
</P>
<P>
While meat is an important part of Vietnamese holiday food, Polish Catholics 
have a tradition of fasting on Christmas Eve day and enjoying a variety of 
meatless dishes for the evening meal, according to Lento. 
</P>
<P>
Lento was born in Gary, Ind., but her parents returned to Poland when she was a 
baby. She returned to Gary in 1938. "My brother became 21 and they told him to 
join the Polish army or get out, because we were American citizens, so we got 
out," she recalls. Later, she married Frank Lento, who is of Italian descent. 
They have lived in Orange County since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
She says a Polish Catholic Christmas celebration starts on Christmas Eve, 
around 7 p.m., "when the first star appears." Family members share an oplatek, 
a sort of communion wafer, and wish each other well. The family then sits down 
to dinner, leaving an empty chair for unexpected guests. 
</P>
<P>
The meal might include a bread called babka; trout or herring in sour cream; a 
buckwheat dish called kasza; potatoes with butter, parsley and dill; barszcz, a 
type of soup that may be made of beets or onions and sour cream); kluski z 
makiem, wide noodles topped with honey, poppy seeds and butter; sauteed 
mushrooms and poppy seed rolls for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
The meal also will include pierogi, which is perhaps one of the best-known 
Polish dishes and the most requested recipe, Lento says. Pierogi is a pasta 
that is stuffed, sort of like a ravioli or won ton. 
</P>
<P>
All sorts of stuffings might be used, including cheese, mushrooms, sauerkraut, 
potatoes or meat. Since Christmas Eve is a meatless meal, Lento favors pierogi 
stuffed with cheese or cabbage. (See recipe on N13.) 
</P>
<P>
Special rules are part of all the meals at Rose's home because her family 
observes kosher dietary laws. "We're probably one of the more traditional 
families in Orange County," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Kosher dietary laws state what food is permissible for Jews and how it should 
be prepared -- and require that meat and dairy products not be served at the 
same meal. Some foods are parve, which means they are neither meat nor dairy 
and can be eaten with either one. 
</P>
<P>
Rose calls Hanukkah, the festival of lights, a celebration of religious 
freedom. It commemorates Judas Maccabaeus' rededication of the Hebrew temple in 
Jerusalem in the second century. 
</P>
<P>
The annual celebration begins on Dec. 23 this year. Traditions include prayers, 
lighting of candles on the menorah, games with dreidels (spinning tops), songs, 
and Hanukkah gelt (money) and gifts for the children. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rose, a Hanukkah party may be held any time during the eight-day 
celebration. Rose, who is a member of the Sisterhood at Temple Beth Emet of 
Orange County in Anaheim, says a typical celebration meal for Jews with an 
Eastern European background might include vegetable soup, roast duck or goose 
(though Rose says it's difficult to find a kosher goose in Orange County), 
potato latkes with applesauce, orange and avocado salad and jelly doughnuts for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Menus may vary, depending on the country of origin of a Jew's family, but she 
says that everybody eats potato latkes in some form or other on Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
Sephardic Jews, for instance, make latkes with zucchini, says Rose, who is 
compiling a 25th-anniversary cookbook for the Sisterhood. 
</P>
<P>
Rose uses a simple and tasty potato latke recipe that can be made in the food 
processor and even eliminates the need for peeling the potatoes. (See recipe on 
this page.) 
</P>
<P>
One reason latkes and doughnuts are popular on Hanukkah, Rose said, is that 
both are cooked in oil, which is symbolic of something miraculous -- the 
sacramental oil in the Jerusalem temple that Judas Maccabaeus reclaimed. 
Although there was only enough for one day, the oil continued to burn brightly 
for eights days and nights.

</P>
<P>
(Makes 4 dozen) 
</P>
<P>
6 lbs. masa preparada -- available at tortillerias (Mexican bakeries) 
</P>
<P>
3 bags of corn husks (available at Mexican markets) 
</P>
<P>
2 large cans of whole Ortega chilies (27 ounces) 
</P>
<P>
5 lbs. Monterey Jack cheese 
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Note: This recipe requires a tamale steamer, available in Mexican markets, 
starting at about $10. 
</P>
<P>
Wash husks thoroughly and soak in water for a day. Drain and shake off excess 
water. Eliminate husks less than 4 inches wide. Drain liquid off chilies and 
cut into strips 1/2-inch wide. Cut cheese into strips 1/2 inch by 3 inches. 
Spread about 2 tablespoons of masa on husk, over area about 3 inches wide and 3 
inches long. Place two strips of chilies and two strips of cheese on top of 
masa. Gently fold over sides of husk and fold bottom of husk upward. Leave open 
at top. Wrap tightly in square of wax paper, place in plastic bags and put in 
freezer. When ready to serve, remove from freezer and place (with wax paper 
intact) in tamale steamer with boiling water. Cover and steam for about 1 1/2 
hours. Don't pack tamales into steamer too tight. Allow room for steam to 
circulate thoroughly. To check doneness, open one tamale in middle of steamer 
and one at edge. When dough easily separates from husk, tamales should be done. 
Serve with salsa.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEST SCORES FOR SOUTH BAY STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
COMPARING CALIFORNIA STUDENT FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Education for the first time last spring tested the 
physical fitness of fifth-, seventh- and ninth graders. State Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig said the scores for the nearly 800,000 students surveyed 
confirmed experts' hunches that most California children are woefully out of 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
Not all schools participated in the survey, and Los Angeles Unified School 
District scores are not shown because district officials say problems in the 
administration of the test by many schools has raised questions about the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Also, officials in other districts said schools show zero scores in certain 
categories of fitness because state reporting forms were not properly 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
The physical education tests are the newest addition to the California 
Assessment Program, which annually evaluates the state's students in academic 
areas. As with the academic exams, results of the physical education survey are 
intended to provide a way to assess schoolwide performance; individual scores 
are not released. 
</P>
<P>
The test was developed by the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, 
Recreation and Dance. There were four mandatory exercises -- sit and reach, 
sit-ups, pullups and mile run. A fifth test -- of body composition -- was 
voluntary and not all students participated. The results were compared against 
a minimum fitness standard for each grade level. Listed below are average 
percentages of students in each grade level who met the standard in four or 
more areas, three areas, two areas, one area and none. 
</P>
<P>
For comparison, here are state averages:

KEY W. GERMAN BANKER KILLED IN CAR BOMBING

<P>
Alfred Herrhausen, the head of West Germany's largest bank and one of the most 
powerful men in Europe, was killed in a bomb attack Thursday while he was en 
route to his office in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
The office of the chief federal prosecutor said that the Red Army Faction, a 
terrorist organization, had claimed responsibility for the attack in a letter 
left at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The blast that killed Herrhausen destroyed his armored BMW limousine and was 
heard as far as three miles away from Bad Homburg, a Frankfurt suburb where 
Herrhausen lived. His driver was severely injured. 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old executive, a personal friend of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and an 
economic adviser to Kohl's government, was on his way to his office at the 
Frankfurt headquarters of the Deutsche Bank, of which he was chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, when informed of the killing, denounced it as a "cowardly and brutal 
murder." He described Herrhausen as a friend and patriot. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever knew him," Kohl said, "knows he was an outstanding businessman, an 
important banker and one of the most important spokesmen for the German economy 
around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Herrhausen had been "an eminent 
representative of responsible social and political policies in West Germany" 
and that he had "made a great contribution to aid programs for Third World 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, a spokesman for Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who was meeting with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said "the prime minister and President 
Gorbachev expressed their regret at Herrhausen's death." 
</P>
<P>
Herrhausen had strong ties to the Soviet Union and had recently made it clear 
that his bank was prepared to expand toward the East as a result of the decline 
in Communist power there. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday he had flown to London to complete arrangements for the Deutsche Bank 
to take over the British merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, a move designed to 
expand the West German bank's role in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But his status as West Germany's No. 1 banker had drawn criticism from people 
who said they feared the power of the banks, and particularly that of the 
Deutsche Bank because of the latter's interests in many important private 
companies, including key industrial enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank recently pressed for a merger between the auto maker 
Daimler-Benz AG, of which the bank is a major shareholder, and the aerospace 
concern Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm (MBB). This role helped make Herrhausen a 
potential target for terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything related to weapons," a fellow banker said Thursday, "is seen by the 
general public as immoral." 
</P>
<P>
Heribert Hellenbroich, former head of West German counterintelligence, 
suggested that Herrhausen's part in the Daimler-Benz-MBB arms industry merger 
could have drawn terrorist attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, for the extreme left wing, the largest West German bank and its chief 
executive were a symbol of the hated capitalist system. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Herrhausen) is an unusual phenomenon in terms of what one expects from the 
chairman of Deutsche Bank," the liberal weekly Die Zeit once commented. "He 
does not act like a traditional banker, but instead more like a captain of 
industry who by sheer force wants to transform his institution into a company 
with 'international identity' active in all areas of finance." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the bank's industrial holdings in 1,700 West German and 200 foreign 
firms, Deutsche Bank under Herrhausen recently began moving into such new 
financial areas as insurance and mortgage banking. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing attack occurred just after 8:30 a.m., about 500 yards from 
Herrhausen's heavily guarded residence in Bad Homburg, a fashionable spa. As 
Herrhausen's BMW moved along, followed by a vehicle carrying security 
personnel, an explosive device was detonated, apparently by remote control. 
</P>
<P>
The car was thrown into the air. Its doors, hood and trunk flew open, and its 
windows were shattered. The force of the explosion knocked out the windows of 
homes and other buildings in a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
Policemen found the letter claiming responsibility not far from the shattered 
car. It bore the Red Army Faction symbol of a Kalashnikov rifle superimposed on 
a star, but neither police nor the prosecutor's office made public the letter's 
details. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the chairman of the Deutsche Bank's French branch said that the 
Frankfurt office had been warned by West German anti-terrorist services of a 
possible attack. 
</P>
<P>
"For several weeks security measures had been tightened at the Deutsche Bank's 
headquarters in Frankfurt," Hesse Zu Leiningen told French television. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources here said the Red Army Faction, thought to have been all but 
extinct, was preparing "a new phase of its struggle." Until Thursday's 
incident, the group was not known to have mounted any such action for more than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Herrhausen, tall and elegantly dressed, looked 10 years younger than he was. 
Fluent in English and other foreign languages, he went into banking after 
working in the energy field. He joined Deutsche Bank in 1969 and became its 
chief executive last year. He brought a modern management style to the bank, 
emphasizing not so much titles and seniority as ability and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he had sought to reduce Third World debt, specifically promoting a 
plan to give financial aid to Poland. He also was talking about establishing 
banking links in the Soviet Union. On Wednesday night the bank had given a 
dinner for a delegation of high-level Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
The news of his death stunned the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Trading was 
interrupted for a minute of silence. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Army Faction dates back to the late 1960s, when it mounted the first of 
a series of attacks that made it one of the most notorious terrorist 
organizations on the Continent, targeting mainly industrial and economic 
leaders in an effort to destabilize the West German government. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years it was known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang, after its founders 
Andrea Baader and Ulrike Meinhof. Both committed suicide in prison. 
</P>

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The terrorist Red Army Faction grew out of West Germany's student unrest of the 
late 1960s. Its depredations began with an arson attack on a department store 
for which Andreas Baader was arrested in 1970. He was freed by cohorts at 
gunpoint a few weeks later and went underground to form the Baader-Meinhof 
Gang. Its aims were violent overthrow of the West German social order, 
including "monopoly capitalism." Gang members sought contact with Third World 
guerrilla movements and were trained by leftist Palestinian guerrillas. When 
its leaders were arrested in 1972, the group tried through terrorism to force 
the release of the jailed figures: Baader, Ulrike Meinhof, Gudrun Ensslin, Jan 
Carl Raspe and Holger Meins. Meinhof committed suicide in prison in 1976. And 
Baader, Ensslin and Raspe committed suicide in jail in October, 1977, after 
West German troops ended a Red Army Faction hijacking of a Lufthansa plane in 
Mogadishu, Somalia. The faction has remained isolated in society, with 20 to 30 
men and women considered the current hard core. But it continues to find 
sympathizers who lobby for more rights for its jailed members. In recent years, 
the Red Army Faction has increased cooperation with terrorist groups in Italy, 
France, Belgium and Spain.

DEUTSCHE BANK: A PROFILE 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank is the largest bank in West Germany by a wide margin. Here are 
some facts and figures: 
</P>
<P>
Its $175-billion volume of business ranks it No. 22 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
It has 55,000 employees and 1,530 branches serving 7 million customers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank was founded 117 years ago in Berlin. After World War II, the 
Allies shut down its Berlin headquarters, and all of its branches in the 
Soviet-occupied sector of Germany were closed. In 1952, the bank was broken up 
into three separate banking institutions, but five years later, these were 
re-merged into a single Deutsche Bank, with headquarters in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
About 62% of its business and 83% of its earnings in 1988 were in West Germany, 
underscoring the bank's strong influence in the economy and reflecting its 
powerful industrial holdings. The value of these holdings are estimated at more 
than $7.35 billion, including a 28.1% share of Daimler-Benz, West Germany's 
largest company.
