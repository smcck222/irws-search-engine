Down the street from LAX, overlooking the 405 Freeway, stands a billboard 
hawking a new BMW automobile. The ad reads: "Own the San Diego Frwy. For Just 
$25,105." 
</P>
<P>
The billboard stands at the border of Inglewood, where virtually half of the 
households, according to one reliable study, earn less than $25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Over the decades, moviegoers have been lured to theaters by all sorts of 
gimmicks and free gifts, including dishes, 3-D glasses, vomit bags and 
scratch-and-sniff "Odorama" cards. William Castle, the self-styled king of 
exploitation horror films, insured spectators of the 1957 film "Macabre" with 
Lloyds of London for $1,000 against death by fright. And in Castle's 
"Homicidal," an announcement burst onto the screen after 100 minutes stating 
that anyone too scared to view the final 120 seconds could leave and have their 
money refunded. 
</P>
<P>
Comes now "Phantom of the Mall," a shocker film at which spectators are being 
offered optional blood pressure tests before entering the theater. Those 
registering a reading of 195/125 will be turned away, the ads for Friday's 
opening say. 
</P>
<P>
According to a hypertension expert contacted by The Times, anyone with a blood 
pressure reading of 195/125 should not be watching "The Sound of Music," let 
alone "Phantom of the Mall." They should be seeing their doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Normal blood pressure for a 40-year-old adult is 140/90, said Dr. Ka Kit Hui, 
an associate professor of medicine at UCLA. Without proper medical care, people 
with a 195/125 reading are prone to heart and kidney problems. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of horror films, only "Exorcist" buffs will understand the irony of 
Linda Blair's upcoming appearance this morning at a Superbowl of Chili Cook-Off 
in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
For 16 years, Marquesa Di Lara Anna Ma. Schott Fonz Abrew De Carrascosa, more 
commonly referred to in certain circles as the mysterious "Lady in Black," was 
buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
That's several miles and one Griffith Park away from Hollywood Memorial Park 
Cemetery. The latter is the burial site of Rudolph Valentino, whose crypt the 
"Lady in Black" visited with some regularity. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Estrellita Del Regil reburied her mother's remains at Hollywood 
Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The new grave, she said, is "about 100 yards and across the lake" from 
Valentino.

BECKER IS TOO MUCH FOR EDBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you do with Boris Becker? 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you want to beat him, you certainly don't do what Stefan Edberg did 
Friday night, which was to just stand there and watch Becker take target 
practice with his serves. 
</P>
<P>
Zap. Zap. Zap. Follow the bouncing ball. Nine aces is pretty tough to beat, 
which is what Edberg discovered when he played Becker in the Nabisco Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who also lost to Becker last month in the Paris Indoor, began another 
month by losing on another continent, 6-1, 6-4. It was a 1-hour 16-minute romp 
on the rug for Becker that has got Edberg thinking about changing strategy for 
the next time they play. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would do anything different in their next match, Edberg said: 
"Yeah, I would play better." 
</P>
<P>
Is anyone playing here better than Becker? Maybe Ivan Lendl, who is No. 1 on 
the computer even if there is a convincing case that Wimbledon and U.S. Open 
champion Becker is No. 1 for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, a five-time Masters champion and a finalist nine times, continued his 
consistency in this event with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over John McEnroe, who, as 
Edberg, had already clinched a spot in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
But because they lost, their penance is daunting. McEnroe must play Becker in 
one semifinal today while Edberg gets Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe thought about his schedule, going from Lendl to Becker. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a firing squad," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 32 meetings between Lendl and McEnroe, the majority of them 
doubtlessly more interesting than their latest brief encounter. Lendl limited 
it to 81 minutes, then hit the turnpike back to Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably thought he might miss a period of his hockey game on TV," McEnroe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who is 17-15 against McEnroe, has won six of their last seven meetings. 
McEnroe's sole victory in that span is a four-set decision in this year's WCT 
Finals in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe had no luck trying to solve Lendl's serve and won only eight points in 
Lendl service games. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lendl: "It's always easy to win if you don't lose your serve." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least Edberg, reduced from player to spectator against Becker, came 
away with renewed respect for his opponent, but also injected a word of 
caution. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the No. 1 player for this year with the results he's had," Edberg said. 
"He believes a lot in himself these days. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be another year next year and he's going to have to work even 
harder to stay there." 
</P>
<P>
Here is how hard Becker worked against Edberg: 
</P>
<P>
He served an ace in the first game, two more in the third game while fighting 
off a break point, broke Edberg for a 3-1 lead, served three more aces for 4-1, 
broke Edberg with a backhand crosscourt pass for 5-1 and closed out the set by 
holding at love, a game which included a feather-light touch volley winner on 
set point. 
</P>
<P>
This is Borisball. 
</P>
<P>
"There are days like that . . . you go out there and you are in a zone," Becker 
said. "You get a break point and all of a sudden, the match is easy." 
</P>
<P>
And if you are seeing Borisball in a zone? 
</P>
<P>
"You just roll over him," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Becker was still spinning. He lost just seven points on his 
serve and four of those occurred in the last game when he eventually served out 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
The only break Becker needed came in the seventh game when he scorched a 
backhand return of Edberg's first serve that left Edberg so stunned, he 
double-faulted at 15-40. 
</P>
<P>
It was routine from there, but winning has become commonplace for Becker. He is 
61-7 for 1989, he has won 28 of his last 30 matches and his 24-1 record on 
carpet is the best among touring pros. 
</P>
<P>
The defending Masters champion, Becker is continuing a remarkable stretch of 
success that began here at last year's event and continued through West 
Germany's victory over Sweden in the Davis Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Masters of last year, I was starting to put it into a higher gear," 
Becker said. "You keep going and going and hopefully it won't start for a few 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang's Masters debut ended on a forgettable note, losing to Aaron 
Krickstein, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), in 1 hour 33 minutes. Chang, who finished 0-3 to 
Krickstein's 1-2, was blanked in the prize money department. Krickstein earned 
$30,000 for the victory. It was a rematch of their Volvo/Los Angeles final in 
September where Chang led, 6-3, 4-1, but lost in three sets. This time, 
Krickstein led, 6-3, 5-2 and Chang was serving for the second set at 6-5, but 
faltered. The similarities in the two matches was not unnoticed by Krickstein. 
"I was thinking of that a little bit," he said. "But even if we had gone into a 
third set, I thought he looked a little tired. He had to do a lot of running." 
Chang, who finished 47-16 for the year, said he was worn out. "The whole match, 
I'm just running so much." Krickstein's goal? "I didn't want to finish 0-3 like 
(Andre) Agassi.

WELLMAN'S TOUCHDOWN: SHADOW OF DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the photo in The Times on Nov. 25 showing Gary Wellman's knee 
supposedly touching the end zone inbounds, I find it interesting that there's a 
shadow under Wellman's knee. How could his knee be touching the ground and 
still have a shadow under it? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if his knee was as inbounds as the photo supposedly shows, it would 
not correlate with the TV picture. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it: The TD should not have been allowed.

CATHOLIC TAKES EXCEPTION TO PHRASE 'HAIL MARY PASS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a member of the Roman Catholic faith, and Los Angeles has a very large 
Catholic population, I find the phrase Hail Mary pass offensive and 
disrespectful in the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
Please cease from using this phrase in the future. 
</P>
<P>
LARRY C. KNIGHT, Rosemead 
</P>
<P>
 EDITOR'S NOTE: The phrase in question was used by quarterback Roger Staubach 
of the Dallas Cowboys, a Roman Catholic, in describing the last-second winning 
pass play in his team's 1975 playoff victory over the Minnesota Vikings. It 
quickly became a part of the language of football and is used with no 
disrespect intended.

JOCKEYS SEEM TO GET BETTER WITH AGE

The national top-10 jockey standings contain some interesting information. All 
of the top six riders -- except (Eddie) Delahoussaye, and he has a national 
riding title -- are past Eclipse Award winners. All of the top six -- except 
(Jose) Santos -- are over 30 years old, and two of them -- (Angel) Cordero and 
(Laffit) Pincay -- are over 40. This seems to be one sport where the cream 
comes to the top -- and stays there.

<P>
On Nov. 18, the headline ran: "Alcohol -- Not Drugs -- Detected in Tarpley." 
</P>
<P>
Please inform your headline writer, copy editor, the sports staff and the 
general public that alcohol is a drug. Period. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol is a drug. Alcohol is a legal drug. Alcohol is the most used and abused 
drug in our nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Australian Peter Senior took a three-stroke lead over Nick Faldo of Britain and 
Jeff Woodland of Australia by shooting his second 66 in the second round of the 
Australian Open on Friday at Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
First-round leader Curtis Strange and Mark Calcavecchia are four shots behind 
Senior at 136. Strange, the U.S. Open champion, followed his course 
record-tying first round of 65 on the 6,847-yard, par-72 Kingston Heath course 
with an inconsistent round of 71 that included seven birdies and six bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, the British Open champion and defending Australian Open champion, 
added a 69 to his first round of 67. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo shot a 67 in the second round to tie Woodland, who had a 69. Australian 
Greg Norman, seeking his fourth Australian Open title, followed his opening 
round of par 72 with a 70 and is 10 shots off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Perry, winless on the PGA tour, and Sherri Turner shot an 8-under-par 64 
to share the lead with three other teams after the second round of the 
$1-million J.C. Penney tournament at Largo, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Also tied for first at 10-under 134 were Bill Britton-Donna White, who shot a 
66 Friday; Andy Bean-Laura Davies (66); and Mike Hulbert-Val Skinner (67).

UC Irvine turned in a solid all-around game for the first time this season and 
beat Bucknell, 85-79, in the first round of the Freedom Bowl tournament Friday 
night at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed into a loss in their opener at the University of San Francisco last 
Saturday and plagued by dismal shooting in a loss to Stanford Monday, the 
Anteaters did things right against Bucknell. 
</P>
<P>
They shot well, especially down the stretch as they pulled away in the final 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine took the lead for good, 77-76, on a jump shot in the lane by Justin 
Anderson, who had 19 points. Jeff Herdman also had 19 and Ricky Butler had 18, 
despite fouling out with more than six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine will face Tennessee Chattanooga, an 86-81 winner over Navy, for the 
championship at 8 tonight. Bucknell plays Navy in the consolation game at 6. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and Herdman each made key free throws in the final minute to seal the 
victory. Herdman also came up with what turned out to be the biggest basket of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
After missing a jumper on an out-of-bounds play, Herdman wrestled the rebound 
away from Bucknell's Mike Joseph and scored on a short bank shot. 
</P>
<P>
That gave Irvine a relatively safe 81-76 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph had 22 points to lead Bucknell. 
</P>
<P>
Bucknell opened a 30-15 lead midway through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine was listless at times in the first half, throwing the ball away 
repeatedly and missing easy shots. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan turned to two freshmen, neither of whom figured 
prominently in the Anteaters' plans when the season began, for a spark. Ben 
Rishwain, a walk-on guard, got Irvine moving with a layup that cut Bucknell's 
lead to 30-19. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Von Lutzow, a forward Mulligan had hoped to red-shirt, added a steal and a 
driving dunk, cutting the Bison lead to 35-30. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine took the lead, 40-38, on a pair of free throws by Herdman with four 
seconds left.

SLUM FINANCING FIGURE FILES BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT: A FEDERAL EXAMINER QUESTIONS THE ABILITY OF HIS COMPANIES TO PAY AN 
ESTIMATED $110 MILLION IN DEBTS. BUT ALEXANDER SPITZER SAYS THE CREDITORS 
SHOULD NOT BE ALARMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The financier behind some of Los Angeles' worst slums has filed for bankruptcy 
protection from creditors, and a federal bankruptcy examiner has questioned the 
ability of his companies to fully pay an estimated $110 million in debts to 
investors and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Spitzer, a central figure in the city's landmark lawsuit this year 
against slumlords and their lenders, filed Monday for protection under Chapter 
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Spitzer's largest business entities also sought Chapter 11 protection. A 
&amp; B Loan Co., a California corporation headed by Spitzer, and California 
Pacific Funding Ltd., a California limited partnership controlled by Spitzer, 
filed last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A bankruptcy examiner's report last month concluded that significant amounts of 
loans extended by A &amp; B Loan and California Pacific could be 
"uncollectable." 
</P>
<P>
However, Spitzer, 69, who estimated that about $80 million is owed to banks and 
$30 million to individuals, said he disagrees with the report. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely convinced we are coming out of this mess whole," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spitzer said that investors should not be alarmed by his bankruptcy filings. 
"As far as the investors are concerned, it is a constructive move. It is for 
their protection." 
</P>
<P>
The investors have included prominent Jewish scholars, rabbis and Soviet 
emigres. Spitzer, a Holocaust survivor, has been a prominent member of the 
city's Jewish community for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The new filings brought to three the number of Inglewood-based business 
entities associated with Spitzer to file in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court central 
district office in Los Angeles. Linmark Investments, a holding company which 
Spitzer also heads, filed last June. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Crosser, senior partner of the accounting firm of Touche Ross &amp; 
Co., had been appointed bankruptcy examiner in the Linmark case by Davis von 
Wittenburg, the U.S. trustee in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the financial records of Linmark, A &amp; B Loan, California 
Pacific and other business entities associated with Spitzer, Crosser 
recommended in early November that a trustee be appointed to take control of 
Linmark, A &amp; B Loan and California Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Crosser also suggested that a trustee investigate past practices of the 
companies and determine whether Linmark's "identification of assets and 
liabilities . . . truly represents the assets and liabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Chapter 11 filings allow a debtor to suspend obligations to creditors while 
attempting to reorganize and to restructure debts. Normally the debtor retains 
control, unless a trustee is appointed to oversee the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
In order for a trustee to be appointed, either the U.S. trustee, creditors or 
another "interested party" must file a motion in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees are appointed in only about 5% of the 2,500 Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
filings each year in the Los Angeles office, Von Wittenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Examiners are appointed in only a few cases each year. In the Linmark case, Von 
Wittenburg said, "We wanted answers to some of the problems, particularly the 
relationships between the various entities." 
</P>
<P>
Von Wittenburg said Spitzer's multiple Chapter 11 filings are "significant" 
because of their potential effect on individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
The civil lawsuit brought by the Los Angeles city attorney and public-interest 
lawyers last March accused Spitzer, A &amp; B Loan, California Pacific and 139 
other defendants with fraud and racketeering in connection with their 
investments in 11 slum properties. 
</P>
<P>
In a settlement reached with the city attorney in July, Spitzer and his loan 
companies promised to change their lending policies. They remain defendants in 
the class-action part of the suit, however, in which damages are being sought 
by hundreds of tenant families. 
</P>
<P>
Spitzer said he had problems with his creditors as a result of the lawsuit: "It 
created conditions that required a certain protection the law is giving us, to 
continue the business and reorganize." 
</P>
<P>
He filed personally for Chapter 11 protection, he noted, because "I am a 
guarantor to all these creditors." 
</P>
<P>
Spitzer said he and his entities are "absolutely not" broke. 
</P>
<P>
"The liabilities of those companies will be met," he said. "The assets are 
there, absolutely, and the overall net worth of the companies is also there." 
</P>
<P>
The examiner's report said that Linmark, A &amp; B Loan and California Pacific 
"operated with little regard of maintaining the separateness of the individual 
corporate or business entities." 
</P>
<P>
The entities seemed dependent on each other for their financial viability, the 
report said, so "deficiencies in net worth" of some companies put the value of 
others in question. 
</P>
<P>
For example, even though Linmark reported $5.3 million in equity on its June 30 
financial statement, the examiner found that as much as $9.4 million of 
Linmark's listed receivables from two other entities had no value. The examiner 
also found that about half of Linmark's $21-million investment in A &amp; B 
Loan -- "its only other asset of significance" -- might not be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
A high number of the loans A &amp; B Loan had issued were in default 90 days or 
more, the report noted. "This loss of recoverable value would further 
exacerbate the adjusted deficiency in assets of Linmark . . . increasing such 
deficiency to approximately $15 million," the examiner wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Spitzer disputed the examiner's conclusions. "The loan 
portfolio was somewhat impacted by the publicity connected with the (city's) 
lawsuit," he said, explaining that some people temporarily stopped making 
payments on loans from his companies. 
</P>
<P>
That is not a problem now, he added. "All the debtors are in a mode of paying." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Magnani, a spokesman for Bank of America, one of Spitzer's largest 
creditors, with a listed claim of $54.5 million, said: "We're in a sort of 
wait-and-see situation, monitoring developments to see what steps the bank will 
take to protect its position." 
</P>
<P>
Some investors contacted this week said they were not sure how to react. 
</P>
<P>
William Shusset, a retired electrician from West Hills who has invested more 
than $100,000, said, "We are not getting enough information. . . . This is a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Four investors in Spitzer companies have lawsuits pending to recover their 
investments, in amounts ranging from $60,000 to $171,000. 
</P>
<P>
But others still expressed confidence. "I haven't the slightest doubt I'm going 
to be paid ultimately," said Sidney P. Schreiber, a Los Angeles businessman who 
is one of the 20 largest unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Greenstadt, a Los Angeles doctor, expressed similar sentiments, adding 
that Spitzer is "an old friend. I have certain confidence in what he is telling 
us. I'm going to be as patient as possible."

PERU ARTIFACTS SEIZED IN RAIDS ARE GOING HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a show of force and moral resolve, U.S. Customs officers on Friday delivered 
a load of Peruvian artifacts valued at $1 million to Los Angeles International 
Airport for return to Peru. Six large crates containing 123 ceramic, stone, 
fiber and metal objects were to be flown Friday night to Lima and received by 
Alan Garcia, president of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
All the objects were seized March 30, 1988, in customs raids on eight Southern 
California dealers and collectors. The raids yielded about 1,300 objects, but 
fewer than 10% of the artifacts have been designated for repatriation after 18 
months of delays, investigations and two trials. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most valuable pieces in the shipment -- some of which were unpacked 
and displayed during a Friday press conference -- are a ceremonial pair of 
Moche Indian ear spools made of gold, with inlaid turquoise and shell, and a 
unique ceramic sculpture known as "Suicide Man," which depicts a man slitting 
his own throat. 
</P>
<P>
These two objects and a few others are thought to have come from Sipan, the 
site of an important archeological dig in northern Peru that has been compared 
to King Tut's tomb in Egypt. Looters discovered a rich tomb in Sipan late in 
1986, and archeologists subsequently have located other graves nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the rare pre-Columbian artifacts were inspected at the airport by 
George C. Roberts, a Los Angeles businessman and representative of Peru who was 
to travel to Lima with the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
"These are too valuable to be in private collections," Roberts said excitedly, 
as he unwrapped a carved stone drinking cup, a cat effigy and some "stirrup 
cups," ceramic sculptures of human or animal forms whose curved handles 
resemble equestrian stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of the part U.S. Customs has been able to play in returning such 
important artifacts to Peru, where they rightfully belong," said customs 
spokesman Joseph Charles, reading from a prepared statement issued by Carol 
Hallet, U.S. commissioner of customs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the action "should send a strong message to collectors of illegal 
archeological remnants, wherever they may be, that smuggling of stolen 
artifacts will not be tolerated in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Return of the 123 objects is a symbolic victory for an impoverished country 
whose cultural patrimony has been plundered for hundreds of years. Repatriation 
has become a cause celebre since the Sipan looting. 
</P>
<P>
The customs raids were the culmination of extensive detective work focusing on 
Southern California dealers and collectors suspected of being involved in an 
international smuggling ring. Customs officers seized about 500 objects from 
Santa Barbara dealer David Swetnam and about 330 pieces from Benjamin Johnson, 
a retired conservator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, who lives in 
Santa Monica and maintains a large art collection. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller numbers of artifacts were seized from Santa Monica dealer Larry Wendt 
and collectors Orman K. Gaspar of Montecito; George H. Gelsebach, Encino; 
Ronald T. Stanman, Los Angeles; Charles Craig, Santa Barbara, and Murray 
Gell-Mann, a Caltech professor who won a Nobel Prize for physics in 1969 and 
lives in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the objects to be returned to Peru were forfeited after the raids; a 
few are being repatriated as the result of legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Only Swetnam and Johnson have gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Swetnam was convicted of fraudulent customs declarations and is currently 
serving a six-month sentence at the federal prison camp in Boron, Calif., but 
he only had to give up nine items. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was sued civilly by Peru in a U.S. court for the return of objects 
found in his possession. But U.S. District Judge William P. Gray ruled that 
Peru failed to prove that the pieces seized from Johnson had actually come from 
Peru and that they had been exported after 1929, the effective date of a 
Peruvian law claiming that the government owns all Peruvian pre-Columbian 
artifacts. All of the objects seized from Johnson were then returned to him. 
</P>
<P>
Peru planned to appeal the Johnson case, but that appeal was denied Thursday, 
Roberts said. As a result, Peru will initiate extradition procedures for 
Swetnam, Johnson and others involved in the raids, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts estimated that about $50 million worth of Peruvian artifacts were 
returned to the U.S. owners from the customs raids and are currently on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"But this repatriation is the beginning of a whole new era," he said.

TOSHIMA'S SLAYER GETS 27 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: WOMAN WAS INNOCENT VICTIM OF WESTWOOD VILLAGE SHOOTING IN 1988. INCIDENT 
SHOCKED L.A. INTO THE REALIZATION THAT STREET VIOLENCE COULD OCCUR ANYWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Gang member Durrell DeWitt Collins was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison 
Friday for the 1988 shooting death of Karen Toshima in Westwood Village, a 
killing that shocked Los Angeles into the realization that street violence is 
not limited to minority neighborhoods in South and East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James A. Albracht noted in sentencing Collins 
that the 23-year-old defendant had committed an "unspeakable act." But he 
observed, at the same time, that Collins had been in trouble since age 11, 
adding that society had also failed Collins. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens again and again," Albracht said. "He (Collins) didn't burst on the 
scene in Westwood. These young people are no secret to us. They are walking 
time bombs. We failed the Durrell Collinses of the world. We failed ourselves 
as a society." 
</P>
<P>
Albracht could have sentenced Collins to two consecutive life terms on two 
convictions: one for shooting Toshima and the other for attempted murder in 
firing at rival gang member Tyrone Swain in a street confrontation that led to 
Toshima's death on Jan. 31, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite what the judge admitted was his emotional "human desire for 
revenge," he ordered that Collins' life terms should run concurrently, making 
him eligible for parole in about 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael J. Duarte urged the judge to sentence Collins to 
consecutive life terms. The prosecutor was supported in his recommendation by a 
letter written to the court by Toshima's younger brother, Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
"Although my sister was not the intended victim, it was nevertheless a killing, 
which was pre-intended, and my sister and family, as a result, have suffered 
because of Collins' premediated action," Kevin Toshima wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Collins has a long history of violence, which his criminal record shows, but 
even more disdaining is his attitude of total disregard for other people and 
his disregard for another's life. He doesn't have any respect for human life 
and that makes him dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who was identified by probation authorities as a member of the Rolling 
60s Crips, sat with head bowed during the 40-minute hearing. He showed no 
emotion when his sentence was announced. His lawyer, Paul Takakjian, said he 
has appealed Collins' convictions. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for a new trial, Takakjian said Collins has "maintained his 
innocence" and has continued to insist that he was not the one who shot 
Toshima. 
</P>
<P>
Toshima, a graphic artist from Long Beach, was strolling with a friend along 
the bustling streets of upscale Westwood Village, adjacent to the UCLA campus, 
late on Jan. 30, 1988, when she was shot in the head. She died the next day at 
UCLA Medical Center after a night on life-support systems. 
</P>
<P>
According to trial testimony, two factions of Crips were confronting each other 
across Broxton Avenue when Tyrone Swain, identified as a member of the 
Mansfield Hustler Crips, started to cross the street and two shots were fired. 
Four eyewitnesses testified that they were fired by Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Police reacted by tripling patrols in Westwood Village and assigning 30 
officers to the murder investigation. The action prompted criticism by black 
and Latino leaders, who complained that authorities had not responded so 
dramatically to gang shootings in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP, described the 
killing of Toshima as a "watershed-type moment" that showed that escalating 
street violence is "non-containable."

KCBS COMMENTATOR BILL STOUT, NEWSCASTING PIONEER, DIES AT 62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bill Stout, whose gravelly voice and acerbic manner proved both an endearing 
and enduring avenue of television news and commentary for nearly four decades, 
died Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
He had been admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Thursday night complaining 
of flu-like symptoms and died of cardiac arrest at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Stout, who literally had lived with the news with both Associated Press and 
City 
</P>
<P>
News Service wire machines in his Beverly Hills home, was 62. He had suffered a 
major heart attack in 1987 that kept him away from his KCBS "Perspective" 
segment of the nightly news for six months. 
</P>
<P>
What proved his final broadcast came Tuesday night on Channel 2's "Action News 
at 6." 
</P>
<P>
At his death, the balding, rumpled newscaster and former anchorman, who 
disdained the makeup and toupees often found in his trade, had been on Los 
Angeles television and radio for 39 years, nearly all of them on Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
His stern, paternal countenance also was known to millions outside this area. 
He was a card-carrying member of the Screen Actors Guild who had portrayed 
newscasters and reporters in several movies, including "Somewhere in Time," 
"House," "The Underground Man" and "The Phantom of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
His awards ranged from Emmys to those from state and national press 
associations to Golden Mikes to a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And he 
expressed mixed enthusiasm for them all, fearing that the accolades that came 
his way might be seen by his audiences as more important than the honesty and 
credibility he sought to bring to his craft. 
</P>
<P>
'Quicker and Better' 
</P>
<P>
He talked early last year with The Times, one of dozens of interviews he 
granted over the years. He spoke of the heart attack he blamed on years of 
smoking, drinking and a love of highly seasoned food. And then he turned to his 
love-hate feelings for TV news. 
</P>
<P>
He said the high-salaried anchormen of television always appalled him as did 
the inexperienced but photogenic reporters whose stories often were used to 
boost ratings rather than provide information. 
</P>
<P>
But television news, he said, "in some ways is quicker and better than 
newspapers. The Symbionese Liberation Army shoot-out (in 1974, which followed 
by a few months the Patty Hearst kidnaping) in South L.A. was a good example. 
We covered it live. Newspapers covered it later in the day. They had great 
stuff, but not as good . . . not with the immediate wallop of TV. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand," he said, warming to a role he relished as television 
critic, "complicated stuff is difficult. Economics, government. We try with 
graphics, but newspapers are better." 
</P>
<P>
He traced the era of chatty anchors and TV "happy talk" to the profit factor 
when station managers in the early 1960s discovered that they could make money 
through news programs. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was neutral or a slight loser," he said of the days when he first 
appeared on the local TV scene in the 1950s, "they (the managers) didn't give a 
damn. But when those who always considered the news departments to be harmless 
collections of Bolsheviks saw them making money, they suddenly said, 'Hey! This 
is too important to leave to you guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
William Stout was indeed one of those "guys" who were the Talking Heads of TV 
news in its infancy -- before electronic innovations and videotape 
instantaneously brought the myriad corners of the world into the nation's 
living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and his colleagues of yesterday had tried to rise above what Edward 
R. Murrow once defined as local news: "A curious mixture of show business, 
carnival huckstering and journalism." 
</P>
<P>
"He was right, of course," Stout would say. "But what used to keep it 
reasonable -- especially at the CBS stations -- was the extra ingredient of 
responsibility. That's gone now," he said as early as 1975. "The worst thing 
anybody can say about a TV newsman these days is that he's 'traditional.' " 
</P>
<P>
A former newspaperman, Stout wrote news before he ever broadcast it. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles and an English major at UCLA, Stout became a reporter at 
the Minneapolis Times in the late 1940s and a correspondent for the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
He moved into broadcasting in 1950 as a radio reporter for KNX, the CBS radio 
station in Los Angeles, and joined Channel 2 in 1953, first as researcher, 
writer and reporter for the investigative series "Special Assignment." 
</P>
<P>
After a few years at KTLA he joined the CBS network in 1963 as a Los Angeles 
correspondent and rejoined KCBS here in 1972 as a reporter and anchor. 
</P>
<P>
His migrations in those years sometimes were traceable to his often abrasive 
treatment of executives and his penchant for argument with anyone within 
earshot. 
</P>
<P>
Maturity had softened him some and many felt had heightened his credibility 
when he became a much-honored commentator in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He talked rather than preached to his audience as he wrote and then offered his 
"Perspective" on topics ranging from women's rights to defense spending to 
press freedom. He approached this most recent work as a wise but curmudgeonly 
friend talking to other friends about how things are and how they could be. 
</P>
<P>
Although his professional persona was saber-like, he was not without his 
personal amusements, and stories abound about his escapades in the watering 
holes of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime friend, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, in a speech last April 
paying tribute to Stout, called him "a great friend and boon companion. For 
years he brought to an evening at the Cock 'n Bull the same traits that he 
still brings to the Action News." 
</P>
<P>
'One of the Best' 
</P>
<P>
CBS anchorman Dan Rather, who was a correspondent in Vietnam with Stout and 
covered several presidential conventions with him, called Stout "one of the 
best broadcast journalists of his time." 
</P>
<P>
"He was a pioneer in the modern era of broadcast news, a pathfinder and 
standard-setter, whose best-known badge was his integrity," Rather said in a 
statement from Malta, where he was covering the Bush-Gorbachev summit. 
</P>
<P>
While Stout labored professionally on the airwaves he continued to return to 
touch his roots in the written word, contributing often to newspaper columns 
and book reviews. 
</P>
<P>
He was much sought after as a banquet speaker for fund-raisers and as a 
eulogist of the dead, where his sentiments for the late departed sometimes were 
salted with personal stories of parties past. 
</P>
<P>
Stout, who is survived by his wife, Margaret, and eight children, always 
refused to change the subject of his commentaries during sweeps periods, when 
TV stations introduce provocative or sensual topics to boost their ratings. 
</P>
<P>
It was ironic, he noted wryly, that the February day in 1988 when his star was 
to be installed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame coincided with the opening of 
that year's sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
"No kidding? Ah, geez," he groaned when told. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at the ceremony itself, the normally stoic newscaster became emotional, 
saying, "It's easy to be sophisticated and blase and say, 'Who cares?' but I am 
overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services are pending.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PIPE BOMB FOUND DURING SEARCH FOR NARCOTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies serving a search warrant in a narcotics investigation 
stumbled unexpectedly onto a lethal pipe bomb in a suspect's apartment in 
Norwalk Friday, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just going about the business . . . of searching the location when one 
of the deputies found a cardboard box . . . marked 'Fragile, Handle With Care,' 
" said Sheriff's Sgt. Glen Bartholomew, head of the narcotics team. The 
suspect, Charles Spooner, 26, eventually admitted that explosives were in the 
box. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies evacuated nearby apartments in the complex at 11544 Imperial Highway 
and bomb squad members disarmed the device. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner was booked on suspicion of possession of an explosive device, 
manufacture of an explosive device and possession of methamphetamines for sale. 
Bail was set at $60,000.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 60 ARRESTS MADE BY ANTI-GANG TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police anti-gang task force in the Rampart Division has been 
sweeping through neighborhoods in the Mid-City area, arresting scores of 
suspected gang members and visiting the homes of others with words of warning 
in an effort to quell a spate of violence that has claimed the lives of three 
people, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's had a quieting effect so far," said Capt. Robert Riley, commander of the 
Rampart station. No violence between warring gangs has been reported since the 
task force of 40 officers moved in on Monday, he said. The officers have made 
more than 60 arrests involving assault, drug possession, burglary and auto 
theft, Riley said. About 80% of those arrested belong to gangs, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'POLITE BANDIT' GETS 28-YEAR PRISON TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man prosecutors dubbed the "Polite Bandit" because of his courteous manners 
while robbing small businesses was sentenced Friday to 28 years and 8 months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber imposed the sentence on Gary Allen 
Smith, 45, of Long Beach in connection with a string of 30 robberies, 18 of 
which occurred in the San Fernando Valley last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had asked that Smith be sentenced to 30 years, nine years less than 
the maximum, because Smith pleaded guilty before the case went to trial. Smith 
was arrested in April at a drug treatment center in Tarzana when his mother 
turned him in after her car was linked to several of the robberies, authorities 
said.

SALVADOR STRIFE HITS HOME IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Rivera has never been to El Salvador, but this week her family was 
unexpectedly drawn into that country's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Mario Rivera, a 28-year-old Salvadoran immigrant, traveled with 
their two children to El Salvador on a family visit Nov. 1. A few days later, 
leftist guerrillas entered San Salvador, beginning an offensive that led 
Wednesday to the evacuation of American diplomats and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Now, most of the U.S. Embassy staff has left the country. And Mario Rivera is 
stuck in San Salvador without a visa and no prospects of obtaining one soon, 
despite his wife's anguished calls to her senators and congressman. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there's a lot of injustices here," Nancy Rivera, 30, a bank manager, 
said Friday morning as she sat with her children in their Canoga Park home. 
"Governments can pardon murderers, but they can't get a family man out of a 
war-torn country." 
</P>
<P>
Since the rebel offensive began three weeks ago, many in Southern California's 
Salvadoran community of 350,000 have felt much of the same pain and anxiety 
suffered by that country's residents. 
</P>
<P>
In the last month, some, like Nancy Rivera, have been separated from their 
relatives. Others, like Mario Rivas, a 27-year-old employee of La Placita 
Church whose father has disappeared during the fighting, have seen their 
families directly touched by the continuing political violence. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Nancy Rivera is still in telephone contact with her husband, who is 
staying with his mother in San Salvador. She has turned to her elected 
representatives for help, making almost daily calls to the offices of U.S. Rep. 
Anthony Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) for the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera believes her husband is the victim of the slow-working bureaucracy of 
the U.S. State Department. Mario Rivera entered the United States illegally in 
1984 and tried to legalize his status after he married her. They met while 
working at a Van Nuys pizzeria, where he is an assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. immigration officials told Rivera he would have to return to El Salvador 
and re-enter the United States with a valid visa. The American Embassy in San 
Salvador had not completed the paper work when the new round of fighting began. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Rivera and the two children -- Coire, 8, and Jarrett, 2 -- were trapped 
for several days in a working-class suburb of San Salvador where some of the 
heaviest fighting of the offensive has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't watch the news because every time I saw the news I would start 
looking for my children," Nancy Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
When embassy officials began evacuating Americans from the war-torn city, Mario 
rushed the children to the airport. More problems awaited them there. The 
children are American citizens, but embassy officials would not allow them on 
the chartered evacuation plane because they had no adult to fly with them. 
Mario Rivera, a Salvadoran citizen, had to stay behind. He then tried to put 
the children on a commercial flight, but the airline would not honor the return 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
With no money to buy new tickets, the children were stranded. Then a group of 
Americans who were at the airport waiting to be evacuated passed around a hat 
and collected $450 to pay for the children's plane fare. 
</P>
<P>
When her children arrived at Los Angeles International Airport late Thursday, 
Nancy Rivera said, they were thin and weak. Both had lost several pounds 
because they had gone without food or water for several days. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the stores, but they didn't have anything in them," Coire said. "I 
saw kids on the street asking for food and clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Hatfield, a field representative for Beilenson's office who has called 
San Salvador on Rivera's behalf, said it may be some time before Mario Rivera 
can return. 
</P>
<P>
"The embassy (in San Salvador) is operating on an emergency basis," Hatfield 
said. "The political situation down there is going to determine what happens to 
his visa application." 
</P>
<P>
At La Placita Church, parishioners and clergymen have also asked for U.S. 
government intervention to rescue endangered relatives of a Southern California 
man. The congregation is praying for 51-year-old Guillermo Rivas, father of 
Mario Rivas, a community worker with the downtown Los Angeles church. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said his father disappeared Nov. 21 from his home in Ilopango, a suburb 
of San Salvador. That day, uniformed members of the Salvadoran Treasury Police 
arrested his father, accusing him of keeping a supply of arms in the home, 
Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
The police found nothing in the home, Rivas said, but they took his father into 
custody. He has not been heard from since. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to pressure the Salvadoran government to release his father, 
Rivas called the offices of U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles). At the 
congressman's request, U.S. officials in El Salvador contacted the Treasury 
Police, a spokeswoman for the congressman said. The Salvadoran authorities said 
they did not know his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
"That fills me with pain and worry," Mario Rivas said in Spanish. "Because I 
know that means I may never see him again." 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said his brother, Miguel Angel Rivas, was kidnaped under similar 
circumstances in November, 1986, and has not been seen since. After trying to 
find him for three years, Mario fears that his brother -- and now perhaps his 
father -- are dead. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart tells me that my brother is alive somewhere in jail," Mario said. 
"But that hope is destroyed by the reality of El Salvador. I know that when 
someone is arrested and they don't appear after a month, the person is never 
going to be heard from again."

L.A. LOSES A STRONG VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The angriest voice in Los Angeles television was cut off yesterday. Bill Stout, 
62, the man who hectored generals in Vietnam and sycophants in City Hall, died 
of cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
All TV news people read. Stout could also write. And ask hard questions. He 
learned his journalism at UCLA in the days before reporters and anchors were 
supposed to be beautiful, handsome or at least avuncular. Stout's strength was 
to grow up skeptical and intellectual; he understood war, politics and the 
petty lies people tell each other. On screen, he was sarcastic. Off screen, he 
could be sardonic. Funny, too. 
</P>
<P>
He cocked his eyebrow at the audience and told his version of the whole story. 
Station managers and sponsors didn't always like whole stories because 
executives also tend to live with petty lies and half-told truths. So Stout 
moved around in his 40-year broadcasting career, from network to independent 
channel and back to network again. For the last few years he has been the news 
conscience of KCBS-TV, doing a commentary called "Perspective," spouting truth, 
spewing opinion and making clear which was which. 
</P>
<P>
Stout and his spouse, Peggy, were news junkies, the first ones on the block to 
have a computer that could talk to other computers, the first to have a wire 
service clacking in the family room. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago he had a heart attack. He came back on screen looking older, 
balder, more tired but no less furious about the wayward ways of public life. 
His was a voice suitable for judgment day, and some days in the '60s and '70s 
Stout seemed to be speaking for the national character -- or lack of it. From 
one medium to another, we thank you, Bill. You were so often right.

FELONY CASE FACES PAIR IN ARMS STASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Felony charges will be sought against a Cal State Northridge student and 
another man, both suspected gang members, after a cache of weapons was 
discovered in a student housing apartment last month, campus police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Cho, 18, a student at the school, and John Lee, 18, of Northridge were 
arrested after a Nov. 21 search of Cho's apartment at University Village in the 
10000 block of Zelzah Avenue, Lt. Mark Hissong said. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, investigators will ask the Los Angeles County district attorney to 
charge the two men with possession of stolen property and possession of a 
firearm on a state university campus, both felonies, Hissong said. 
</P>
<P>
Hissong said the officers found and confiscated seven rifles and four handguns 
and arrested Cho and Lee, who were in the apartment. Some of the guns were 
openly displayed and others were concealed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is probably the largest number of guns we have ever taken out of a campus 
apartment," Hissong said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the seized weapons belongs to a Northridge homeowner who reported it 
stolen during a burglary in October, Hissong said. Investigators are still 
attempting to trace the ownership of the other weapons and determine why they 
were in Cho's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is gang-related," Hissong said. "We are reasonably convinced the 
suspects are gang members. We don't know if this is where the gang kept all 
their weapons or if this is just one portion of what they have available." 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment for Cho and Lee, who were released on $5,000 bail each, is 
scheduled in San Fernando Municipal Court on Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Hissong said the investigation began after a student reported seeing a man 
carry a gun into Cho's apartment. When officers arrived, Cho granted them 
permission to search the apartment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest, Cho has moved out of the student housing complex, Hissong 
said.

L.A. ZOO JOINS GLOBAL EFFORT TO SAVE RHINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day in August, an unsuspecting female rhinoceros made its daily grub search 
through the jungles of Sumatra, Indonesia, fell into a pit and unwittingly 
volunteered for a breeding program intended to replenish the species. 
</P>
<P>
The rare rhinoceros was brought to the Los Angeles Zoo earlier this week, part 
of an international program to preserve endangered wildlife. Zookeepers said 
the unnamed 7-year-old will winter in the Southland before moving to a 
permanent home at the Bronx Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, while the half-ton visitor splashed water and wallowed in mud at a 
pool side press conference in Los Angeles, zoo officials described the program 
to establish rhino breeding groups in four U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the Indonesian government and zoos in Cincinnati, 
San Diego, New York and Los Angeles, five males and five females will be sent 
to the United States as they are brought into captivity, said Jim Doherty, 
curator for the New York Zoological Society. 
</P>
<P>
A preserve also is being established in Indonesia, Los Angeles Zoo Director 
Warren Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce climatic changes for the rhinos, Los Angeles has been the stopping 
place for the animals headed east, program officials said. In their natural 
habitat -- the humid rain forests of Southeast Asia -- temperatures range from 
80 to 95 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the program is to ensure that the estimated 500 members of the 
Sumatran species do not die out and to help restore balance to a wildlife 
environment that has been upset by Indonesia's industrial and agricultural 
development, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Doherty said that rhinos, along with "countless other species," are being 
squeezed out of their natural homeland, as rain forests are chopped down for 
lumber and to make room for cash crops such as palm oil plants. 
</P>
<P>
"There are animals that are going to disappear that haven't even been 
identified yet," the curator said. "It's really a problem with people. The 
damage is, in part, because people in countries such as our own are not as 
careful about conservation as we should be. We are the ones providing a major 
market for wood and wood products."

VIOLENCE POLARIZES EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was shocked and then grimly satisfied to read the excerpt from the writing of 
the Rev. Ellacuria. Clearly, he advocates and justifies terrorism, although not 
at all creatively; the arguments he puts forth have been previously stated in 
humanistic terms by philosophers, sociologists and psychologists for 200 or 300 
years. And yet, he makes perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
Should not those who engage in, advocate, or support oppressive violence expect 
to meet with violent punishment at the hands of those they have harmed? And 
indeed, the Rev. Ellacuria, a supporter of the oppressive violence of 
communism, which is even now being torn down by angry people all around the 
world, has met with his own punishment. With his death, justice is served.

VIOLENCE POLARIZES EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reading the excerpts from "Freedom Made Flesh," by Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria 
(Op-Ed Page, Nov. 21), one feels compelled to ask, which is most evil in El 
Salvador, the left-leaning rebels (communists to us), the militarists running 
the country, or the Roman Catholic Church? Sadly, the answer is that all are 
equally culpable and will have the blood of the people on their hands for many 
years to come. 
</P>
<P>
The now deceased Rev. Ellacuria saw "good violence" mandated by his 
interpretation of the Bible, as something which was liberating, a kind of 
rightful wrath. Shame on all who think this way. No good reasons can be 
advanced to support murder and destruction. It is no surprise that he died at 
the hand of violence, it seems clear that he called it on himself. 
</P>
<P>
What solace may have been possible for the El Salvadorans by their church and 
its clergy has clearly disappeared. History has shown repeatedly that when 
religious institutions are actively a part of the political process or attempt 
to usurp it, substituting one hierarchical model of violent authority for 
another, democratic processes are overwhelmed and government by consensus 
becomes impossible.

President Bush tells us we need to continue massive aid to the El Salvadoran 
government. Congress approves continued military aid. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador's President Cristiani is not able to control the atrocities 
committed by members of the military. 
</P>
<P>
He promises to bring the murders of the Jesuits to justice -- something that 
has never happened in similar cases. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. aid goes to the military which is out of the control of the country's 
president. The U.S. supports atrocities committed against innocent people in El 
Salvador. The U.S. violates its own stated principles of respecting basic human 
rights.

Where's the greatness of a country that can't coherently promote its own 
ideals?

'DO WE REALLY NEED THE B-2?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times has always been considered a thoughtful news organization fully aware 
of the influence it wields over a larger readership. But we find your editorial 
on the B-2 very disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
One concludes that your position was based on an "analysis" by the 
International Institute for Strategic Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Let me cite a few points to clear up some of the misunderstanding the Strategic 
Studies report obviously created. 
</P>
<P>
Cost per warhead studies are what you want to make of them. For example, the 
Harvard analysis is used by The Times to conclude that using a B-2 would cost 
more than using a Midgetman missile. It would seem a system that can carry a 
wide variety of weapons, in an equally wide variety of sizes and strengths, and 
be able to do it time and again across the spectrum of conflict (from 
conventional to nuclear) is a very "cost-effective" weapon system. The small 
ICBM does have its utility as a deterrent. But doing a warhead "return on 
investment analysis" is in this instance, specious. 
</P>
<P>
Let's turn to another issue -- whether or not the "stealthy" quality of the B-2 
is of any value. Once again The Times focuses on only part of the picture. Even 
in the most intense exchange (an unlikely scenario) the number of 
surface-to-air missile sites -- at last count more than 10,000 -- would be 
considerbly reduced but not all would be destroyed. The Soviets overbuilt their 
system for just that reason. 
</P>
<P>
Weapon systems must be developed based upon what can best provide the highest 
deterrent value this country's technology can produce. At the same time it must 
give us the most effective war-fighting capability should deterrence fail. The 
B-2 bomber falls into the "highly qualified" category on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
Together with land- and sea-based missiles, the other two legs of our strategic 
triad, it will keep the peace and lend stability as we work our way through 
this critical period in history. 
</P>
<P>
One final point. What has been left out of the editorial is any discussion of 
the pivotal role the B-2 plays in the START negotiations. The underlying 
rationale of START seeks to shift a greater portion of the deterrent mission to 
the more stable bomber element of the triad. The premium on the strategic 
bombers in the START negotiations makes it imperative we have a bomber capable 
of penetrating the sophisticated Soviet air defenses into the next century. 
That system is the B-2.

VIOLENCE POLARIZES EL SALVADOR

<TEXT>
<P>
As a former chief of the political section of our embassy in San Salvador, I 
fully share the views of George Black and Anne Nelson on the outrageous torture 
and murder of the Jesuit priests ("Why the Right Would Slay Priests in El 
Salvador," Opinion, Nov. 26). The circumstances of the slaughter and subsequent 
developments make it a safe bet that the national record of never trying a 
military officer for human rights violations will remain unblemished. 
</P>
<P>
Let us not forget that, in the brief period between Ronald Reagan's election 
and inauguration, the Salvadoran hard-liners celebrated the political demise of 
Jimmy Carter and his human rights policy by assassinating six leaders of the 
legal opposition, four American religious women and two American land reform 
advisers. Now they are sending another clear message of their determination 
never to share power -- least of all to let themselves be ousted like the 
Somozas of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
In a country that has become increasingly polarized in violence since the 
wholesale massacres of 1932, the issue is not whether President Alfredo 
Cristiani was democratically elected. It is whether he or any other civilian 
leader can avert or punish such acts of terrorism while seriously negotiating 
with the rebel forces.

STATE'S DRINKING WATER SUPPLY FROM DELTA FACES NEW THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Southern California we cannot survive on water supplies available locally; 
natural supplies meet less than one-third of our current needs. We must import 
the rest from Northern California and from the Colorado River. Now, according 
to your editorial, another element, a suspected cancer-causing agent, 
trihalomethane, has been added to the controversy surrounding Southern 
California's need for water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
</P>
<P>
Water demands in Southern California are expected to increase roughly 20% by 
the year 2000. Our region still faces a highly undependable water supply in the 
future even though we lead the state in efficient use of water, including water 
conservation, water reclamation and ground-water management. Without a 
reliable, high-quality water supply, Southern California cannot avoid the 
adverse impact on our economy, our life styles, our very livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
The latest report of potential contamination of one of Southern California's 
important sources of water adds urgency to the cry that elected officials and 
policy-makers address the management and optimum utilization of this most 
precious resource. In providing us with the keys to the solutions, these 
decision-makers can place emphasis on understanding and appreciating the water 
needs of all regions and all sectors of the state, and build a bridge of 
cooperation among them all. 
</P>
<P>
A solution is out there. Everyone needs to be involved.

STATE'S DRINKING WATER SUPPLY FROM DELTA FACES NEW THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Year after year we see our water and power bills go up. According to The Times, 
we on the City Council should take "the broader view" (editorial, Nov. 9) and 
approve increases, even when they are not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago the council requested the chief administrative officer (CAO) 
to review the requests of the Department of Water and Power so that we, like 
the Public Utilities Commission, could have a second opinion. He has done just 
that. His review noted that the DWP has a $47-million cash surplus last year, 
and that the current trend, if it continues, could generate a $50-million 
surplus at year-end even without a rate increase. In view of this, a rate 
increase is simply not justified. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported that the increase to the average residential customer's bill 
would be about 5.9%. This is misleading. If DWP's 8.4% rate request is 
approved, customers could see their bills increase more than 17% simply because 
of the high cost of purchasing water and the automatic pass-through provisions 
that apply. Allowing DWP to keep up with the "cost of living" is one thing -- 
permitting bills to rise more than three times that amount is excessive. 
</P>
<P>
As New York rating agencies know, the Los Angeles City Council will not let the 
DWP's bond ratings slump. As Moody's says, "Timely rate increase is the key to 
good credit." I simply would add, "if justified." The City Council has not been 
hesitant to approve rate increases if the funds are essential. It approved a 
12% rate increase last year.

FMLN "terrorists" attack the U.S.-supported government of El Salvador, while 
Contra "freedom fighters" attack the U.S.-opposed government of Nicaragua. I 
imagine the appellations are reversed in the media of, say, Cuba and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
When these threadbare and profoundly flawed pejoratives come from the mouths of 
official spokesmen, is it any wonder that negotiations fail? 
</P>
<P>
Does President Bush really believe that these characterizations are valid? How 
can we play a positive role in the resolution of these blood-soaked guerrilla 
wars while broadcasting such divisive misrepresentations?

HIGH SCHOOLS DON'T EXIST JUST TO TRAIN ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pity the poor Los Angeles City high school football teams that will lose 
players just before playoff time because of academic ineligibility. Pity the 
coaches who demand that the players spend so much of their non-school time 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from Lonnie White's column on Nov. 21, you would think that the high 
schools existed for the purpose of training athletes and not minds. Let's get 
our prioities straight. Students attend school to get an education first. 
Extra-curricular activites should be considered only after students have proven 
themselves capable of meeting their academic responsibilites.

MEDIA CAN'T KEEP ELWAY IN THE GRASP; 
</P>
<P>
BRONCOS: QUARTERBACK HAS BEEN UNDER SCRUTINY THIS SEASON. RUMORS OF A DRINKING 
PROBLEM ARE FINALLY MAKING HIM STRIKE BACK.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You guys are like Attila the Hun of the media. -- Howie Long, Raider defensive 
lineman, to Denver reporters. 
</P>
<P>
In this Mile High City, the sky is often cobalt blue and the air is thin -- so 
thin that Bronco quarterback John Elway can sometimes hardly breathe. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment he arrived, Broncomaniacs have been fascinated by Elway. Their 
hunger for news has been insatiable. Nothing was too trivial when it came to 
the media's pursuit of Denver's All-Pro quarterback. So intense was the 
scrutiny that Elway felt as if he were under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
Where does Elway get his hair cut? Inquiring minds want to know. 
</P>
<P>
Who fills Elway's teeth? Inquiring minds want to know. 
</P>
<P>
What does Elway eat for lunch and how much did he tip the waiter? Inquiring 
minds want to know. 
</P>
<P>
How much did Elway pay for his house? Inquiring minds want to know. 
</P>
<P>
And the Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News, locked in fierce competition, 
have dutifully presided over the Elway Watch. 
</P>
<P>
Although his eloquence doesn't match his extraordinary arm, Elway had always 
accommodated the media, answering the same questions over and over again with 
the same cliches. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, he snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Elway went to war with the media over its intrusions into his personal life and 
unsubstantiated allegations that a drinking problem was supposedly affecting 
his play. 
</P>
<P>
He began avoiding reporters as if he were eluding pass rushers. When the media 
tried to get a comment from Elway after former Raider coach Mike Shanahan was 
rehired as a Bronco assistant, the quarterback hid and left through a back 
door, where he was met by a teammate driving Elway's truck. 
</P>
<P>
Elway saved his comments on Shanahan for his TV show, which nets him a reported 
$200,000. Make no mistake, Elway is well compensated, earning $12.7 million 
over six years in salary and millions more from off-the-field business deals. 
Yet, he wondered if the price of fame was too high. 
</P>
<P>
Why did he avoid the media? 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be a quarterback here, but it came down to if they painted the 
building, the media wanted to know what I thought about it," Elway said. "I was 
avoiding questions instead of saying no. I just didn't want to answer them. I 
held a lot of animosity toward (the media) and I didn't want to give them any 
time. I had been very open with them." 
</P>
<P>
Elway opened up to Rick Reilly of Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm about to suffocate," Elway told Reilly. "They talk about my hair, they 
talk about my teeth, they talk about how much I tip, how much I drink, how I'm 
playing, when I'll talk to the media. I'm sick of it." 
</P>
<P>
An example of what Elway meant: After visiting the houses of Denver luminaries 
on Halloween, the Rocky Mountain News reported that Elway handed out Reese's 
Cups and miniature Kit-Kat bars. 
</P>
<P>
Another example: After Elway was seen drinking beer and playing backgammon at a 
local night spot, it was dutifully reported in a gossip column. 
</P>
<P>
And yet another example: After Elway was late to his own charity foundation's 
dinner because he had to have a neighbor help him with his bow tie, an item 
about this failing made the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
But all has not been light-hearted. 
</P>
<P>
Amid rumors that Elway has a drinking problem, sportscaster Jim Gray of ESPN 
confronted him during an interview. Elway denied it. He has never been arrested 
for driving under the influence or for public intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the drinking allegation) bothered me because I look at myself as a role 
model for young kids, and when they say things like that that are totally 
untrue, there's going to be people that believe it whether it's true or not," 
Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the (media) don't think I'm playing well, they've got to find a reason, 
therefore they were following me and checking my background." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Post columnist Jay Mariotti, then with the Rocky Mountain News, called 
Elway "a greedy and scared punk" and advised him: "Go ahead John, leave. Get 
out of Denver, baby. Go. You'll be crawling back here after a week." 
</P>
<P>
But more people apparently thought Mariotti should leave than Elway. 
</P>
<P>
Mariotti was doing his radio show at a local restaurant when four police 
officers appeared and surrounded him. When Mariotti asked why they were there, 
the officers told him that two death threats had been phoned in against him. 
This, of course, is the town where talk-show host Alan Berg was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Told that Mariotti's life had been threatened, Elway said with a laugh: "He 
deserves it. No, that's off the record. He called me a greedy young punk. The 
guy's never around here. He's one of these guys that like to take potshots. I 
don't worry too much about Jay Mariotti." 
</P>
<P>
Mariotti said: "My contention in my column was that he's smothering himself. He 
does so much on the side that the media isn't smothering him, he's smothering 
himself with his profit-making ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned into a big furor in town. It almost became me vs. Elway in this, and 
I didn't want it to be that way. I was just so infuriated with what he was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
"I became infuriated with a smear job on the media because, all in all, if you 
compare it to Philadelphia and New York, we've pretty much laid off him. We 
don't smother him." 
</P>
<P>
But Bronco fans sided overwhelmingly with Elway. Of 363 telephone calls the 
Broncos received, 350 supported Elway. Several callers said they planned to 
cancel their newspaper subscriptions in support of Elway. Even Denver Mayor 
Federico Pena called Elway to offer support. 
</P>
<P>
Since making his comments to Sports Illustrated, Elway said he feels as if a 
burden had been removed. Now, at peace with himself since declaring a truce 
with the media, Elway has begun to play like the quarterback who led the 
Broncos to consecutive Super Bowl seasons in 1986 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
"He got what was bothering him off his chest," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said. 
"He has always done a good job handling the press. He has always been available 
and talked to them in good times and bad times." 
</P>
<P>
These are good times for the Broncos, who have already clinched the AFC West 
championship with a 10-2 record going into Sunday's game against the Raiders at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Elway has been sub-par, passing for 2,268 yards and 14 touchdowns with 14 
interceptions. He is ninth in the AFC with a 73.3 quarterback ranking. There 
are signs, however, that he is about to break out of his slump. 
</P>
<P>
After missing the Broncos' 14-10 victory over the Redskins in Washington 
because of a stomach virus, Elway returned last Sunday to pass for 217 yards 
and four touchdowns in the first half of Denver's 41-14 win over Seattle. He 
sat out the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of Elway happens to coincide with the return of Shanahan, who 
coached him before leaving to become coach of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
How much has this helped Elway? 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's kind of hard to say," Shanahan said. "What I have been able to 
do is spend a little more time with John than Dan (Reeves) did." 
</P>
<P>
Elway said Shanahan is determined to beat the Raiders and has been all business 
in meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"He's said more in 45 minutes than he usually says in three hours this week in 
meetings," Elway said of Shanahan. "There's definitely a little animosity there 
as far as Mike is concerned. He told me Monday that 38 points in the first half 
would not be enough."

COWBOYS: PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY, TROY AIKMAN HAS BEEN JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING 
THE NFL'S NO. 1 DRAFT CHOICE SHOULD BE.

<P>
Troy Aikman doesn't feel like a rookie. Sure, he has played in only seven NFL 
games, but he just doesn't feel like a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Understand, the Cowboys' $11-million Wunderkind quarterback from UCLA has been 
memorizing the playbook and visualizing opposing defenses since April. He has 
been knocked out of a game with a concussion and knocked out of a month with a 
broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
He has had the best passing day for a rookie in the history of the league. And 
he has had some of the worst. During his first four games, his quarterback 
rating threatened to dip below his age -- he just turned 23. 
</P>
<P>
Then he was out five weeks, came back and passed for 638 yards in the next two 
games, a better two-week total than the ones compiled by Dan Marino (614), 
Boomer Esiason (608), Jim Everett (600) and Joe Montana (595). 
</P>
<P>
He has heard boos at Texas Stadium and rave reviews by opposing coaches and 
television commentators. 
</P>
<P>
And the Philadelphia Eagles supposedly put a $500 bounty on his head. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, all this didn't happen in the first dozen weeks of his first NFL 
season? Heck, lots of guys go through whole careers without ever having to 
worry about bounty hunters. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long season so far," Aikman said, sounding a bit weary. "I don't 
know how a rookie is supposed to feel, but I don't feel like I don't have any 
idea what's going on. I really feel pretty good and I think that stems back to 
getting in here in April for quarterback school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to sit here and tell you I feel like a seasoned veteran and know 
everything teams are trying to do, because that's not the truth. But I feel 
good out there for the most part and I don't want anyone around me to sense 
that I'm a rookie. I don't want to be a liability." 
</P>
<P>
Liability? The Cowboys made him a multimillionaire because of his assets. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman is sort of the quintessential quarterback of the 1990s. A regular 
Stepford Quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
He's just the right size at 6-foot-4 and 216 pounds. He's quick and can run 
like a fullback if he has to. He has an efficient release and a strong, 
accurate arm. He even has a sturdy jaw. 
</P>
<P>
In his first two games after returning from the injury that sidelined him for 
five weeks, Aikman passed for 379 yards -- an NFL rookie record -- against 
Phoenix, and the next week ran for 71 yards to lead the team in rushing against 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the mental part of the game. This is where Aikman really 
excels. 
</P>
<P>
"He has shown signs that he's going to be an excellent quarterback because not 
only does he have the physical talent, he has the mental talent as well," 
Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been able to zip in as a rookie and really get a grasp of a complicated 
offense. He has been able to read defenses, and most of the time he has 
performed extremely well. I do believe he's ahead of most quarterbacks coming 
into this league at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
It has been a crash course, to be sure, but Aikman already has gone headlong 
into life in the NFL and come up smiling. He has it all and he has seen it all. 
</P>
<P>
But there is something missing that has kept this season from being the stuff 
of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas is 1-11. 
</P>
<P>
And Steve Walsh, the Cowboys' other rookie quarterback, led the team to the 
lone victory while Aikman was sidelined with the broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, (with the team) having only won one game, I'm 
probably enjoying it as much as I can," Aikman said. "But it's tough to stay 
mentally up when you're having the season we're having." 
</P>
<P>
Long before Oklahoma's Barry Switzer decided to stick with Jamelle Holieway -- 
after Aikman had broken his leg -- and called UCLA's Terry Donahue, saying, 
"Have I got a quarterback for you," people were predicting big things for 
Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
And if you believe half of the glowing praise you hear these days, it looks as 
though Aikman was a steal at a mere $1.86 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Fame quarterback/television analyst Joe Namath describes him with 
phrases like "one-of-a-kind package" and "a more accurate passer than (Denver's 
John) Elway." 
</P>
<P>
One defensive lineman described Aikman as "tougher'n hell." His teammates 
fairly gush. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman doesn't resort to the quarterback slide, which no doubt sends waves of 
fear through Johnson every time his quarterback collides head-on with a 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
But no one questions Aikman's ability to tuck away the football, lower his head 
and get the job done. On third and fourth downs, he has run for enough yardage 
to pick up a first down on eight of nine attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Guts and testimonials alone won't get you into the Hall of Fame, however. So 
Aikman had better work on his statistics. He has completed just 90 of 179 
passes for 1,209 yards and has thrown 12 interceptions while passing for only 
four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Cowboys are young and struggling, but 12 interceptions in seven 
games? There must be a little rookie in Aikman after all. 
</P>
<P>
"You get so many different looks in the pros as opposed to college," he said, 
"and the level of talent is so much better. Therefore, the margin of error for 
a quarterback to throw the football is that much less. 
</P>
<P>
"The five games I missed, I hated to miss the ballgames, but I think it helped 
me in the long run. I was able to learn in a relaxed position." 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to relax when you're the first rookie quarterback to start a 
season opener for the Cowboys since Roger Staubach in 1969. Aikman was born in 
Cerritos and moved to Henryetta, Okla., at the age of 12. He says he would much 
rather live in Dallas than in Los Angeles, but he's quickly learning that a 
Cowboy quarterback -- even one in boots and a cowboy hat -- can't just blend 
into the crowd in this part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when it's really fun and exciting and other times when you 
don't want to have any part of it, you just want to get away," he said. "If I 
have a choice, I'll stay in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't felt any more pressure here than I did at UCLA. . . . I'll never 
live up to everyone's expectations, anyway, so I just do the best job I can." 
</P>
<P>
The competition between rookies Aikman and Walsh for the starting job, 
chronicled in a preseason Sports Illustrated story titled, "Duel in the Sun," 
wasn't much of a shootout. It was over long before the first game of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson assured everyone that both quarterbacks would get an equal chance. But 
not all quarterbacks are created equal. Aikman was just excited about getting 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Steve and I looked at this year as a chance to play, which neither of us 
might have gotten had we gone to a team with an established veteran," Aikman 
said. "But I feel, and so does Steve, that more than likely, one of us will be 
dealt at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to stay in Dallas, but I'm not concerned about my career in the NFL. 
I feel like I'll do well wherever I go. I've got other things on my mind than 
trying to figure out what management will do." 
</P>
<P>
There's no big secret what management will do. Just ask Johnson about the 
Cowboys' future. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe we've made some progress," he said. "I do believe that with the 
draft picks we have and with a young group and a quarterback like Troy Aikman, 
the Cowboys will have a very good future." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Aikman has managed to remain convincingly humble through all this. He 
is still the same polite, Clark Kent type, who acts super only when he's in 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
And veteran quarterback Babe Laufenberg, the Cowboys' backup who has relayed a 
lot of signals but hasn't thrown a pass this season, does his best to help keep 
Aikman on an even keel. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman might be in the spotlight on Sunday, but he has other, decidedly less 
glamorous duties the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Laufenberg located his favorite delivery service, told him, 
"Turkey, with Muenster cheese," handed him a five-dollar bill and sent Troy 
Aikman, the world's best-paid errand boy, on a sandwich run. 
</P>
<P>
"See there, he's still just a rookie," Laufenberg told bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so maybe sometimes he does feel like a rookie.

EX-EAGLE SAYS BOUNTIES MAY HAVE BEEN OFFERED 
</P>

<P>
The case of Buddy Ryan vs. The World is now in Week 2, with Ryan talking about 
his Wednesday interview with Warren Welsh, the NFL's director of security. The 
topic: bounties, of course; whether Ryan offered any of his Eagles cash to put 
a hit on some Dallas Cowboys last week. 
</P>
<P>
While Ryan said Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson will look like "a clown" for raising 
the allegations, one of Ryan's former players said the NFL ought to take the 
Cowboys' claims seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Packers tight end John Spagnola, who played two years for Ryan in Philadelphia 
before getting cut before the 1988 season, said: "In this particular instance 
... you have an overzealous coach who does preach to his players to hurt and 
get people out of the game. Whether or not money was offered remains to be 
seen, through the findings of the investigation. Personally, I don't see it as 
being out of the realm of possibility, since I played for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ugly side of football, the way the game is taught in that particular 
city. The fact that it surfaced is probably good in that hopefully there won't 
be that kind of stuff in the future. I think Ryan will be more careful. He's 
the only coach I've ever heard of to preach that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Michael Haddix, another former Eagle with the Packers, said: "When I 
was there we had incentives to make hits and plays. Especially the guys on 
special teams. At the time it wasn't directed at any player. Nobody ever said, 
'We've got to get this guy out of the game.' It was directed at getting your 
blocks or making a big play. Guys on special teams don't get to play a lot 
sometimes, and the coaches try to give you incentives to go out and feel good 
about that limited involvement you have in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Spagnola, a 10-year veteran, said players who have taken this bounty business 
literally should bear some responsibility: "The other part is the player has to 
take responsibility and not take everything literally. Some players would hear 
it and understand that there's a message implicit; others take it literally. 
The older players tend not to take it quite so literally." 
</P>
<P>
Spagnola and other NFL players expressed disappointment that Cowboys kicker 
Luis Zendejas would tell the league the names of the "five or six" Eagles who 
apparently warned him that he was a target. (Quarterback Troy Aikman and punter 
Mike Saxon were on the hit list too, Johnson said.) Zendejas, recently cut by 
Philadelphia, also said Eagles special-teams coach Al Roberts tipped him off. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not going to endear those (Eagles) to Buddy," Spagnola said. "They do 
(Zendejas) a service and he turns around and does them a disservice. Buddy has 
a long memory." 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing film of one controversial play with Welsh -- the one where 
Eagles linebacker Jessie Small ran over Zendejas -- Ryan said he didn't think 
the league would try to punish him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just talked to (Welsh)," Ryan said in a conference call to reporters 
Wednesday, according to the Philadelphia Daily News. "He and I just visited 
about it. I mean, he's been in the league awhile too. Visited with me about 45 
minutes. Showed him the film (of Small's hit), which I couldn't show you all. I 
wish they could show you all." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan got a vote of support from Giants Coach Bill Parcells, who perhaps didn't 
want to stir up emotions even more before his team's game against the Eagles 
for first place in the NFC East on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, don't get me involved in that," Parcells said in a conference call with 
reporters. "That's a bunch of bull. Really, I mean, who cares?" 
</P>
<P>
The league office apparently does. Welsh has talked to both sides, and an 
official recommendation is expected next week, before the Dec. 10 game between 
the Eagles and Cowboys in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Welsh "said he'd get back to me in a couple weeks," Ryan said during the 
conference call. "When all the marbles are in, there will be no question who 
the clown is." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ryan-Cowboys issue has raised a larger question: Are there 
coaches in the league who offer monetary rewards and players who receive them 
for trying to injure specific players? 
</P>
<P>
Former Redskins Coach George Allen had one of the most heated rivalries in 
football when his teams played the Dallas Cowboys in the 1970s, with both sides 
often trading charges of cheap shots before and after games. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, reached at his home in California this week, said: "We never did 
anything like having a bounty on anybody. We would give some incentives for 
interceptions, tackles inside the 20, mostly stuff to give the special teams 
some recognition. We'd give a guy a clock-radio or a small appliance or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"But send somebody out with intent to injure an opponent? Nah. Heck no. The 
Over the Hill Gang was clean. 
</P>
<P>
"With that situation they have now, I'd have to know more. But I'm absolutely 
against the idea of it." 
</P>
<P>
Several players reached this week also dismissed the notion that bounties are 
common in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody talks about trying to get after somebody on some team; it's the 
nature of sports," said San Francisco all-pro safety Ronnie Lott. "You know 
that Michael Jordan, every time he's on the court somebody wants to 'get him.' 
And the intensity is sometimes at a level where you do things you wouldn't 
normally. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember in 1984 we were playing the Steelers. I had a bad ankle and Weegie 
Thompson went after my ankle on every play. 
</P>
<P>
A coach told me he had been told to do it. Paid to? I'll just say this; if 
you've got to give somebody money to get them to make a play on somebody, I 
don't want that guy on my team." 
</P>
<P>
Packers guard Billy Ard said: "I've never been on a team where a coach said, 
'Get this guy out of the game.' If you're playing the Rams, you wanted to get 
Eric Dickerson out of the game; if you're playing Reggie White, you'd like to 
see him out of the game, for strategic reasons. But you're not going to go out 
there to hurt the guy. There's no place for that."

VOW BROKEN, PUTTER BROKEN IN; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: ARNOLD PALMER, WHO SAID HE WOULD NEVER USE AN UNORTHODOX CLUB, DOES SO. 
BUT ZEMBRISKI STILL LEADS 54-HOLE TOURNAMENT THAT ENDS TODAY.

<P>
After vowing he would never use an unorthodox putting style, Arnold Palmer did 
just that Friday in the second round of the GTE West senior golf tournament at 
Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
However, his 40-inch putter with two separate grips lasted one round. Palmer 
shot a par 70, but 38 of those strokes were putts, so the new putter is history 
-- at least for the present. 
</P>
<P>
"I did well on the practice green with the new putter," Palmer said. "It really 
felt good. But when I got out there, I couldn't sink anything beyond five feet. 
The experiment is over for now." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's switch to an unorthodox putter -- slightly longer than normal -- 
caused such a commotion that it overshadowed another excellent round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was another perfect day for golf, with almost no wind, the 
6,190-yard course proved a little tougher for most of the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The leader with 18 holes remaining today is Walt Zembriski. The former 
high-rise steelworker from New Jersey threatened to run away with the 
tournament before bogeying four of the last 10 holes and finishing with a 
two-under-par 68. His total of 132 gave him a one-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
George Archer and Al Kelley, a Monday qualifier, are tied for second place at 
133. 
</P>
<P>
Archer, who had a hole-in-one on the 128-yard eighth hole, shot a 64 to tie the 
course record. Five shots back after Zembriski and Homero Blancas shot 64s in 
the opening round, Archer is now in a position to win his second tournament in 
just four tries on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, 54, who has never won a PGA event, shot a 66, including a 30 on the 
back nine. A victory would exempt him from qualifying for one year. Otherwise, 
it's back to the Monday grind against about 100 other players trying for four 
tournament spots. 
</P>
<P>
With almost every hole a potential birdie, a wild finish is expected today. 
There are 15 golfers within five shots of Zembriski. Among them are Rocky 
Thompson, who also shot a 64, Frank Beard and Jim Dent at 135, plus four 
others, including Chi Chi Rodriguez and leading money-winner Bob Charles, at 
136. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, at 142, is hitting the ball well but is still being embarrassed by his 
putting. He rationalized switching to the unorthodox putter on the grounds that 
he still uses his regular grip, except that his hands are apart -- even though 
he employs the pendulum swing that has been a boon to those who have been 
successful with the longer-handled putters. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Owens pioneered the unconventional style as a matter of necessity. 
Owens had to stand upright because of a fused left leg, the result of an injury 
while a paratrooper. Later, Orville Moody and Harold Henning had success with 
handles up to 50 inches in length. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer had always said he would never use anything but an orthodox putter. 
Technically, maybe he hasn't given in. But his club, a Slotline mallet-head 
putter, is used in the same manner as unorthodox putters with even longer 
handles. 
</P>
<P>
Zembriski's orthodox putter was hot early. After seven holes of the second 
round, he was five under par and leading Blancas by four shots. Blancas faded 
to a 72 and is at 136. He was only two shots back until he had a double bogey 
on the 11th hole and went downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
Zembriski's problems began with the ninth hole, a reachable par-five. He pulled 
his drive into the trees, then hit a three-iron through the trees to within 100 
yards of the green. But it took him four shots to get down from there. Until 
then, he had not made a bogey in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I have work to do," he said. "My putting isn't smooth, and I'm too quick with 
my driver. I'll be ready tomorrow, I promise you." 
</P>
<P>
Archer said the hole-in-one was the sixth or seventh of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether I'll win or not tomorrow," he said. "One thing I've 
learned in 30 years is never to expect anything. I'm just happy to be playing 
golf." 
</P>
<P>
It would mean more to Kelley, who finished 13th and out in the recent 
qualifying school. "I'm tired of trying to qualify," he said. "I don't think 
I'll be nervous, but who knows?

British boxing promoter and manager Frank Warren remained in critical condition 
as police stepped up the search for a gunman who shot him on a London street. 
</P>
<P>
Police described the attack as an attempted murder and Warren, 37, was 
unconscious in a hospital with wounds to the chest and abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shooting probably was the work of a hired killer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was either a professional killer or very lucky," said Detective 
Superintendent Jeff Rees. "There were no wasted shots." 
</P>
<P>
As Warren arrived at a card show he was promoting, his attacker walked over to 
the car and fired from about six feet away.

Judge Michael J. Farrell of Van Nuys Superior Court also ordered each of the 
teen-agers to pay as much as $3,500 to the parochial school for the cost of 
repairing chipped water fountains, cleaning lockers spattered with eggs and 
removing racial slurs painted on the door of Jimmy Chambers, an assistant 
football coach.

LINEBACKER JERUE WAIVED BY RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Jerue's remarkable football comeback after three knee operations in two 
years ended after six games Friday when the Rams put the seven-year veteran 
inside linebacker on waivers to make room on the roster for rookie cornerback 
Alfred Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Jackson was put on injured reserve Oct. 18 to make room for 
Jerue, who seemed to have beaten the medical odds and returned after another 
career-threatening surgery last February. 
</P>
<P>
Jerue, in the end, was lost in a numbers game at inside linebacker, where the 
Rams were suddenly loaded to capacity with the return of Fred Strickland and 
Larry Kelm from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams needed to activate Jackson this weekend because of the uncertainty of 
cornerback Cliff Hicks, who is questionable for Sunday's game against the 
Dallas Cowboys because of a knee strain. 
</P>
<P>
Jerue's knee is still not 100% and probably never will be, and he was more 
expendable than linebacker Richard Brown because of Brown's value as a special 
teams player. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was difficult for defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, who also 
coaches inside linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
"He took it like the man he is," Shurmur said. "Football ought to mean as much 
to everyone who plays the game as it does to Mark Jerue. All you need to do is 
watch him working eight hours a day, five days a week in the off-season to 
bring back an injury everyone thought couldn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
Jerue, 29, played six games this season, recording eight tackles and half a 
sack. His best season was 1986, when he made 109 tackles in 16 games after 
replacing injured starter Jim Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Jerue couldn't be reached for comment Friday, and his agent, Peter Funsten, 
wasn't sure of Jerue's chances of catching on elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to take a look and see where we are," he said.

IT TOOK 44 YEARS TO FLIP BENTON; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: RECORD WITHSTOOD THE TEST OF SOME BIG-NAME RECEIVERS BEFORE 
ANDERSON SHATTERED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Flipper Anderson broke the NFL single-game record for receiving yardage 
with 336 yards Sunday night during the Rams' 20-17 overtime victory in New 
Orleans, it was obviously a club record as well. 
</P>
<P>
However, it wasn't an easy one to break. Tom Fears couldn't do it, and neither 
could Elroy Hirsch, Del Shofner, Jim Phillips, Jack Snow, Harold Jackson, Henry 
Ellard or any other accomplished Ram receiver over the last 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's feat only magnified what a rather slow but gifted receiver did on a 
November day in Detroit in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Benton, known as the Arkansas Traveler, gained 303 yards on pass receptions 
from Bob Waterfield, a rookie quarterback who would later be inducted into the 
Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year before the Rams made their move from Cleveland to Los Angeles, 
the first major league sports franchise to be established in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's day was likewise historic. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He broke the existing NFL single-game receiving yardage record held by 
Green Bay's Don Hutson by 66 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He got his 303 yards with only 10 catches, compared to 15 for Anderson. 
Waterfield threw only 21 passes that day, completing 12, compared to Jim 
Everett's 29 completions in 51 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More mind-boggling is that Benton's NFL record lasted 40 years before 
Stephone Paige of the Kansas City Chiefs broke it with 309 yards in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Benton's big performance came in a big game as the Rams clinched the 
Western Division title by beating the Lions, 28-21, on their way to the 
franchise's first NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
An All-American at Arkansas, Benton began his pro career with the Cleveland 
Rams in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
He was a contemporary of Hutson, a Hall of Fame end who is still regarded by 
many as the greatest pass receiver in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Benton and Hutson each grew up in nearby towns in Arkansas, Benton in 
Fordyce and Hutson in Pine Bluff. 
</P>
<P>
Hutson went on to play for Alabama and gain fame in a Rose Bowl game against 
Stanford in 1935. Benton set a collegiate record in 1937 at Arkansas with 47 
catches for 754 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Their pro careers were intertwined. In 1945, Benton became only the second 
1,000-yard receiver for a season in NFL history with 1,067 yards, an average of 
23.7 a catch. Hutson was the first with 1,211 yards in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
The Waterfield-Benton passing combination flourished in Los Angeles. Benton led 
the league in receiving in 1946 with 63 catches for 981 yards and six 
touchdowns. He retired after the 1947 season at 31. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-3 and 206 pounds, Benton was regarded as a tall end in his time. 
</P>
<P>
Benton preferred to give the credit to Waterfield, once saying: "Bob can put 
'em anywhere with handles on 'em. Why, whatever I do to get open at the last 
second, when I do, there comes the ball right where I need it." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving pro football, Benton coached for a while at Arkansas A&amp;M. He 
later owned some bowling alleys and then went into the oil business. 
</P>
<P>
Now 73, he is retired in Pine Bluff but is still active as a dedicated walker 
and golfer. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have almost cornered the market on passing-related records. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Van Brocklin still holds the league record for most passing yardage in a 
game with 554 yards against the New York Yankees in 1951. Fears is the NFL 
record-holder with 18 receptions in a game against Green Bay in 1950. And Dick 
(Night Train) Lane is the league record-holder with 14 interceptions for a 
season in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Now Anderson has joined such select company. To do it, though, he had to beat a 
club record that, in context, was way ahead of its time.

ANGELS PUMPED UP ABOUT NEW TEAMMATE

<P>
Mark Langston's signing with the Angels wasn't the best news Sandy Alderson 
heard Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, congratulate the Angels," said Alderson, general manager of the World 
Series champion Oakland Athletics. He paused, obviously thinking about his own 
club's concerns. "I think," he added somberly. 
</P>
<P>
Angel players and coaches exulted over the signing of Langston, interpreting 
the addition of the 29-year-old left-hander as a sign of the club's commitment 
to the future and proclaiming that his $16-million, five-year contract won't 
spark envy among his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting a World Series ring on our fingers at the end of '90, that's the only 
thing we're thinking about," right-hander Bert Blyleven said. "I don't think 
the players are jealous. Other people see the big money, but we don't talk 
about that among ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased we got Mark Langston. He's been very consistent and I know he 
wants to play on a winning ballclub. This shows that (General Manager) Mike 
Port really wants to put a winning team on the field. I think everybody in the 
organization has to feel pleased." 
</P>
<P>
And apparently they do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," Wally Joyner said. "I think this will help us close the gap 
between us and the A's. One of the reasons we went after Mark Langston was to 
better the ballclub. This is not going to do anything but improve our club and 
our staff. Hopefully, down the line there's a couple of players left that they 
might sign." 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Lachemann, the Angels' pitching coach, was skeptical about the news 
until he was repeatedly reassured that Langston's signing was certain. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the case, it's great," said Lachemann, whose staff's earned-run 
average of 3.28 was second-best in the American League last season. "Obviously, 
we've improved the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's been a great pitcher in our league before he went over to the National 
League. It's an indication that (owner Gene) Autry and Mike Port are really 
concentrating on trying to win. They realize we had a very fine year but came 
up eight games short. This is an indication they want not just a winning 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"When you say winning, you talk about being over .500, but really winning is 
what Oakland did this year, winning the pennant and the Series." 
</P>
<P>
Lachemann said he knew Langston casually from the pitcher's time in Seattle and 
is already looking forward to working with him in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I was relatively eager for spring training three days after the season ended," 
Lachemann said. "This makes everything that much easier." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven is also anticipating Langston's arrival because he expects to reap a 
financial benefit of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Now maybe Chuck Finley will leave me alone and won't bother me to buy him 
lunch all the time," Blyleven said. "Mark Langston makes more money, and Chuck 
will probably hook onto him now."

CAPISTRANO VALLEY BEATEN ON CONVERSION

<P>
Capistrano Valley High School, brought to an emotional peak with a desperation 
drive, fell with a thud because of one player Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's Jack Manu. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley drove 63 yards in the final four minutes to tie Friday 
night's Southern Section Division III semifinal game at 28-28. But the 
jubilation was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
In the California tiebreaker, Manu flipped a three-yard pass to running back 
Leon Neal for a two-point conversion that gave Paramount a 36-35 victory in 
front of 5,000 in Santa Ana Stadium. The Pirates, who defeated Los Alamitos for 
the Division III title last season, will play El Toro in the championship game 
next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars scored on their first possession of the tiebreaker to take a 35-28 
lead. Then, on Paramount's first play, Manu rolled to his right and hit Darrell 
Cloy in the end zone for his fourth touchdown pass of the game. 
</P>
<P>
After a timeout, the Pirates went for two, and Manu lobbed a pass to Neal, who 
was not covered when he swung out of the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no question we were going for two," Paramount Coach Ken Sutch. 
"That's our style." 
</P>
<P>
That style was apparent through most of Friday's game as the Pirates (12-1) 
played with the swagger of defending champions. Costly mistakes didn't faze 
them, nor did a 21-14 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
And that style was most evident in Manu, who was the Division II player of the 
year last season. 
</P>
<P>
Considered a better runner than a passer, Manu burned the Cougars both ways. He 
gained 60 yards rushing, including an 11-yard scramble for a touchdown, and 
completed 10 of 14 passes for 139 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (12-1) was able to pressure Manu, but he was able to 
improvise some big plays. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars took a 6-0 lead in the first quarter when Damon Psaros scooped up a 
fumble and returned it three yards for a touchdown. The Pirates proceeded to 
drive 83 yards in just three plays to tie it, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
With a first down on the Cougar 26, Manu was flushed from the pocket. But, as 
Psaros grabbed his legs, Manu floated a pass to Alfonso Bigelow, who outjumped 
Mike Lavin in the end zone for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Manu threw two touchdown passes in the second half to give the the Pirates a 
28-21 lead, driving Paramount 72 and 77 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for a team that can't pass," Sutch said. "That's all we hear about. 
Everyone says we can run the ball great, but we can't pass." 
</P>
<P>
After giving up 209 total yards in the first half, Paramount held the Cougars 
in check for most of the second half. But with 4:01 left and Capistrano Valley 
trailing by a touchdown, it mounted one last drive. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Tony Solliday, who passed for 214 yards, completed six of seven 
passes on the drive, including a 14-yard completion to Chris Adams on a 
fourth-and-10 play to maintain possession. 
</P>
<P>
Solliday also scrambled nine yards to give Capistrano Valley a first down on 
the Paramount three. On the next play, he rolled to his right and found Dan 
Zamora all alone in the end zone for the touchdown with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Solliday and Zamora hooked up again on the first play of the tiebreaker to give 
the Cougars the lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Manu had the last say.

UPSETS 
</P>
<P>
Paramount High School quarterback Jack Manu threw four touchdown passes and ran 
for another as the Pirates defeated the county's top-ranked team, Capistrano 
Valley, 36-35, to advance to the championship game of the Division III 
playoffs. Manu kicked two conversions and passed for a pair of two-point 
conversions, including the game-winner in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills tailback Ben Rooker, who missed five games after having 
arthroscopic knee surgery three games into the season, rushed for 200 yards and 
a pair of touchdowns in 23 carries in the Mustangs' 48-21 Division VIII 
semifinal victory over Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Remmel rushed for 282 yards on 25 carries, including 220 in the first 
half, and scored touchdowns on runs of 78, one and 94 yards, to lift Orange to 
a 35-22 victory over Agoura and into the championship game of the Division III 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
ODDS AND ENDS 
</P>
<P>
Be True to Your School: Administrators at La Quinta High School offered its 
students free bus transportation to La Mirada for the Aztecs' Division VI 
semifinal game but had to cancel the free trip when only eight students signed 
up for the free ride. The lack of school spirit didn't hurt La Quinta, however, 
as the Aztecs beat La Mirada, 20-7, to advance to the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
SHOWDOWNS 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills' 48-21 victory over Santa Clara put the defending Division VIII 
champion Mustangs in an all-Pacific Coast League final for the second year in a 
row. Trabuco Hills, which will meet Orange in next week's championship game, 
defeated Woodbridge for the title a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
LATE HEROICS 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's Danny Maestas scored on a four-yard run in overtime, then intercepted 
a pass on the final play of the game to give the Chargers a 28-21 Division III

ANOTHER TITLE GAME FOR CORONA DEL MAR AFTER 27-0 SURPRISE 
</P>

<P>
For all those Corona del Mar High School football fans who dozed off during 
their team's daze six or so weeks ago, wake up. 
</P>
<P>
 With its 27-0 upset over Sunny Hills Friday night in a Division VI semifinal 
game at Buena Park High School, Corona del Mar proved it is now a tremendous 
team with a more-than-possible dream. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (10-3), a wild-card team that finished fourth in the Sea View 
League, is going to the final for its second straight year. The Sea Kings, the 
defending Division VI champion, will play La Quinta, a 20-7 winner over La 
Mirada Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Against Sunny Hills, the Sea Kings swept away all doubts, proving that the 
inconsistent play that plagued them in the early season is far behind them. No 
player symbolized that more than senior wide receiver/defensive back Weston 
Johnson, who scored three touchdowns to lead Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to say," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
He needn't say more. 
</P>
<P>
On Corona del Mar's first play from scrimmage, Johnson caught a perfect pass 
from quarterback Todd Kehrli for a 66-yard touchdown play. That play seemed to 
have a numbing effect on Sunny Hills, the playoffs' top-seeded -- and 
previously undefeated -- team. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored again in the second quarter on a botched field goal attempt. As 
Jerrott Willard stood ready for a 31-yard try, Johnson, the holder, waited for 
Mike Kelly's snap. But the ball was snapped short, so Johnson picked it up, 
scrambled around the Sunny Hills defenders and dove into the end zone for a 
13-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
On Corona del Mar's next possession, Brian Lucas, who rushed for 103 yards on 
17 carries, scored on a six-yard run to give the Sea Kings a 20-0 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the first half, the Lancers (12-1) could not sustain a drive; they 
did not pick up a first down, nor did they cross midfield. Their well-known 
trio of running backs -- Brian Pizula, Mike Sullivan and Ken Overby -- were 
stopped from making big plays. Combined, they gained only 57 yards in the first 
half, and Pizula was stopped altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Pizula, who entered the game with 1,461 yards, had to leave the game with a 
separated shoulder midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that hurt," Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney said. "But Corona del Mar 
played very well. We gave up the early score and our offense was not operating 
well. Hell, they just played great football tonight." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Johnson capped his best game of the season with a 20-yard 
touchdown reception from Kehrli, who completed seven of 14 passes for 162 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar dominated Sunny Hills in every aspect. Its defense, anchored by 
Willard, held the Lancers to 120 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was surprised by the final score, Sea King Coach Dave Holland said: 
"Yeah, I'm very much surprised. Are you kidding? Aren't you?"

LA QUINTA PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER TO SMOTHER LA MIRADA, 20-7

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On most nights, La Quinta High School's explosive offense needs a warning 
label. Something like, "Flammable! Keep away from heat." 
</P>
<P>
But Friday night, the Aztec defense ignited as well and La Mirada took the 
heat, losing a Southern Section Division VI semifinal, 20-7, in front of 3,000 
at La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has been improving every week along with our offense, so it's not 
surprising," Aztec Coach Roger Takahashi said. "This was a team effort. We're 
on fire." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec offense almost never sputtered and, coupled with an impressive 
defensive effort, it was enough to make this game the kind La Quinta fans like 
-- one that was over before the third quarter ended. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs led, 17-7, at the half, then dominated the third quarter, scoring on 
a 40-yard Matt Logan field goal and keeping the Matadors (9-4) from recording 
so much as one first down. 
</P>
<P>
"That took a lot of fire out of them," Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta sacked Matador quarterback Chad Drown three times, all in the second 
half, and limited La Mirada to 215 yards in the game. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta quarterback Richard Weaver had his third 200-plus yard passing 
performance in as many playoff games, completing 13 of 21 passes for 207 yards 
and two touchdowns. He was intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec running back Trent Julian had 101 yards on 15 carries and 40 more yards 
in three receptions. Receiver Jason Cherms had another outstanding game with 
five catches for 99 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta scored on three of its five first-half possessions with big plays. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Weaver completed 10 of 13 passes for 179 yards and the two 
touchdowns, the first a six-yard completion to Todd Lee to cap a seven-play, 
51-yard drive that put La Quinta ahead, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
He then collaborated with Cherms on a 65-yard touchdown pass play to put the 
Aztecs ahead, 14-7, in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Logan added a 45-yard field goal with six seconds to play. It was set up 
by Cherms' interception at his eight that ended La Mirada's second of only 
three forays into Aztec territory. 
</P>
<P>
The interception came with just 1:16 to play, but time is never a problem for 
the explosive Aztec offense. 
</P>
<P>
Julian ripped off a 27-yard run and Weaver added a 12-yard completion to Todd 
Lee to set up Logan. 
</P>
<P>
La Mirada's only successful venture into Aztec territory, came in the second 
quarter. The Matador defense forced La Quinta to punt from its end zone. La 
Mirada took over at the Aztec 34 and 11 plays later, Joe Fernandez went in from 
the two for his team's only score. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (9-4) will make its first appearance in a title game since 1985, when 
the Aztecs lost to Saddleback, next Friday when it meets Corona del Mar.

LANCERS FALL TO MUIR, 9-3, IN TIEBREAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lance Martin was a reserve middle linebacker two years ago when his football 
team at Thousand Oaks High won a Southern Section championship. It was Thousand 
Oaks football's only Southern Section title, its most glorious hour. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a senior, will have to cherish those feelings because the Lancers came 
up short this season. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, the top-seeded Division II team, was defeated by Muir, 9-3, in a 
semifinal game Friday night at Citrus College. The outcome was decided when 
Muir's Carlton Greer lunged three yards into the end zone on third down in a 
California tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
The run came moments after the Mustangs' defense held Thousand Oaks four times 
from the 10-yard line. Lancer fullback Chris Foster bounced off the interior 
line on fourth and inches from the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the score," Martin said. "That's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to put into perspective a season that produced 11 victories against only 
one loss and a tie, Martin shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't yet," he said. "No." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, it seemed, finally stumbled upon a team that would not wear 
down. Muir (11-1-1) possessed greater size than Thousand Oaks along both sides 
of the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
But, when regulation expired, neither team had blinked and the score was 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a very good football team here," Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards 
said. "Very physical and very quick. I'd be very surprised if they didn't win 
the CIF championship next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The CIF championship was won tonight. Put my words on that." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but Muir Coach John Tyree was either unimpressed or just plain 
uninterested. 
</P>
<P>
"All year long, we have been the team that wore the other team down," he said. 
"I don't think tonight we played near as well on defense as we normally do. 
Either Thousand Oaks didn't fold or we didn't hit very hard." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers were unable to sustain offensive continuity, especially in the 
second half. Thousand Oaks had 129 yards in total offense -- 99 via a ground 
game that averaged nearly 250 in its first 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
And, still, in the overtime, it came down to the fullback needing about a foot. 
</P>
<P>
Muir quarterback Sedrick Thomas passed for 132 of the team's 205 total yards -- 
most of which came in the second half -- and 21 on Muir's only scoring drive. 
Early in the fourth quarter, the Mustangs went 21 yards in seven plays -- 
including a crucial fourth-and-nine conversion. Todd Elkins capped the drive 
with a 25-yard field goal to tie the score. He later missed an attempt from 28 
yards with 12 seconds remaining in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Ybarra's 36-yard field goal for Thousand Oaks with less than a minute 
left in the second quarter was the only score of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Lancer defensive back David Watts set up an 18-yard drive when he recovered 
Muir tailback Sam Williford's fumble on the Mustang 37. Seven plays later, 
Ybarra booted his second field-goal of the season.

CSUN PLAYS WEBER STATE TOUGH IN LOSS

<P>
It will go down in the record books as Cal State Northridge's second-biggest 
loss in the series, but Weber State's 67-51 victory over the Matadors at the 
Dee Events Center on Saturday night was anything but easy. 
</P>
<P>
For 34 minutes, Northridge scratched and clawed with the Wildcats, but when the 
Matadors' shooting went cold, Weber State pulled away to win the nonconference 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge trailed, 45-41, with 6:15 left in the second half after a Kendell 
McDaniels' basket, but the Matadors made only one of their next 11 attempts as 
Weber State went on a 20-5 run. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some good open shots, but we just missed them," Northridge Coach Pete 
Cassidy said. "That hurt us and we got too close for some people's comfort." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy also suggested there may have been some bias in the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
True, there were a couple of questionable calls against Northridge -- which 
trails in the series, 7-0 -- but Weber State's victory was more the result of 
superior strength inside. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Tony Nicholas led the Wildcats with a game-high 19 points, but 6-foot-6 
Jerry McIntosh, 6-8 Chris Metke and 6-8 Anthony McGowan turned the game around 
for Weber State (2-1) in the last five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh and Metke had 12 points each, and McGowan had 11 points and six 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, I think we played pretty respectable," Cassidy said, "but they 
did start to muscle us inside in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers led Northridge (1-2) with 14 points and McDaniels added eight 
points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 48-43, with five minutes left in the game, Weber State went on a 9-0 
run that left the Matadors reeling. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas started the surge with a jumper, which was followed by three Metke 
free throws, a McGowan dunk and a Metke jump hook. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real tight game," Cassidy said. "and suddenly, three minutes later, 
we were down by 14." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 57-43, with 1:36 left, the Matadors were forced to hurry their shots 
and foul Weber State when they missed. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge trailed by eight points at halftime, but hit seven of its first nine 
shots in the second half to trim Weber State's lead to 35-34 with 15:06 left in 
the game.

BAKERSFIELD POSTS UPSET OF CSUN IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>

<P>
The end of the 1989 women's volleyball season was expected to be a time of 
pleasurable reflection for those associated with the Cal State Northridge team. 
</P>
<P>
After a decade of dominance on the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division 
II level, the Lady Matadors are bound for the big time next season. 
</P>
<P>
What better way to celebrate its move to Division I than to accomplish the 
usual -- earning a berth in the national finals? 
</P>
<P>
"Excellence in the '80s" was CSUN's team slogan and Coach Walt Ker announced 
early that Northridge was more motivated than ever to go out on top. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the best-laid plans. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield squashed CSUN's plan for an 11th consecutive trip to the 
Division II quarterfinals, upsetting the third-ranked Lady Matadors, 16-14, 
15-6, 15-13, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, upsetting is an appropriate term. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (26-11), which had won 13 of its past 14 matches, was outdug, 
outserved, outhit and perhaps outfoxed by the 11th-ranked Roadrunners. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield (18-15), which had split its previous four matches this year 
against Northridge, juggled its lineup and adjusted its hitting patterns in the 
West regional final. 
</P>
<P>
"We came back from losing to Northridge at the Air Force tournament (in 
November) and said 'Assuming we're going to get Northridge in the regional, 
this is what we'll do,' " said Bakersfield Coach Dave Rubio, a Ker protege. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield's Rachel Morton, normally a middle blocker, was moved to outside 
hitter and Roadrunner players were instructed to tip down the line in an effort 
to break up CSUN's blocking pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tight at first," said Rubio, who played for Ker at CSUN and Granada 
Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
"But once some of the things we had been practicing started to work, it gave us 
that much more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Down, 10-4, in the first game, Bakersfield scored 10 consecutive points en 
route to a 16-14 win. 
</P>
<P>
"They never broke down," said CSUN's Allisa Evans, a senior outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"They played great from point one to 45. They excelled in every facet of the 
game, from beginning to end. Everything we tried, they handled."

NOTRE DAME TIPS ITS HAND TO SERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took a while for Serra High's vaunted full-house backfield to get started 
Friday in a Southern Section Division VII semifinal football game at Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
But Serra faithful need not worry about the slow start. Notre Dame was dealing 
away its aces. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights turned the ball over five times, twice in scoring position, and 
lost, 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
Serra, which did not earn a first down until early in the second quarter, put 
the game out of reach with 13 seconds to play when Dennis Gerard charged in 
from the one-yard line after Notre Dame turned the ball over on downs. The 
conversion pass failed. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights, whose previous low point total was 12, finished 11-2 after 
advancing further in the playoffs than any team in Notre Dame history. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's only points came on a 28-yard field goal by Chris Afarian in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Notre Dame did have its opportunities. The Knights drove to the one-yard 
line late in the second quarter but on a second-down sneak, quarterback Greg 
Andrachick fumbled on the goal line. Serra lineman Corey Long pounced on the 
ball to preserve a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the quarter, Notre Dame moved to the Serra four before Andrachick's 
pitch, which was intended for Errol Small, was picked off by Louis Laffitte, 
who was tackled after he rambled 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we couldn't make mistakes and expect to win," Notre Dame Coach Kevin 
Rooney said. "Everybody was kind of nervous and tight. There's no excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Serra's ground game, which employs three running backs, had accounted for all 
57 regular-season touchdowns. Ironically, the Cavaliers' first score came on a 
34-yard pass from Alex Marcelin to Donald Godden on fourth and 16 with 9:35 to 
play in the first half. Lamont Daniel's conversion run failed. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel led all rushers with 138 yards in 15 carries. The Cavaliers gained 254 
yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
It was just Serra's third touchdown pass of the season. Godden has caught a 
scoring pass in each playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers' first scoring drive was kept alive largely on a 15-yard 
pass-interference penalty and a 19-yard pass play from Fred Safford to Jerald 
Henry. 
</P>
<P>
Serra's defense limited Notre Dame to 97 yards rushing and put a lot of 
pressure on Andrachick, who completed six of 17 passes and threw two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Small led the Knights with 63 yards in 17 carries but was stopped for losses 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers' defensive effort was no shock to Small. 
</P>
<P>
"No one makes it to the semifinals being a chump team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Serra Coach Leo Hand: "Our defensive speed is very good. I don't know who 
Notre Dame has played in the past but they probably haven't seen a team with 
this kind of speed."

ALEMANY UPSETS TAFT, 48-46, ON BURR'S 3-POINT BASKET AT BUZZER

<P>
Junior guard William Burr made a three-point basket as time expired Friday 
night to give Alemany High a 48-46 upset win over Taft in the first round of 
the fifth annual Simi Valley tournament at Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany, which did not lead until the final shot, battled back from a 40-32 
deficit at the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With six seconds left and the Indians trailing, 46-43, Alemany's Greg Ryan made 
two free throws. Taft Coach Jim Woodard used a timeout to set up an inbounds 
play, but Irvin Scott's pass was intercepted by Alemany's Tim Fontenette, who 
was fouled with four seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Fontenette missed the front end of the one-and-one but Ryan grabbed the rebound 
and called timeout with one second remaining. Alemany Coach Rocky Moore 
designed the last play to go to Fontenette, but the 6-6 forward was covered and 
Burr, standing 22 feet away from the basket, took the final shot. 
</P>
<P>
Burr scored a game-high 26 points including six three-point shots. Guard Casey 
Sheahan paced Taft with 15 points and forward James Yoakum added 12. PAUL OLSON

1-0 victory American River Friday at El Camino College.

WSC BOWL PREVIEW;

<P>
STOPPING ROBISON KEY FOR VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In theory, today's Western State Bowl would have pitted Moorpark, the Western 
State Conference's Northern Division winner, against Bakersfield, the Southern 
Division champion. 
</P>
<P>
But reality finds Southern Division runner-up Valley College (5-5) playing host 
to Santa Barbara (6-4), which tied for third in the Northern Division. 
</P>
<P>
With Bakersfield opting to play in the Potato Bowl, Valley was the obvious 
choice for the Southern Division representative, but Santa Barbara's road to 
this game wasn't as direct. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros were not selected until Moorpark (Orange County), L. A. Southwest 
(Southern California) and Ventura (Hall of Fame) all had accepted invitations 
to other bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't exactly the first choice," Santa Barbara Coach Rick Cook conceded. 
"But we'll take it. This is our first bowl game since 1983 and the kids are 
really looking forward to playing in it." 
</P>
<P>
Although it may lack marquee teams, the Western State Bowl, which starts at 1 
p.m., appears to have the ingredients for an exciting match-up. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, which is making its first postseason appearance since the 1975 Potato 
Bowl, has won five of its past seven games after starting the season with three 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
And Santa Barbara has won two in a row, including a 49-34 shoot-out over 
Glendale three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros, led by quarterback Ted Robison, are ranked fifth in the 
conference in total offense and first in passing offense; Valley fields the 
WSC's No. 1 defense against the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Robison bombed Glendale for 402 yards and has completed 141 of 253 passes for 
1,994 yards and 14 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His top receivers are Greg Borgquist, Walter Brooks and Victor Prince. 
</P>
<P>
Borgquist has a conference-leading 54 receptions for 745 yards and eight 
touchdowns. Brooks has 35 catches for 537 yards and four scores, and Prince has 
33 for 484 and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Robison makes them go. He's the key to their offense," Valley Coach Chuck 
Ferrero said. "But there's a lot more to this game than their offense versus 
our defense. They've got to stop us too." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Valley's offense has been in high gear after sputtering early. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging only 189 yards a game in losses to Mt. San Antonio (20-16), 
Moorpark (23-0) and L. A. Southwest (12-9), Valley has averaged more than 371 
yards in its past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
An effective ground attack has powered Valley (185.1 yards a game), which 
rushed for only 147 yards in its first three outings. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Dozier is the Monarchs' leading rusher with 592 yards and 11 touchdowns. 
Quarterback Trendell Williams has completed 66 of 140 for 1,107 yards and four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Edwards (eight interceptions) leads a Valley defensive backfield that will 
be put to a stern test by Robison and Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tough back there," Ferrero said. "The (defensive backs) take a lot of 
pride in their work. . . . They are looking forward to taking on Santa 
Barbara."

CANYONS FINDS NEW LIFE WITH HART TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took all of seven games for the College of the Canyons women's basketball 
team to exceed its win total from the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (7-1), the Baltimore Orioles of women's basketball, has won seven games 
in a row, a marked improvement over the previous two seasons when it totaled 
only five wins. 
</P>
<P>
Two seasons ago, Canyons forfeited the last 10 games after the squad dropped to 
four players. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jeff Dunlap took over last season and struggled to a 4-19 record with 
only seven players, but this year he has a squad large enough to actually 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a totally different look out there," said Dunlap, who attributes the 
turnaround to "a lot of luck and a lot of hard work. We had a nice selection of 
local players, which is fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap's players had heart, but what they really needed was Hart, specifically, 
players from Hart High's Southern Section Division 4-A championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Three former Hart players -- DeeDee Hinson, Kim Posey and Dominique Ice -- are 
key contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Tressie Millender, the third-leading scorer in the state last season, 
returned at forward and freshman point guard Keira Irwin of Simi Valley High 
has been "the last piece of the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
With only two sophomores on the roster, Canyons will have to mature quickly 
before beginning its Western State Conference schedule in early January. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's a pride factor," Dunlap said. "That's the goal. We want to 
prove College of the Canyons basketball is for real." 
</P>
<P>
Dublin their pleasure: Two former Valley-area high school football players will 
be on opposing sides far from home today when Pittsburgh meets Rutgers in the 
second Emerald Isle Classic football game. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Kavulich, a redshirt freshman from Chaminade High, may see action for 
Rutgers as a reserve offensive guard. Brian Greenfield, a junior from Notre 
Dame High and Glendale College, is Pitt's punter. 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: Keira Middleton and Kathleen Dixon of Cal State Northridge have 
been selected to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II 
All-Southwest Region volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton is a senior outside hitter. Dixon is a junior middle blocker.

UNBEATEN DAMEWORTH FEATURED IN REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having won his third consecutive state Division I cross-country championship 
last week, Bryan Dameworth of Agoura High will return to Fresno's Woodward Park 
today for the Kinney West regional. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, undefeated this season, will be gunning for his first West regional 
title after finishing eighth as a freshman in 1986 and second last year. 
</P>
<P>
The top eight finishers in each of the boys' and girls' races will qualify for 
next Saturday's national championships in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Other top local entries include Abe Valdez of Camarillo and Canyon teammates 
Dan Berkeland and Dave Hartman. That trio finished fourth, fifth and sixth in 
the state Division I race. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura junior Deena Drossin will attempt to improve on her fifth-place 
performance of last year in the girls' race. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' race starts at 12:15 p.m., followed by the boys' race at 1 p.m. JOHN

TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE

Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tim Bednar, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-14; fifth in league at 3-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Bednar heralds his young squad as "a bunch of excellent 
athletes." Experience, however, is lacking. Senior point guard Brian Lester 
(5-10), "my coach on the floor," Bednar said, and senior forward Robert 
Hernandez (6-3), quarterback on the football team, have the most games under 
their belts. Lester started last year, Hernandez was a reserve. "He'll 
rebound," Bednar said of Hernandez. "And he's faster than heck." Senior forward 
Mike Granderson (6-3) also moves from backup to starting duty. Sophomore 
forward Jodie Kitt (6-2) might be one of the league's surprises. "He can get up 
the court and he can get over the rim and dunk," Bednar said. Junior guard Kim 
Kira (6-1), a starter on last season's junior varsity, is the team's 
best-conditioned athlete. Senior guard Chris Boyer (5-10), also moves to the 
varsity. "Kira and Lester and Boyer can shoot," Bednar said. So can senior 
off-guard Manuel Garcia (5-9). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We're going to run the ball," Bednar said. "Every day we work on 
getting the ball up the court as fast as possible." Laker-like performances, 
however, might be slow in coming. "I don't have a lot of tall people, so my big 
players are going to have to play a lot of the time," Bednar said. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Goldstein, 5th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-16; fourth in league at 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior center Ben Feick (6-6), who averaged 10 points and 
eight rebounds as a forward last season, is the Eagles' only returner. "All the 
rest are up from the junior varsity," Goldstein said. That squad was 7-13 last 
season. Senior guard Josh Atkinson (6-1), who averaged 21 points a game, is the 
best of the newcomers. "He thinks he can shoot from anywhere," Goldstein said. 
"If he can, we'll find out." Senior forward Shawn Carson (6-3) scored 16 points 
a game last season. Senior forward Mike Greenspan (6-1), a transfer from Taft, 
is a "smooth left-hander," Goldstein said. Senior Kevin Fong (5-8), another 
good ballhandler, will start at point guard. Senior forward Dan Vigil (6-1) is 
strong inside and will fill in at forward and center. Senior Mike De vine (6-0) 
will back up at forward and guard. Sophomore guard Eric Pryor (5-10) moves to 
the varsity from the frosh-soph team. Senior center Rick Chase (6-2) is playing 
his first season of basketball. Oak Park has only nine players on the varsity. 
"That'll make it better," Goldstein said. "Everyone will get more playing 
time." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Goldstein will juggle offensive lineups and employ frequent 
substitution. "I've never carried a squad this small, but we'll see how it 
goes," he said. If the Eagles' outside game improves, so too will their chances 
of a playoff berth.

Agoura 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Kevin Pasky, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-11 overall; 3rd in league, 7-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Sean Martin (5-10) is a fundamentally complete, creative 
off-guard who, as was the case last season, will be responsible for the bulk of 
the Chargers' scoring. In fact, Pasky has given Martin's job as point guard to 
senior Brian Miller (5-9), just so there's no chance of Martin's arms tiring 
from dribbling the ball: He is going to shoot that much. Miller averaged 16.2 
points a game last season. Senior center Tony Marko (6-5) and sophomore forward 
Eddie Corridori (6-2) figure to pick up some of the scoring chores. Pasky said 
that he expects 10 points and 10 rebounds from Marko, "the most improved player 
in the program," according to Pasky. Corridori averaged 16 points a game as a 
freshman and was named the junior varsity's most valuable player. Senior Gino 
Corridori (6-1), Eddie's brother, will start at the other forward. Others 
expected to contribute are senior forward Bryce Arledge (6-3), senior guard Joe 
Marini (5-11), junior forward Diego Edber (6-2) and senior guard Mark Kelly 
(5-10), the only player other than Martin with varity experience. Agoura's 
weakness is, well, weakness; the Chargers have size but not much bulk. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Could this be the season that Agoura challenges Santa Clara, which has 
won nine of the past 10 league championships and last season's 2-A Division 
state title? Probably not, but Pasky remains positive. "I think we'll be 
competitive with them," he said. "In the four years I've been at Agoura, this 
is the best varsity team we've had." As was the case last season, the Chargers 
probably will need to beat Nordhoff for second place. This season, Calabasas 
also could be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas 
</P>
<P>
COACH: David Hoffman, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-12 overall; 4th in league, 4-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Jim Friedlander, Greg Waugh, Dan Feldman, Jason Young and Tom 
Hoover all started several games last season for Hoffman, who was in his first 
season. They're all back and that should make for a much-improved Coyote team. 
Friedlander (6-3), who averaged 12.5 points and five assists as a forward last 
season, has been moved to the point. Waugh (6-7), a senior center, and Young 
(5-10), a junior guard, also scored about 10 points a game. Waugh contributed 
more than five rebounds a game. Young recently had surgery on his knee and is 
not expected back until the start of league play. Mitch Chernow (6-3) figures 
to fill in as a power forward. Feldman (6-4) is a senior forward and Hoover 
(6-1) is a junior guard with a strong perimeter game. Hoover has Hoffman's 
endorsement as the team's most improved player. That alone probably isn't good 
enough to challenge the likes of Santa Clara, but Agoura and Nordhoff are 
certainly within reach. Another player expected to help the Coyote cause is 
forward Brian Ferring (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Calabasas might start slowly, but the Coyotes probably will improve as 
the season progresses. Their early season schedule includes Crespi and 
Chaminade, and they play in the Hart tournament. "You have to schedule 
according to talent and experience," Hoffman said. "We have to face as much 
quality competition as we can."

IMPROVING MIRA MESA MAY POSE PROBLEMS FOR MORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HAZELTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two points about Mira Mesa High School's football season that should 
concern Morse Coach John Shacklett. 
</P>
<P>
First is Morse's 21-17 victory against Mira Mesa earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Second is Mira Mesa's 27-10 victory over Chula Vista in the quarterfinals 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Chula Vista was undefeated and had also defeated Mira Mesa, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
So Shacklett can't expect the past to hold true to form in tonight's 3-A 
section semifinal at 7:30 at Southwestern College. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa is looking to avenge a loss that easily could have been a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Although Morse won, Mira Mesa was inside the Morse five twice in the second 
half, coming away with only three points. On its final possession, Mira Mesa 
drove to the Morse four, but the Tigers' defense forced a fumble to clinch the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a situation where you called 'X' and you wish you would have called 
'Y,' " said Mira Mesa Coach Brad Griffith. "It's just part of the game. Get us 
in the same situation (tonight) and we might do something different." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Shacklett will try to make sure Mira Mesa does not get in position to 
win late, thereby keeping his Tigers from San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, where 
they have finished the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Morse made sure that situation wouldn't happen against San Dieguito in the 
second round. The Tigers scored 14 points before San Dieguito took a snap, and 
Morse rolled to a 42-21 victory at Southwestern College. 
</P>
<P>
David Dunn -- who caught a 73-yard touchdown pass -- was the catalyst against 
San Dieguito. But in the teams' first meeting, Mira Mesa kept him from catching 
a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings up the main problem with trying to stop the Morse offense: Just 
who do you go after? 
</P>
<P>
Although Mira Mesa stopped Dunn, fullback Utotofo Faime rushed for 125 yards 
and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito tried to focus on Morse's running game, but Teddy Lawrence 
completed seven of 12 passes for 236 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Jessie Campbell, who ran for 1,012 yards this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Morse defense is expected to focus on Mira Mesa's running game. Quarterback 
J.J. Rowlett is always a threat when he runs, and running back Wayne Pittman, 
who had a 52-yard touchdown run against Chula Vista, is capable of the big 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to make sure we punch it in when we get the chance," 
Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, Morse will have to make sure it doesn't take Mira Mesa 
lightly. Last year, Morse was 8-1 and cruising into its final regular season 
game against Mira Mesa, a decided underdog. Mira Mesa won, 17-14, but Morse 
still advanced to the playoffs, where it defeated Orange Glen, 31-28, in the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Morse will not get a second chance.

FAST FINISH PUTS PALOMAR IN BOWL TODAY

<P>
Five games into the 1989 community college football regular season, Palomar 
College had won only once. But the Comets have won their past five games and 
now are ready for the first postseason game in their 45-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar (6-4), the Mission Conference South Division champion, will play 
Ventura (7-3) in the fifth Hall of Fame Bowl at 1:30 p.m. today at Balboa 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, the third-place team in the Western State Conference, won its first 
seven games before losing its final three. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Palomar's turnaround is second-team All-American quarterback Scott 
Barrick, the Comet's third national passing leader in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Barrick, a former San Diego State and Fallbrook High quarterback, was 
instrumental as Palomar set one national, seven conference and 18 school 
records this season. 
</P>
<P>
With 248 pass completions, Barrick is the nation's single-season leader -- 
breaking the mark of 233 set by Palomar's Duffy Daugherty in 1988. His 3,225 
passing yards and 449 attempts (three short of the national record) broke 
Daugherty's conference marks of 3,006 and 433. 
</P>
<P>
In Palomar's season finale -- a 49-28 victory over Southwestern -- Barrick 
completed 40 of 57 passes for 478 yards in only three quarters. All three marks 
were single-game Mission Conference highs. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Hansen, who caught a school-record 15 passes in that game, and Chris 
Chiarappa became the first two teammates in conference history to gain more 
than 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. Chiarappa, the conference leader 
with 73 receptions, finished with 1,218 yards, breaking the conference record 
of 1,190 set by Orange Coast's Junior Tagaloa in 1987. Hansen, a tight end who 
missed one game with a shoulder injury, had 72 receptions for 1,004 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Chiarappa and Hansen were honorable mention All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what all the records mean," Barrick said, "but it's nice. It's 
fun to have the records to go along with a winning season." 
</P>
<P>
With all the passing yards accumulated by Palomar's no-huddle, shotgun offense, 
the Comets can the run, too. In a 28-21 victory over Grossmont, Palomar gained 
260 rushing yards on 63 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Said Palomar Coach Tom Craft, a former quarterback at SDSU, "Our style of play 
is making people change their defensive scheme." JIM LINDGREN

STOLZ DECIDES NEW MEXICO STATE DOESN'T HAVE RIGHT JOB FOR HIM

Denny Stolz, former San Diego State football coach, said Friday he has 
withdrawn from consideration to fill the coaching vacancy at New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"Both professionally and financially, it was an attractive opportunity," Stolz 
said. "But it just was not the right job for me now." 
</P>
<P>
Sources had said that Stolz was the leading candidate to succeed Mike Knoll, 
who was fired two weeks ago after an 0-11 season and a 4-40 record in four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Stolz and his wife, Cena, took a two-day visit to the New Mexico State campus 
in Las Cruces last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it a lot of thought," Stolz said. "It was not an easy decision." 
</P>
<P>
Stolz, 55, said he would prefer to look for an opportunity in professional 
football but currently has no offers. 
</P>
<P>
The late-afternoon announcement apparently caught New Mexico State officials by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home Friday night, Athletic Director Al Gonzales, said: "I have 
no statement until I speak with him." 
</P>
<P>
Stolz was fired last year in his third year at SDSU. Stolz had a 16-19 record 
and led the Aztecs to the 1986 Western Athletic Conference title. He has 
remained at the school as the men's golf coach.

HOMEFED EARMARKS $115-MILLION 'CUSHION'; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE SAVINGS INSTITUTION HOPES A LOAN-LOSS RESERVE SET ASIDE IN THE 
FOURTH QUARTER WILL RENEW CONFIDENCE IN ITS WEAKENED STOCK. THE COMPANY ALSO 
PLANS TO QUICKLY LIQUIDATE $350 MILLION IN FORECLOSED REAL ESTATE.

In a move to shore up investor confidence after a precipitous two-month slide 
in its stock price, HomeFed Corp. said Friday that it will set aside loan-loss 
allowances totaling $115 million for the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed President Robert Adelizzi said the amount is not a specific provision 
for problem loans but a "general" loan-loss allowance to "provide a cushion for 
events that may occur based on historic performance." Prospects for a slowing 
economy helped persuade HomeFed to take the allowance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The allowance will also give HomeFed, the San Diego-based parent of HomeFed 
Bank, more flexibility in carrying out its plan to "liquidate on a more rapid 
basis" $350 million in foreclosed real estate properties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Likened by analysts to the $200 million set aside by Great Western Bank earlier 
this week to cover probable writedowns and loan losses, the provision is meant 
to assure the investment community that HomeFed has adequately reserved for 
loan problems, said Allan Bortel, an analyst with the Shearson Lehman Hutton 
investment firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed stock has been battered in recent weeks, falling from a 1989 high of 
$47.50 in early October to close at $29.125 in Thursday trading, a 39% drop. 
The stock market reacted favorably to Friday's announcement, as HomeFed stock 
closed Friday at $30.75, up $1.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
The stock slide was hastened in October when HomeFed announced a dip in 
earnings and that its problem loans and foreclosed real estate had jumped to 
2.85% of total assets as of Sept. 30, up from 2.45% of assets three months 
previous. A high percentage of non-performing loans tends to diminish an 
S&amp;L's earning power. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the stocks of HomeFed and other savings and loans have suffered by 
Wall Street's fears that the California real estate market is softening and 
that the state's economy will suffer from expected cuts in defense spending, 
said Dan Williams, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. investment firm in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L stocks have also suffered from the tough new capital standards imposed 
on the industry by the S&amp;L rescue bill passed by Congress last summer. By 
making acquisitions more difficult, the capital requirements have worked to 
delay the long-anticipated "consolidation" that was expected to hit the S&amp;L 
industry once the bail-out package was resolved, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are few enough potential buyers among the thrifts themselves that they 
are taking the view that it's a buyer's market and that there's no rush," 
Williams said. "A lot of S&amp;Ls will be available to be bought because (the 
troubled S&amp;Ls) don't have a lot of choice except to be acquired." 
</P>
<P>
Bortel of Shearson Lehman Hutton described the $115-million loss allowance as a 
"catharsis" that will turn HomeFed stock around in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed said the after-tax effect of the loan-loss allowance will be a 
$68-million charge on fourth-quarter earnings. That charge will be largely 
offset by a $62-million after-tax benefit resulting from the merger of HomeFed 
subsidiary Columbus Savings into HomeFed Bank, which was also announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi said the loan-loss allowances, which should bring HomeFed's 
non-performing assets down to about 2.2% of total assets, will "assuage 
(investor) concerns about the California real estate market and our ability to 
manage through any potential recession that may occur." 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed decided to "move those (foreclosed properties) out more quickly" in 
light of new risk-based capital standards that require S&amp;Ls to have roughly 
twice the capital on hand for foreclosed property as for real estate loans. The 
requirement gives S&amp;Ls more incentive to get the foreclosures off their 
books, Adelizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus Savings, a $700-million thrift with 14 branches in the San Francisco 
Bay Area, was acquired by HomeFed late last year but had been operated as a 
separate subsidiary. By folding Columbus into HomeFed, the S&amp;L is entitled 
to use Columbus' $170 million in tax-loss carryforwards, an action that will 
result in an after-tax benefit of $62 million in the fourth quarter, Adelizzi 
said.

TRADING OLD COLD WAR GEAR FOR SOME GOOD, COLD CASH; 
</P>

SURPLUS: THE SOVIETS ARE HOLDING AN AUCTION TO SELL EQUIPMENT. SOME OF IT WAS

For sale: Used 12-wheel truck, with trailer. Army green. Maximum speed 25 
m.p.h. Weight 62,000 pounds. Previously used only for hauling nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
That was one of the offerings Friday at an unusual Red Tag Sale put on by the 
Soviet Ministry of Defense and several semi-public organizations to recoup some 
of the cold cash spent in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
The sale items were military support equipment for the medium-range nuclear 
missiles destroyed under a 1987 U.S.-Soviet agreement, and they were on the 
market as part of the Soviet drive to reorient its economy from military to 
domestic needs. 
</P>
<P>
Items as small as rolls of cable, for as little as $1.85, and as big as the 
12-wheel monster MAZ547-B truck for $49,600, were packed into an exhibition 
hall in Moscow's Sokolniki Park to be sold to whomever came up with the most 
money the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to learn how this equipment can be used in the national economy," said 
Yuri Vorontsov, a spokesman for the sale. 
</P>
<P>
One of the sale's organizers, Elvin Kalinin, said more and different equipment 
might be offered at later sales, depending on the success of this first one. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, the organizers might also offer after-sales service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 100 potential buyers milled around the drafty exhibition hall, among 
them Gennady Gritsevsky, a departmental director for the government 
environmental commission, Goskompriroda. 
</P>
<P>
Gritsevsky was looking for a vehicle to turn into a mobile environmental 
laboratory to take to chemical factories and dumps. He was facing down another 
green truck, this one with a cabin built onto its flatbed. 
</P>
<P>
The starting price was $21,700, but that's not what was bothering Gritsevsky. 
It was just too big. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't use it on the street," he said, and then huddled with one of the 
organizers who said the Ministry of Defense might have something more suitable 
that it would be willing to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Another organizer who refused to give his name said the Defense Ministry could 
deliver several hundred such trucks if buyers wanted them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest headaches has been pricing the equipment, Vorontsov said. 
Although military equipment is very specific and expensive to manufacture, many 
of the costs are hidden in the Soviet economy.

1 IN 15 EMPLOYEES IN STUDY CAUGHT STEALING; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: ELEVEN MERCHANDISERS RECOVERED $7.3 MILLION STOLEN BY WORKERS. 
SHOPLIFTERS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT $2 MILLION LESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Employee theft, long considered a big problem for retailers, now appears to 
have mushroomed to the point where workers are stealing far more merchandise 
than are shoplifters. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion of a new poll of 11 major U.S. merchandisers. The study, 
by the consulting firm Jack L. Hayes International, found that nearly one in 
every 15 retail workers at the chains surveyed were caught stealing. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, said the firm's president, Jack Hayes: "You have to ask, how many 
people are actually caught?" Hayes estimated that retailers nab "only about 25% 
of those who are stealing." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the burgeoning employee-theft problem, industry experts 
said, is that retailers pay much more attention to catching shoplifters than to 
catching thieves on their own payrolls. Employees "have become more brazen 
because they haven't been pursued like customers who shoplift," said Gene 
McKenzie, a retailing consultant for the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
For example, McKenzie said, surveillance cameras tend to be trained on the 
sales floor where customers are, rather than on employees working at the cash 
register or in the back room. Likewise, mirrors are set up to let employees 
watch customers rather than each other. 
</P>
<P>
Employees, unlike most customers, also know how to disarm the tags many 
retailers now place on merchandise to trigger alarms when someone tries to 
sneak out the door without paying. 
</P>
<P>
Advances in retailing technology, however, may be starting to curb employee 
theft. Jeffrey P. Luker, a retailing consultant at Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., 
said electronic cash registers and other computerized inventory-tracking 
equipment are helping retailers pinpoint where their losses are occurring. It's 
been especially useful, he said, in spotting employees who fleece their bosses 
by undercharging their friends at the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
Previous studies have shown that retailers have generally considered employee 
theft only a slightly larger problem than shoplifting. They have attributed 
roughly 45% of their "shrinkage" to employee theft, another 40% to shoplifting 
and the rest largely to bookkeeping and cash register errors. 
</P>
<P>
The figures in the Hayes study released Friday, however, showed that the 11 
retail chains surveyed recovered $7.3 million in merchandise from employees who 
were caught stealing, about $2 million more than was recovered from 
shoplifters. Consultants said the gap probably would be far wider if retailers 
were as good at nabbing unscrupulous employees as they are at catching 
shoplifters. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the average amount recovered from employees was 
$890, compared to $57 for shoplifters. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said employees and customers who steal normally aim for expensive 
women's wear along with such items as audio cassettes and videotapes. Other 
common targets are consumer electronics goods, including stereos, televisions 
and radios. 
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Hayes firm, which is based in Stanfordville, N.Y., involved 
five mass merchandise companies and six department stores chains with more than 
1,300 stores nationwide and overall sales exceeding $13 billion. The names of 
the companies surveyed were not released.

INDICTED RECORD PROMOTER ALLEGEDLY THREATENS WITNESS

<P>
A former record promoter indicted on racketeering, fraud and other charges for 
making "payola" payments to radio station programmers has allegedly threatened 
a former employee expected to testify against him, a federal prosecutor said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorney Drew Pitt also told a federal magistrate that 
authorities believe that Joseph Isgro, 42, has Mafia connections that might be 
employed to make good on the alleged threats. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt said Isgro had financial ties as recently as 1986 with East Coast mobster 
Joe Arnome, who Isgro was known to refer to as "Uncle Joe." Arnome has been 
convicted of racketeering, Pitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor made the allegations at a bail hearing in which Isgro's bond was 
lowered to $300,000 from $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Pitt said Isgro in early 1987 had "threatened (to) harm" 
David Michael Smith, a former Isgro employee who is expected to testify against 
him. Pitt said the threat had been made after Isgro arranged for Smith to go to 
Britain. One of the charges in the indictment -- obstructing justice -- 
involves allegations that Isgro persuaded Smith to flee the country after Smith 
was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt said he had raised the issue of the alleged threat so that Isgro would be 
restrained from talking to any witnesses except through his lawyer. Pitt said 
he was pleased that this had been made a condition of Isgro's bail being 
lowered. 
</P>
<P>
Isgro's attorney, Don Re, has called the indictment "unfounded and 
unjustified."

Lockheed to Close Unit: Lockheed Corp. said it will close a money-losing New 
Jersey unit and lay off 950 workers after the unit failed to win new business 
from the government in heated competition. Lockheed said it will consolidate 
operations at Plainfield, N.J.-based Lockheed Electronics Co. with another

PERSONAL FINANCE: STOCKING STUFFERS THAT OFFER PROFIT POTENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A partridge in a pear tree? Four calling birds? Seven swans a-swimming? 
</P>
<P>
You can sing about these Christmas gifts all you want. But what if your true 
love (especially children, nieces or nephews) needs something that will last, 
pay interest, appreciate in value or teach them about managing money? 
</P>
<P>
Stocks, savings bonds, mutual funds or investment guides still make great 
gifts. And some can be purchased for minimal amounts -- amounts that could grow 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some suggestions for potentially profitable stocking stuffers: 
</P>
<P>
* Stocks. Normally, buying only a few shares of IBM or AT&amp;T can be 
expensive in terms of commissions -- and stockbrokers give you dirty looks 
because it's a hassle for them to handle such small orders. But some brokerage 
houses will allow you to buy small numbers of shares for minimal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch's downtown Los Angeles office, for example, charges only a $2.35 
handling charge -- and no commission -- if you want to buy one to three shares 
of stock, says John R. Queen, a senior resident vice president. (He cautions, 
however, that not all Merrill Lynch offices offer this program.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fun thing; we've done it for a long time," Queen says. Kids' favorites 
include shares in Walt Disney and Mattel, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion: If you have stocks that have appreciated in value over the 
years, consider giving them to your children if they're age 14 or over. That 
will save you taxes, because capital gains can be taxed at their usually lower 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
* Mutual funds. These will give your loved ones more diversification for the 
money and could cost you less in sales charges if you choose the no-load 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of good funds to choose from. But some also allow low or no 
minimum initial investments, are free of sales charges and boast good long-term 
performance records. 
</P>
<P>
One group with no minimum investment requirement is Twentieth Century 
(800/345-2021). Its Twentieth Century Select fund, which invests in 
growth-oriented firms, has gained 42.9% in the past year and 696.7% for the 
past 10 years, ranking it fifth among all funds in that period, according to 
Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago service that tracks fund performance. 
</P>
<P>
That group also offers Twentieth Century Giftrust, a fund specifically designed 
for parents to buy shares for their kids. The fund will set up a trust to hold 
your child's shares, keeping the child from tapping the funds for a new stereo 
set or other unintended purpose. The trust also provides tax advantages. The 
flip side is that the trust must be held for 10 years or until your child is 
18, whichever comes later. And it is irrevocable, meaning you can't take the 
money back for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Another strong-performing group with no minimum investment requirement is the 
Janus group of funds (800/525-3713). Its value-oriented Janus Fund is up 50.4% 
in the past year and 672.8% for the past 10 years, ranking it seventh for the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, particularly for 
these aggressive funds. But if you're giving investments to young people, it's 
not a bad idea to give them aggressive stock funds that -- while volatile in 
the short run -- have the greatest profit potential over the long term. It's 
not as though your kids will be retiring next year and need the cash right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks and mutual funds also are ideal vehicles for saving for your kids' 
college education through custodial accounts set up through the Uniform Gifts 
to Minors Act. The act allows you to manage investments for your children. 
Again, your kids can't access the investments immediately, so they can't run 
off and use the proceeds for frivolous purchases. 
</P>
<P>
* Savings bonds. OK, you insist, the stock market is for gamblers. You want 
something safer and more stable. 
</P>
<P>
Savings bonds can do the trick. These have always been great gifts, in part 
because you can buy one very conveniently from your local bank for as little as 
$25. They are not taxable until maturity and are backed by Uncle Sam's full 
faith and credit. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, there will be an added incentive to put a savings bond under your loved 
one's Christmas tree: Starting in January, the yield from Series EE bonds will 
become free of federal tax (they are already free of state and local tax) if 
you use the proceeds to fund your child's college education and you meet 
certain income criteria. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for a complete tax break, you must have modified adjusted gross 
income -- including Social Security and retirement income -- below $60,000 for 
couples and $40,000 for singles at the time you cash in the bonds. You can 
still get a partial tax break if your adjusted income falls below $90,000 for 
couples and $55,000 for singles. 
</P>
<P>
Another hitch: To qualify for the tax break, you have to hold the bonds in your 
own name, not your child's. 
</P>
<P>
* Gold. Prices of this precious metal have taken off lately, triggering a 
mini-buying spree in gold bullion coins, whose values fluctuate with the market 
price of gold. Smaller sizes of these coins are suitable for rings, charm 
bracelets, cuff links, stick pins, earrings, necklaces and other jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest new bullion coin is the Australian Kangaroo Nugget, which is minted 
on only a limited basis (possibly giving it greater appreciation potential) and 
comes in a presentation capsule that keeps it in mint condition, says Bruce L. 
Kaplan, president of Kaplan &amp; Co., a precious metals consulting firm in 
Santa Monica. The Kangaroo comes as small as 1/20th of an ounce, which can be 
bought for about $40. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to support Uncle Sam, then stick with the American Eagle bullion 
coin. 
</P>
<P>
* Investment books and periodicals. Instead of giving a stock or coin, why not 
make your friend an informed, up-to-date investor first? 
</P>
<P>
Subscriptions to such investment magazines as Money and Changing Times or such 
newspapers as the Wall Street Journal or Investor's Daily are often popular. 
</P>
<P>
Among investment books, there's a lot -- maybe too much -- to choose from. 
However, if you had to pick one from among the plethora of new entries from 
this year, go for "One Up on Wall Street: How to Use What You Already Know to 
Make Money in the Market" by Peter Lynch with John Rothchild (Simon &amp; 
Schuster, $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
Lynch is the superstar portfolio manager of Fidelity Magellan Fund, this past 
decade's top-performing mutual fund. The book, which provides tips on stock 
investing from one of the best stock pickers of all time, is entertaining, full 
of common sense and oriented to the novice investor -- although it's still a 
bit heavy for kids.

Debt-ridden Campeau Corp. will not accept less than $1 billion for its 
Bloomingdale's department store chain and has set a Dec. 8 deadline for bids, a 
company spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sanger, spokesman at Campeau's Cincinnati office, said if Campeau doesn't 
get the price it wants, it will take the trend-setting chain off the auction 
block. 
</P>
<P>
Sanger said a $1-billion minimum price tag for Bloomingdale's "is pretty close 
to being correct." 
</P>
<P>
Campeau also has set Dec. 8 as a deadline for potential buyers to notify the 
retail and real estate company of the seriousness of their interest in 
acquiring Bloomingdale's, Sanger said. A short list will then be drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's has 17 stores located in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, 
Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Florida and Texas.

FIRED AMERICAN SAYS JAPANESE DISCRIMINATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the top-ranking American executives at Hakuhodo Advertising America Inc. 
said Friday that he was fired "without merit" and may sue the company for what 
he called a "history of discrimination against Americans" at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply regret having to do this," said Kent Charles Cooper, vice president 
and director of public relations at the Los Angeles office of the Japanese 
agency. "But I intend to show a long, consistent pattern of discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Hakuhodo executives strongly deny the allegations. "What he says is not true," 
said Tadashi Toma, executive vice president and general manager at the office. 
"We have only three Japanese on a staff of 40. It is only an internal 
adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the agency's U.S employees are American, said Taka Arai, associate 
general manager at the office. "He was laid off based on his performance," Arai 
said. "He's taking it too personally." 
</P>
<P>
But Cooper, 30, claimed that a total of nine Americans have been fired from 
Hakuhodo in recent weeks, including Brian Ribbey, who, as vice president and 
management director, was the senior ranking American in the Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
Ribbey, however, sees things differently from Cooper. "I don't think they 
listen to what American management has to say about the company," said Ribbey, 
"but I don't think that's discriminatory." He said the layoffs occurred because 
the agency is trying to cut its budget. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs at Hakuhodo began shortly after the agency spent nearly $1 million 
but still failed to land the much sought-after ad business for American Suzuki 
Motor Corp. Although the firm's Japanese parent company ranks as one of the 
largest agency's in the world with annual billings of $4 billion, its Los 
Angeles office has struggled for business since it opened 13 years ago. Some 
sources estimate that the office, whose largest clients are All Nippon Airways 
and Hitachi, may be losing upward of $1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
The woman who is filling in as public relations director said she doesn't think 
the agency discriminates against Americans. "I'm a white, American woman who is 
now head of public relations at Hakuhodo," said Jo DeLyon, acting vice 
president of public relations. "Is that discrimination?" 
</P>
<P>
Cooper was unwilling to detail specifics of the alleged discrimination. He said 
he is now in the process of hiring an attorney, and he wants to wait for legal 
guidance.

URBAN ENERGY FROM STERN/BERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mike Stern/Bob Berg Quartet's Thursday sets at Santa Monica's At My Place 
had all the Sturm und Drang of a 42nd Street subway station at rush hour. The 
New York-based group showcased a brand of improvisational music that pulsated 
with restless urban energy. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, a veteran sideman with groups ranging from Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears to 
Miles Davis, is a state-of-the-art contemporary guitarist. His masterfully 
executed solos -- solidly based on a Jimi Hendrix/John McLaughlin foundation -- 
pushed aside the barriers between styles. 
</P>
<P>
At times, he moved very close to what might be described as heavy-metal jazz; 
at other times his rich harmonies recalled an intensely energized Jim Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Berg's tenor saxophone playing was equally fervent -- at times too much so. A 
powerful technician, he seemed determined to attack every solo with his 
complete arsenal of musical weaponry. The resulting series of improvisations 
took the same basic arc -- from opening musical pleasantries to climactic peaks 
filled with wild-eyed flurries of notes. Impressive, but ultimately too 
repetitive. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, for a group in which half the personnel were the leaders, the 
evening's most powerful moments were provided by drummer Dennis Charles. His 
solo on the concluding number (which, like many of the others, was 
unidentified) made one suspect that there were one or two extra percussionists 
hiding behind the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Lincoln Goines, a solid rhythm player, was the rock on which the other 
group members built their soloistic impromptus. DON HECKMAN

HUNGARY PLANS TO SLASH ARMED FORCES 25% OVER 2 YEARS

<P>
Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth said Friday that Hungary will slash its armed 
forces by up to 25% in the next two years, scrapping many offensive weapons and 
regrouping them away from its western frontier. 
</P>
<P>
He also announced a shake-up in the defense command, replacing the army chief 
of staff and dismissing three deputy ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing top Defense Ministry officials, Nemeth said the unilateral cuts are 
designed to promote success at the Vienna talks on conventional forces in 
Europe, the state news agency MTI reported. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts in hardware and personnel are on top of a 9% reduction announced last 
January for implementation by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"These cuts are being made for a combination of both financial and political 
expediency," a Western defense attache said, noting Hungary's budgetary 
problems and the unpopularity of the army. 
</P>
<P>
In the reshuffle Friday, Lt. Gen. Laszlo Borsits replaces Col. Gen. Jozsef 
Pacsek as army chief of staff. Ferenc Karpati remains defense minister and Maj. 
Gen. Ferenc Szombathelyi was appointed deputy minister.

12 water wells in Arleta to replace contaminated North Hollywood wells, despite 
the project's proximity to a closed garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
The $33-million Tujunga Well Field Project, which has drawn scattered 
opposition from nearby residents, was approved without dissent by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said the wells would provide much-needed drinkable 
water for all sections of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gordon Murley of Woodland Hills, representing the Federation of 
Hillside and Canyon Assns., questioned whether water from the wells in the 8800 
block of Arleta Avenue could be guaranteed to be pure, since the site is about 
3,000 feet from the closed Sheldon-Arleta landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike modern dumps, the bottom of the Sheldon-Arleta facility was not lined to 
prevent seepage, and Murley and others suggest that toxic materials could 
percolate down to the water supply. 
</P>
<P>
City water officials "have never been able to say where the contamination" that 
has forced closure of nearby wells "comes from," Murley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Duane L. Georgeson, Department of Water and Power assistant general 
manager, said, "We've checked carefully, and at present there is no 
contamination. We are confident that the project can be constructed with no 
threat to the water supply of our customers." 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson said the water will be tested regularly for contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Even if limited contamination is discovered, he said, the water supply can be 
filtered or diluted with water from other sources to keep it drinkable, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing last month before the council's Environmental Quality and Waste 
Management Committee, several residents complained that noise from the well 
pumps would disturb them in their homes and would lower property values. 
</P>
<P>
They also complained that a 3-million-gallon water storage tank to be built as 
part of the project will visually blight their residential neighborhood.

COURT LIFTS PORTION OF RENT LAW; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE COURT OF APPEAL RULES THAT LOS ANGELES' RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE 
DOES NOT APPLY TO MOBILE HOMES INSTALLED AFTER OCT. 1, 1978. TENANTS FEAR THEIR 
COSTS WILL INCREASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A recent ruling by the state Court of Appeal has lifted portions of the Los 
Angeles city rent control ordinance on trailer parks, jarring city officials 
and mobile home tenants who fear that rents will skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for park owners said he doubted the impact would be great. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling leaves intact rent control restrictions on mobile homes installed 
before Oct. 1, 1978, but lifts the restrictions on those installed since then. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Gwendolyn Poindexter said Friday that the city is appealing 
the ruling, involving Los Olivos Mobile Home Park of Sylmar, to the state 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
At issue, Poindexter said, is the appellate court's interpretation of a 1979 
rent control ordinance, which applies to all mobile home parks and some 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance exempted apartments built after Oct. 1, 1978, from rent controls, 
she said. A three-judge panel ruled Sept. 16 that the ordinance also exempts 
mobile homes installed after 1978, Poindexter said. 
</P>
<P>
Units installed before that date are still covered by rent control, which 
limits rent increases based on the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling creates problems probably not foreseen by the judges, Poindexter 
said. Under the ruling, if a mobile home owner replaces his unit with a new 
mobile home, that new home would not qualify for rent control, even if it 
occupies the same space as the old home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
This impact "really discriminates" against mobile home owners, said James A. 
Fleck, head researcher in the rent stabilization section of the Los Angeles 
Community Development Department. "They are bound to keep old, dilapidated 
coaches in place." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert L. Weiss, an attorney for Los Olivos, said other Los Angeles 
ordinances ensure that mobile home owners would still be covered by rent 
control, even if they replace their units with new ones. 
</P>
<P>
There are 67 mobile home parks with 6,800 spaces in the city, most of them in 
the San Fernando Valley, Fleck said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said it is unclear how many mobile homes in Los Angeles would 
lose the protection of rent control because of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he doubted the ruling would have a wide impact. He said attorneys 
for the city and Los Olivos have identified only five mobile home parks, with a 
total of 533 spaces built after 1978, which are unequivocally affected by the 
court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Farris Robertson, a real estate agent and resident of Los Olivos, said some 
neighbors recently received letters telling them their rents would be raised 
because of the court ruling. One neighbor was told her rent would increase from 
$330 to $385, he said. Robertson predicted that other park owners will follow 
suit as the ruling becomes better known. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Robertson asked the Los Angeles City Council to enact an emergency 
ordinance that would freeze mobile home rents until the Supreme Court can hear 
the Olivos case. The council took no action but said it would study the 
request.

'POLITE BANDIT' SENTENCED TO 28 YEARS IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man prosecutors dubbed the "Polite Bandit" because of his courteous manners 
while robbing small businesses was sentenced Friday to 28 years and eight 
months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber imposed the sentence on Gary Allen 
Smith, 45, of Long Beach in connection with a string of 30 robberies, 18 of 
which occurred in the San Fernando Valley during the first four months of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had asked that Smith be sentenced to 30 years, nine years less than 
the maximum, because Smith pleaded guilty before the case went to trial. They 
dubbed Smith the "Polite Bandit" because they said his well-mannered demeanor 
distinguished him from typical criminals. 
</P>
<P>
But police called Smith the "Bungler" because he was a robber who bungled, 
according to a probation report. Smith once overlooked $3,000 that a clerk had 
thrown into a garbage can during the robbery, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was arrested in April at a drug treatment center in Tarzana when his 
mother turned him in after her car was traced to several of the robberies, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Smith told probation officers that he was trying to kick his heroin addiction 
at the time of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're sick with dope . . . you really do some stupid things," Smith said 
in a statement contained in the probation report. "I was trying to detox when I 
was caught." 
</P>
<P>
But probation officers recommended a long prison term because they noted that 
Smith has a record of drug and other violations dating back more than 20 years.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTORCYCLIST KILLED AFTER HIGH-SPEED CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amotorcyclist led police on a lengthy pursuit in Simi Valley at speeds up to 70 
m.p.h. until he crashed into a chain-link fence on a dead-end street and died, 
Simi Valley police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Anthony James, 21, of Simi Valley died of head injuries at Simi Valley 
Adventist Hospital about an hour after the 5:50 p.m. crash Thursday at the west 
end of Fitzgerald Road. 
</P>
<P>
James ran four red lights after police tried to pull him over for speeding, 
police said. Police gave up the chase when they lost sight of the motorcycle 
but sighted him again about 30 minutes later, weaving in and out of traffic, 
and renewed the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they lost sight of him again, but minutes later discovered his 
wrecked motorcycle next to the fence. James, who was not wearing a helmet, had 
a suspended automobile driver's license and had been convicted of nine vehicle 
code violations since February, 1987. He was not licensed to drive a 
motorcycle, police said.

EL TORO STOPS THE DIABLOS IN OVERTIME 
</P>

<P>
Danny Maestas scored on a four-yard run in overtime and then intercepted a pass 
on the final play of the game to give El Toro High School a 28-21 victory over 
Mission Viejo Friday night in front of 6,200 in Orange Coast College's LeBard 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (12-1) advances to the Division III championship game next Saturday 
against defending champion Paramount, trying to win its fourth Southern Section 
championship in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (10-3) lost in the semifinals for the third consecutive year and 
the second time in overtime. It was also the Diablos' second loss of the year 
to El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were tied, 21-21, at the end of regulation and the outcome was 
decided by the California Tiebreaker, in which each team is given four plays to 
try to score from the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro lost the coin toss and had first possession. A pass interference call 
on El Toro's second play gave the Chargers a first down at Mission Viejo's 
four-yard line and Maestas scored off left tackle on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Romaniszyn's extra-point kick pushed El Toro ahead, 28-21, and now it was 
Mission Viejo's turn to try to score. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo quarterback Tim Snowden, who played brilliantly most of the 
night, had trouble finding open receivers in the ensuing series. Snowden threw 
three incomplete passes and then was intercepted on his final attempt by 
Maestas. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro had lost an overtime game to Santa Ana in the opening round of the 
playoffs last year and was defeated by Aviation in overtime in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
For Mission Viejo, the loss brought back bitter memories of a 7-6 overtime loss 
to Los Alamitos two years ago in the semifinals, where placekicker Eric Ekdahl 
missed an extra-point attempt when his kicking shoe filled with mud on a sloppy 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's defense dominated play for 30 minutes before El Toro came alive 
midway through the third quarter. Steve Stenstrom, considered by many to be the 
top quarterback in the county, was held to only 17 yards passing in the first 
half as Mission Viejo built a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom was continually pressured into poor passes and was sacked six times. 
But he managed to throw two touchdown passes -- a 57-yarder to tight end Bo 
Haley and a looping 19-yarder to wide receiver Rob Johnson -- that finally got 
El Toro going. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden, overshadowed by Stenstrom and Capistrano Valley's Tony Solliday all 
season, passed for 252 yards, including 189 yards in the first half. Mission 
Viejo appeared to be in control with 10:46 remaining to play when tailback Mark 
Gaw scored on a one-yard run on fourth down for a 21-14 lead, but Stenstrom 
rallied El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
There were two big pass plays in El Toro's rally to tie the score. First, 
Stenstrom teamed with Johnson on a 25-yard play and then he lofted a high 
spiral in the left corner of the end zone that Johnson managed to catch despite 
double coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo was hurt by 145 yards in penalties, including a critical holding 
and pass interference call against defensive back Bill Denny. But Denny also 
had a pass interception in the fourth quarter that set up Gaw's touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo intercepted Stenstrom twice and kept him off balance all evening. 
Stenstrom completed 12 of 18 passes for 172 yards.

OUTSIDE HELP COST PADRES, AGENT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If Padre owner Joan Kroc had permitted the front office to handle the Mark 
Langston negotiations instead of retaining an outside attorney, Langston likely 
would have signed with the Padres instead of the Angels, agent Arn Tellem said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, with everything being equal, Mark's preference was to play for 
the San Diego Padres all along," said Tellem, Langston's agent. "If it had been 
left to the baseball people, he would have been a Padre already. But it's quite 
obvious the baseball people there are not in charge, and it's hurting that 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based attorney Fred Lane has been retained by the Padres to handle 
negotiations with Langston and reliever Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind, none whatsoever," Tellem said, "that if Dick 
Freeman (president), Tony Siegle (vice president, personnel) and Jack McKeon 
(manager) were involved, we'd already have had a press conference with Mark in 
a San Diego uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"But when the non-baseball people got involved, it put another tone on the 
negotiations. That's when it became apparent that nothing was going to get done 
with the Padres. And that's what really disappointed Mark, because that's where 
he wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, the left-handed starter who was considered the prize of the 
free-agent sweepstakes, instead signed a five-year, $16-million contract Friday 
with the Angels. It is unknown whether the Padres would have paid that kind of 
money for a free agent, but Tellem suggested that Langston might have signed 
for considerably less if the front-office had handled the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Padre front office refused comment, and Kroc was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced Mark would have signed with San Diego," Tellem said. "Mark just 
loves the area. He had a slight preference for staying in the National League 
because he liked to hit. He's got great friends there. He just thinks the world 
of (Padre players) Tony Gwynn and Bruce Hurst. . . . It would have just been 
all so easy." 
</P>
<P>
Lane has worked extensively with Kroc involving the McDonald's organization. 
Tellem said that although Lane probably is a fine lawyer, and certainly seemed 
quite competent, the fact that he has no baseball background sent a flare to 
Langston that the Padres were not going to be serious negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame, a real shame to see what's happening to that organization. No 
one's in charge, and the organization is suffering because of it. There's no 
doubt in my mind that's happening. 
</P>
<P>
"If the front-office was involved, I think they would have had both Marks 
signed by now. As it is, they have a good chance of not having any." 
</P>
<P>
The other "Mark," of course, is Davis, who won the Cy Young Award for the 
Padres last season with 44 saves. Davis, who was hoping to sign with the Padres 
just days after the end of the season, filed for free agency when negotiations 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, according to sources, are prepared to offer Davis a four-year 
guaranteed contract for $8.8 million. It would be the first time since 
negotiations began that the Padres have offered a four-year contract and the 
first four-year contract offered to a reliever since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also offered Davis salary arbitration, a procedural step most clubs 
take with their unsigned free agents to protect negotiating rights until Jan. 
8, when they would expire until May. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his agent, Alan Hendricks, are not expected to accept or reject the 
Padre offer until sifting all offers at the major league baseball winter 
meetings beginning Monday in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Royals already have made a lucrative offer in an attempt to 
acquire Davis, and the Angels and New York Yankees also have engaged in 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Davis proved that he's the best reliever in the game right now," Royals 
General Manager John Schuerholz said, "and we'd like to have him. We need to 
close the gap between us and Oakland, and having a guy like Mark Davis would 
help enable us to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Padres talked on the telephone with free-agent center 
fielder Robin Yount, 34, who was selected the Most Valuable Player of the 
American League this past season for the Brewers. Yount later met in person 
with Mike Port, general manager of the Angels. Others interested in Yount 
include the Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves and 
Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
And in an attempt to protect themselves in case they lose Davis to free agency, 
the Padres have offered free-agent left-handed reliever Craig Lefferts a 
two-year contract with an option year, according to sources. Lefferts, 32, who 
was traded by the Padres in a seven-player deal that was used to acquire Davis, 
saved 20 games for the San Francisco Giants this past season in a part-time 
role as the stopper. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Davis is our top priority," Siegle said, "but we can't sit back and wait 
for that. We've got to react before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Compte, the agent for Lefferts, said: "Right now we know we're kind of in 
the shadow of Mark Davis, and rightly so. They had little or no interest in 
Craig at the beginning, but now, their interest really has increased." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also will resume trade talks today, when Siegle and McKeon fly to 
Nashville for the winter meetings. They have a meeting scheduled Sunday with 
General Manager Hank Peters of the Cleveland Indians in which they hope to make 
a proposal for center fielder Joe Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians are interested in obtaining one of the Padres' catchers, Benito 
Santiago or Sandy Alomar, Peters said, but have yet to come up with any other 
names in a possible trade package. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do anything until we talk to everybody Sunday," Peters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He also has meetings scheduled with the Angels, Kansas City, the Boston Red 
Sox, the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous amount of interest in Joe because he's going to be an 
important player wherever he goes," Peters said. "I'm not going to say that 
team will win the pennant, but whatever club gets him will have a tremendous 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as Arn Tellem will tell you, the same held true for Langston.

SEGOTA SETS RECORD, AS SOCKERS WIN EASILY 
</P>

<P>
Sockers forward Branko Segota clutched the ball in his hands Friday night and 
counted the signatures of his teammates on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey guys, make sure everybody signs the ball," Segota said. "This was just 
another goal, but the moment is special." 
</P>
<P>
It was Segota's 255th goal for the Sockers, one ahead of the previous franchise 
record held by Juli Veee. The other reason to celebrate was the Sockers' first 
road victory, 4-0, against the St. Louis Storm at the St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to keep in front of my dad," Segota said, jokingly referring to 
teammate Steve Zungul, the MISL's all-time leading scorer. "We haven't played 
that bad on the road. The back-to-back games have killed us." 
</P>
<P>
They have another tonight at 7:30 at the San Diego Sports Arena against 
Wichita. But the Sockers (6-5) could do no wrong against the Storm. St. Louis 
forwards pounded 32 shots at goalie Zoltan Toth, but he did not bend. 
</P>
<P>
"(St. Louis) came out firing like we knew they would, but Zollie kept us in the 
game," Segota said. "We just kept playing our game all along. We knew we would 
break out of this." 
</P>
<P>
Sockers Coach Ron Newman said his team was ready to break the road slump. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to come around sooner or later," Newman said. "You work 
on the first goal, the first road win, and then it falls into place." 
</P>
<P>
Segota said the Sockers actually have been playing better on the road than at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more relaxed playing on the road because there is no pressure, no home 
fans to worry about," Segota said. "We were not pressing on the road." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers went in front, 1-0, at 7:01 of the first quarter after Godfrey 
Ingram acted too quickly on a Storm free kick. Zungul blocked the kick, carried 
the ball down the left side and hit Waad Hirmez in the box for a easy tap-in 
past David Brcic. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gabarra found Zungul alone in the corner, and he pushed a shot through 
Brcic's legs to make it 2-0 at 11:28 of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Segota made it 3-0 when he beat Brcic to the far post with 1:50 left in the 
half. Kevin Crow hit Segota down the left side, and he beat two defenders to 
score.

MONTROSE PERFORMANCE LACKS PERSONALITY

Ronnie Montrose certainly plays a lot of guitar, but these days who doesn't? 
While no less capable a fretman than when he provided the rampaging ax on Edgar 
Winter's "Frankenstein" 16 years ago, Montrose's 14-number set at the Coach 
House on Thursday evening was largely eclipsed by the array of picking peers he 
now has to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
From James Burton and Link Wray through Joe Satriani and Johnny Marr, the rock 
scene is clotted with four decades of guitar heroes, and Montrose failed to 
display a prowess or, most important, a musical personality sufficient to set 
him apart from the throng. 
</P>
<P>
Montrose had his curiously-shaped guitar hooked up to a MIDI rack to rival 
Steve Morse's, but that's about where the comparison ends. While both players 
are formidable technicians, particularly considering the intricacies of 
computer-patched guitars, Morse uses his craft to delineate a rich sense of 
composition. 
</P>
<P>
Montrose did achieve some impressive effects, at one point coaxing shimmering 
plateaus of sound from his strings with each stroke. But more often than not 
his playing seemed to promote technique for its own sake. And that's a crowded 
field. 
</P>
<P>
It's not particularly damning that Montrose is outshone by the complexity of 
Morse, Satriani and others -- beyond a point a computer becomes necessary just 
to sort out the notes -- but where his music really suffered was in that lack 
of personality. Where a Jeff Beck or Stevie Ray Vaughan play with such style 
and undiluted emotion that a couple of notes are all that is needed to identify 
them, Montrose was a musical John Doe, running predictable, signature-less 
speed patterns over his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Except for an encore number vocalized by his trio's bass player, the set was 
wholly instrumental, drawing on the current "The Speed of Sound" album, 
"Territory" and others, and introducing several selections from a disc due in 
January. A couple of numbers only served up convoluted Zeppelin riffs, but 
"Windshear" and one or two other of his own compositions allowed Montrose a 
modicum of melody. 
</P>
<P>
Before he unleashed Sammy Hagar on the world with his self-named metal band in 
the early '70s, Montrose was known as a pretty melodic player, enough so to 
land a job with Van Morrison on his "Tupelo Honey" and "St. Dominic's Preview" 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest hints Thursday that Montrose may still have some of that in him 
came on his covers of Gene Pitney's "Town Without Pity" and the Tornados' 1962 
"Telstar." On the former particularly, Montrose showed that given a strong 
melodic line to work from, he can still let rip with solos that sing instead of 
sputter.

ANTONOVICH'S VIEW ON THE NEA CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Allan Parachini's "For New NEA Chief: A Brush With Disaster," Nov. 
22: After only a short time on the job, John Frohnmayer, chairman of the 
National Endowment for the Arts, went native all the way. The arts crowd, or 
that part of it that wants taxpayers' money to pay for obscenity and attacks on 
religion and patriotism, framed a case to bait him into withholding money from 
an exhibit; then they cracked down, and he reversed himself. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is suggested, the arts crowd is willing to let up on him and let him 
keep his job. And no wonder; he has been caponized, and the operation is 
irreversible.

DAY HIKE: TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE OF PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY, McKinney is the author of hiking books and a regular 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palm Springs today is a curious sight -- a chain of sparkling green islands on 
the desert sand. For a good overview of the resort, hikers can take Museum and 
Lykken trails. 
</P>
<P>
This hike in the hills begins at the Palm Springs Desert Museum, where 
natural-science exhibits recreate the unique ecology of Palm Springs and the 
surrounding Colorado Desert. Displays interpret the astonishing variety of 
plant and animal life in addition to the powerful geological forces that shaped 
this desert land. The museum also has exhibits portraying the original 
inhabitants of the Coachella Valley, who managed to live in what seems to be a 
harsh and unforgiving land. 
</P>
<P>
The steep Museum Trail ascends the western base of Mt. San Jacinto. Letters 
painted on the rocks suggest that this was once a nature trail. After a mile 
climb, Museum Trail junctions with Lykken Trail. This trail, formerly known as 
Skyline Trail, winds through the Palm Springs hills north to Tramway Road and 
south to Ramon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Skyline Trail was renamed Lykken Trail in 1972 in honor of Carl Lykken, Palm 
Springs pioneer and the town's first postmaster. Lykken, who arrived in 1913, 
owned a general merchandise store and later a department/hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
Early Palm Springs social life consisted of stopping at the Desert Inn to check 
if any new and interesting guests had arrived, then dropping by Carl Lykken's 
store to pick up the mail, make a phone call (Lykken had the first telephone) 
and catch up on all the gossip. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From Highway 111 (Palm Canyon Drive) in the middle of 
downtown Palm Springs, turn west on Tahquitz-McCallum Way, then right on Museum 
Drive. Park in Palm Springs Desert Museum's north lot. 
</P>
<P>
The trail begins behind the museum, between the museum and an administration 
building, near a plaque honoring Carl Lykken. During the hot summer months, the 
trail is closed for health reasons (yours), but it is thoroughly enjoyable 
during cooler months. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: The trail ascends the rocky slope above the museum. Soon you'll 
intersect a private road, jog left, then resume the trail walking up the 
mountainside. As you rapidly gain elevation, the view widens from the Desert 
Fashion Plaza to the outskirts of Palm Springs to the wide-open spaces of the 
Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A mile's ascent brings you to a picnic area built by the Desert Riders, local 
equestrians whose membership included Carl Lykken. One of the Desert Riders, 
former Palm Springs Mayor Frank Bogert, is a real trail enthusiast whose 
efforts have contributed much to the state's trail system. 
</P>
<P>
The Carl Lykken trail's north leg goes to Tramway Road; it's not too exciting. 
Instead, bear left (south) on Lykken Trail, which travels the hills above town 
before descending to Ramon Road near the mouth of Tahquitz Canyon. You can 
follow Ramon Road to downtown Palm Springs or return the way you came.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: CHECKING OUT THE DAY-CARE CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm afraid I'm going to have to put my 8-month-old baby in 
day care if I'm going to be able to get the job I want and need. I'm terrified 
about child abuse in day-care centers, but my husband says that this is silly 
and highly unlikely. I'm very torn about what to do. What's your view? 
</P>
<P>
 -- R.B. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR R.B.: If there's any way you can stay with your baby for the first year 
or, preferably, two years, I'm all for it. So if it's just a case of getting a 
better job or extra money, then I believe it would be wise to wait. If, 
however, the money you'd be earning isn't "extra" but actually is necessary to 
live, if you're a single parent or if you're so driven that you'd resent 
staying home, then it's probably better to go the day-care route. 
</P>
<P>
Your concerns certainly aren't "silly." It's essential to take time to check 
out day-care centers for children of any age. It's true, however, that of 
35,845 cases of sexual child abuse reported in 1986, only 5.12% took place in 
day care or were committed by baby sitters. 
</P>
<P>
It's important for parents to teach their children about the difference between 
good touch, bad touch and confusing touch. Parents of young children also 
should be aware of signs of abuse, such as irritated genital or rectal areas, 
bruises or sores around the mouth, eating or sleeping disturbances, withdrawal 
or hyperactivity or fear of strangers or any particular stranger. Older 
children are likely to be sexually aggressive with other children if they've 
been victims of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My wife and I have planned our baby for five years and I 
thought we'd timed it perfectly. Something has gone wrong, however, because now 
that we finally have our wonderful daughter, my wife is depressed and in tears 
most of the time. I'm beginning to wonder if she really loves our child. I've 
never seen her this way before. Basically, my wife has always had a rather 
happy, easygoing disposition. What could be wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.E. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR J.E.: She could very well be suffering from postpartum depression, and 
it's important to ask your physician about this possibility. This illness is 
usually temporary and can be treated, but it can be serious enough to cause 
women to harm their babies and almost always robs them of the joy they should 
experience at this time of motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
According to an expert in this field, Dr. Susan Hickman, postpartum psychosis 
is a biochemical illness precipitated by the hormonal upheaval with the loss of 
the placenta at delivery. The illness affects about 1 in 1,000 mothers.

BOB GREENE: DAILY DOUBLE: BEXLEY, OHIO . . . AND ELVIS

<DATELINE>
<P>
BEXLEY, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So there I was, trying to be as unobtrusive as possible, wandering once again 
inside the first library I had ever visited. I was recalling the quiet, 
soothing feeling of the place -- the Bexley Public Library, my hometown library 
-- and thinking about how much it had done to instill in me a lifelong love of 
reading. I was also thinking about how I would probably never be able to write 
about it: I asked myself if there could possibly be a subject that readers of 
the column were more sick of hearing about than my fond memories of Bexley. 
</P>
<P>
The answer came in the form of an unexpected tap on my shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir?" the voice said. 
</P>
<P>
I turned around and stood face to face with Bexley's only Elvis impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, I just wanted to introduce myself," said Jamie Coyne. 
</P>
<P>
You have to understand: Bexley is a town of 15,000 people. I was not even aware 
that there was an Elvis impersonator in Bexley. But here was Jamie Coyne. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I guess I've hit the daily double," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Pardon me?" Jamie Coyne said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bexley, Elvis . . . both of you in one column is really going to drive people 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Coyne, 17, is a senior at Bexley High School. Not only is he Bexley's 
only Elvis impersonator -- he thinks he may be the only student at the high 
school who even likes Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly the other students like U2 and New Kids on the Block," he said. 
</P>
<P>
I should point out that Jamie Coyne does not look like Elvis. He is a 
clean-cut, fresh-faced lad who would be at home whitewashing wooden fences in a 
Mark Twain novel. Nevertheless, impersonating Elvis is his chosen avocation. 
</P>
<P>
"It really started the year I was 12 years old, on Halloween," he said. "My 
mother made me an Elvis suit for Halloween, and I went out dressed as Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
"Jumpsuit?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said. "A blue one." 
</P>
<P>
Then he learned to play the guitar. He estimates the number of Elvis songs he 
can perform as 657. 
</P>
<P>
He spent his freshman and sophomore years of high school at St. Charles, a 
parochial school, but transferred to Bexley -- a public school -- when he was a 
junior. One of his teachers was intrigued when he handed in a term paper on the 
topic of "How Elvis Presley Affected American Values." The teacher invited 
Jamie to sing in front of the class. He did, and then repeated the act in 
several other classes that day. 
</P>
<P>
"After school, I got a message to report to the assistant principal's office," 
he said. "I thought I was in trouble. But he just wanted me to sing 'Don't Be 
Cruel' for him." 
</P>
<P>
His fame inside the school began to spread. "I'll walk down the hallways every 
day and the other kids will say, 'Hey, Elvis,' or 'How's it goin', Elvis?' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He is not exactly playing huge arenas yet. His biggest recent performance was 
at the Reynoldsburg Tomato Festival; mostly he does children's birthday 
parties. There's not that big an Elvis market in Bexley. His standard fee is 
$50. "I'll knock it down to $25 for a nursing home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he was invited to sing at half time of Bexley's homecoming football 
game. His mother had sewn him a new jumpsuit, and he wanted to make his 
entrance to the football field in a pink Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know where I could get one," he said. "But there was this lady who 
won one from Mary Kay Cosmetics, and she agreed to drive me." Thus, backed by 
the Bexley High School Marching Band, Jamie Coyne stood on the 50-yard line and 
sang "All Shook Up" at homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
He said that even though Bexley is un-Elvislike, he is enjoying himself. "My 
dad is a public works inspector for the State of Ohio," he said. "We live on 
Chelsea. Over by the Dairy Queen?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," I said. "Near the Clark Oil station?" 
</P>
<P>
"Right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him what he was doing at the Bexley Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
"I work here three or four days a week," he said. "I file books and stamp cards 
. . . it's a good part-time job." 
</P>
<P>
"An Elvis impersonator who also works at the Bexley library," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, I do," I said, wishing him the best of everything.

The motion picture "Romero," the story of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero who 
was slain in 1980 by an assassin in San Salvador, returned Friday to four Los 
Angeles-area theaters amid new concerns over the fate of church workers in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Six Jesuit priests were murdered Nov. 16 along with their cook and her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"The continuing tragedy has aroused great interest," said Paulist Father 
Ellwood Kieser, producer of the movie that opened last September. "People want 
to understand what's going on in that country." 
</P>
<P>
Kieser said that one of the Jesuits killed, Father Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of 
Central American University, was one of the sources for the movie's script. 
</P>
<P>
Romero became archbishop of San Salvador in 1977, nearly a decade after the 
Roman Catholic Church in that country had shifted its attention from the 
wealthy and government elites to the poor. "A timid, scholarly kind of guy, 
Romero was transformed in three years as archbishop from a mouse to a tiger," 
Kieser said. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.5-million Paulist Pictures movie, starring actor Raul Julia, opened 
Sept. 8 and was showing in 14 theaters in the Los Angeles area at one point. So 
far, the movie has brought in about $1.25 million, Kieser said. The priest, 
attached to St. Paul the Apostle Parish in Westwood, was the creator and 
producer for 23 years of the "Insight" dramatic television series.

Episcopal Bishop Frederick Borsch, in his report this morning to the annual 
convention of the six-county Los Angeles Diocese, will call for the election 
next June of a new suffragan, or assistant, bishop. Suffragan Bishop Oliver B. 
Garver Jr., elected to that post in 1985, has announced plans to retire when he 
turns 65 in July. Garver also served as interim bishop for the diocese's 152 
congregations after the July, 1986, death of Bishop Robert Rusack and before 
Borsch's election in January, 1988. The two-day diocesan convention, which 
convened Friday at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, was scheduled to address 
problems of poverty and homelessness in Southern California and to discuss 
details of the proposed Diocesan Center at Echo Park in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
DATES 
</P>
<P>
A panel of scientists will discuss "Genesis, Evolution and the Possibilities of 
Faith" at 10 a.m. Sunday at the Pasadena Jewish Temple. The temple had an 
earlier forum on the subject Oct. 27, but scheduled a second panel because of 
high interest in the discussion, a spokesman said. The discussions at the 
"bagel breakfast" Sunday will begin with short talks from evolutionary 
biologist Jonathan Baskin of Cal Poly Pomona; Louis Friedman, director of the 
Planetary Society, and Arthur Lane of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The first pan-Methodist worship service in Los Angeles -- featuring 
representatives of four denominations -- will be held Sunday at 5 p.m. at Faith 
United Methodist Church, according to Pastor M. A. Robinson-Gaither. The Rev. 
Carolyn Tyler, pastor of Walker Temple in Los Angeles, will give the sermon, 
and her church's choir will provide the music for the Advent service at the 
South-Central Los Angeles church. Walker Temple is affiliated with the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church; other denominations involved are the African 
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. 
The local group is an outgrowth of the national Commission for Pan-Methodist 
Cooperation created in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
On the first anniversary of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that shook Soviet 
Armenia, St. John Armenian Cathedral in Hollywood will conduct Solemn Requiem 
services Thursday night under the auspices of Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian. Mass 
will start at 7 p.m., followed by Requiem services at 8:30 p.m. and the 9 p.m. 
blessing of a monument dedicated to the victims of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 U.S. and Canadian members of the Women's League for Conservative 
Judaism will begin a three-day social justice conference Sunday at Sinai Temple 
in Westwood. Topics include abortion, drugs, crime, ecology and illiteracy, 
according to a spokeswoman. JOHN DART

ONE COUPLE'S SWEET SMELLS OF SUCCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
Antiques dealer Sue Ann Elmore found some handwritten potpourri recipes in an 
old trunk and they inspired a whole new career. 
</P>
<P>
That was 14 years ago, according to an article in the current issue of 
Victoria, and the idea for Woodbine Herb Co. of Charlottesville, Va., was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mesmerized," she said of finding the potpourri recipes. "It seemed as 
though I already knew the recipes, as if a long-lost friend had returned." 
</P>
<P>
Right from the start she knew instinctively which oils and spices worked well 
with various herbs and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden the chemistry began to click in my mind," she said. "It was 
like being able to start reading music without any formal training." 
</P>
<P>
Herbs are a family enterprise for Sue Ann and Jim, her husband, who follow true 
18th-century methods in making their potpourris. 
</P>
<P>
Whole flowers, untreated herbs and spices are gently layered, then natural 
fixatives such as orrisroot, frankincense and myrrh are added to absorb the 
fragrance and hold it for years. 
</P>
<P>
The Elmores grow some of their own ingredients, and import such exotica as 
myrrh beads, bundles of Batavian cinnamon and hand-woven Indonesian Baleka 
baskets that double as pomanders. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sue Ann occasionally mashes comfrey leaves into a poultice to salve 
poison ivy or creates herbal blends for her pantry, it is the mixing of 
fragrances that gives her the greatest pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a knowledge of the chemical properties of herbs as well as a good 
nose to create a successful blend," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Woodbine bath herbs, a mix of mint and roses, are formulated to be 
both rejuvenating and relaxing because "bathing is a time to unwind as well as 
to renew the senses." 
</P>
<P>
History inspires Sue Ann's potpourri. Sold under private labels at Monticello 
and Mount Vernon is a carefully measured blend called "Mr. Hamilton's 
Favorite." It also is Jim Elmore's favorite and combines rosebuds, lavender, 
cornflowers and spices. 
</P>
<P>
The Elmores' potpourri business has outgrown their yard, but they remain 
devoted gardeners. At home, 60 to 70 different herbs are nurtured along with 
unusual tomatoes and other vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Since mint is a favorite, orange mint, spearmint and peppermint, wonderful for 
teas, and pineapple mint, for fruit salad, grow in the garden and spill over 
into the yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Mowing mint only helps propagate it," Sue Ann said. "And when you walk on it, 
it's so fragrant."

MOST COUPLES SOON ADJUST TO RETIREMENT, STUDY SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Retirement won't destroy a good marriage nor will it salvage a bad one, say two 
researchers who interviewed more than 200 couples to determine the effect of 
retirement on marriage. 
</P>
<P>
As time goes by, Mature Outlook magazine reports, more couples will be leaving 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Retirement neither ruins nor resurrects marriage," said Barbara Vinick. An 
assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health and a research 
sociologist at the Veterans Administration in Boston, Vinick conducted the 
three-year study with David Ekerdt, associate director of the University of 
Kansas Center on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers interviewed two groups of married couples. In one group, the 
men were in their first year of retirement. In the other, the men were still 
working and were on the average two years younger. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that a lot of people approaching retirement wonder how they'll get 
along after retirement and whether they'll get in each other's hair," Vinick 
said. "There's some natural apprehension." 
</P>
<P>
But most couples make the adjustment fairly easily, the study suggests. While 
many of the retired husbands acknowledged that they initially missed the 
camaraderie of their workplaces, most said they adjusted within a couple of 
months and were enjoying the opportunity to do projects they had been saving 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the wives had worried about having their husbands underfoot, 
they said they enjoyed spending more time with the men in a relaxed atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone doesn't react the same way to retirement, Vinick and Ekerdt said. But 
they found several common reactions to life style changes that retirement can 
bring. For example, many women in the study felt a loss of privacy in the first 
months after the husband retired. And husbands gained a new understanding of 
their wive's daily routine. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the positive aspects of retirement outweighed the negative ones, the 
study found. About 60% of the retired couples said their quality of life 
improved upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Before retirement, one spouse or the other was often worried about some aspect 
of the change," Vinick said. "After retirement, most couples said they got 
along better than they expected."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: MURDOCK RETURNS, AUTHOR TO LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS MCLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matt Murdock, Robert Ray's hard-boiled yet soft-centered Newport Beach private 
eye, is back. 
</P>
<P>
In "Merry Christmas, Murdock" (Delacorte Press; $16.95), the Irvine mystery 
writer's fourth Murdock outing, the detective is hired to investigate the 
hit-and-run accident of a U.S. senator's teen-age daughter at Xanadu, "a 
combination mall, business complex, convention hotel and pleasure circus" off 
the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation leads the bearded Vietnam vet and former cop "to the heart of 
Orange County's moneyed elite." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Ray is doing a string of local book signings and sending out 
postcards announcing his new book. The self-described guerrilla book-marketer's 
mailing list includes everyone from booksellers across the country to anyone 
who has ever given him a business card since the publication of the first 
Murdock mystery three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But this time around, Ray's promotional time is limited -- at least in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
By Christmas, Ray and his wife, Margot, will have moved out of their home in 
Irvine and into their new house in Seattle where Margot -- after 23 years at UC 
Irvine -- has been hired as director of personnel at the University of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, who has taught fiction writing part time at Chapman College in Orange the 
past 1 1/2 years and served as director of its annual writers conference, said 
he is looking forward to moving into their new hilltop home with a view of 
Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that it is with mixed feelings that he bids farewell to Orange 
County after eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic is driving me crazy," said Ray, 54, in his Texas Panhandle drawl. 
"I mean it's just driving me crazy. And Seattle is very attractive: It's real 
pretty, and Margot has family there." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "I've made some real good friends here, and I've gotten 
to know the bookstores: Book Carnival in Orange, the Bookstore in Irvine, 
Upchurch-Brown and Fahrenheit 451 in Laguna. They (the owners) are just really 
nice people. They work hard, and they do their best for local authors." 
</P>
<P>
Ray said he will also miss Costa Mesa author Jean Femling, whom he met at 
Fictionaires, the elite Orange County writing workshop. "She has helped me the 
most with my editing and reading of manuscripts and stuff. She's a great 
editor. The other thing I'm going to miss is the Chapman students. I really 
like to teach, and they're a good group and a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Does Ray's move to the far reaches of the rainy North mean a change of venue 
for Murdock, who lives above a Newport Beach surf shop? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going to happen to Murdock," Ray admitted. "He's sort of 
in limbo now." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Ray said he has already written part of his next Murdock mystery, and 
it is set in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just sitting there waiting while I finish the new book, which is about 
money laundering in Miami and the Caribbean," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The untitled new book is a mainstream thriller he has been working on for a 
year. "I can usually do a book in nine months," he said. "But this is bigger 
and has more characters. What really slowed me down is the multiple points of 
view." The Murdock books are narrated in first person. 
</P>
<P>
Ray said he is following the advice of his Los Angeles literary agent, Ben 
Kamsler, in creating different lead characters for each book. In so doing, Ray 
said, he'll have more chances of selling work to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a series character you only sell it once, so if you have 10 books 
with 10 different characters, there's the possibility of 10 different sales," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Kamsler wants him to abandon Murdock: "He just wants at least 
every other book to be something other than Murdock," said Ray, who has donated 
his papers -- "old drafts and notes for books and stuff, some of them got 
written and some didn't" -- to the UC Irvine library. 
</P>
<P>
As a mystery writer, Ray said, "the chances of really hitting it big are slim. 
There are a lot of private eyes around and the private eye field is real 
crowded. Estimates now say there are 300 male private eyes a year published and 
50 woman private investigators. And that's just a lot. That doesn't count the 
back-list of MacDonald, Parker and Chandler and all those guys. 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing with Chandler and those guys, when you write a private eye 
you're going to be compared with those guys. It's real tough. You've got to try 
to do as good as Chandler. You're just in his shadow all the time." 
</P>
<P>
As one of a handful of local writers to surface in the '80s with mystery novels 
set in Orange County, Ray said Orange County "is not as ripe as it was because 
a lot more people are doing it, and I just heard Joe Wambaugh (a Newport Beach 
resident) has done one set in Orange County, so it's not nearly as fertile as 
it was." 
</P>
<P>
In moving to Seattle, Ray will be joining novelist and New Yorker short-story 
writer Michael Chabon, a former Laguna Beach resident, who moved to that city 
last summer. (Chabon had a short story with a Laguna setting in The New Yorker 
in November.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Ray said a couple of Seattle mystery writers already have staked out 
their city as a literary setting, he's looking forward to writing a novel set 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of unguarded shores just ripe for all kinds of contraband and 
there's a lot of money -- cash -- moving in from Hong Kong and Canada, and 
there are wonderful opportunities for violence on those ferries that go across" 
Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
But the odds are, Ray said, that Murdock will stay in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"He really likes it because he's a poor guy in all this rich territory, so in 
every book he has a clean mission by acing some fat cat." Ray laughed: "He 
likes to ace the fat cats." 
</P>
<P>
Ray will be signing "Merry Christmas, Murdock" from 1 to 3 p.m. today at Book 
Carnival, 870 N. Tustin Ave., Orange; from 2 to 4 p.m. Sunday at the Bookstore, 
Heritage Plaza, Irvine, and from 8 to 9 p.m. Friday at Fahrenheit 451, 509 S. 
Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Prolific Laguna Beach author Theodore Taylor has two new suspense novels out. 
</P>
<P>
In "Sniper" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; $14.95), Taylor's new young-adult 
novel, 15-year-old Ben Jepson finds himself in charge of his father's big-cat 
preserve in the hills above El Toro while his parents are on a research trip to 
Africa. Everything is running smoothly until a sniper begins stalking the 
preserve, shooting at the animals. 
</P>
<P>
In "Monocolo" (Donald I. Fine; $18.95), Taylor's new adult thriller, a Las 
Vegas showgirl is on a date with a mobster hit man when, in self-defense, she 
slashes his eye. Blind in one eye, the hit man vows vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I've ever had two books published in one month, and that 
wasn't arranged; it just happened that way," said Taylor, 68, the author of 43 
fiction and non-fiction books. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for children's and young-adult novels such as "The Cay," Taylor has 
alternated between writing juvenile books and adult suspense novels since his 
1987 thriller set in Orange County, "The Stalker." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great change of pace," Taylor said. "I've found it invigorating to go 
back and forth, and I intend to keep doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, just back from a publicity tour of Northern California, completed "Tuck 
Triumphant" for Doubleday in July. It is a sequel to his popular children's 
book about a blind dog, "The Trouble With Tuck." 
</P>
<P>
After only a four-day break, he began working on "Kill the Tankers," an adult 
suspense novel about World War II submarine warfare for which he spent 18 days 
in Lorient, France, researching the old German submarine fleet headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
And only last week he mailed Doubleday his finished manuscript for "Woodbine 
Mall," a children's picture book about a shopping mall for wild animals. 
Explained Taylor, who wrote the story in a month: "It's another idea that came 
from walking my dog." 
</P>
<P>
Interscope, the film company that made the hit "Three Men and a Baby," has 
purchased the movie rights to "Monocolo." Another production company is 
expected to begin filming "The Stalker" soon. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor, who spent 17 years in Hollywood as a press agent, story editor and 
associate producer before quitting in 1970 to write books, will not work on the 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anything to do with that business anymore," he said. "It's much 
easier to sit in this room by myself and pick away on the typewriter than get 
involved up there. " 
</P>
<P>
Taylor will sign copies of his books from 1 to 3 p.m. today at Book Carnival in 
Orange and from 6 to 9 p.m. Friday Dec. 8 at Marriner's, 225 Forest Ave, Laguna 
Beach.

December is the month to plant blooming bulbs such as tulips, hyacinths, crocus 
and daffodils. Tulips and hyacinths need to be chilled six weeks before 
planting. 
</P>
<P>
Most bulbs prefer a sandy, well-drained soil, so it is a good idea to 
incorporate organic matter such as redwood, peat moss and sand before planting. 
Keep bulbs on the dry side until the new shoots emerge then water regularly and 
fertilize with 10-10-15 every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Prune bare root fruit and nut trees, asparagus, berries and grapes. Again 
incorporate organic matter before planting and water with B-1 to help initiate 
root growth. Apply a dormant oil spray to smother dormant insects, and mulch 
all newly-planted trees and shrubs to help protect from moisture loss and cold 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Plant amaryllis bulbs in early December for Christmas color. Plant one bulb per 
six-inch pot in a well-drained potting soil. Place in a sunny window and water 
sparingly until flower stalk appears.

. . . . AND GENERAL DECEMBER CARE TIPS 
</P>
<P>
Spruce up your container garden by filling it with colorful annuals or 
perennials that bloom in the winter. Remember to water if the containers sit 
under a covered area where the rains don't reach. 
</P>
<P>
Tidy up around the lawn and garden -- prune infected tree branches, keep fallen 
leaves raked and secure vining plants to trellises. 
</P>
<P>
Look for your living Christmas tree now while there's a good selection. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare plants for a cold winter by "hardening" them -- holding back on 
nitrogen feeding in late fall and early winter discourages new growth. 
</P>
<P>
Consider raising your flower beds for better drainage; this also allows 
accumulated salts to be leached out the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Snails and slugs love the damp winter conditions so use natural or chemical 
controls to keep them from feeding on new bulb flower shoots and annuals. 
</P>
<P>
When spraying to control pests and diseases in their dormant state, be sure to 
cover the plant from top to bottom and even on the undersides of the leaves and 
on the ground around the plant. 
</P>
<P>
To keep weeds in check during the winter rains and give a neat appearance to 
your flower beds, weed now and apply a layer of mulch. 
</P>
<P>
Plant roses, strawberries and fruit trees this month. 
</P>
<P>
Have you sprayed your peaches and nectarines to prevent peach leaf curl? If 
not, do so immediately and then follow up with another spraying before the buds 
swell.

BRASS SHINES, FURS FLY AT CENTER SHOW AND DINNER

The Scene 
</P>
<P>
Dinner at the Center Club after a concert by the Canadian Brass. The quirky, 
irreverent quintet came to the Performing Arts Center on Wednesday, compliments 
of the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 40 of whose members sipped sauvignon 
blanc post-encore and dined beside the boughs of a silver-ribboned Christmas 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Style 
</P>
<P>
The Brass perform an eclectic program -- ranging, for this Christmas show, from 
"Frosty the Snowman" to Kurt Weill to Vivaldi -- in anarchic formal wear: black 
tails and white gym shoes. The five virtuosi showed up at the party in sweaters 
and slacks and black leather shoes. Tuba player Charles Daellenbach wore a 
rumpled white T-shirt, untucked, with an unbuttoned black shirt over it. "This 
is my, um, Japanese look," he said with a sweet smile. All but trumpeter 
Frederic Mills and french horn player David Ohanian split before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Reviews 
</P>
<P>
"They are just darling," said Floss Schumacher, en route to the private dining 
room. "What's great is how they establish their virtuosity," said Eva 
Schneider, "and then get into their shtick." Louis Gluck likewise raved, 
concluding: "When they go from Bach to Dixieland it sounds like the most 
natural thing in the world." For Cynthia Illingworth, the concert recalled 
family ties. "My father plays the trumpet, and he played in a little hometown 
band with my grandfather and uncle and my aunt, who played drums," she said. 
"So I've always liked this kind of music."

PHOTOGRAPHY: PHOTO DAYS DEVELOP AMATEUR SHOOTERS' SKILLS WHILE FATTENING 
MODELS' PORTFOLIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The success of a magazine, as with almost all businesses, depends on getting 
people to buy its product. But that isn't possible unless consumers see the 
magazine. And therein lies the importance of the magazine cover. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of magazines have gone to celebrity or cheesecake covers to draw in an 
audience. These high-tech, state-of-the-art glamour images are made in the 
studios of the best-known photographers or at exotic locations. It's a 
specialized type of photography open to very few people. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Western Photographer, a magazine that bills itself as being 
for the amateur photographer. It consists primarily of features, snapshots of 
models in swimsuits and sportswear, calendar events of upcoming photo 
opportunities, articles, columns and advertisements for glamour shoots at the 
beach and local parks. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California is the mecca of photography," said Hank Koch, publisher of 
Western Photographer. "There is no other place in the world that I know of 
where there are so many model shoots -- especially with the quantity and 
quality that we have here." 
</P>
<P>
Photo days, which usually attract about 200 photographers and 50 to 100 models 
at local parks, are designed to give amateur photographers an opportunity to 
shoot models. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives them (the photographers) a chance to shoot different girls without 
paying a lot of money," said S.T. Bear, the magazine's editor. "It gives the 
girls a chance to get modeling experience and photographs for their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys get out there and enjoy the company of the other photographers. It's 
sort of a chance to meet the gang, instead of going to a bar. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way it might be considered a girlie magazine. The pictures are used to 
represent what happened at the photo shoots. We've had quite a few models who 
have gone to photo days and become successful. Raquel Welch went to a few photo 
days down here in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Bear believes the photographs are useful because subscribers can learn from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine is published in San Diego and printed on newsprint. Columnists 
include Rohn Engh, Lee R. Clark, Alice and Peter Gowland and Bear. Each issue 
includes a calendar of upcoming photo events and shoots. 
</P>
<P>
Koch started Western Photographer 30 years ago in San Diego with two friends 
from the Navy. He was finishing his tour of duty and wanted to start a magazine 
for servicemen who wanted to trade travel slides. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine has appeared in many formats, starting as a pocket-size, 
5-by-7-inch publication with just 25 pages, selling for 50 cents. Today it is 
produced in an 8-by-11-inch format with a circulation of 10,000. Subscribers 
now reach as far as England, New Zealand and Italy, with the majority in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Koch, 65, has seen a lot of changes in his years with the magazine -- and he'd 
like to see more. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot more subjects in the world than shooting girls," he said. "I'm 
not against it, no way. But we intend to enlarge our magazine both in different 
types of articles and approach. I'm not going to phase out photo days. My 
growth is in the areas of nature, table-top shooting and all types of 
photography. I want it to be more of a service to photographers."

<P>
In a field where people on camera grin a lot, he glared, and you just never 
forgot him. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Stout no longer here? Not around to face issues head on? To puncture 
balloons? To verbally decapitate the arrogant and supercilious? To speak out 
for the underdog? To define so incisively and eloquently the strengths and 
weaknesses of a community whose vastness and diversity seemed almost to defy 
definition? Not around to growl when he didn't like something, and also growl 
when he did? No longer present to punctuate his commentaries on KCBS-TV with 
sentences that were tiny pit bulls? 
</P>
<P>
Gone? Yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
Stout's face has been erased from television, but surely not his memory. 
</P>
<P>
The man was good, really good. When he died Friday, much of the very best of 
Los Angeles journalism died with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Stout was the kind of guy who couldn't have cared less about his obituary," 
said his close friend Pete Noyes. But he's going to get one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"He died as a commentator, but he made his reputation covering the news," said 
Noyes, the veteran managing editor at KNBC Channel 4 news. "He was as good a 
newsman as I've seen in this town. There are real television journalists in 
this world, and he was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Stout's death at 62 shrinks the club significantly, though. His continued 
presence on Channel 2 -- amid youthful colleagues whose average age has been 
ever diminishing as the station seeks to attract a younger audience -- seemed 
almost archival in a visual sense. He was so different from . . . them, Mt. 
Rushmore among statuettes. 
</P>
<P>
Well, look where he'd been, and what he'd done after getting early experience 
working for the Associated Press in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a superb newsman, an excellent writer and absolutely fearless, always 
digging up stories, and he had the best contacts in town," said Sam Zelman, who 
was Stout's boss as CBS News bureau chief in the 1950s and later news director 
at then KNXT (since renamed KCBS). "I don't think I've ever seen a reporter in 
the broadcast industry who could top him," said Zelman, a retired CNN 
executive, from his home in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Noyes, himself an old-fashioned journalist known for high standards, is just as 
complimentary about Stout. "When I was a very young reporter, I noticed there 
was this TV reporter who was beating everyone on stories," he recalled. "I mean 
he would walk right in on the chief of detectives, on anyone, and break 
stories. He reported the biggest stories, the blacklisting of Hollywood 
writers, the Watts riots, everything." 
</P>
<P>
When Stout anchored West Coast updates for CBS News in the 1960s, Noyes was 
occasionally his producer. And Noyes was Stout's colleague at KNXT, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He was totally irreverent in the newsroom," Stout said. "There was no news 
director who could scare him. And he had this great sense of humor that was 
beyond belief. I tell you he would just rip me apart. He was so articulate, so 
bright, so quick, that he had the ability to reduce a producer to a blithering 
idiot." 
</P>
<P>
"He was even irreverent of television as a news medium, even though it was his 
bread and butter," Zelman said. "He was always cranky with less than superior 
work and he worshiped the idea of having primary sources. He was almost an 
anachronism in an industry where the emphasis today is on brief content, jazzy 
stuff and good looks." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Stout knew that. The man whose trademark was skepticism had become 
increasingly skeptical about his own business in the 1980s, ever concerned that 
if TV news continued on its present path, its content would be eclipsed by form 
and entertainment values. 
</P>
<P>
Stout had his flaws, and a long history of heavy drinking and smoking had taken 
a toll. Zelman last saw him in October. "He talked slowly, walked hesitantly, 
but was articulate as hell," Zelman said. "He always had something important to 
say. He was no small-talk artist." 
</P>
<P>
But a different sort of artist. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Stout got a Hollywood star, an ironic award for a man whose 
career was the very antithesis of such cliches. He didn't need the star. He was 
Hollywood, and Los Angeles, and journalism.

POP MUSIC REVIEW: IGLESIAS SHEDS CASANOVA IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Julio Iglesias has a popular image as a sort of Latin George Hamilton, thanks 
in part to pop hits of a few years ago such as the regrettable "To All the 
Girls I've Loved Before," which is no longer part of his concert repertoire. To 
see him live these days is to see something different altogether: In the best 
moments of his show Thursday at the Pantages, Iglesias came off more in the 
Sinatra mold circa "Only the Lonely," more Mr. Solitude than Mr. Casanova, a 
quiet, intensely serious figure of studied isolation. Which only makes women 
love him more, of course. 
</P>
<P>
For an international romantic idol, his moves aren't all that smooth; they're 
so subtle you almost need a motion detector to pick them out. As he sings of 
broken love in relatively unbroken English as well as French and his native 
Spanish, his hand balls into a fist, then arches, and his arm goes out to his 
side, barely controlled, like Joe Cocker cast as a suave, jilted gigolo in 
black tie. The lyrics may have been unintelligible to English-only attendees, 
but the body language said: "Ouch." 
</P>
<P>
If his performing style is nicely understated these days, so is his backing 
band, which provides plenty of subtle Latin rhythms, dominated by synthesizer 
washes. This is in sharp contrast to the unsubtle Disco Julio of a few years 
back, whose unfortunate attempts at self-Americanization sold millions of 
records to new Anglo fans but turned off a lot of old Latin ones. Happily, 
there were few signs that this stop on his international tour was specifically 
tailored for the American audience he once seemed desperate to court. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for paying so much money tonight for the kids," Iglesias told the 
ethnically diverse, sold-out house, referring not to baby-sitters, but to the 
fact that half the proceeds from the show were earmarked to go through UNICEF 
to primary health care projects throughout Latin America. CHRIS WILLMAN

POP BEAT: REACTIONS MIXED OVER MCCARTNEY'S TALK OF BEATLES REUNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul, George and Ringo together again? 
</P>
<P>
Paul says he'd love to. 
</P>
<P>
George says no thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Ringo says no comment. 
</P>
<P>
If the three surviving members of rock's most celebrated group disagree over a 
possible reunion project, fans too seemed to have mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of some kind of Beatles reunion has come up frequently since the 
group dissolved two decades ago, but all four principals always rejected it. 
John Lennon's death in 1980 brought renewed calls for the surviving three to 
get together, but various legal and personal differences have kept them apart. 
</P>
<P>
But with the lawsuits all settled recently, McCartney said at a Monday press 
conference in Los Angeles that he would be interested in finally teaming up 
again with his ex-mates. And once again, the fans are intrigued. The general 
feeling: a mix of nostalgic elation, but doubts about whether the "magic" would 
still be there and whether it would be proper to proceed without Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
At Pepperland Records in Anaheim, a store that highlights Beatles music and 
memorabilia, the potential re-teaming has been a hot topic all week. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of talk," said store owner Mike Lefebvre. "In the concerts, Paul 
is coming across very warm and that makes a lot of customers come in here 
thinking he's a loving guy and would be happy to have the others on stage with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Pepperland's patrons were caught up in rumors that a reunion would take 
place at Wednesday's closing night of McCartney's five-concert engagement at 
the Forum. (It didn't, although both Ringo Starr and George Harrison were in 
town.) 
</P>
<P>
But Lefebvre and other Beatles enthusiasts seem torn about the prospect, 
generally agreeing with Harrison's terse response to McCartney's comments: "As 
far as I'm concerned," Harrison said in a statement Tuesday, "there will be no 
Beatles reunion so long as John Lennon remains dead." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lefebvre: "My opinion is they fear that if they got back together there 
wouldn't be the magic any more. They're probably right. They would put out good 
music, but not as good. We all have a, well, morbid curiosity, but there's a 
part of me that says, 'Why bother?' " 
</P>
<P>
Among fans surveyed in the Forum parking lot before and after Monday's 
McCartney concert, Mary Zekin's reaction was typical. The 14-year-old, who had 
come to Los Angeles from San Diego with her 19-year-old sister to see 
McCartney's concert at the Forum, was visibly elated, her eyes growing big in 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be the best thing in the world," she said in a burst of 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, Laura, concurred, stating that though Paul, George and Ringo 
couldn't be expected to recreate the old Beatles magic, "It would be a new kind 
of magic." 
</P>
<P>
But then, the initial adrenaline rush over, the Zekins nodded in agreement as 
George Emmel, a first-generation Beatles fan at 40, spoke with the dampening 
voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
"There would always be something missing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were anticipating something like that (comment by McCartney)," said Lonnie 
Pena, 31, who had traveled with two friends from Houston to see the show. "But 
there's no Lennon, so I'm not going to have high expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it became clear that even if Beatles fans aren't looking for a 
true reunion, they want something. 
</P>
<P>
"It would never be the Beatles again, even if John was alive," said Allen 
Weiner, a Potomac, Md.-based writer and author of the 1986 book, "The Beatles: 
A Recording History." 
</P>
<P>
But Weiner has some ideas for a second-best situation. 
</P>
<P>
"My first choice would be to get them back in the studio to do new things," 
Weiner said. "Paul and George writing together would be a neat idea. It would 
be a pressure-free situation, hopefully." 
</P>
<P>
A different fantasy is held by Pepperland's Mike Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't like to see any songwriting type of thing," Lefebvre said. "I'd 
like to see them get together with other musicians like at some benefit and not 
just be the three of them. If they did get together, I wouldn't want it to be a 
Monkees-type reunion." 
</P>
<P>
That attitude suits some in the Beatles camp just fine. Elliot Mintz, longtime 
confidant of Lennon and Yoko Ono's spokesman, suggested that McCartney's 
announcement may have been made to draw attention to the press conference, 
which was called to announce a tour sponsorship deal with Visa. 
</P>
<P>
"If Ringo or George elected to take him up on the invitation, that's 
wonderful," said Mintz, producer and host of the ongoing "Lost Lennon Tapes" 
radio series, heard here Wednesdays at 11 p.m. on KLSX-FM. "But to me the whole 
thing seemed a little hollow. I think perhaps the invitation was extended a 
little too late." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking as a fan, Mintz was dubious about the aesthetic prospects of any kind 
of reunion. "The Beatles represented more than a musical group," he said. "They 
represent a time in history, a time in our development as a culture and a 
generation. It seems unlikely that those experiences and sensibilities can ever 
be reclaimed, and I think that any effort to do so might somehow rob us of the 
experience we once shared and revere."

RE-CREATING CHRISTMASES OF THE PAST; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAYS: MANY HISTORIC RANCHOS AND MANSIONS WILL FEATURE DECORATIONS AND 
TRADITIONS IN COMING WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARILYN OLIVER, Oliver is a frequent contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of sharing, woven throughout our holiday customs, was evident in the 
Southland even a century or more ago. Today, many ranchos and historic mansions 
re-create this spirit of giving at Christmastime in festivities open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The vast open fields surrounding them are long gone, victims to housing tracts 
and shopping malls. But many of the stately homes belonging to the Southland's 
early families still stand, decked out for the holiday season in motifs 
diligently researched from written and oral history. 
</P>
<P>
For Pamela Young, curator at Rancho Los Alamitos in Long Beach, the weeks 
before the annual holiday open house at the historical rancho are hectic. The 
house must be decorated with fresh greens, flowers, and fruit. Following the 
tradition of the Bixby family, who lived on the rancho, a 16-foot tree must be 
cut down to fit the 10-foot-high ceiling in the living room, because they liked 
the bushy effect of the full branches. 
</P>
<P>
Actors and other volunteers from the Long Beach area are recruited to play 
Bixby family members and friends who might have attended Christmas Eve 
festivities there in 1923. Hundreds of cookies must be ordered, and gallons of 
mulled cranberry punch must be brewed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to re-create the feeling of hospitality that existed on the 
ranch," Young says. "There was a tradition of a Christmas Eve party for ranch 
employees, family and friends. I hope the visitors will leave this year's open 
house with a feeling of having had a warm, happy experience and several years 
from now will remember the event with nostalgia." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Los Alamitos, "Company for Christmas," 6400 Bixby Hill Road, Long Beach, 
(213) 431-3541. Open house Wednesday through Friday, 6-8:30 p.m.; also Dec. 10, 
noon-4 p.m. Reservations are a must. 
</P>
<P>
At the Newland House in Huntington Beach, docent training chairman Marsha 
Johnston said: "We want our guests to feel the warmth of Christmas as it would 
have been celebrated by a pioneer family at the turn of the century. Mrs. 
Newland used to can the produce of the 500-acre ranch and make relishes and 
preserves. She and her daughters would pack baskets to take to neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, people socialized and sang carols. "We want to show 
how a small community worked together in the past," says Jo Anne 
Viserta-Galinis, keeper of the country store at Newland House. 
</P>
<P>
This Christmas, the Newland House will be decorated with antique and replica 
dolls and toys. Greens will festoon the pictures in the dining room and parlor. 
The table will be set with the original Newland family's red and white 
ironstone china. 
</P>
<P>
"We cheat a little," Viserta-Galinis says. "We aren't sure that the Newlands 
had a Christmas tree, but we know people now want to see a tree, so we'll have 
one in the parlor." 
</P>
<P>
 Newland House, 19820 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach, (714) 962-4112. Dec. 15, 
costumed docents interpret the history of the city's oldest residence at a 
special open house, 7:30-9 p.m. $2 donation. The 1898 farm home will be 
decorated for Christmas from Wednesday on. Open Wednesday-Thursday 2-4:30; open 
Saturday-Sunday noon-4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At the Workman-Temple Family Homestead in the City of Industry, authenticity is 
the objective of the holiday decor. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pass through the gates of La Casa Nueva, you enter the 1920s, circa 
1928," says Max van Balgooy, director of education and public affairs for the 
Homestead Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Both indoors and outdoors, the Spanish-colonial revival mansion will be 
decorated to portray a party in progress -- a tea honoring guests from Chicago 
visiting the Temple family for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
In the living room, the ceiling-high tree will be trimmed with crepe paper, 
blown glass and homemade ornaments fashioned from light bulbs painted black and 
coated with glitter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fantasy look popular in the late 1920s," says van Balgooy. "We 
learned how to make the ornaments from an old copy of Popular Mechanics. 
Visitors may be surprised to see garlands of artificial greens. In the late 
'20s there was a conservation movement that tried to keep people from denuding 
the local hillsides of greenery." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will sip tea laced with flavorings popular in the '20s -- candied 
ginger, rum balls, gum drops and loaf sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Van Balgooy is looking forward to portraying a character, Bob Lambert, at the 
tea. 
</P>
<P>
"Researching and creating the character has made me study the period," he says. 
"I'm going to try to incorporate typical sayings such as 'Jeepers.' I'm not an 
actor, but it's fun to step back in time and become someone else. I like Bob." 
</P>
<P>
Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum, 15415 E. Don Julian Road, City of 
Industry, (818) 968-8492. "Mistletoe and Holly-Berries Christmas Tea" Dec. 10, 
1-6 p.m. A 1928 afternoon tea. Free, but advance reservations required. Holiday 
tours Tuesday-Friday, 1-4 p.m. and Saturday-Sunday, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. between next 
Saturday and Jan. 7. Reservations suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Living history is also a part of the festivities at the Los Cerritos Adobe in 
Long Beach, originally part of a large sheep ranch that belonged to another 
branch of the Bixby family. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aiming toward an entertaining and educational look at Victorian times 
on an isolated ranch," says Steve Iverson, curator. "We want to re-create 
Christmas 1878, because from our research we know that 1878 was the first time 
in many years Mrs. Bixby was able to celebrate the holiday with all of her 
sisters and her father." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the annual open house will be greeted by the blacksmith and the 
ranch foreman, who are busy repairing the wagon, which, according to family 
records, broke down while bringing the Christmas tree to the ranch in 1878. 
</P>
<P>
From the blacksmith's workshop, visitors will troop to the dining room where 
they will see costumed actors packing gifts for the Basque and Mexican 
sheepherders who must spend Christmas Day in the fields. The room is decorated 
with greenery, wreaths and a kissing ball over the table. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will nibble on lumberjacks (a New England molasses cookie) and Boston 
cookies (a type of sugar cookie), both washed down with spiced hot cider. 
</P>
<P>
"We want visitors to Los Cerritos adobe to go away with the idea that our 
values today are similar to those of a century ago," says Ellen Calomiris, 
director. "People still celebrate the holiday with family and friends. They 
think of others in need and want to do something for them." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Los Cerritos, 4600 Virginia Road, Long Beach, (213) 424-9423. "Deck the 
Halls for an 1870's Christmas," Friday and next Saturday, 6:30-8:30 p.m.; 
reservations required. Immediately before the two open houses, the ranch will 
offer its traditional free pinata party for young children 6-6:30 p.m. The 
adobe will close for that half-hour. No reservation required for Dec. 10 open 
house 1-4 p.m. Donation $2; children 5 and younger free. 
</P>
<P>
According to some scholars, the traditions of Yankee settlers in early 
California replaced the customs of the Mexican and Spanish colonial period. 
Richard Senate, site manager of Olivas adobe in Ventura, says: "Prior to 1900, 
Hispanic customs were considered old-fashioned and undesirable." 
</P>
<P>
"In the early 1920s, there was a romanticization of the Hispanic culture of 
early California," says Dr. Michael Heisley, curator of folklore at Southwest 
Museum. "There was a revival of Spanish-colonial architecture. Elements of 
authenticity and imagination combined to make a fantasy heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Senate says the Olivas adobe aims for authenticity in the annual re-enactment 
of Las Posadas, a procession commemorating the journey of Joseph and Mary 
through Bethlehem in search of lodging. 
</P>
<P>
"People have told us that our posadas resemble what they have seen in Mexico 
and Latin America," Senate says. "We try to keep them as traditional as 
possible. The candlelight procession resembles an opera. All the words are sung 
in Spanish. Some people have complained about the darkness, but I feel that the 
candlelight gives visitors a feeling of the rural environment and adds to the 
mystical quality of the evening. We want people to know that there's more than 
one way to celebrate Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Senate says that early in the 19th Century, an adobe rancho home would be 
decorated with a nacimiento, small statues portraying the Nativity scene. 
Christmas celebrations would begin with the saint's day of the Virgin of 
Guadalupe, Dec. 18. The posadas would begin nine days before Christmas. Gifts 
would be given to the children on Jan. 6 (Twelfth Night). 
</P>
<P>
Olivas Adobe, 4200 Olivas Park Drive, Ventura, (805) 644-4346. Las Posadas Dec. 
16, 7-9 p.m. Actors will dress in 19th-Century Mexican attire. Visitors are 
encouraged to dress in ponchos or typical attire. Traditional refreshments 
served. A shuttle bus will transport visitors from Olivas Park Golf Course to 
the house. Event will be canceled if it rains. Free. 
</P>
<P>
Every year since 1968, George and Vivian Obern have been hosts for an open 
house at the Hope mansion in Santa Barbara. It was built in 1878 as the center 
of Hope Ranch, a 4,000-acre sheep ranch. In 1967, the Oberns bought the house, 
then in a state of disrepair, as a 25th wedding anniversary gift to one 
another. Although they have never lived in the house, they have restored it to 
its original Victorian splendor. 
</P>
<P>
"We started the open house as a Christmas present to our neighborhood," Vivian 
Obern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope House, 399 Nogal Drive, Santa Barbara, off Hollister Avenue at the end of 
State Street, (805) 682-3175 . Open house Dec. 10, 1-4 p.m. Free.

The Sandinista government refused to allow a four-member U.S. congressional 
delegation to observe national election campaign activities because of 
Washington's financial aid to an opposition candidate. Foreign Minister Miguel 
D'Escoto said the Nicaragua has invited observers from the United Nations, the 
Organization of American States and other international agencies, including 
former President Jimmy Carter, to witness activities leading up to the Feb. 25 
elections. Congress and the Bush Administration have approved $9 million in 
contributions to opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro.

Prosecutors in Springfield, Mass., said they will not retry three alleged 
revolutionaries charged with trying to overthrow the government, ending one of 
the longest and costliest criminal cases in U.S. history. A mistrial had been 
declared after a jury cleared the three of charges they tried to overthrow the 
government by force. It deadlocked on whether alleged bombing exploits 
constituted racketeering. Defendants Raymond Levasseur and Richard Williams are 
serving 45-year sentences for some of the bombings. Levasseur's wife, Patricia 
Levasseur, served 3 1/2 years for harboring a fugitive, her husband.

NASA's tumbling Solar Max satellite plunged toward a fiery doom over the 
Pacific west of Ecuador. NASA officials in Cape Canaveral, Fla., said any 
debris that survived this morning's re-entry likely would fall harmlessly in 
the Atlantic. The Solar Maximum Mission satellite was launched in 1980 to study 
the sun. It was repaired by a shuttle mission in 1984, but its orbit has been 
"decaying" -- growing lower -- dooming it to burning up in friction from 
Earth's atmosphere.

FLY FIGHT AVOIDS THE OLD TRAPS; 
</P>
<P>
THE WAR OF THE MEDFLY HAS NEW RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. THIS TIME IT'S SPRAY FIRST, 
DEBATE LATER -- AND NEVER TRUST A STERILE ALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On June 8, 1980, a tiny fly was trapped in San Jose. The insect was sent by 
third class mail to a Sacramento laboratory for identification, and 10 days 
later it was found to be a Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
A full year passed before Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. ordered aerial spraying of 
pesticides to attack what by then had spread into a huge infestation -- a delay 
that cost California's farm industry $100 million and significantly crippled 
Brown's political career. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 6 of this year, a tiny fly was trapped near Dodger Stadium. It was 
rushed aboard the first available plane to Sacramento, where experts quickly 
identified the winged insect as a Medfly. Five days later, helicopters were 
dropping malathion over a section of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As the difference in response time indicates, the infamous infestation of 1981 
has provided agricultural officials and politicians with a host of hard-earned 
lessons about how to fight the Medfly, lessons that now are being applied in 
earnest to combat an expanding infestation in the Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Today, unlike 1981, they spray first and debate later. They set more traps in 
order to detect pockets of infestation more quickly, and they no longer expect 
winter's cold to provide an easy means of eradication. They mass-produce 
sterile flies which, released by the millions, are designed to breed the 
destructive fertile flies out of existence. And this time "they" refers mainly 
to scientists and bureaucrats -- politicians have learned from Brown that the 
Medfly is a formidable opponent best left for the experts to battle. 
</P>
<P>
"We will win the fight against the Medfly in Los Angeles," predicted Rex Magee, 
assistant director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture. "This time 
it is easier. We are able to do what we need to do right away." 
</P>
<P>
Though in many instances the combatants have benefited from 1981, the wily 
Medfly nonetheless has managed to frustrate them anew. The fly has spread from 
Whittier north to the San Fernando Valley and south into Orange County, and 
eradication is nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a highly unusual and highly unexpected infestation," said Bill Edwards, 
Los Angeles County's chief deputy agricultural commissioner, "and we don't have 
any good scientific or biological reason why the pest has spread the way it has 
or why it continues to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"One change that we might see come out of this is we might be suggesting two 
aerial treatments instead of one," said Edwards, a veteran of the county's six 
previous Medfly battles dating back to 1975. "If we had used that in the 
Whittier area, we might not have the problem we are having now." 
</P>
<P>
The corps of combatants in the current infestation includes many veterans of 
the 1981 effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who started the Medfly experience in 1981 as corporals are now 
master sergeants," said Jerry Scribner, Medfly project director in 1981. 
Scribner himself, a Sacramento lawyer, is sitting this one out. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign against the tiny, yellow-bellied insect is expected to take a 
pivotal turn next week, after a team of scientists and government officials 
meet to evaluate the successes and failures of eradication efforts thus far and 
map out new strategies for the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions made inside the squat, stucco office building of the Los Angeles 
County agricultural commissioner are of great significance to California's most 
important economic entity -- the $16-billion-a-year agricultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
If even a single fertile Medfly crosses the Tehachapi Mountains that separate 
urban Los Angeles from the San Joaquin Valley "all hell will break loose," said 
Mike Durando, executive director of the California Tree Fruit League, which 
represents farmers and shippers of 95% of the state's deciduous fruit products. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely concerned now," Durando said, "but we are confident that the 
state will do everything it can to eradicate the Medfly." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, officials have bolstered markedly the authority and make-up of the 
state's Medfly advisory panel, a move that has allowed for quicker 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1981 infestation, 15 "technical advisers" -- including growers, 
environmentalists and federal officials with diverse interests -- often gave 
conflicting and confusing advice to state leaders. Now, a streamlined group of 
five nationally recognized fruit fly experts guide the actions of state and 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We do whatever they tell us," Magee said. 
</P>
<P>
The dean of Medfly experts is U.S. Department of Agriculture entomologist Roy 
Cunningham. The Hawaii-based scientist served on the panel in 1981 and now is 
its unofficial leader. He said that the Medfly continues to surprise him. For 
for example, he said, the current infestation has again rewritten the book on 
how to breed Medflies out of existence with sterile mates and how to chart the 
outbreak's spread with trapping. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, officials have improved a number of their procedures for using 
sterile flies, including stepped up "quality controls" to ensure sterility. In 
1981, officials blamed the failure to completely eradicate the pest on a batch 
of supposedly sterile Medflies brought from Peru that later were suspected to 
have been fertile. 
</P>
<P>
In the last eight years, California has built its own sterile fly rearing 
factory in Hawaii, where the Medfly is endemic. But the facility, despite 
stepping up production to 130 million flies a week, has not been able to 
produce enough to be useful in fighting the current infestation. And officials 
now are seeking additional sterile flies from Mexico. In 1987 and 1988, 
officials succeeded in wiping out small Medfly infestations in the Los Angeles 
Basin by spraying one night with the pesticide malathion and then releasing 
millions of sterile flies. This tactic has not worked in the current outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
"We developed a great deal of success until this present program of doing a 
single malathion treatment and following it immediately with steriles," said 
Reg Rosander, a U.S. Department of Agriculture official who also was involved 
in the 1981 Medfly battle. "We were hopeful that would continue with this 
program, but for reasons unknown to us at the present time, that doesn't seem 
to be working." 
</P>
<P>
Added Richard Rice, a UC Davis entomologist and member of the scientific 
advisory panel: "One thing we may be seeing is that steriles have a place with 
small, clearly defined infestations, but in extremely large geographic areas 
they perhaps are just not adequate." 
</P>
<P>
Trapping practices also have proven to be inadequate again. A major problem in 
the 1981 infestation, officials acknowledged afterward, was that setting one 
trap for each square mile had not been enough to detect quickly the appearance 
of the pest in a new neighborhood. As a result, five traps are now set for each 
square mile in cities. 
</P>
<P>
But even that is not enough, officials have learned. Three weeks ago, 
scientists called for a doubling of trapping to 10 per square mile in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had had the 10 up early on, maybe we would have had a good chance of 
stopping the infestation in Whittier," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
That still is not enough, in the view of some experts. Several scientists said 
that next week they will push for 25 per square mile because of the severity of 
the Los Angeles infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Another byproduct of 1981 is that the cardboard traps set in trees are now 
checked year-round. In the 1981 infestation, scientists mistakenly believed 
that the fly would not survive the brisk Northern California winters. What they 
did not know was that millions of tiny Medfly pupae nestled in hibernation 
beneath warm soil over the winter. In spring of 1981, the infestation exploded 
as the baby flies popped out from the earth and there were not enough traps to 
detect them. 
</P>
<P>
According to "An Analysis of the Mediterranean Fruit Fly Eradication Program in 
California, 1980-1982" by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the 1981 outbreak 
was worsened by this "scientific misjudgment." 
</P>
<P>
Medflies thrive in temperatures in the high 70s to mid-80s. As weather cools 
their breeding cycles simply slow down. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that we can go two or four months without much activity, but we 
know the problem is still out there," said James Carey, a UC Davis entomologist 
and advisory panel member. 
</P>
<P>
Some lessons of 1981 seem to have been forgotten. For instance, officials have 
blamed the Southern California infestation on people who illegally smuggle 
infected fruit into the country and outside quarantine zones. 
</P>
<P>
During the current outbreak, grocery stores in infested neighborhoods have 
passed out state-produced "Don't Spread Med" flyers to shoppers. Flyers also 
have been distributed to 24,748 homes around the larvae finds in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Until now there have been none of the billboards, radio and TV commercials and 
bumper stickers that were employed widely after the 1981 infestation. The 
campaign fell victim to budget cuts in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the biggest weaknesses is that people are not well-informed on 
how this fly is being spread," said state Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-San Bernardino), 
who chairs the Senate Agriculture and Water Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Gera Curry, spokeswoman for the state Agricultural Department, disagrees: "It 
is not a matter of the amount of publicity, it's a matter of people paying 
attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
The current infestation, though the Southland's worst, so far has required less 
spraying than the 1981 outbreak. Then, 1,496 square miles spanning eight 
counties -- mostly in Northern California -- received as many as 20 weekly 
doses of aerial pesticide spray. Currently, 232 square miles of Los Angeles and 
Orange counties have been targeted for one or two doses of pesticide spray. 
</P>
<P>
The speed with which spraying is ordered represents the most extreme tactical 
difference between today and 1981. Aerial spraying "is happening more quickly, 
almost before people have a chance to get organized in opposition," said 
Scribner. 
</P>
<P>
Although signs of political and citizen discontent over aerial spraying are 
beginning to surface in Los Angeles County, the outcry is a whisper compared to 
the howl of protests in 1981 from local officials in Santa Clara County. Brown, 
facing opposition to aerial spraying from environmentalists and residents, 
called out the National Guard and a legion of state workers to attempt an 
alternative approach of fruit stripping, ground spraying and release of sterile 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
Just when officials thought they had succeeded, the small infestation in Santa 
Clara County exploded into a statewide outbreak. Finally, Brown ordered aerial 
spraying, saying he was forced to do so under the threat of a federal 
quarantine of California produce. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Scribner said, farmers felt that the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture under Brown "was in the hands of the enemy, that it was run by 
environmentalists. . . . Now, they feel the department is run by people 
sympathetic to their concern." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the present director, Henry Voss, is a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
During the current outbreak, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors -- 
whose conservative Republican majority is allied with Deukmejian -- has 
maintained a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Montebello) conducted a public hearing this 
week on the health effects of malathion, but only 20 people showed up, most of 
them government bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Brown, Deukmejian has steered clear of personal involvement in the 
Medfly battle, leaving the decision to the experts. In doing so, he has heeded 
the advice that Scribner gave in 1982: "We would have been much better off if 
the eradication project had been left to the scientists." 
</P>
<P>
But that is not to say the governor is not paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
"History is not going to repeat itself," said Deukmejian spokesman Kevin Brett. 
"The governor certainly remembers what happened to the prior Administration 
when they did not pull out all the stops, when they hesitated. People remember 
what happened in 1981 and we certainly will not see that sorry chapter 
repeated."

POST OFFICE DEVELOPS PLAN TO SLOW MAIL -- ON PURPOSE 
</P>

The U.S. Postal Service is developing a controversial plan to provide slower 
delivery of first-class mail. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that its customers prefer consistency over speed, the Postal Service 
wants to shrink the geographic zones in which it provides overnight delivery of 
first-class mail. More mail would be aimed for two-day and three-day delivery 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, a letter dropped in a mailbox in downtown Los Angeles 
before 5 p.m. will be delivered the next day to locations as far away as San 
Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Barbara, Oxnard and Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The new zones might increase the delivery time to two days for letters from 
downtown Los Angeles to San Diego and to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
As much as 20% to 30% of the nation's first-class mail could be shifted into 
slower delivery schedules, according to Postal Service officials. In exchange, 
they promise that the reliability of delivery would be improved. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed change already has drawn criticism, however. The consumer advocate 
for the independent Postal Rate Commission said the proposal would "degrade 
first-class mail service," and he has invited state officials to intervene in 
hearings next week on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"You might also wish to inform your congressman of your comments," the 
commission's consumer advocate, Stephen A. Gold, said in a letter to the 
consumer protection offices of all 50 states. A copy of his letter was made 
available to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Gold said Friday he had taken the unprecedented step of inviting each state to 
become involved in the issue to ensure that the proposal was fully aired before 
being adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think this case was getting the notice it should have gotten," he 
said. "We felt that unless there is grass-roots involvement, this thing would 
just sail through. Maybe it should sail through, but we want to be sure people 
are going in with their eyes wide open." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Consumer Protection Board has asked to intervene in the case. "We 
believe that postal service customers oppose any additional delay in the 
delivery of first-class mail," the board said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hearings, the Postal Rate Commission has only an advisory role on 
this issue. Final decisions on delivery schedules are up to Postal Service 
management. The Postal Service can simply ignore any finding by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Postal Service officials have been discussing the new delivery zones with 
customers since October. They expect to announce the new delivery zones next 
year, with the changes to be phased in between February and September. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, overnight delivery zones would be redrawn along metropolitan lines 
and would conform to local business marketing patterns. 
</P>
<P>
For example, "a store in San Diego would not consider Los Angeles part of its 
local trading area," said Greg Whiteman, director of the Postal Service office 
of market research and systems management. Mail between the two areas, which 
now moves overnight, might be put into the two-day delivery category. 
</P>
<P>
The new zone plans will be drawn by Southern California division managers and 
their colleagues among the nation's 73 postal divisions, Whiteman emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
"We're meeting with our customers, banks, insurance companies, cruise lines, 
telephone companies, and other major mailers to find out what they desire," 
said David Mazer, communications manager for the Los Angeles division. "Then we 
will sit down with our counterparts in the rest of the basin and see what is 
best for all our customers." 
</P>
<P>
In return for slower service for some mail, the Postal Service would promise a 
higher rate of accurate deliveries. The current target calls for delivering 95% 
of the mail on time. The ratio of success is high in overnight zones -- about 
95 of every 100 letters deposited in a mailbox before 5 p.m. currently are 
delivered the next day. 
</P>
<P>
But in a two-day zone, such as the region extending from Los Angeles to the 
Mississippi River, only 88% to 90% of the letters are delivered on time. The 
same performance applies to the three-day delivery, which covers letters 
between any two locations in the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to provide the level of consistency the market needs," Whiteman said. 
</P>
<P>
An 88% success ratio "is not good enough," he said. "We need to get the level 
of performance up to the high 90s." 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service plan is generating growing opposition among business groups. 
</P>
<P>
The American Bankers Assn. and its postal service committee "have mobilized 
into action to fight this plan and need the help of bankers everywhere," the 
association said in its weekly newspaper to bankers. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Postal Service also is seeking higher rates in 1991, the ABA 
said "the end result may well be that banks will pay more for less service." 
Gas and electric utility companies "could lose overnight service in some 
important areas," the Council of Public Utility Mailers, a trade group, said in 
a filing with the Postal Rate Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials were miffed at the efforts by Gold, the rate commission 
consumer advocate, to involve state officials in the issue. They initially 
suggested that he might be violating a federal law by allegedly using public 
funds to lobby Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an absurd way of trying to embarrass me, and had nothing to do with the 
issue of delivery standards," Gold said. The Postal Service acknowledged in its 
most recent filing with the rate commission that no one had ever been 
prosecuted under the law.

U.S. MOVE TO BACK AQUINO COULD PROVE COSTLY LATER 
</P>

<P>
Over the long run, the Bush Administration's military intervention on behalf of 
President Corazon Aquino could, ironically, mark the beginning of the end of 
America's 91-year involvement in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the U.S. military move in Manila could help preserve the Aquino 
government and, with it, two strategic American military facilities, Clark Air 
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. But the American military action also could 
accelerate forces, both in the Philippines and in Washington, leading to a 
reduction or pullout of U.S. forces over the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's need for U.S. Air Force warplanes to suppress a military revolt serves 
as the most graphic reminder yet of the dependent relationship between the 
Philippine government and the United States. Like the regime of Ferdinand E. 
Marcos in its final years, the Aquino government has demonstrated that it 
cannot survive without American backing. 
</P>
<P>
It has been that way ever since May 1, 1898, when Commodore George Dewey and 
his fleet sailed into Manila Bay, sank a Spanish armada and seized America's 
first overseas territory. As author Stanley Karnow recounted in his book, "In 
Our Image," President William McKinley later explained that God had told him to 
annex the Philippines and "do the best we could for them." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a number of nationalist leaders in the Philippines have spoken 
of the importance of breaking the pattern of dependency on the United States. 
"We must slay the father image," declared Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus. The 
American military intervention is likely to intensify these nationalist 
sentiments among Filipino politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, foreign-policy strategists have been warning that in 
the future, the United States should reduce its reliance on overseas bases such 
as those at Clark and Subic Bay, America's two largest overseas military 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not ordinarily be dependent on bases in defending our interests in 
the Third World," concluded the Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy, a 
private blue-ribbon panel that included former national security advisers Henry 
A. Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and William P. Clark, in a report two years 
ago. "We have found it increasingly difficult, and politically costly, to 
maintain bases there." 
</P>
<P>
This week's coup attempt in Manila indicates that even now, despite all the 
U.S. efforts and money, the situation in the Philippines is, if anything, more 
politically fragile and unstable than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Only three weeks ago, on the eve of a visit by Aquino to the White House, a 
Bush Administration official was asked whether her government had managed to 
improve the situation in the Philippine armed forces since an unsuccessful coup 
attempt in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, the state of civil-military relations (in the Philippines) has 
improved markedly," declared the senior official. "I think morale within the 
armed forces, discipline, the sorts of things that are important for an 
effective force, are much greater now than they were, say, two or three years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
The events of recent days show that the Bush Administration has been far too 
optimistic. And quiet U.S. efforts over the past few years to find alternatives 
to the bases in the Philippines are likely to take on special urgency now. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. lease for its bases in the Philippines -- including not only Clark and 
Subic Bay but four smaller military facilities -- expires in September, 1991. 
Discussions between the two governments about the future of the bases are 
scheduled to resume in Manila later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The next presidential elections in the Philippines will be in 1992, and Aquino 
recently told The Times in an interview that she will not run for reelection. 
"I feel I have already done my duty insofar as being a citizen of this republic 
is concerned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine voters already have elected a Senate dominated by members opposed to 
continuation of the U.S. bases. And the future of the relationship between the 
Philippines and the United States will inevitably be one of the principal 
issues in the next presidential election there. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, even middle-of-the-road Philippine politicians and military 
leaders have begun to call for a gradual elimination of the U.S. military 
presence during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos, one of the staunchest supporters of the 
United States among Philippine leaders, said early this year there should be a 
"phase-out" of the U.S. bases by 1998, the 100th anniversary of Dewey's sail 
into Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, last July, Vice President Salvador Laurel called for "at most, a 
10-year phase-out of the bases." In other words, the question among Philippine 
politicians seems to be shifting from whether the Americans should leave the 
bases to how soon. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Washington officials have begun to take seriously the 
possibility that the United States could be forced to give up its bases in the 
Philippines, which are considered perhaps the most important American military 
facilities outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems is money. Last year, the United States concluded an 
agreement with the Philippines under which it is paying $481 million a year in 
aid for the bases until the current lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United States has promised to contribute $200 million a year 
in economic aid to the Philippines as part of a multinational aid initiative 
aimed at buttressing the Philippine economy. But Congress has balked at 
contributing the money, and it is doubtful the United States will be able in 
the long run to keep increasing its payments to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"In the current budget environment, it's not clear that the United States is 
going to fight as hard as it might have done to preserve bases if the Filipinos 
don't want them," Dov Zakheim, a former Ronald Reagan Administration defense 
official, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Pentagon planners have studied the possibility of 
relocating the American facilities to U.S. possessions in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"If you move back to Guam, Tinian or Saipan, you could carry out a lot of the 
functions of Clark (Air Base) with relative ease," observed one senior Defense 
Department official. "The problem is replacing the ship-repair facilities at 
Subic Bay." 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. defense strategists hope that eventually new, high-technology 
solutions will make bases like Clark and Subic Bay less important than they are 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Hudson Institute, a conservative-oriented think tank, said the 
development of hypersonic aerospace planes, which could travel halfway around 
the world in a few hours without refueling, would reduce the need for overseas 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
The Hudson Institute report concluded that "the fruits of these technologies 
will probably not be available for at least a decade." That prediction matches 
the timetable of the Philippine leaders who are calling for a gradual phase-out 
of the American military presence during the 1990s.

BUSH VOWS TO MAINTAIN U.S. AID TO AQUINO

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, responding to the crisis in the Philippines on Friday even as 
he moved toward his first summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, vowed to continue American aid to the embattled government of 
President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly support Mrs. Aquino and she knows it," Bush said, as U.S. officials 
expressed "cautious optimism" that the Philippine leader had survived the most 
serious assault thus far on her government by restive military officers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking to reporters shortly after arriving here, said his decision to 
provide U.S. air cover for troops loyal to Aquino was justified by the need to 
defend a democratically elected government. "We're doing what has been 
requested of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White House aides later added that protection of American lives was another 
major factor in the decision. They noted the presence of 106,000 U.S. citizens 
in the Manila region alone, with thousands more in other parts of the country, 
many of them U.S. armed forces and civilian personnel attached to the huge 
American air and naval bases in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Bush arrived in Malta, where he and Gorbachev will hold two days of summit 
meetings, looking drawn, clearly tired after a nine-hour transatlantic flight 
during which he was awakened at least twice to deal with developments in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
After landing, he traveled to the 16th-Century Knights of Malta castle for a 
ceremonial greeting from Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami. Even there, Bush 
was interrupted by aides briefing him on Philippine developments. 
</P>
<P>
The unfolding crisis not only disrupted the President's pre-summit schedule but 
also posed a special challenge for an Administration stung earlier this fall by 
criticism of its seemingly disorganized response to the abortive coup attempt 
in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Administration's foreign policy crisis management structure has 
been reworked -- "fine-tuned," in the words of White House spokesman Roman 
Popadiuk. As a result, he said, even though Bush and Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III were on Air Force One en route here and Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney had just returned to Washington from NATO meetings in Europe, this time, 
"the process worked extremely well under very difficult circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, despite the apparent success, Administration officials were 
clearly discomfited by the degree to which the Philippine fighting overshadowed 
Bush's arrival here, which was already in danger of being eclipsed by 
Gorbachev's dramatic meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Until officials grew confident that Aquino's side had begun to prevail, White 
House press officials here referred inquiries about the crisis to Washington in 
an apparent attempt to distance Bush from the story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crisis Management 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, as news from the Philippines improved, White House officials 
began releasing details of how the Administration was handling the crisis. But 
they also took pains to detail Bush's final briefings on the Gorbachev 
meetings, insisting to reporters that despite the distractions of a distant 
war, the President was fully prepared for today's negotiations aboard the 
Soviet cruiser Slava. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's handling of the Philippine uprising contrasted sharply 
with its actions during the Panama coup attempt. During that affair, when the 
United States provided limited and seemingly ineffectual backing to Panamanian 
officers seeking to overthrow strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, key information 
about events failed to reach Bush and his senior advisers in an organized and 
timely manner, a top-level Administration review later concluded. 
</P>
<P>
And although Administration officials insist that better information would not 
have changed their decisions, nor the outcome of events in Panama, they decided 
in the wake of the coup's failure to restructure the information process. 
</P>
<P>
The chief reform was to strengthen the role of a panel known as a "deputies 
committee," made up of the senior aide to each of the President's top national 
security advisers and chaired by Deputy National Security Adviser Robert M. 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
That panel is now supposed to serve as a crisis management team, collecting 
information, analyzing options and preparing recommendations for Bush, Baker, 
Cheney and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. 
</P>
<P>
Through Thursday night and on into Friday morning, that panel met to arrange 
support for Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis began to unfold at an awkward time for Bush: Washington was notified 
of the details of the developing coup at roughly 5:30 p.m. Thursday, barely 
more than an hour before the President's scheduled departure for the 
Mediterranean. Over the next seven hours, officials met repeatedly to analyze 
the situation and prepare options for Bush, who ultimately approved the 
decision to deploy the Air Force at about 12:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to a chronology of Administration actions provided by senior 
Administration officials, the crisis management team first met at the White 
House at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, as Bush's helicopter was lifting off from the 
White House lawn en route to Andrews Air Force Base. At the same time, Gen. 
Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, convened his top aides 
at the Pentagon's National Military Command Center to begin analyzing military 
options. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' group met for three hours, keeping in touch with Air Force One by 
telephone. But then, with no word from the Philippines and no request from 
Aquino for help, the committee went into recess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call to Aquino 
</P>
<P>
At just that moment, however, Aquino and Philippine Defense Secretary Fidel V. 
Ramos were contacting U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt in Manila, asking for U.S. 
air support to immobilize mutinous elements of the Philippine air force at two 
bases outside the capital. Gates, an official said, received word of Platt's 
request just as he arrived home shortly after 10 p.m. and hurriedly returned to 
the White House. He was quickly joined by other senior officials. 
</P>
<P>
By 11 p.m. Gates' team had reconvened and updated Bush on Aquino's request. At 
11:30 p.m., Vice President Dan Quayle, joined by Deputy Secretary of State 
Laurence S. Eagleburger, CIA chief William H. Webster, Gates and Deputy White 
House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, convened a senior-level meeting in the White 
House Situation Room and, after a 45-minute discussion, recommended to Bush 
that the request be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle then called Aquino, reaching her at about 1:30 a.m. Washington time. At 
the same time, the vice president called three congressional leaders, House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Maine) and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) to inform them of 
Bush's decision. Pentagon and State Department officials also briefed members 
of the House and Senate Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees, 
Administration spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite congressional concern in the past about being informed of military 
options before any final decision is made, White House spokesman Popadiuk 
insisted that this after-the-fact notification had satisfied both the Congress 
and all legal requirements for U.S. military action. 
</P>
<P>
"The President, as commander in chief, has a constitutional right to act to 
protect American lives," he said.

MALTA: THE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are some of the issues likely to be discussed by President Bush and 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when they meet on warships in Marsaxlokk 
Bay: 
</P>
<P>
 EASTERN EUROPE: The political upheaval in the Soviet-led East Bloc as Poland, 
Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia move to lift the "Iron Curtain" and 
introduce democratic reforms. Bush is anxious to encourage the democratic 
transformation of the Communist states but does not want to be seen as 
undercutting Gorbachev's stature as the catalyst of change. Gorbachev seized 
the initiative a day before flying to Malta by proposing an all-European summit 
to discuss events in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
GERMAN REUNIFICATION: The opening of the Berlin Wall revived calls from West 
Germany for the two German states to be reunited, causing nervousness in some 
European capitals that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance could be 
jeopardized. The Soviet Union has made clear that reunification is unacceptable 
at present, and White House aides have sought to play the issue down despite 
calls from some U.S. conservatives to press it. 
</P>
<P>
ARMS REDUCTIONS: Both sides have said no arms control deals would be signed at 
the summit. But U.S. defense officials are believed to be willing to cut their 
forces by 250,000 troops, 350 planes and 60 ships over the next four years. 
Officials say about half of about 300,000 U.S. troops in Europe could be 
withdrawn if relations improve with the Warsaw Pact states. 
</P>
<P>
NAVAL DISARMAMENT: In another pre-summit initiative, Gorbachev called for the 
two superpowers to withdraw their permanent naval forces from the 
Mediterranean. The United States adamantly refuses, saying this would hamper 
its ability to honor commitments to NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: Secretary of State James A. Baker III says Soviet behavior in 
Central America is the biggest obstacle to improving U.S.-Soviet relations. The 
United States this week renewed accusations that Moscow is sending arms to 
left-wing governments and revolutionaries. The Soviet Union has denied 
supplying arms to guerrillas fighting the U.S.-backed government in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: The Soviet Union wants the United States to waive a law denying Moscow 
favorable tariffs for its exports because of restrictions on Jewish emigration. 
Trade between the two superpowers is worth between $3 billion and $4 billion a 
year, much of it American grain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, as preparations for the superpower summit here came to a peak, 
President Bush sat down and dashed off a handwritten note to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev outlining his hope for a new kind of U.S.-Soviet 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The note was personal and even eloquent, a Bush aide said. But many of the 
Administration officials charged with managing U.S.-Soviet relations didn't 
even know the message existed until long after it arrived in Moscow. Some 
haven't seen the text to this day. 
</P>
<P>
The episode typifies both the opportunities and the potential pitfalls of 
George Bush's unusually personal approach to diplomacy. To a degree that 
astonishes even some of his own aides, the President believes deeply in the 
usefulness of direct, one-to-one contact with other leaders, from Chinese 
leader Deng Xiaoping to the prime minister of tiny Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with that conviction, the personal note was a step toward one of 
Bush's major goals for this weekend's summit: to establish the same kind of 
informal relationship with Gorbachev that he feels he has with other leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dangers Lurk 
</P>
<P>
"The President's desire all along was, No. 1 . . . to get together (with 
Gorbachev) to be able to have the kind of extended conversation that allows 
them to get to know each other in a much more personal way," a senior official 
said. "He is someone who believes very much in the virtue and importance of 
personal diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
But some diplomatic veterans warn that Bush's approach also carries serious 
dangers. "I've always trembled when a President picks up the phone to talk to 
his counterparts," said David Newsome, a former U.S. ambassador who heads 
Georgetown University's Institute of Diplomacy. "The idea of solving difficult 
international issues through personal rapport is a very risky one." If nothing 
else, he noted, it makes it harder to keep the U.S. government's vast foreign 
policy apparatus in tune with what's going on at the top -- as in the case of 
Bush's impromptu note to Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, as the Ronald Reagan Administration learned at the 1986 summit in 
Reykjavik, Iceland, presidents who rely too much on personal diplomacy can 
sometimes create as much misunderstanding as accord. 
</P>
<P>
And there is at least one more drawback to personal diplomacy, a White House 
aide noted after a flurry of presidential chats with Latin American leaders: 
When Bush calls a foreign chief to ask a favor, it creates a precedent that can 
sometimes boomerang. 
</P>
<P>
"The downside," the aide said ruefully, "is that sometimes they call back." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has long prided himself on his ability to establish personal rapport with 
foreign leaders. As U.S. ambassador at the United Nations during the 
administration of President Richard M. Nixon, he built a wide network of 
diplomatic friends, including many from countries that were traditionally U.S. 
adversaries. As envoy to China, he sought friendships with that country's 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
And as vice president under Reagan, he played a little-noted role in forging 
"back-channel" contacts with such foreign leaders as India's Rajiv Gandhi and 
Algeria's Chadli Benjedid. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as President, Bush has reveled in the role of chief diplomat of the land, 
spending hours on the telephone with princes, prime ministers and presidents 
around the globe. He has chatted frequently with Egypt's President Hosni 
Mubarak, gone fishing with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and played 
tennis with Argentina's President Carlos Saul Menem. (Bush won.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Success in Europe 
</P>
<P>
Bush has been especially successful, aides say, in cementing ties with European 
leaders in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- an important task as NATO tries to respond to 
upheaval in the Soviet Bloc. In preparation for the summit, the White House 
announced solemnly, Bush talked by telephone or in person with the leaders of 
all 15 NATO allies, including the surprised prime ministers of Iceland and 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Even more notably, Bush has managed to achieve a measure of rapport with 
France's sometimes prickly president, Francois Mitterrand. Bush was the host 
for Mitterrand and his wife for a weekend at his vacation home in Maine last 
spring, indulged the Frenchman's passion for woodland walks, and -- more 
important -- included him in early discussions of a U.S. proposal to cut 
American and Soviet troop levels in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The two presidents have coordinated their moves ever since and have scheduled a 
Dec. 16 meeting on the French Caribbean island of St. Martin to review Western 
policy after the Malta summit. 
</P>
<P>
But the one major leader Bush has not dealt much with directly is Gorbachev. 
Several aides said that the President has long wanted to try his hand at 
personal diplomacy with the Kremlin leader but was urged by his national 
security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to wait until the Administration had in 
place the framework of a policy toward the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In July, however, after reformist leaders in both Poland and Hungary urged Bush 
to talk directly with Gorbachev, the President wrote one of his famous notes to 
Moscow, suggesting an informal summit. Countless cables and two more 
handwritten messages later, the two men meet today aboard the Soviet cruiser 
Slava -- "to put our feet up and talk," as Bush put it last month. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said Bush has been encouraged to believe that a direct relationship with 
Gorbachev can be useful because the major U.S.-Soviet talks held during his 
Administration so far, between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, have been unusually frank and 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"All the conversations between Shevardnadze and Baker have taken on a very 
detailed, personal character," one senior official said. "It's one thing (for 
Bush) to be briefed on those; it's another to have your own direct experience 
with Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
But then, scholars and other outside experts warn, all modern presidents have 
believed that personal rapport with their Soviet counterparts might be a key to 
managing world affairs -- with generally disappointing results. "I always 
believed that as long as I could take someone into a room with me, I could make 
him my friend," Lyndon B. Johnson once said. "That included anybody, even 
Nikita Khrushchev." 
</P>
<P>
"Presidents are highly confident of their own powers of persuasion," said 
Kenneth L. Adelman, who attended summit meetings while serving as an arms 
control adviser to Reagan. "And usually, they're right, because it was their 
powers of persuasion that made them successful as politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"But Soviet leaders are just not as susceptible to persuasion as (U.S.) 
domestic players are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bush has already found some limits to the powers of charm. Last June, 
after Chinese troops killed hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of pro-democracy 
demonstrators in Beijing, the President picked up the telephone and tried to 
call Deng whom he had often described as an old friend. Deng refused to take 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say Bush's telephonitis has delighted some foreign leaders but 
rattled others, who are uncomfortable with being called out of the blue by the 
President of the United States. "Some (foreign officials) ask us, 'Why does he 
keep doing this?' " one State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chance for Mistakes 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Bush's informal style could produce problems with substance, 
experts warn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing for two leaders to size each other up," said Adelman, who 
recently published a book on the Reagan-Gorbachev summits. ". . . But dealing 
at that level also magnifies the chances of serious misunderstandings, in arms 
control and other issues." 
</P>
<P>
At the 1986 Reykjavik summit, for example, Reagan agreed with Gorbachev to work 
toward the elimination of all U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons -- to the 
consternation of the President's own aides, who understood that the United 
States was far from ready for any such sweeping step. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone diplomacy can be equally dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has attempted to keep a precise record of his telephone dealings with 
other leaders by taking careful notes on a yellow pad, aides said. But there is 
still a potential for confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"A president on the telephone is performing without a safety net," Newsome of 
the Georgetown Institute, said. "He doesn't have others around him to pick up 
the nuances of what the other side is saying."

Mother Teresa underwent surgery Friday to receive a pacemaker, and hundreds of 
nuns of her Missionaries of Charity prayed for her recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who suffered a heart attack in September, 
was reported to be resting comfortably after the operation. 
</P>
<P>
"The permanent pacemaker is working fine," said Dr. Rajen Watts, her personal 
physician. "Mother Teresa had a mild bout of fever in the afternoon, but now it 
is under control. She is under constant observation, but we can say that she is 
fine now." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work among the 
poor, was hospitalized Sept. 5, and suffered a heart attack three days later.

MLADA BOLESLAV, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As hard-line communism in Czechoslovakia went into its death throes last week, 
an eerie quiet fell over Mlada Boleslav, an industrial town just northeast of 
Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops, stationed here since 1968, simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"They went inside and stayed there for days," Oldrich Kubala, an editor at the 
regional newspaper Zar (Light), told a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet commanders said the move was taken as part of a concerted attempt by 
Moscow to reduce tension during the political crisis that preceded the collapse 
of the hard-line regime, but for many Czechoslovaks it carried a deeper 
message: The era of Soviet military intervention had passed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although uniformed Russians have reappeared in the town, people were 
speculating Friday about how much longer the Soviet garrison might be here. 
</P>
<P>
It was a question virtually no one would have considered two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Few expect any immediate withdrawal of the 75,000 to 80,000 Soviet troops. Any 
significant withdrawal would be highly unlikely in advance of agreement in the 
East-West talks on conventional forces that are taking place in Vienna. But the 
collapse of the hard-line regime has raised the question of Moscow's military 
presence for the first time in 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
It was a Soviet-led invasion, in 1968, that crushed the Prague Spring -- 
Alexander Dubcek's reform program -- and installed the hard-liners who wielded 
unchallenged power until two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In both Moscow and in Prague there have been calls from within the Communist 
parties to reassess the invasion. On Friday, the Czechoslovak party officially 
labeled it "unjustified," and said the decision behind it was "wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue to go around this thing with closed eyes," Prime Minister 
Ladislav Adamec said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats think that attempts by the Czechoslovak party's new leadership to 
distance itself from those associated with the invasion is certain to intensify 
pressure for an early withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
If the decision that brought in the Soviet troops is wrong, people here 
believe, then their continued presence surely is, too. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of their departure has brought few tears to the eyes of people in 
Mlada Boleslav. 
</P>
<P>
"If they left today, it wouldn't be soon enough," Jiri Boura, a long-distance 
truck driver, commented. 
</P>
<P>
"The sooner the better," a mechanic at the Skoda car plant said. 
</P>
<P>
Even at Communist youth headquarters, where two weeks ago such remarks would 
have been heresy, officials nodded a restrained, almost embarrassed "yes" when 
asked if it was time for the Red Army to go. 
</P>
<P>
"They occupy a lot of apartments, and there is a real housing shortage," said 
Renata Cesakova, head of secondary school activities for the Mlada Boleslav 
region. 
</P>
<P>
People here remember Aug. 21, 1968, the date of the invasion, the way Americans 
remember the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated. It was a national tragedy, a 
personal trauma. No one has forgotten exactly where he or she was at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"People without weapons tried to block the tanks," the truck driver Boura, who 
was 25 then, recalled. "But they had to give up." 
</P>
<P>
Incidents of open hostility between citizens and soldiers are said to be 
infrequent, but the resentment persists. There are similar feelings in other 
garrison towns. 
</P>
<P>
The commander of Soviet military forces in Czechoslovakia, Col. Gen. Edvard 
Vorobyov, told Britain's Independent Television News in an interview that was 
aired Thursday that these feelings have come out into the open in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
He said a group of children gathered the other day at the base of a regiment 
near Sumperk and shouted for the soldiers to go home. 
</P>
<P>
Vorobyov indicated that the Czechoslovak authorities had asked the Soviet 
forces to stand clear during the recent crisis, to dispel fears sweeping Prague 
of a military crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"There was friendly advice for us to stop all movements planned for military 
training of our combat vehicles and armed personnel in the direction of Prague 
and other towns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are also reported to have delayed routine troop rotations to the 
Soviet Union scheduled for late November, apparently out of fear that the 
arrival of new forces might be be misinterpreted.

BUSH'S MOVE BASED ON INTERNATIONAL LAW; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: THE U.S. AID FOR AQUINO GETS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN CONGRESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's order directing U.S. warplanes to help suppress the insurgency 
in the Philippines was legal under a provision of international law permitting 
governments under attack to seek outside help, U.S. officials and 
non-government experts agreed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The President's decision to authorize use of armed force in defense of 
Philippine President Corazon Aquino's government drew immediate applause from 
Democrats in Congress, including some who have expressed doubts about 
involvement of U.S. military power in Third World conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials, departing from their usual reticence about military rules 
of engagement, said the F-4 jets were armed and authorized to secure airspace 
over Manila "with force if required." These officials emphasized that Aquino 
was given all the help she requested, but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
"If President Aquino thought she had everything under control, she probably 
wouldn't have asked for our help," a senior defense official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were coming to the assistance of a democratically elected government that 
requested our assistance," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. 
"That is totally in conformity with international law." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Carter, a Georgetown University professor of international law, said it 
always is legitimate for a nation to respond to a plea for help from a 
recognized government. 
</P>
<P>
"An invitation (from a government facing attack) is a genuine basis under the 
United Nations Charter and international law for the use of force," Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That theory has been cited frequently in recent years. For instance, Washington 
invoked it in responding to an appeal from the governor-general of Grenada to 
restore order on that Caribbean island after a hard-line Communist coup in 
1983, and France cited it in helping the government of Chad expel Libyan 
occupiers from the North African nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union also said it was acting in response to a government invitation 
when it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. But shortly after Moscow's troops arrived, 
they deposed the government and installed a puppet leader. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council ultimately determined that the Soviet presence in 
Afghanistan was illegal. But Soviet forces remained there for a decade, clearly 
demonstrating that international law can be flouted with impunity, especially 
by a superpower. 
</P>
<P>
International law -- derived mostly from treaties, compacts and longtime 
precedent -- generally has no means of enforcement. Nevertheless, nations 
usually try to at least appear to abide by its provisions because they are 
reluctant to be branded as outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
At least at the outset, Bush's use of air power in the Philippines seems to 
have generated less opposition than any military deployment in decades. Aquino, 
credited with ousting the authoritarian government of the late Philippine 
leader Ferdinand E. Marcos, is immensely popular in the United States. 
Moreover, the U.S. government, which maintains its largest overseas military 
bases in the Philippines, has a clear interest in preserving stability in 
Manila. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to think of a case where the use of force from our point of view 
and that of the rest of the world would be less controversial," said Richard K. 
Betts, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution in Washington. "If you are 
ever going to do that anywhere, this looks like as good a case as you can 
find." 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction from Capitol Hill seemed to prove Betts' point. Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) called Bush's action "prudent and 
appropriate." Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) said the President "took the kind 
of measured action required." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's prompt backing of the Philippine government was in sharp contrast to his 
failure to take decisive action when rebel officers recently tried to overthrow 
the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega in Panama. But Administration 
officials insisted that the two situations were far different. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a legitimate and popular government (in the Philippines), as opposed 
to the situation we saw in Panama, where an unknown and suspect officer was 
trying to overthrow the government," said an Administration analyst. "Here, 
we're saving democracy. This is mom-and-apple-pie stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also was on much firmer international legal ground in the 
Philippines. Even though Noriega's regime is widely regarded as illegitimate, 
it remains the only effective government of Panama. Therefore, there was no 
government that could request U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some specialists suggested that Bush might have moved more 
quickly this time because of criticism that his actions were halfhearted in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a good lesson learned and applied there," said Dov Zakheim, a 
former Reagan Admistration official. "There needed to be clarity in a highly 
fluid situation where there were American interests and lives at stake." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base are America's largest military 
facilities outside the continental United States and are vital for the 
protection of U.S. strategic interests in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Large 
stockpiles of fuel and ammunition are maintained at Clark, from which the 
United States can stage airlift operations -- as it did in the early days of 
the Vietnam War -- and train combat pilots based there. Subic Bay is the main 
rest and repair stop for the U.S. fleet operation from the mid-Pacific to the 
Persian Gulf. While they are an increasing sore spot to nationalist-minded 
Filipinos, the two bases, situated north of Manila, contribute substantially to 
the Philippine economy, providing employment for 68,000 Filipinos.

Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth said Friday that Hungary will slash its armed

regrouping them away from its western frontier.

COUP ATTEMPT HAD QUAYLE PRESIDING OVER HIS 1ST SECURITY CRISIS;

PHILIPPINES: VICE PRESIDENT'S BACKERS PLEASED WITH THE WAY HE HANDLED HIMSELF 
IN ABSENCE OF PRESIDENT BUSH.

Dan Quayle's moment in the sun came shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Stationed deep in the most secure quarters of the White House -- the National 
Security Council's Situation Room -- the vice president presided over his first 
national security crisis while the commander in chief, President Bush, was en 
route to Malta. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle was notified about 10 p.m. Thursday by Deputy National Security Adviser 
Robert M. Gates about grave developments in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting to the special crisis management room, he coordinated the U.S. 
response from 11:30 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. and filled the position normally held by 
the President as focal point for top officials' reports as the military 
conflict unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
For a vice president whose leadership abilities were roundly questioned during 
the campaign, it was a chance to shine and one that he seized with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
Although his role was played out in private, Quayle's supporters were clearly 
pleased that the accounts of his performance that filtered out later from 
various sources were generally favorable. 
</P>
<P>
With his suit jacket on and his tie neatly knotted all night long, Quayle faced 
a wall of video monitors that provided up-to-the-moment information on the 
coup, according to one person present. He used the closed-circuit television 
hookup to quiz Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
Undersecretary of State Robert M. Kimmitt and CIA Director William H. Webster 
about reports from the Philippines reaching the Pentagon, the State Department 
and the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
By telephone, he talked twice with Aquino in Manila, receiving her request for 
U.S. military help to help contain the rebels, and relaying Bush's decision at 
12:30 a.m. to provide U.S. fighter patrols over rebel-controlled air bases. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, Quayle's top aide, William Krystol, never left his side, 
according to one official. But several persons said it was Quayle who actively 
monitored the developments. 
</P>
<P>
Worried that the rebels might attack the U.S. Embassy in Manila in retaliation 
for the assistance being given to Aquino, Quayle overrode embassy objections 
and ordered a company of U.S. Marines to take up defensive positions. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Quayle also made sure that the message to the rebels holding the 
air bases was clear: "You guys get in the planes and try to fly out, we'll 
shoot the daylights out of you," said one official.

HIGH COURT DEFERS ILLINOIS ABORTION CASE ARGUMENT 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court on Friday dropped a much-watched Illinois abortion dispute 
from its schedule of cases to be argued next week because of an out-of-court 
settlement in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was announced in Chicago last week, eliminating the case that 
had been viewed as the high court's most likely opportunity to alter its 1973 
decision legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
As anticipated, the justices granted a request from both sides that Supreme 
Court arguments be deferred pending a formal settlement. The argument session 
had been scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement must be approved by a federal judge before it becomes final. The 
case will remain on the Supreme Court docket, in limbo, until the judge acts 
and both sides then ask the justices to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in the Illinois dispute is a set of strict regulations imposed on 
abortion clinics, where most early-pregnancy abortions are performed. The 
regulations could have severely restricted the availability of abortions in 
that state. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge struck down many of the state regulations, and that ruling was 
upheld by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Atty. Gen. Neil Hartigan's appeal to the Supreme Court was accepted 
for review last July 3 -- the same day the justices announced, in a Missouri 
case, a decision giving states greater authority to regulate abortions. 
</P>
<P>
But Hartigan, a Democratic candidate for governor in 1990, later sought a 
settlement in which Illinois women would be guaranteed continued access to 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The case is Turnock vs. Ragsdale, 88-790.

ARTS GROUPS OBSERVE WORLD AIDS DAY 
</P>

<P>
World AIDS Day was observed Friday with protests, arrests and more than 600 
arts institutions throughout the United States participating in "A Day Without 
Art" to draw attention to the impact AIDS has had on the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of major art galleries closed their doors for the day. Other museums 
opened free of charge, suggesting that patrons make donations to AIDS 
organizations instead. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unprecedented action that drew together private galleries 
and museums, universities and theaters, police in Washington arrested 78 AIDS 
activists who sat in the street in front of the White House and chanted, 
"People with AIDS under attack. Act up, fight back." 
</P>
<P>
The activists also issued a "report card" giving President Bush failing or 
incomplete marks for his response to the deadly epidemic that has stricken more 
than 100,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has failed to provide a national AIDS strategy, has not pushed for 
adequate funding for prevention, care, research and treatment and has not 
responded to the growing burden AIDS is placing on the nation's health care 
system, said Rene Durazzo, who represented more than a dozen groups, including 
the National Assn. of People With AIDS and the AIDS Action Council. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in a statement: "Though there is no cure for AIDS at the present 
time, we will continue the most vigorous research efforts." 
</P>
<P>
In Burlingame, Calif., 100 demonstrators from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash 
Power gathered at the western regional headquarters of Burroughs Wellcome to 
protest the high price of the antiviral drug AZT. Police said 16 people were 
arrested for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking Burroughs to lower the price by 50% or to open up its books to 
justify the current price," said David Stearns, a spokesman for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Even after a recent 20% price cut, AZT costs about $6,400 a year for a full 
dose. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs, which closed the facility Friday in anticipation of the protest, 
could not be reached for comment but has consistently defended the price. 
</P>
<P>
Other protests commemorating World AIDS Day were scheduled to be held 
throughout Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu dimmed the lights in its photography 
galleries to honor Sam Wagstaff, a photography collector who died of AIDS in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
In Raleigh, N. C., a church opened its doors for friends and relatives of AIDS 
victims to light candles. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York was 
draped with a giant black banner. 
</P>
<P>
The DeCordova Museum in Lincoln, Mass., draped many of its paintings, on loan 
from corporations, in black shrouds. The Metropolitan Museum in New York pulled 
down Pablo Picasso's famed "Portrait of Gertrude Stein" and replaced it with a 
note about the impact of AIDS on the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts opened an exhibit called "Memento Mori," a 
collection of etchings by Boston artist James Hansen, chronicling a friend's 
death from AIDS, and displayed dozens of panels of the quilt from the Names 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
In an example of lesser-known institutions joining in, Waco-Southern Illinois 
University at Edwardsville, Ill., draped a four-building arts complex with 
fabric and marked the entrance with a giant "X."

2ND INFANT RALLIES, MAY GET LIVER IMPLANT NEXT WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Teresa Smith, who made medical history Monday by donating part of her liver to 
her 21-month-old daughter Alyssa, was still in too much pain Friday to visit 
her steadily recuperating daughter, University of Chicago physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 15-month-old Sarina Jones, whose scheduled living-donor liver 
transplant last Wednesday was canceled when she developed a life-threatening 
infection, has improved markedly and the university's medical center flew her 
to Chicago from a hospital in Memphis, Tenn., Friday afternoon in anticipation 
of performing the transplant early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter F. Whitington plans to evaluate Sarina's condition for at least a 
full day before making any decision on the innovative transplant, hospital 
spokeswoman Mary Fetsch said. As soon as Sarina is healthy enough to withstand 
the surgery, Fetsch noted, Dr. Christoph E. Broelsch will perform the 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa Smith's condition was upgraded from "critical" to "serious" as she 
continues to improve and the transplanted liver continues to function well. 
"She's alert, she's looking around, she's very responsive," Fetsch said. "It 
appears she's trying to act like a normal 2-year-old again, which we're 
thrilled about." 
</P>
<P>
Both Alyssa and Sarina suffer from biliary atresia, a congenital condition in 
which the bile ducts, which deliver digestive enzymes from the liver to the 
intestines, become blocked, damaging the liver. Broelsch removed about 
one-third of Teresa Smith's liver Monday and implanted it in her daughter, 
attempting to reverse the condition. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure had been performed four times previously in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Sarina's father, Robert Jones, 20, will serve as her donor. Her mother, 
Michelle, 21, is the wrong blood type to serve as a donor. Physicians normally 
prefer to use the mother as a donor because female livers are typically smaller 
than male livers, so the severed lobe is more likely to fit into an infant's 
tiny chest. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Jones is small in stature, Whitington said, and his liver is 
actually smaller than Terri Smith's.

EPA TO CURB FUNGICIDE USE ON FRUITS, VEGETABLES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: INDUSTRY GROUPS PREDICT THE EXPECTED BAN WILL RAISE FOOD PRICES AND 
REDUCE CROP YIELDS. BUT ENVIRONMENTALISTS CITE EBDC LINK TO CANCER.

<P>
After months of debate, the Environmental Protection Agency will move next week 
to sharply restrict a controversial class of fungicides used on many fruits and 
vegetables and linked in recent years to cancer in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in the food industry and the environmental movement said EPA 
officials will seek to prohibit use of ethylene bisdithiocarbamates, or EBDCs, 
on tomatoes, potatoes and bananas, three of the crops on which they are most 
heavily used. 
</P>
<P>
The action is expected to be announced on Monday by EPA Administrator William 
K. Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
EBDCs are used widely in California and throughout the world to protect produce 
crops from fungus, particularly in humid areas, and to extend shelf life after 
harvest. The compounds currently are used on about a third of all fruits and 
vegetables produced in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical and produce industries contend the proposed restrictions would 
increase food prices by reducing crop yields, particularly in the Rio Grande 
Valley of Texas, in Florida, and in other Southeastern states where the growing 
season is accompanied by high humidity. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, however, said the EPA's proposed action would be inadequate, 
ineffective and impossible to enforce thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
The move to withdraw approval for EBDC use on tomatoes, potatoes and bananas 
comes three months after manufacturers of the fungicides voluntarily withdrew 
60 of the 73 food crops listed for approved use. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the sharp reduction, consumer exposure was not drastically lowered 
by the voluntary action, the EPA has concluded, because the remaining 13 crops 
include such staples as tomatoes and potatoes and account for much of EBDC use. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to hold off mandatory restrictions, the United Fresh Fruit and 
Vegetable Assn. and more than a dozen other trade groups asked the EPA last 
week to delay its decision until a $17-million industry study of consumer 
exposure to EBDCs is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The organizations had received no answer by Friday, when the agency announced 
that Reilly would disclose the decision on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Because Monday's actions will be subject to comment from industry and 
environmental interests, it is expected that a year or more will pass before 
the new restrictions would take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Critics predicted the EPA action would not be effective even when implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Since EBDCs would remain on the market and approved for use on at least 11 
crops, there is no assurance they would not continue to be used on fruits and 
vegetables no longer on the approved list, said Rick Hind of the U.S. Public 
Interest Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
Hind and representatives of other environmental groups concerned with pesticide 
use insisted that EBDCs should be banned outright. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have learned any lesson over the last decade, it is that we cannot trust 
the federal government to assure a safe food supply. . . ," said Al Meyerhoff, 
a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The EPA is 
seeking to manage the cancer risk here, not prohibit it, and they are 
continuing to close their eyes to the special risks that pesticides present to 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Meyerhoff said California growers use EBDCs on such crops as tomatoes, 
potatoes, grapes, lettuce, sugar beets and asparagus. Under an environmental 
initiative now being circulated for the November, 1990, ballot, the compounds 
would be banned for use by growers, and foods containing their residues could 
not be sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The EPA has set out to establish an 'acceptable risk' for public exposure to 
one carcinogen on a food commodity, while failing to calculate the aggregate 
risks from other cancer-causing pesticides used in the production of the very 
same commodity," said Jay Feldman of the National Coalition Against the Misuse 
of Pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen carcinogenic pesticides are still approved for use on apples, Feldman 
said, while 13 are approved for use on potatoes, 10 on tomatoes, and 11 on 
citrus fruits. 
</P>
<P>
EBDCs were first used in the 1940s. Sold under the trade names Zineb and Maneb, 
they represent about half of all fungicides used on fruits and vegetables in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory studies have suggested that EBDC residue levels commonly found on 
food crops could produce a cancer risk as high as 20 cases out of every 1 
million people -- 20 times the accepted risk level. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a study by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that EBDCs 
were among the more dangerous agricultural chemicals currently in use. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the produce industry maintain there are few alternatives to EBDC 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"For some crops, such as green peppers, there is no approved alternative," said 
John McClung of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn. "For celery and some 
others, there are alternatives which are expensive and ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
Produce industry representatives accused the EPA of taking precipitous action 
because it has decided not to wait for results of a national "market basket" 
study being conducted to determine the level of consumer exposure to the 
compounds. The study is due to be completed next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups, in contrast, insist that the EPA has dragged its feet, 
even after acquiring new evidence involving the safety of EBDC use. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to be announced Monday, Feldman said, is but "a small piece in a 
flawed food safety policy puzzle."

Five astronauts scheduled to be orbiting the Earth on Christmas climbed aboard 
the space shuttle Columbia on Friday for the final two hours of a successful 
practice countdown. 
</P>
<P>
The test, which began Thursday, covered the final 24 hours of an actual count 
and provided training for both the launch team and the astronauts, who checked 
spacecraft communications circuits and other systems just as they will on 
launch day. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything proceeded smoothly during today's terminal countdown demonstration 
test," National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman Lisa Malone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia is scheduled to be launched Dec. 18, but officials said the schedule 
is tight and that liftoff might have to be delayed a day or two. Shuttle 
managers will select a launch date on Tuesday after a two-day flight readiness 
review. 
</P>
<P>
During the 10-day mission, the astronauts are to release a Navy communications 
satellite and then track down and retrieve for return to Earth a science 
satellite that has been orbiting the globe for nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Long Duration Exposure Facility satellite is secure in the cargo bay, 
the crew members are scheduled to conduct medical and materials processing 
experiments for five days. 
</P>
<P>
They said they are planning something special for their Christmas in space, but 
would not reveal those plans. 
</P>

The commander of the mission is Dan Brandenstein, the pilot is Jim Wetherbee

through its territory into the Southwest United States, Administration 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The projected focus on Mexico, to be initiated in coming weeks, is part of a 
broader U.S. plan to step up its own anti-drug efforts in the border region, 
where most cocaine is now believed to enter the country. 
</P>
<P>
The timing coincides with the annual State Department consideration of whether 
Mexico should be formally certified as cooperating in the anti-drug effort and 
therefore eligible for extensive foreign aid, officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
In disclosing the plan, National Drug Control Policy Director William J. 
Bennett emphasized in an interview that the United States was "very encouraged 
by what we see" in the way of more stringent anti-drug efforts by Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We should build on these efforts, and we should be doing more. . . ," he said. 
"The whole relationship between the United States and Mexico is going to be 
pretty focused with regard to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such gentle language, officials acknowledged that the plan to prod 
Mexico could complicate relations between the two countries, whose differences 
over drugs have aggravated stormy relations for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
They said that while Mexico's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has 
proven more aggressive than any of his predecessors in mounting anti-drug 
efforts, the steps he has taken still fall far short of what the United States 
has made clear it would like to see. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Mexico has shown little enthusiasm for U.S. proposals calling 
for joint crews on aircraft used on drug interdiction missions and for American 
authorities to be permitted to cross the border in "hot pursuit" of drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State Department, in a report last summer, noted persistent 
"charges of corruption" against high-level Mexican officials long thought to be 
aligned with drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision to seek the additional cooperation, Bennett said, was 
prompted principally by an emerging Bush Administration effort to dispatch 
additional anti-drug resources to the Southwest border, the preferred point of 
entry for drug traffickers after enforcement was stepped up off the Florida 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to have an increased presence along the Mexican border 
because we think more of (the cocaine) is coming in that way. . . ," Bennett 
said. "And if you've got more military and more border patrol, you need more 
cooperative government." 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. official involved in the anti-drug effort noted that the 
effectiveness of the planned border crackdown depended in large part on 
intelligence and surveillance that only the Mexican government could provide. 
</P>
<P>
The planned discussions with Mexican officials also appear designed to 
forestall the kinds of protests its diplomats sounded last month after the 
Defense Department unveiled a plan to use American troops and warplanes along 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Embassy warned that the plan "might have negative consequences for 
the bilateral relationship," and both the Pentagon and the State Department 
issued statements playing down the impact of the new effort. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Bennett said he had discussed "the necessity (for Mexico) to 
develop an even better campaign" with John D. Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador 
to Mexico, in a telephone conversation Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND Differences over drugs have plagued U.S.-Mexican relations since the 
Richard M. Nixon Administration, when the United States put pressure on Mexico 
to eradicate heroin and marijuana. The Mexican response has consistently fallen 
short of American expectations, leading the United States on occasion to slow 
cross-border traffic in hopes of spurring further action.

Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood, in a move certain to reignite 
passions on Capitol Hill, ordered the Marine Corps Friday to discontinue 
spending on production of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, senior defense 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable Pentagon officials said the decision was made after Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney ruled out the possibility of seeking new production funds 
for the futuristic aircraft in the 1991 defense budget, in spite of Congress' 
insistence that the program proceed on course. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to the Navy, which oversees the purchase of weapons and 
equipment for the Marine Corps, Atwood said that it would be wasteful and 
premature to continue the "advance procurement" of parts for the aircraft when 
no decision had been made to proceed with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney earlier this year proposed to cancel the program, arguing that it is too 
expensive and that commercial interests could develop and build the aircraft 
instead of the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's decision caused a furor on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers, concerned 
over the loss of jobs, joined with traditional Marine Corps patrons to fight 
the termination of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps had called the Osprey one of its highest aviation priorities 
and touted the aircraft as a central component of its new strategy to ferry 
Leathernecks from ships lying far offshore to hot spots over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The V-22 contractors, Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Co., would receive 
cancellation fees under existing contracts if the project is in fact killed. 
</P>
<P>
The V-22 aircraft is designed to lift off from a ship's deck like a helicopter 
and flies forward like a conventional plane. 
</P>
<P>
After a long-running debate over the aircraft, Congress approved $255 million 
in research and development funds to keep the program alive, and it deferred 
until next year any decision on whether production should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official tried to defuse the political controversy Atwood's 
decision is expected to stir. 
</P>
<P>
"There shouldn't have been anything too surprising in this to anyone," the 
official said. "If the Congress had fully intended to go along with production, 
then presumably they would have made it known in the form of production money. 
But they didn't."

GOVERNORS SEEK NEW DISASTER RULES

Gov. George Deukmejian, criticizing restrictions in federal emergency relief 
procedures, called Friday on President Bush to change the rules so that states 
would be eligible for more aid in disasters such as the Oct. 17 earthquake that 
struck the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Western Governors' Assn., Deukmejian was joined by the 
governors of nine other states in urging the President to streamline the 
delivery of emergency aid so that help would be available more quickly in 
stricken areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The lessons learned from these disaster recovery efforts have provided us with 
an important opportunity to make changes that will maximize the effectiveness 
of disaster relief programs in the future," the 10 governors said in a letter 
to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Deukmejian said in an interview, the federal government's 
response to the earthquake was "excellent." The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, criticized for moving too slowly after Hurricane Hugo struck South 
Carolina, responded quickly to the California quake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But bureaucratic requirements and restrictions on the amount of aid available 
placed unnecessary hardships on earthquake victims and on state officials 
trying to coordinate recovery efforts, the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Deukmejian proposed in the letter to Bush permanently lifting 
federal limits on the amount of money available to rebuild homes, highways and 
businesses. And he called on the federal government to better coordinate 
housing aid so that homeowners seeking assistance are not required to fill out 
as many as three applications with different agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Congress waived some of these requirements for California when it passed a 
$3.45-billion earthquake relief package, including eliminating a $100-million 
limit on highway reconstruction. But such waivers would not automatically apply 
in the event of future catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the provisions were changed specifically to assist us with our 
disaster, but they're not permanent changes in the law," Deukmejian told a 
reporter. "There still is a need for improvement in coordinating how the 
federal agencies implement these relief programs in a way that would be less 
burdensome to the victims." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposal also calls on FEMA to store some of the mobile homes 
used for emergency replacement housing in western states where they can be 
moved into position more quickly. They are now kept in Texas and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
It is only now -- six weeks after the 7.1-magnitude temblor -- that these 
housing units are being set up in Watsonville and Santa Cruz, where thousands 
of people were forced from their homes, the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
And he called on the relief agency to hire Spanish-speaking staff members and 
provide forms in Spanish so that in the future they will be able to better help 
Latino disaster victims who do not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the governors, Deukmejian said the Bay Area quake killed 62 
people, injured 3,700 and left 13,000 homeless. Of the homeless, about 500 
people are still living in shelters. Many have moved in with friends or 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian noted that those hardest hit by the quake generally were low-income 
people who lived in older housing units that had not been reinforced. In many 
cases, he said, several families were crammed into each of these homes. 
</P>
<P>
The permanent changes in federal law sought by the governors include: 
</P>
<P>
* Reduce the amount of state matching funds required to repair public 
facilities and lengthen the period that aid is available. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminate the requirement that emergency highway funds be deducted from a 
state's future federal transportation allocation. 
</P>
<P>
* Permit the use of relief funds to upgrade transportation structures that are 
found to be unsafe in an earthquake but are not actually destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
* Raise the Small Business Administration loan limit for housing from $100,000 
to $250,000 and eliminate a $500,000 limit on emergency business loans. 
</P>
<P>
At a closed session with the governors earlier in the day, Deukmejian invited 
other governors to join him on a trade mission next year to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who has personally promoted California trade in Japan and Europe, 
suggested that other western governors might wish to join in a collective 
effort to promote their states in Canada.

GOP FIRES AIDE WHO ADMITTED EXTORTION

A top Republican aide fell victim Friday to a continuing federal investigation 
of Capitol corruption when GOP leaders fired her, three days after she admitted 
extorting $12,500 for her bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Karin Watson, 42, a former fund-raiser who had been restricted to a research 
role in recent months, was fired by Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of 
La Habra on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I have indicated to her that we are terminating her employment," Johnson said 
in an interview after meeting briefly with Watson. He declined to discuss the 
matter further. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana), chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, 
which oversees all staff for the lower house, said he expected to ratify 
Johnson's decision without requiring a vote of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never overruled a member," Bane said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Watson, who was paid more than $58,000 a year, still has several 
unused vacation days on the books and her firing will not become effective 
until those days have run out. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's attorney, Clyde M. Blackmon, said his client would not comment to the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
Watson pleaded guilty Tuesday to a felony extortion charge for her part in 
coercing undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen to pay campaign 
contributions and appearance fees, or honorariums, to two ranking GOP 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
She also agreed to cooperate with federal authorities as they continue to 
investigate former Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale and 
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who was one of Nolan's chief lieutenants 
until Nolan resigned his leadership post in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal court documents, Watson was caught up in the FBI sting 
operation in 1988 when she told a fellow legislative staffer who was working as 
a federal informant that it would take roughly $10,000 to secure her bosses' 
support for a bill the informant was promoting. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she helped arrange and attended meetings between undercover agents and 
two lawmakers, who are not identified in the court documents.

ALVIN AILEY JR., 58; FOUNDER OF FAMED MODERN DANCE COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alvin Ailey Jr., founder of the internationally renowned modern dance company 
that bears his name, died Friday in a New York City hospital of a blood 
disorder, said a spokeswoman for the dance company. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
Ailey, who died about 4:55 p.m. at Lennox Hill Hospital, had been suffering 
from the disease for a year, spokeswoman Meg Gordean said. Lenox Hill officials 
refused to give details about the illness. 
</P>
<P>
"He was clearly one of the giants of modern dance," said Michael Wright, 
executive director of the Erick Hawkins Dance Company and one of Ailey's 
longtime colleagues. "But he also did more for American blacks and American 
black culture in dance than any other person that I know of." 
</P>
<P>
The choreographer, who assembled the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre in 
1958, had earned worldwide fame for his company's spectacular blend of the 
American modern dance tradition and such African-American musical expressions 
as jazz, blues and spirituals. 
</P>
<P>
Ailey, whose troupe swelled from the original seven members to the current 28, 
had retired from performing in 1968 to concentrate on choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Although his works were at times criticized as excessively showy, Ailey built a 
company that gave black dancers an unprecedented chance at professional dance 
careers and helped bring other multicultural choreographers to prominence by 
programming their works. In addition, he sparked interest among mainstream 
audiences in the overlapping traditions that form the black experience in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
In all, he created 79 ballets. 
</P>
<P>
"Ailey was a pioneer who managed to fuse modern dance, showbiz dance and an 
original vision of the black experience in American life," said Martin 
Bernheimer, music and dance critic for The Times. "He broke down many racial 
barriers. . . . His importance wasn't as a dancer but as a choreographer and as 
a dancer." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to creating works for his own company, Ailey's ballets have 
appeared in the works of other companies including the American Ballet Theatre, 
The Joffrey Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, and the 
Royal Danish Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"One must also wonder what we'll never see and what dances may never be danced 
because of the loss," said Jeremey Alliger, executive director of the Dance 
Umbrella in Boston. "Alvin Ailey has served as a role model for all of us 
working in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Rogers, Tex., in 1931, Ailey was the sole child of Alvin and Lula E. 
Ailey. After his parents separated, Ailey moved to Los Angeles in 1942 with his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
There, he fell in love with the style of modern dance master Lester Horton, 
with its radical mix of dance and theatrics. Although Ailey performed regularly 
with the Lester Horton Dance Theatre, he continually wavered between dance and 
teaching as professions. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1948 and Los Angeles City 
College three years later, Ailey left the company to study Romance languages at 
San Francisco State College. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ailey began dancing in a nightclub act in San Francisco in 1953, his 
irresolution over career choices ended. Alvin Ailey wed himself to dance for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
He rejoined the Lester Horton Dance Theatre and remained with the company for a 
year after Horton's death in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
He choreographed Darius Milhaud's "Creation of the World" for a performance by 
a Horton company and the San Diego Symphony. He also danced in the film "Carmen 
Jones," which was later released by 20th-Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Ailey left the Horton company for New York City in 1954 to perform in a 
Broadway production of Truman Capote's "House of Flowers." 
</P>
<P>
During his first years in New York, Ailey studied dance with such greats as 
Martha Graham, Hanya Holm and Charles Weidman. 
</P>
<P>
On March 30, 1958, Ailey and friend Ernest Parham recruited a team of dancers 
and presented their first independent production in the Theresa Kaufmann 
auditorium. The works -- Ode and Homage (a memorial to Lester Horton), Blues 
Suite and five dances on Latin themes -- drew critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
"As a dancer, Mr. Ailey is exceptional," wrote Dance magazine's Doris Hering in 
May, 1958. "He reminds one of a caged lion full of lashing power that he can 
contain or release at will." 
</P>
<P>
The Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre performed full-scale concerts for the first time 
in December of 1958, the program including ballets set to the music of Debussy. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences found "the stage world created by Alvin Ailey an altogether 
stimulating, exciting, beautiful, funny and original entertainment, 
meticulously presented," wrote critic P.W. Manchester in a 1959 edition of the 
Dance News. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after the theater's debut, Ailey produced "Revelations," commonly 
regarded as the greatest of his works. The program note described "Revelations" 
as an exploration of "motivations and emotions of American Negro religious 
music." 
</P>
<P>
A biography of Ailey notes that "no Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre Program is 
considered complete without ("Revelations")." 
</P>
<P>
For the next few years, Ailey's company performed concerts throughout the 
nation. In 1962, the troupe spent 13 weeks traveling the Far East in a tour 
sponsored by the State Department, becoming the first African-American dance 
company to perform in Southeast Asia. The group presented a portion of Ailey's 
repertoire of African-American folk dances as well as "Mountain Way Chant," 
based on Navajo Indian rites. 
</P>
<P>
The tour established the group's universal appeal and sparked the series of 
international shows that would follow. 
</P>
<P>
Ailey's company toured the world over the next two decades, performing works 
ranging from Ailey's "Labyrinth," based on the myth of Theseus and the 
Minotaur, to "Memoria." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, some members of the African-American communities pressured Ailey 
to remove non-black dancers from his troupe. Ailey, however, stood his ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there were some phone calls and some inferences," he said in an interview 
with the New York Times. "But we were just coming together as a people through 
the civil rights period. I felt that people were people and that a black theme 
expressed by dancers of all colors would be enlarged. It became a universal 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
Ailey also said of his work: "I am trying to show the world we are all human 
beings, that color is not important, that what is important is the quality of 
our work." 
</P>
<P>
Ailey is survived by his mother, Lula Cooper; his step-father, Fredrick W. 
Cooper; and a half-brother, Calvin Walls Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements are incomplete.

The driver of a bus that was struck by a commuter train, killing two television 
executives, will face a variety of charges stemming from the accident, police 
said Friday. South San Francisco Police Chief James Datzman said the 
preliminary investigation into the Monday evening crash indicated that the bus 
driver, Paul Go Cang, 34, had marijuana on the bus and illegally held two 
driver's licenses. Cang -- who had at least three convictions over the last 17 
months for traffic violations -- was unavailable for comment. Two employees of 
ABC-TV were killed and six others including Cang were injured.

JUDGE PUTS OFF HEARING ON ORDER RESTRAINING THE TIMES ON DUFFY STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego County judge put off until Wednesday a hearing on an extraordinary 
order he issued barring The Times from publishing information about security 
measures installed at the home of San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jeffrey T. Miller refused, after a closed 
meeting Friday in chambers with lawyers for The Times and for Duffy, to lift 
the order he issued late Thursday. Miller did, however, make a single but 
significant change in the order, one that an attorney for The Times said would 
enable the publication of a broad range of information. 
</P>
<P>
Even with that change, the attorney, Los Angeles lawyer Rex S. Heinke, said 
Miller's order remained "an unconstitutional prior restraint" on the freedom of 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any basis for enjoining the publication of information 
about security measures at the sheriff's home, particularly when what The Los 
Angeles Times was primarily interested in was how much these measures cost and 
who was paying for them," Heinke said. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking the court order late Thursday, a lawyer for Duffy told the judge 
that she believes any article about security measures at Duffy's newly built 
Scripps Ranch house could seriously compromise the personal safety of the 
sheriff and his wife, Linda. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, Janet B. Houts, said Friday that the case "most certainly" involves 
issues of press freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"But the cases I've researched hold that the right to privacy in this 
particular case, when someone's safety is at stake . . . will override any type 
of newsworthiness on an issue such as this, when it's not newsworthy," Houts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Fetherling, editor of the San Diego County Edition of The Times, 
characterized Houts' claim -- that the story The Times was pursuing would 
somehow threaten the lives of Duffy and his wife -- as "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Fetherling also suggested that the sheriff, who has announced his intention to 
run next year for a sixth term, was pursuing court action as a public-relations 
gambit. 
</P>
<P>
"Duffy has been displeased by other Times stories in recent months, involving 
him and his department, and there is every indication the court battle is an 
effort to divert attention from the question of the sheriff's public 
accountability," Fetherling said in a statement released Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Recent stories in The Times have documented, among other matters, Duffy's 
frequent out-of-town travels and outside consulting work. As recently as 
Wednesday, The Times ran an article detailing how the sheriff has ordered his 
deputies to respond to emergency calls at his home, even though it is in San 
Diego and under the jurisdiction of San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was unavailable for comment Friday, said Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Cooke, a 
department spokesman. Cooke, however, said the sheriff's turn to the courts was 
"not a calculated reaction to generate sympathy or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn statment filed late Friday with court papers, Duffy claimed that 
media attention has helped make him a "controversial sheriff." That attention, 
in turn, has generated "strong feelings of rancor" among some people, including 
those who are "mentally unbalanced and emotionally unstable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said he had been threatened with harm or death "numerous" times in his 18 
years as sheriff, most recently in October. The "internal security measures of 
our home are not matters of public concern or interest, and disclosing such 
information poses a threat to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began Thursday afternoon when a Times reporter, Richard A. Serrano, 
called the Sheriff's Department and asked about what Serrano had been told was 
an "extraordinary" security system at Duffy's home, Fetherling said. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the calls was "not to endanger or allow anyone else to endanger 
the sheriff," Fetherling said. "Its purpose was to find out if this super 
security system exists, and if so, what are the public policy implications." 
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday afternoon, at the time Serrano made his initial inquiries about 
the security system to Cooke, no decision had been made to publish or not 
publish a story, Fetherling said. 
</P>
<P>
But, since the paper would not agree not to publish information about any 
security measures, Houts said, she had no choice late Thursday but to go to 
court. Miller issued an order directing The Times not to print information 
regarding the "nature, layout or configuration of security measures" in Duffy's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
After Friday's hearing, Miller substituted the word "location" for "nature" but 
let the rest of the order stand. 
</P>
<P>
The change "makes a big difference," Heinke said, because "nature" is "one of 
those vague words," while "location" is much more specific. 
</P>
<P>
With the change, The Times is "certainly entitled to say, for example, he has 
an electronic security system or he has an electronic fence." 
</P>
<P>
The Times has had "no plans to publish a layout of Duffy's house or to reveal 
his address," Fetherling said. "No responsible newspaper would." 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Houts filed papers detailing Duffy's legal claim and arguing that 
his right to privacy outweighs any public interest in security measures at the 
sheriff's house. "Surely the fact that (Duffy) holds public office does not 
mean he waives all rights to privacy," Houts said in the brief. 
</P>
<P>
Publishing details about Duffy's "personal security devices" is "not a 
constitutionally protected activity," Houts said. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said Friday that the 1st Amendment to the Constitution does not 
explicitly bar all "prior restraints," the legal phrase for the blocking of 
news stories and broadcasts before their dissemination. But in several major 
cases, the U. S. Supreme Court has held that prior restraint violates the 
free-press provisions of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior restraints have been tried many times," San Diego attorney John Allcock 
said. "Even in severe areas like national security, they haven't been upheld. 
And so I don't see why this would be any different, why (Duffy's) assertions 
would justify it."

TWO MORE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PUPILS CLAIM THEY WERE MOLESTED BY TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two more Knox Elementary School children said Friday that they had been 
molested by Ernest Booker Brown, the Southeast San Diego school teacher 
arrested Thursday on suspicion of molesting at least two 12-year-old female 
students, San Diego police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The latest children, whose ages and sex were not disclosed, were interviewed 
Friday at the multi-track school by police detectives, who still are trying to 
determine if any more pupils at the school were molested, Sgt. Fred Moeller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to locate victims in the next few weeks by encouraging parents 
to call the child-abuse section if they think their children have been 
molested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if we'll find more children. Some students are off-track, 
meaning they are on vacation, and we can't contact everyone in one central 
location," Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have media coverage through the local papers, television and radio and hope 
to get to victims that may not have come forward. Our perspective is to 
identify as many victims as possible." 
</P>
<P>
About 25 alarmed parents who called the school Friday were assured that Brown, 
facing 70 counts of molestation charges spanning at least two years, was not on 
campus. Also, a team of four crisis counselors, who spoke to six fourth- and 
fifth-grade classes, were at the school to help the students and teachers 
reduce any trauma, said Tina Dyer, general counsel for San Diego city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"When counselors go into a situation like this, they are there to listen to the 
staff and kids who are fearful and wonder what's going on and help them to deal 
with their feelings," said Carolyn Morris, the district's guidance services 
department director. 
</P>
<P>
"They are available to talk with individuals and help return things to normal. 
In this case it was a very popular teacher. We find in a situation like this, 
it affects male teachers more so. They feel like, 'Gee, maybe I shouldn't be as 
close to the girls.' That's their immediate reaction," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the school district is required to suspend a teacher criminally charged 
by the district attorney, Dyer said. If Brown is convicted, he will be fired, 
and his teaching credential will be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office said Brown will be arraigned 
Monday.

REGIONAL AIRPORT COMMISSION PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GOMEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) has called for the formation of a multicounty 
commission to study the feasibility of building a major commercial airport in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference held Thursday on an undeveloped ridge overlooking 
Cristianitos Canyon in San Clemente, Packard said federal, state and county 
officials must cooperate to find an acceptable site for a new airport. 
</P>
<P>
Packard noted that officials in every county in the Southland are studying a 
variety of solutions to meet growing air transportation needs. But, he added, 
there has not been enough regional cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all doing this in isolation of each other without a coordinated effort," 
Packard said. "I'm looking at the entire airport needs of Southern California. 
We need to begin to coordinate the site selection process so we don't work in 
counterpart, in ignorance of each other's efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Packard's comments came during a tour of Cristianitos Canyon with San Clemente 
officials, who have criticized suggestions that a medium-haul airport be built 
in the unpopulated region northeast of the beach city. 
</P>
<P>
Cristianitos Canyon, less than 3 miles from San Clemente, is one of five 
airport sites being considered by an ad hoc group commissioned by the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The county commissioned the Airport Site Coalition to study possible sites for 
an airport to serve Orange County as part of a settlement over a controversial 
plan to enlarge John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The other option proposed by the coalition is in Potrero Los Pinos, a hilly 
part of the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Packard held a similar press conference, condemning the 
coalition's inclusion of the Potrero Los Pinos area as a possible airport site. 
</P>
<P>
Packard opposed that plan for environmental reasons. He said an airport in the 
national forest would ruin the pristine countryside, one of the last 
undeveloped areas in Orange County. "As far as I can tell, this is as bad a 
place as Los Pinos," Packard said. "I don't see any difference." 
</P>
<P>
An airport in Cristianitos Canyon would also bring commercial aircraft 
dangerously close to the San Onofre Nuclear Power Station, the TRW "Star Wars" 
test facility and Camp Pendleton, Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
The tour came less than two weeks after the Airport Site Coalition held its 
final public meeting at UC Irvine. The coalition also is considering putting an 
airport in South Camp Pendleton, March Air Force Base and Norton Air Force 
Base. JAMES GOMEZ

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in Nancy Hoover Hunter's federal tax-evasion and fraud trial declined 
Friday to sequester jurors, but he ordered the panel to deliberate five, not 
four, days a week beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam Jr. said he had thought "long and hard" 
about sequestering the jury, particularly because of recent media attention. 
</P>
<P>
But he said jurors, who are considering 197 counts against Hunter, are 
"enlightened, cooperative and sensitive to this case being tried in the 
atmosphere it was being tried in." The judge said he has "every confidence" 
that the panel will be "fair and dutiful" without sequestering. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of locking up the group, Gilliam ordered another day tacked on to the 
weekly schedule, beginning Monday, making their workweek at the court a full 
five days. Still, he urged jurors to take their time and decide the case 
"coolly and calmly." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors completed their 10th day of deliberation Friday without a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter faces charges of conspiracy, federal tax evasion and fraud stemming from 
her role as a top executive from 1979 to 1984 at the La Jolla investment firm 
of J. David &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 investors were bilked out of $80 million in the affair, a giant 
Ponzi scheme in which prosecutors allege Hunter played an active role. Defense 
attorneys contend she was blinded by her love for the firm's founder, J. David 
Dominelli, and was unaware of any illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to four counts of fraud and tax evasion and is 
in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's trial began March 28. It is believed to be the longest criminal trial 
in the history of San Diego federal court.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother-in-law of Charles Russ testified tearfully Friday that he bilked her 
out of her life's savings. 
</P>
<P>
Russ, 39, is charged with killing his wife, Pamela, 33, whose battered body was 
found Feb. 1, 1987, on North Torrey Pines Road after apparently having been run 
over with her own car, which was found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Russ is also accused of grand theft in the loss of about $80,000 belonging to 
his mother-in-law, Ginger Allen, who testified in the first day of Russ' 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, 68, explained to Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine that she trusted Russ, 
whom she referred to as Chuck. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, I thought Chuck was a financial wizard," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she mortgaged her home and that Russ promised he would invest her 
money with an investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
"When he brought me documents, I signed them. I trusted him. I thought it was 
the best investment for me," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Pettine showed Allen numerous escrow documents, and Allen testified that some 
signatures bearing her name were forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
Russ became a fugitive in mid-1987 and was arrested early one morning last 
August while walking on a Florida beach. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he had been charged only with grand theft and was considered an 
uncharged suspect in his wife's death. After his arrest and extradition here, 
he was charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing continues Monday and is expected to last several more days. Russ is 
being held in County Jail in lieu of $3 million bail.

NOW, THE TOUGH TRANSITION; 
</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE SUPPRESSION OF NORMAL POLITICS FOR 40 YEARS MAKES IT 
DIFFICULT TO RECONSTRUCT ALTERNATIVES OF CHOICE, LET ALONE A GOVERNING 
COALITION.

With each turn, the wheel of revolutionary change in Eastern Europe seems to 
revolve faster. In a fortnight, opposition groups in Prague have made gains -- 
the dethronement of the Communist Party from its constitutional leading role, 
the concession of coalition government and free elections -- that their 
counterparts in East Berlin have not yet fully secured and their colleagues in 
Warsaw and Budapest took months to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Yet everywhere, making the transition to democracy will be more difficult than 
breaking the Communist power monopoly. In Czechoslovakia, as elsewhere in 
Eastern Europe, the systematic suppression of normal politics for more than 40 
years makes it very difficult to reconstruct a choice of organized political 
alternatives, let alone build a viable governing coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The main coordinator of protest in Czechoslovakia, the Civic Forum, is an 
umbrella network of disparate groups united in their opposition to the current 
regime. Its spokesmen see themselves realistically as reluctant amateurs 
pressed into political service by extraordinary circumstances. Some, like 
playwright Vaclav Havel, may eventually accept symbolic high office; most will 
go back to their literary, intellectual and college careers. The Forum itself 
may give rise to a new democratic movement that will become part of a spectrum 
of organizations including existing and reshaped parties. 
</P>
<P>
The small non-Communist parties that have eked out an existence as cosmetic 
partners in the Communist-led National Front may become serious alternatives. 
The two Christian-oriented, rural-based parties have considerable potential for 
growth, as they can draw upon an increasingly active Catholic population, 
especially in Slovakia. The Czech Socialist Party possibly has a larger 
political role to play. Its daily paper Svobodne Slovo (Free Word) has for some 
time been quite outspoken, and some of the party's leaders have joined the 
student and intellectual opposition in calling for mass Communist Party 
resignations. The Socialist Party is likely to experience a rapid influx of 
members, as occurred in 1968, though now as then it will face competition from 
a revived Social Democratic movement. As in 1968, so now the Social Democrats 
are likely also to present competition to reform communism. 
</P>
<P>
Reform communism will form a key part of the new political spectrum. The 
present Communist Party will probably split, producing a conservative faction 
and a large reformist group based on the 
</P>
<P>
"shadow party" -- the half-million members purged in the aftermath of 1968 and 
now starting to re-enter Communist ranks. Some of its leaders, including Jiri 
Hajek, formed the Renewal group earlier this year; others, like Zdenek Mlynar, 
have returned from exile. Headed by Alexander Dubcek, they represent a group 
with unquestioned political experience and some moral credibility yet by no 
means a buoyant long-term future. 
</P>
<P>
The reformist policies that Dubcek still cherishes, centered on socialism with 
a human face led by a more "open" Communist Party, have surely been overtaken 
by events. Few in Czechoslovakia today believe in an improved Communist 
Party-led system; most want a democratic one offering free political choice. 
The watchwords are freedom and democracy, harking back to traditions of the 
First Republic, the only regime in Eastern Europe to sustain democracy through 
the interwar period. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition governments of the interwar and even the early postwar period, 
when the Communists shared power, provide a more useful model for the future 
then does 1968. A reformed Communist Party, with policies that go beyond 1968, 
could at most provide a political bridge in the coalition that manages the 
transition from the ruins of Communist dictatorship to the beginnings of 
multiparty democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Managing that transition will be far from easy. Recriminations over the past 
will inevitably accompany the beginnings of democratization. What will be 
needed is a government of national unity based on a balanced coalition 
embracing Socialists and Christians as well as reform Communists, and Slovak 
groups as well as Czech. Past antagonisms, the scarcity of experienced 
politicians and the volatility that follows the overthrow of an established 
dictatorship will mean that this process will take much effort and time. 
</P>
<P>
But more political time and more stable conditions may be available in 
Czechoslovakia than in Poland, Hungary or East Germany, since the economic 
situation is less pressing and the population less polarized and impatient. 
Relative economic prosperity and traditional political moderation, the very 
factors that delayed the outburst of protest and made Czechoslovakia the last 
key country in East-Central Europe to challenge its Communist rulers, may now 
help it to complete the transition to democracy and a mixed economy more 
rapidly and ultimately more successfully.

ANGELS SIGN LANGSTON TO BASEBALL'S RICHEST CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Angels boldly pursued and won baseball's premier free agent 
Friday when left-handed pitcher Mark Langston agreed to a guaranteed, 
five-year, $16-million contract that made him -- at least for the moment -- the 
highest-paid player in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old San Diego native spurned "serious" proposals from the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees to enlist with the Angels, becoming the 
sixth starting pitcher on a staff that last season had the second-best 
earned-run average in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's contract, which will contain a no-trade clause, will be the longest 
given a professional baseball player since Eddie Murray signed a five-year pact 
with the Baltimore Orioles in 1987 (Murray subsequently was traded to the 
Dodgers) and is the most lucrative guaranteed contract ever, surpassing the 
$13.6 million Dave Winfield was guaranteed by the Yankees in a 10-year deal 
before the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston also becomes baseball's third $3-million man, joining Minnesota's 
Kirby Puckett and Oakland's Rickey Henderson in that elite group. He will get a 
$1.5-million signing bonus, a 1990 salary of $1.5 million and a salary of $3.25 
million in each of the succeeding four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not out to break ground in that regard," said Langston, the Angels' 
biggest free-agent signing since Reggie Jackson joined the club in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the dollar amounts discussed "without a doubt boggles the 
mind," security was paramount in Langston's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teams were close, like the Dodgers and Yankees, but I think from the 
start -- from the very first meeting with the Angels -- meeting with (owners) 
Mr. and Mrs. (Gene and Jackie) Autry, the Angels were first-class, and from 
that point on, they took the lead," said Langston, who had a combined record of 
16-14 last season with the Seattle Mariners and Montreal Expos and has a career 
record of 86-76. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more comfortable with the situation they presented before me as far as 
the five-year deal and the no-trade provision. That's something that was very 
important to me. Every time we (he and agent Arn Tellem) said something, they 
responded. They were the front-runner as far as responding to everything we had 
to say. . . .

"My main concern was playing for a pennant-contending team," he said. "Even 
when I played for Seattle, I thought the Angels were classy and I always liked 
playing in Anaheim. I knew every year they would do what it took to put a 
winning team on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port, who in the past has been criticized for not 
aggressively pursuing free agents, said signing Langston will give him more 
options in trade discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant in the past to sign players for longer than two years, Port made an 
exception because of Langston's ability and the knowledge that another starter 
might have averted the late-season collapse that took the Angels out of the AL 
West race last summer.

ORANGE COUNTY FILIPINOS PRAISE U.S. MILITARY AID

Members of Orange County's Philippine community Friday praised the United 
States' military aid to help their homeland put down military rebels trying to 
topple President Corazon Aquino's administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people will love the way the U.S. responded to Mrs. Aquino," said 
Father Marito Rebamontan, who returned last week from a 15-day visit there. 
"Filipinos are very sentimental people. (Americans) will always be loved," the 
Roman Catholic priest said. 
</P>
<P>
Rebamontan, a member of the clergy at St. Anthony's Claret in Anaheim, said he 
believes the coup attempt is the action of a small minority. Many fellow 
members of Orange County's Philippine community on Friday agreed, saying that 
Filipinos are enjoying their expanded freedoms under Aquino and declaring that 
there is not widespread support for a change in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"(The rebels) won't be able to topple the government," Rebamontan said. "The 
people are really behind her." 
</P>
<P>
Phil DePerio, former president of the Philippino/American Bolinao Assn. of 
Southern California, said he thought Aquino should take a hard line against the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't do that, these things will continue," DePerio, 58, said. "They 
are loyalists. . . . They should line them up and dump them over Manila Bay." 
</P>
<P>
Art Ordonez, 45, a member of the Filipino Catholic Federation at St. Irenaeus 
Church in Cypress, said the rebels are able to find support by buying it. 
</P>
<P>
"You give a guy food to fill his stomach, he'll do anything you ask him to," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The country may not be ready for democracy, he said. "You can buy people (to 
support the rebels) because they are so hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Ordonez, 45, who came to the United States in 1967, said he has been unable to 
contact relatives in the Philippines since Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon A. Alcaraz, a former Philippine navy commodore who was once jailed by 
Marcos, said that the coup attempt is part of the remaining "corrupting 
influence of Mr. Marcos." 
</P>
<P>
Alcaraz, a resident of Orange and friend of Aquino, said that his wife is 
visiting the country and has called to tell him that she is safe. 
</P>
<P>
Rebamontan, the Anaheim priest, was among those who cheered when Aquino came to 
power in 1986 after 20 years of former President Ferdinand Marcos' 
authoritarian rule. After Marcos imposed martial law, Rebamontan left his 
homeland in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"The government wanted to control everything -- even seminaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That situation was quite different in his most recent visit, when he visited 
his mother, brother, sister and other relatives. He said that restrictions had 
been lifted on everything from speech to traveling in and out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Another Anaheim priest who asked not to be identified said that those who 
oppose Aquino have expected her to solve economic problems caused by Marcos. He 
said that during a visit to the Philippines in 1986, an economist told him it 
would take up to 10 years to repair the damage to the economy caused by the 
former leader. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beyond her control, in a way," he said. "It would be worse if someone 
else were there. I think Filipinos know that. There is not one there who can 
take over." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim priest said that any new leader would have the same problems.

SEN. WILSON NOMINATES WOMAN -- A DEMOCRAT -- FOR U.S. ATTORNEY POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson has recommended that President Bush name Superior Court 
Judge Lourdes G. Baird, a conservative Democrat, to the coveted job of U.S. 
attorney in Los Angeles and Orange counties, The Times learned this week. 
</P>
<P>
Baird, 54, had been rated "exceptionally well qualified" by a special committee 
that Wilson uses in selecting nominees for judges and U.S. attorneys. But she 
was considered a dark horse because her leading rivals for the job, like Wilson 
and Bush, are Republicans. U.S. attorneys traditionally come from the same 
party as the incumbent President. 
</P>
<P>
If nominated by Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Baird would become U.S. 
attorney for the Central District of California. Based in Los Angeles, it is 
the largest federal district in the nation, spanning seven counties from San 
Luis Obispo to Riverside and encompassing 14-million people. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of a female Democrat could help Wilson in his 1990 gubernatorial 
campaign. Ever since Wilson announced his candidacy last February, his aides 
have insisted privately that he will reach out more to women and Democrats than 
has Gov. George Deukmejian. Baird's nomination also is expected to be well 
received in the Hispanic community. Born in Ecuador as the youngest of seven 
children, she came to Los Angeles as an infant. She speaks fluent Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was in Los Angeles this week for a fund-raising dinner, but neither he 
nor his staff would comment on Baird's selection. A source close to Wilson 
noted that Deukmejian had chosen her twice for judgeships and "she got great 
reviews on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Baird must pass an FBI check and be interviewed by Justice Department officials 
before being formally nominated by President Bush. Her appointment would then 
be subject to Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other leading candidates, Baird has served as an assistant U.S. 
attorney in Los Angeles, from 1976 to 1983, then went into private practice. 
Deukmejian nominated her for the Municipal Court bench in 1986 and elevated her 
to the Superior Court in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Baird was appointed to the state Judicial Council by California Chief 
Justice Malcolm Lucas, a former law partner of Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year, Baird has worked as a dependency court judge, handling 
often-wrenching custody and child-abuse cases. She has earned high marks for 
her work from attorneys and fellow judges. 
</P>
<P>
"I am terribly pleased and very honored that my name is being forwarded to the 
White House," Baird said in a telephone interview this week. "I think it is 
premature for me to make any other comments about the position at this time. I 
certainly hope I am nominated." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was surprised by her selection even though she is a Democrat, 
Baird responded: "I was surprised when I was asked to submit my application. I 
am very pleased that it did not stand in the way of the recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
Although she is a Democrat, Baird described herself as "conservative" in an 
interview earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Baird made it clear in that interview that she has strong feelings about crime 
and drugs. "Crime is rampant. I believe there has to be tough sentencing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's choice was praised by several judges and lawyers who know Baird, but 
it clearly took others by surprise, including members of Wilson's own selection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very capable. She's very intelligent. She'll be very good," said U.S. 
District Judge William D. Keller, who first hired Baird as a summer assistant 
here in 1974 when he was the U.S. attorney and she was a law student at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she is an excellent choice," said Andrea Ordin, California's chief 
assistant attorney general. Baird worked as an assistant U.S. attorney under 
Ordin who was U.S. attorney from 1977 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"She was an aggressive and imaginative prosecutor in the special prosecution 
unit, which did complex white-collar crime cases," Ordin said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Richard Kendall, who served in the U.S. attorney's office 
with Baird, also lauded the choice, calling Baird "tough but compassionate. She 
has a richness of personal experience that has engendered an unusual degree of 
perceptiveness about people." 
</P>
<P>
One selection committee member, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was 
surprised at the choice because Terry W. Bird, 43, a Westwood attorney, and 
Donald C. Smaltz, 52, a veteran downtown criminal defense lawyer, had received 
higher ratings from the committee. Superior Court Judge Alexander H. Williams 
III, 45, also had been considered a strong contender. 
</P>
<P>
Baird came to legal work somewhat late in life. Raised in Hancock Park, she 
attended Immaculate Heart High School, graduating in 1956. Then she went to 
Europe for two years, attended the University of Madrid briefly, went to 
secretarial school and married soon after. 
</P>
<P>
"I had three kids, a station wagon, a shaggy dog and did a lot of volunteer 
work," Baird said in an interview in September. "After my youngest was in 
school, I started with one night class at Los Angeles City College." 
</P>
<P>
Baird moved on to UCLA, where she earned a degree in sociology in 1973. She 
then attended UCLA Law School and after graduating in 1976 was hired as an 
assistant prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, she went into private practice, handling both criminal and civil 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Baird, who is now divorced, succeeds Gary A. Feess, who has been interim U.S. 
attorney since June when his boss, Robert A. Bonner, became a federal district 
judge here.

POPEYE AND OLIVE BIG STARS AT PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a giant Popeye balloon leading the way, the Times Orange County Holiday 
Parade will step off at 10:30 this morning along the streets of downtown Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
With the weather forecast calling for sunny skies and temperatures in the 80s, 
the parade will begin at Civic Center Drive and continue north on Broadway to 
17th Street to Main Street and concludes at Washington Street and Main. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute parade will be shown on KHJ Channel 9, which will precede its 
telecast with a 20-minute performance by the Orange Song and Dance Company in a 
salute to this year's parade theme, "Traveling to a Holiday Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
The parade lineup includes more than 25 floats, all adorned with floral 
decorations, 150 horses, and six helium balloons in addition to Popeye and 
Olive Oyl. (Parade officials say that the 75-foot-tall Olive balloon is the 
first ever to depict a character who is a woman.) 
</P>
<P>
There will also be 16 marching bands from throughout Southern California and 
six other bands from other parts of the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Parade grand marshals include Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and two 
aviation heroes who live in Orange County: Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk 
on the moon, and 11-year-old Tony Aliengena, the youngest American to fly 
around the world.

OASIS SENIOR CENTER TO GET VAN, DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HERZOG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 3,200-member Oasis Multipurpose Senior Center will get a new van to 
transport seniors to doctor appointments, grocery stores and other activities 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the van and a driver for one year was donated last week by the Harry 
and Grace Steele Foundation in Newport Beach, according to Norma Gilchrist, 
Friends of Oasis president. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation for seniors is a priority," Gilchrist said. "Everyone thinks 
people who come here are rich, but it's not true. And even if they do have 
money to eat, they're lonely." 
</P>
<P>
Gilchrist said an Oasis community survey of seniors revealed transportation to 
be the most pressing problem faced. And hiring drivers costs up to $10 an hour 
or more, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"They live alone and can't get to the doctor or store or here to join in 
activities," she said. "In other words, they're just stranded. This gift is 
such a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
The 24-seat van will have a wheelchair lift for the frail and elderly. The 
Irvine Co. donated $2,500 to help with the maintenance and operating costs of 
the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The Oasis, located at 800 Marguerite Drive, is jointly funded and managed by 
the city of Newport Beach and Friends of Oasis, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 classes and activities are held there for members who come from 
Irvine, Laguna Beach and Costa Mesa, in addition to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The center offers meals, shared housing, counseling, health screenings and 
extensive recreational and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do everything we can to help enrich all senior citizen's lives, 
whether it be social activities or human services," Gilchrist said. LESLIE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: UNITED WAY REACHES 65% OF FUND GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With eight weeks remaining in the 1989 United Way of Orange County fund-raising 
campaign, an estimated 65% of the $20.5-million goal has been achieved, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign pledges have risen steadily since the drive's midway point and United 
Way officials say they believe the goal can be met if the community responds 
generously in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign officials had previously expressed pessimism at the rate of giving 
this year. But recent tabulations from companies with large employee groups has 
been encouraging, said Campaign Chairman Ron Merriman. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies have recorded large increases in employee giving, including 
Tarbell Realtors, with a 500% increase over 1988 results; Ciba-Geigy, with a 
256% increase over last year's totals and Neiman Marcus employees recorded a 
100% increase over last year. County of Orange employees have already raised 
more than $45,000 over their campaign goal. 
</P>
<P>
The United Way campaign began on Sept. 9 and will conclude on Jan. 24. CARLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MOBILE HOME PARKS' RESIDENTS CRY FOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angry residents from eight Orange County mobile home parks met with Assemblyman 
Curt Pringle on Thursday seeking support in their fight against Mel Mack Co., 
the Anaheim-based firm which owns their parks. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 residents, most of them elderly, crowded into the clubhouse of West 
Grove Mobile Home Park in Westminster and complained to Pringle that they were 
being held hostage by Mel Mack, whom they accuse of blocking the sales of their 
homes and saddling them with unfair rent increases. 
</P>
<P>
There were also accusations of harassment and poor park maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Mel Mack could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle (R-Garden Grove) said he was interested in the situation because his 
district has a higher percentage of mobile homes than any other district in 
California. He encouraged residents to take their complaints to the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
West Grove Mobile Home Park resident Sam Turvey said the residents are tired of 
being pushed around. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't organize, they're going to completely crush us under their thumb," 
he said. "What we're asking for is fair and reasonable treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Residents said Mel Mack has tried to force them to sell their mobile homes to 
Mel Mack Mobile Home Sales, a division of Mel Mack Co. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't list with them, your chances for sale are diminished," said Daryl 
Degraw, a resident of Americana Mobile Home Park in Westminster. "I know of 
many instances where homes have been sold and finances approved but the sale 
didn't go through because the resident couldn't get park approval on the sale." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two Westminster parks, Mel Mack owns parks in Santa Ana, 
Anaheim, Garden Grove and Stanton, Degraw said. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Katella Mobile Home Park in Stanton said her plans to sell her 
home hit a roadblock when she was slapped with 16 violations by park 
management. She said the conditions existed before she moved in but she is 
still being forced to fix them. 
</P>
<P>
"The message that they're giving us is very clear -- you must sell your mobile 
home through us," Turvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Blake, a resident of West Grove Mobile Home Park, said it is the rent 
increases that have him concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pricing us out of our living space. In the 10 years that I have lived 
here, my space rent has doubled. They are raising the rent by 10% each year," 
Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
Blake and other residents said they are also angry about having to pay trash 
and additional water fees which they said they have never paid before. GREG

PICKLER WINS POST OVER OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Irv Pickler was elected to the ceremonial position of mayor pro tem 
this week, despite objections from Mayor Fred Hunter and Councilman William D. 
Ehrle. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter nominated Ehrle for the post, noting that Pickler had served one year as 
mayor pro tem in 1986 while Ehrle has never served in that capacity. Councilman 
Tom Daly nominated Pickler, who was elected with votes from himself, Daly and 
this year's mayor pro tem, Miriam Kaywood. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, the mayor is elected by a vote of the people rather than by a vote 
of fellow City Council members, as is the case in most cities. Hunter has 
already announced plans to seek reelection in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to ask the city's Charter Review Committee to consider a 
plan under which the mayor pro tem position would rotate automatically among 
council members, thus avoiding bickering about the job.

PARK DEPARTMENT TO ASK FOR OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Parks and Recreation Department will go to the people today in an effort to 
find out what citizens think of the city park system. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will have a chance to meet with recreation officials at four sites in 
Mission Viejo to discuss problems and solutions, said Wayne Lowery, director of 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to open our ears . . . and let people talk," Lowery said. 
"We'll sit and talk about what they would like to see improved and about 
problems like teen-age drinking in the parks." 
</P>
<P>
The meetings will start at Castille Park at 9 a.m. and move every two hours to 
El Dorado Park, Melinda Park and Marguerite O'Neill Park. City staff will also 
present a package of improvements planned for some sites, such as additional 
playground equipment, security lighting, picnic shelters and landscaping, 
Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
The park director was enthusiastic over the response received from citizens on 
the park forums. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I was just half optimistic originally, but we've gotten several 
phone calls from people," Lowery said. "One lady who said she couldn't make it 
managed to send a letter with her comments. So we expect quite a turnout." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first year for the park forum, and Lowery hopes to make it an 
annual event. 
</P>
<P>
"The city wants to be service-oriented and the best way to provide good service 
is to find out what the people want," he said. FRANK MESSINA

GROUP ABANDONS AGE, ARNOLD RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The organizers of a campaign to recall Mayor Cecilia L. Age and Councilwoman 
Margaret M. Arnold announced this week that they have abandoned their plans. 
</P>
<P>
The group had until Dec. 13 to collect 4,684 signatures -- 20% of the city's 
registered voters -- to force a special recall election, Deputy City Clerk 
Lillian Haina said. 
</P>
<P>
Recall committee chairwoman Alice Rogers said the group had gathered about 
3,800 signatures but decided not to proceed in order to save the city the 
expense of a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers added that the group was encouraged by Age's comments after being 
selected mayor by her colleagues on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps, and let us emphasize perhaps, Ms. Age not only clearly understands 
but appreciates the responsibility, commitment and moral obligations of serving 
a city and all its constituents," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
The recall drive was started in August because of Age's and Arnold's support of 
the controversial Cypress Downs project, a business and recreational proposal 
for 167 acres surrounding Los Alamitos Race Course. The project was turned down 
in a special February ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said the group was also motivated by Age's and Arnold's support of 
Councilman Walter Bowman, who won his seat on the five-member council in July 
through a court order. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold nominated Bowman for the seat after the list of 14 potential candidates 
to replace former Mayor William Davis had been narrowed down to two. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold and Age voted for Bowman, who supported the Cypress Downs plan, while 
their colleagues, John Kanel and Gail H. Kerry, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore ruled in July that the abstentions must be 
regarded as yes votes and Bowman was seated. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said on Thursday that supporting Bowman and the Cypress Down plan were 
no reason to start a recall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a recall is a drastic effort and should be against someone who's done 
something really wrong. This effort was totally unfounded and unwarranted," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Age expressed relief that the recall threat was behind her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a pleasant experience to take your children to the supermarket and 
have people in front of the store waving around a petition with your name on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I hadn't done anything to justify a recall, but I was never afraid of 
it and didn't let it influence any of my decisions. It's encouraging for me to 
see the hatchet buried and that there are no sides any more," she said. GREG

NEW HOTELS ON WAY IN DISNEYLAND AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-story, 750-suite hotel is on its way to the Disneyland area after gaining 
Planning Commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
The 350,000-square-foot hotel will be built on the northwest corner of Harbor 
Boulevard and Orangewood Avenue and will be accompanied by a five-level parking 
garage. Two restaurants, meeting rooms and banquet rooms will be part of the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Anaheim Hotel Complex of San Dimas, will build on a five-acre 
parcel that is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also approved plans for replacing the 100-room Space Age Lodge 
with a four-story, 169-room hotel. The old hotel at 1176 W. Katella Ave. will 
be demolished to make way for the new structure.

MIKE PENNER: PORT EMPTIES POCKETS WITH BOLDEST MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You pay 16 mil and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston on the mound, but you shouldn't stop yet. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels looked back in time and far into the '90s all at once Friday 
afternoon as they completed what easily ranks as the boldest move of the Mike 
Port era. Hello, Mark Langston. Halo Mark Langston. Sixteen million buys a lot 
of fastballs these days. 
</P>
<P>
This is how the Angels used to do it. This was the Buzzie Bavasi buzz-saw 
approach to baseball -- annual shoot-outs at high noon with George Steinbrenner 
for the biggest free agents in the land. 
</P>
<P>
That it failed more often than it worked is a lesson that had altered the 
course of Angel history during the past decade. Memories of Bill Travers and 
John D'Acquisto die hard, and once they added Reggie Jackson to the payroll in 
1982, the Angels sought safe asylum from the free-agent wars. 
</P>
<P>
We would build from within, the Port credo read. 
</P>
<P>
We would hazard no risk. 
</P>
<P>
We would be cheap. 
</P>
<P>
After tentatively testing the waters last winter and getting the chill from 
Nolan Ryan and Bruce Hurst, the Angels finally decided to damn the torpedoes 
Friday. More than just taking the plunge, the Angels went in cannonball style. 
</P>
<P>
No one gets five-year contracts anymore? 
</P>
<P>
No one makes more than Rickey Henderson? 
</P>
<P>
They do now. 
</P>
<P>
Time out should be taken to commend Port and Gene Autry for doing the right 
thing. Considering that the Oakland Athletics still reside in the American 
League West, it was really the only thing. At least now, the Angels can say 
they have a fighting chance. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't let them say they're done. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the Angels still lack anyone approaching the offensive talents 
of Jose Canseco. Or Rickey Henderson. Or Mark McGwire. Or Carney Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
No one currently wearing a halo is going to contend for a batting championship 
any time soon. No one is applying for admission into any 40-40 club. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels don't even have a leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Steps remain to be taken before thoughts of catching the A's can be undertaken. 
Langston was an important one, but let it only be the first one. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any money left for Robin Yount? 
</P>
<P>
As long as the Angels are in the mood, a second strike is in order. Yount, 
baseball's next $3-million man, is presently renegotiating with his present 
employers, the Milwaukee Brewers. Reportedly, Brewer General Manager Harry 
Dalton recently asked Yount what it would take to re-sign him. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Yount replied, "Sign Mark Langston." 
</P>
<P>
If Yount still wants to share clubhouse space with Langston, he knows where to 
look. 
</P>
<P>
If not, the Angels, at last, have some bargaining power at the trade table. 
They have a surplus of designated hitters (Brian Downing and Chili Davis), a 
surplus of second basemen (Johnny Ray and Mark McLemore) and, now, a surplus of 
starting pitching. 
</P>
<P>
A package for Joe Carter or Vince Coleman or Eric Davis or Danny Tartabull is 
no longer out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
The new question is: Which starting pitcher to trade? Mike Witt is the obvious 
choice, but his dreadful 1989 numbers (9-15, 4.54) have diminished his market 
value. The Angels' best hope is finding a buyer willing to take a flyer on a 
still-young (29) former ace who won 16 games as recently as 1987. 
</P>
<P>
With old right-hander Bert Blyleven and young left-handers Chuck Finley and Jim 
Abbott entrenched in the rotation, Kirk McCaskill's name might start making the 
rounds. Getting by more on finesse than power since his 1987 and 1988 arm 
problems, McCaskill's 15-10 record last season reopened some eyes. Kansas City, 
among others, is said to have a keen interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels can also use some help in the bullpen, and there's the Lance Parrish 
matter to attend to, so if Port is truly intent on closing the gap in the AL 
West, his work has really just started. 
</P>
<P>
But Langston is some first domino. He was the one everybody in Nashville was 
waiting to see drop, the action that had to be taken before 25 other teams 
could react. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the games may begin. 
</P>
<P>
And who would have cast the Angels as trend-setters, as catalysts? Finally, for 
the first time under Port, the safety of the sidelines has been abandoned for a 
spot in the front line. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Big A stands for aggressive.

LAKERS HALT PRODUCTION IN OVERTIME, FALL TO PISTONS; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: L.A. IS SHUT OUT IN THE EXTRA PERIOD AND DETROIT WINS, 108-97, AT THE 
FORUM.

<P>
Proving as contentious as expected, Friday night's showdown between the Lakers 
and Detroit Pistons entered overtime with the teams tied at 97, after Joe 
Dumars' shot at the buzzer fell off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
But when overtime beckoned, the Pistons were revived and the Lakers simply 
tuckered out. Detroit, which lost a chance to win it in regulation when Dumars' 
shot at the buzzer spinned out, shut out the Lakers in the five-minute extra 
period to take a 108-97 victory before a sellout Forum crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, who trailed most of the game, dominated in overtime. The Pistons 
(10-5) outscored the Lakers (11-3), 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, who saw guard Byron Scott foul out and Magic Johnson in foul 
trouble, blew a fourth-quarter lead and were lucky to get to overtime. 
</P>
<P>
With :25.5 to play and the Lakers trailing, 97-95, the teams traded 20-second 
timeouts and the Lakers called a full timeout themselves to set up a potential 
game-tying basket. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson drove through the lane, then found James Worthy temporarily open on the 
right wing. Worthy moved inside, but his shot was partially blocked by Bill 
Laimbeer. The Lakers again had the ball with :13.1 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the ball wound up in A.C. Green's hands in three-point range. He 
missed the shot, but Isiah Thomas fouled him with :7.6 seconds to play. Green, 
who had made 71.8% of his free-throw attempts this season, sank both shots to 
tie it, 97-97. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted a Piston timeout, so Coach Chuck Daly could set up a final shot 
to avoid overtime. Aguirre could not find a teammate open, so he called another 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons went to Dumars, who drove the lane. He pulled up for a running 
jumper that rolled around the rin and fell out at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker lead was seven points and holding steady with 4:23 to play in the 
third quarter when Johnson picked up his fourth foul and was forced to sit out 
the remainder of the quarter and the first 1:12 of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lakers' inside game weakened when Johnson left, they had a 76-70 
lead entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson came back for what turned out to be a cameo appearance. Less than a 
minute later, Johnson was whistled for his fifth foul and was back out again. 
</P>
<P>
Then, 22 seconds after Johnson returned late in the fourth quarter and the 
Lakers now clinging to the lead, Byron Scott was called for his sixth foul with 
4:18 to play. Laimbeer's two free throws narrowed the Laker lead to 90-87. 
</P>
<P>
And the Pistons kept coming. Two free throws by Mark Aguirre, on Green's fifth 
foul, cut the lead to 95-93, with 2:16 remaining. Worthy appeared to have got 
those points back, but he was called for stepping on the baseline on a spin 
move to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons finally went ahead when, after a timeout, Dumars sank a 15-foot 
jump shot to tie it, 95-95. The Lakers quickly got the ball to Johnson, but it 
eventually wound up in Green's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Green's shot was blocked by Laimbeer. Dumars straddled the out of bounds line 
to save the ball, and Aguirre sank a jump shot to give Detroit a 97-95 lead -- 
their first since the first quarter -- with :25.5 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for the intensity of the rivalry to flare. Less than four 
minutes after the opening tipoff, a skirmish erupted under the Lakers' basket 
that almost escalated into a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had made a layup and been fouled by Laimbeer when the Pistons' center 
traded shoves with Green. Thomas then came from behind Green and landed an 
open-handed blow to the back of Green's neck. Green retaliated with a hard 
shove, but the three participants were separated before further damage could be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The result was technical fouls on Green and Thomas and a personal foul on 
Laimbeer. Once order was restored Johnson sank the free throw to complete the 
three-point play and give the Lakers a 12-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers opened that to 26-15 as their defense, which featured Johnson 
guarding Laimbeer and Worthy on Dumars, limited the Pistons to 36.8% shooting 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, meanwhile, shot 50% in the first quarter and opened a 10-point lead 
with 4:40 to play after two free throws by Worthy. They extended it to 11 by 
the end of the quarter when Worthy sank two more free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Pistons and Lakers failed to score on their first four possessions of 
the second quarter. Johnson then re-entered the game and got the Lakers going 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson sank two free throws for a 28-15 lead and, after James Edwards 
countered by making a jump shot, Johnson took a pass from Larry Drew and sank a 
baseline hook shot. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and Dumars made back-to-back baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Michael Cooper then teamed up to give the Lakers a 33-21 lead with 
7:28 to play. Cooper streaked in on the right wing and dunked after taking 
Johnson's lob pass. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, again, brought back the Pistons. His three-point play on the next 
possession cut the Laker lead to nine points, but Johnson backed Dennis Rodman 
into the basket for another field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers faltered late in the second quarter, as Rodman took control of the 
offensive boards. That enabled Detroit to cut the margin to 49-42 entering the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Forward Orlando Woolridge, on the injured list after arthroscopic surgery on 
Oct. 17 to remove bone fragments from his right knee, said Friday he has been 
cleared to participate in a full practice with the team. Woolridge might return 
to action as soon as early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve center Mark McNamara did not suit up for Friday's game so that doctors 
could monitor his heart with a mobile device. McNamara passed out briefly in 
his Sacramento hotel room on Wednesday, but said he felt well enough to play in 
Thursday night's victory over the Kings. McNamara said he asked to visit a 
Laker internist on Friday to be fitted with what he called a mobile EKG unit, 
about the size of a small radio. McNamara said he will wear the device for 24 
hours and, pending results, will be cleared to play Sunday night against the 
New York Knicks. The Lakers, apparently, were more concerned about McNamara 
passing out than McNamara, who was slow to recover from a virus recently. "I 
had been feeling a little light-headed that day, and when I got up to answer 
the door when the maid knocked, I opened it and, I guess, fell backward right 
in front of the maid," McNamara said. "I fell straight back. I was lucky I 
didn't hit my head on anything. I do have a big scratch on my arm. I woke up 
about 10 seconds after I passed out. I didn't want to go to the doctor, because 
I knew they'd do something like this to me. But Gary (Vitti, the Laker trainer) 
made me." 
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward Mel McCants, who suffered a sprained right ankle a week ago, 
apparently recovered more rapidly than expected. McCants worked out with the 
team Friday and dressed for the game.

UC IRVINE BREAKS INTO THE VICTORY COLUMN

<P>
UC Irvine proved one thing in its 85-79 victory over Bucknell in the first 
round of the Disneyland/Freedom Bowl tournament Friday night in the Bren 
Center: 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters showed they could turn in a solid all-around game, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine will face Tennessee Chattanooga, an 86-81 winner over Navy in the first 
game, for the championship at 8 tonight. Bucknell plays Navy in the consolation 
game at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The victory came not a moment too soon for Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, who 
watched his team get pressed into a loss in the opener at the University of San 
Francisco last Saturday, then shoot itself in the foot in a loss to Stanford 
Monday. Irvine shot 38% against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan had figured on winning each of those games. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Anteaters suffered through a lapse or two on their way to their 
first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing seemed to throw them too far off track. 
</P>
<P>
They fell behind by 15 points in the first half, but rallied to take the lead, 
40-38, by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Center Ricky Butler fouled out with 6 minutes 24 seconds left, but that didn't 
hurt Irvine too much. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine shot well, especially down the stretch as it pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine took the lead for good, 77-76, on a jumper in the lane by Justin 
Anderson, who had 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, one of the Anteaters' best outside shooters, was one for 12 from the 
field coming into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He can shoot," Mulligan said. "I want to stick with him, but I was starting to 
get nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's poor shooting was one reason Irvine came into the game shooting just 
43%. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't shot that well all year," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, a burly, 6-foot-7, 255-pound junior, was a force inside at times, 
lumbering around defenders for short jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
He had 18 points and a team-high nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Herdman also had 19 for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman and Anderson made key free throws in the final minute to seal the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman also came up with what turned out to be the biggest basket of the game. 
</P>
<P>
After missing a jumper on an out-of-bounds play, Herdman wrestled the rebound 
away from Bucknell's Mike Joseph and scored on a short bank shot. 
</P>
<P>
That gave Irvine a relatively safe 81-76 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph had 22 points to lead Bucknell. Forwards Greg Leggett and Mike Bright 
added 19 and 14, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a really good offensive team," Mulligan said. "There are no easy 
teams in this tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Bucknell opened up a 30-15 lead midway through the first half and it appeared 
the Bison would put the game out of reach early. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine seemed listless at times in the first half, throwing the ball away 
repeatedly and missing easy shots. 
</P>
<P>
But Mulligan turned to two freshmen, neither of whom figured prominently in the 
Anteaters' plans when the season began, for a spark. Ben Rishwain, a walk-on 
guard, got Irvine moving with a layup that cut Bucknell's lead to 30-19. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Von Lutzow, a forward Mulligan had hoped to redshirt, added a steal and a 
driving dunk, cutting the Bison lead to 35-30. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine took the lead, 40-38, on a pair of free throws by Herdman with four 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Anteaters' first lead since it was 10-9 with 16:10 left. But as it 
turned out, it wasn't their last. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Irvine shot better than 50% for the first time this season. The Anteaters were 
30 of 57, including six of 12 from three-point range for 52%. Even their free 
throw shooting, which was 57% against Stanford, improved. They made 19 of 30 
for 63%. . . . Rob Doktorczyk was the only Irvine starter who didn't score in 
double figures. He had just three points. In addition to Justin Anderson (19), 
Ricky Butler (18) and Jeff Herdman (19), guard Rod Palmer had 15 points. He 
also had seven assists and five rebounds. . . . Sophomore Nick Marusich, who 
played at Servite High School, is a 6-7 center for Navy. He had two points in 
12 minutes in Navy's loss to Tennessee Chattanooga. . . . The Moccasins were 
led by center Terry Brent, who had 29 points and 11 rebounds. Eddie Reddick had 
22 for Navy.

ANGEL FANS HAPPY, BUT DAZZLED BY DOLLARS

Mark Langston's signing was cheered by fans, but even they pondered the 
economic implications. 
</P>

"As long as (Yankee owner George) Steinbrenner says he'll top anybody's deal, 
these guys are going to keep getting it," said Hal Hammonds, who tends bar at 
The Catch Restaurant across the street from Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"The spiral can't keep going up because pretty soon we can't afford to go to 
ballgames," said Hammonds, who attended 40 games last season. "Only the 
ultra-rich will be able to afford it." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Fick, a member of the Angels Booster Club, was enthused by the news of 
landing Langston, though he wondered whom it would bump out of one of 
baseball's strongest starting rotations. 
</P>
<P>
Fick also was startled at the size of Langston's paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes these players get too much money, but if they can make it, I guess 
you call it supply and demand," Fick said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Fick said there is nothing wrong with being paid $16 million "if 
somebody is foolish enough to pay it." 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, I'd love to make that kind of money."

Irvine Sports Club president William Ackman has been selected to head a 
three-month fund-raising campaign for UC Irvine athletics, Horace Mitchell, the 
university's vice chancellor of student affairs, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ackman, 42, was hired on an interim basis while the university continues its 
search for a director of development. Craig Fertig, UCI's former associate 
director of athletics and development, resigned from that position in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Ackman will coordinate a staff of 100 volunteers for the fund-raising drive, 
with a goal of reaching $300,000 -- approximately $5,000 per working day -- in 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
Ackman, a graduate of USC and a 14-year resident of Irvine, has been involved 
in many fund-raising projects over the years for Irvine and the Orange County 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Along with serving as the president of the Irvine Sports Club, a community 
service club that supports and raises funds for Irvine-area schools, Ackman is 
on the board of the Irvine Chamber of Commerce; a public safety commissioner 
for the City of Irvine; a board member of the UC Irvine athletic foundation, 
and a past executive committee member of the Freedom Bowl. BARBIE LUDOVISE

WEST GERMANS BUY 80% OF IRVINE-BASED ST. JOHN KNITWEAR 
</P>

<P>
Escada, an international fashion designer and manufacturer, has bought 80% of 
St. John Knits, a maker of expensive, knit dresses and suits. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition, completed recently for an undisclosed cash sum, will enable 
the family-owned St. John to develop its own chain of boutiques, Bob Gray, 
chairman and chief executive of St. John, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has to get bigger -- particularly in the garment field -- and 
retailers are getting weaker," said Gray, who along with his wife, Marie, 
launched St. John 27 years ago. With the rash of mergers and closings among 
major and specialty retailers, Gray said, St. John "could have a problem with 
our distribution in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said he expects St. John boutiques to grow from a single location in Palm 
Desert to 20 to 30 stores within three years. Much of the new store development 
will be in Europe and the Pacific Rim -- notably Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul 
and Hawaii -- where St. John has virtually no outlets now, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray and his wife, who is head designer, both have three-year contracts and 
will remain at St. John, as will the rest of the management team. In addition, 
Bob Gray will join Escada's board and Escada's chief executive, Wolfgang Ley, 
will join St. John's board. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase is the first American acquisition for 13-year-old Escada AG, a 
Munich-based maker of ready-to-wear designer sportswear and accessories for 
women. Escada, which is publicly traded in Germany, had sales of $361 million 
for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31 -- more than six times those of St. John 
Knits. 
</P>
<P>
St. John began as a knit-contractor in the early '60s, after Yugoslavian-born 
Marie Gray spent $450 on a knitting machine and persuaded her future husband 
that selling her knits would finance their honeymoon. They launched the company 
in the San Fernando Valley garage of Bob Gray's mother. Today, St. John employs 
1,200 people and does all of its spinning, twisting, yarn dyeing and garment 
construction at six California factories. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer is known for its sleek, padded-shoulder dresses and jumpsuits, 
as well as two- and three-piece, classically styled knitwear. St. John produces 
under the St. John and Marie Gray Sportswear labels, with prices ranging from 
$400 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the firm reached $55 million for fiscal 1989 ended Oct. 31, up 27.9% 
from the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
St. John is Escada's third purchase since 1987, when the German firm acquired 
majority interests in two West German women's apparel firms. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 stores in the United States, Escada gives St. John the benefit of its 
marketing skill as well as the German company's expertise in identifying 
potential markets, said Lawrence C. DeParis, vice president of finance with 
Escada (USA) Inc., the American subsidiary in New York. "St. John without 
question will run very autonomously," DeParis said. But Escada "perhaps can 
help St. John with potential new lines or other expansion possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Escada produces three lines -- Escada, Laurel and Crisca -- with Escada making 
up more than half of Escada AG's total volume for fiscal 1989. The firm's 
merchandise can be found in the United States at such upscale stores as Saks 
Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus as well as its retail stores, none of which are 
on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
While no definite plans have been developed for new products, Gray suggested 
that a few years down the line, St. John could broaden its menswear line which 
now includes only men's sweaters, sleeveless vests and pullovers.

INDICATORS POINT TO SLOWDOWN IN OCTOBER

<P>
The government's chief economic forecasting gauge signaled a slowdown in 
October, but other evidence suggested that lower interest rates will keep the 
economy from toppling into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.4% drop in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators 
announced Friday fits in with the consensus among analysts that the final 
quarter of this year and the first three months of 1990 will see weak growth at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
"The indicators are telling us what they've been telling us for some time, and 
that is that the economy is continuing to expand, but at a slow rate," said 
economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
However, he and other analysts said a number of factors mitigated the 
unfavorable report. The decline followed two monthly gains; most of the 
weakness was concentrated in only two of the index's 11 forward-looking 
business statistics. 
</P>
<P>
And elements of the index and a separate report on October construction 
spending suggest that the Federal Reserve Board's cuts in interest rates since 
June are beginning to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Construction activity rose 1% in October, bolstered by the first gain in 
single-family construction in nine months, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the 11 indicators were positive. Building permits increased 2.8% and 
the nation's money supply, reflecting lower interest rates, expanded modestly. 
Other positive signs were a slight increase in prices of sensitive materials, 
indicating increased demand, and an upturn in business capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management, which tracks the 
economy through a monthly survey of its members, said Friday that the 
manufacturing economy weakened in November for the seventh straight month and 
at a faster pace than in September and October. 
</P>
<P>
October's overall drop in the leading indicators, which was expected by most 
economists, followed gains of 0.3% in September and 0.6% in August. Both gains 
were revised in the report to reflect a slightly better increase than earlier 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of 1989, the index has fallen five times, risen four 
times and remained unchanged in one month. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the index at 144.6% of its 1982 base of 100. That 
represents a 0.4% decline at an annual rate for the year so far, compared to a 
3.8% gain in the first 10 months of 1988.

WALL STREETERS ENDORSE PLAN TO LET BANKS SELL SECURITIES

Wall Street leaders declared an end on Friday to their lengthy battle to keep 
banks out of the stocks and bonds business, proposing to junk the law that has 
governed the nation's basic banking structure since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the Securities Industry Assn., at the trade group's annual 
convention here, endorsed a proposal for new legislation to let subsidiaries of 
banks "engage in a broad range of securities and securities-related 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the SIA said its plan would let brokers engage in consumer 
banking businesses and join banks in having access to the Federal Reserve's 
banking system, including the right to borrow from the Fed in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The move appears to herald one of the biggest breaks yet in the gradually 
crumbling wall separating banking and brokerage activities, erected by the 
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 amid the financial crisis that followed the stock 
market crash four years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The barrier has been weakened chink by chink in recent years, with the move 
toward financial deregulation.

GRADCO BUYOUT FAILS; FINANCING UNAVAILABLE 
</P>

Gradco Systems Inc. Chairman Keith B. Stewart, confirming Wall Street rumors, 
said Friday that his efforts to secure financing for a management buyout of the 
office equipment manufacturer have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco's stock tumbled for the second consecutive day, falling $1.625, or 
11.7%, to $12.25 a share. It was the third most actively traded 
over-the-counter stock, with more than 2.1 million shares changing hands -- 
about 10 times its average daily volume. On Thursday, Gradco's stock dropped 
$2.375 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the management group has been unable to round up financing for its 
proposed leveraged buyout of the world's largest supplier of collators and 
sorters for office copiers. But he said the group is continuing its efforts to 
raise money for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the widely reported changing environment in the financial markets 
with respect to leveraged transactions, among other factors, contributed to the 
decision" by lenders not to provide financing for the deal, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for leveraged buyouts all but dried up after the $6.75-billion buyout 
of UAL Corp., parent company of United Airlines, fell through in October. It 
prompted the Oct. 13 stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said Gradco is "engaged in discussions with a senior lender and we will 
be pursuing other sources for the subordinated financing." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones News Service, quoting unidentified Wall Street traders, reported 
that two Japanese firms that were expected to finance the deal -- Yasuda Trust 
and Yamaichi Securities -- have decided to proceed more slowly on the financing 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Gradco said that product shipments for the six months ending March 
31, 1990, will be lower than anticipated primarily due to delays in the 
introduction of several new products by Gradco's customers. Gradco is a 
supplier to most of the leading manufacturers of office copiers. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, Gradco's founder, originally announced in late September that he was 
trying to arrange financing for a buyout.

GUITARIST FEELS GOOD ABOUT MEAT PUPPETS' SOUND BUT LESS SO ABOUT THEIR STATURE; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: CURT KIRKWOOD IS CONCERNED THAT THE BAND HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND WHILE OTHER 
ALTERNATIVE-ROCK BANDS ARE BEING SNAPPED UP BY MAJOR LABELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
If anyone cares to drape the mantle of a rock guitar hero over Curt Kirkwood's 
shoulders, he isn't about to shrug it off with false modesty. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkwood's hot, varied guitar work is all over "Monsters," the new album by his 
band, the Meat Puppets. Sometimes, Kirkwood sandblasts a song with molten, 
metallic sound. Elsewhere, his multiple guitar lines form an elegant 
embroidery, full of light, glistening motion. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking over the phone recently from his home in Tempe, Ariz., where the Meat 
Puppets were getting ready for a tour that brings them to the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano on Sunday and to Bogart's in Long Beach on Monday, Kirkwood 
sounded like a six-string Muhammad Ali as he offered a self-assessment of his 
guitar credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think nobody can do it better now," he said. "I don't see any point in being 
modest about it. There isn't anybody around who does the stuff I do." 
</P>
<P>
But Kirkwood, 30, is willing to cut the other Meat Puppets -- drummer Derrick 
Bostrom and bassist Cris Kirkwood (Curt's younger brother) -- in on the credit. 
</P>
<P>
"The guitar playing is good, but it is in the context of the band that it's 
good," he said. "Because of these guys, I've been able to go out on a limb" as 
a songwriter and performer. 
</P>
<P>
A simple, impressionistic joyfulness animates a good deal of the Meat Puppets' 
music. It is there on "Monsters" with songs like "Light," which revels in the 
sheer dazzle of visual phenomena, and "Touchdown King," in which Kirkwood sings 
about a glowing figure who seems to be a cross between a gridiron hero and the 
winged god Mercury. Kirkwood said it wouldn't be off base to take the ebullient 
"Touchdown King" as an evocation of the feeling he gets when the Meat Puppets 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about a different kind of football," he said of the song. "If you're 
going to approach it from the way we play on stage, it's more like Flubber 
football. That's the substance they would put on their shoes (in the Walt 
Disney movies) and it would make them bounce real high." 
</P>
<P>
The Meat Puppets came to Orange County to put the bounce into "Monsters," 
recording the album last spring at For The Record Studio in Orange. Kirkwood 
said the band liked the rates, as well as the recording approach of Eric 
O'Brien Garten, the engineer who runs the studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent quite a bit of time in Orange County the past 10 years," Kirkwood 
said. "My dad and his family live there. I go to Disneyland quite a bit when I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
If Kirkwood is happy with the way he and the Meat Puppets sound these days, he 
is a good deal less content with the band's current station in the music 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1980, the Meat Puppets had emerged by 1985 as one of the most 
acclaimed bands on the alternative rock scene that sprang up in the early '80s 
with college radio as the main media outlet and small, independent record 
labels as the sole suppliers. The band was praised for songs that took on a 
desert-pastoral cast, with lyrical imagery and a spacious sound that evoked the 
natural wonder of their home territory in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
To go with that, the Meat Puppets developed a creaky but warm and 
innocent-sounding vocal harmony and an improvisational playing style that drew 
comparisons to the Grateful Dead. The Meat Puppets combined these lighter, more 
rustic elements with a penchant for turning into a power rock band that could 
crank out guitar onslaughts recalling the likes of Jimi Hendrix, ZZ Top and Led 
Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing has happened to the independent-alternative rock scene over 
the past few years: Much of it has gone big time, with major labels snapping up 
bands that came up through the independent ranks. Frequently, the independent 
labels themselves have been snapped up in mergers and partnership deals. 
</P>
<P>
The Meat Puppets, who have put out all of their albums since 1981 on the 
independent SST label, have watched such peers from the alternative scene as 
Husker Du , the Replacements and Sonic Youth sign deals with major labels. The 
major label connection almost invariably means that a band gets more time and 
money to record, and it can also bring more promotional firepower and radio 
exposure to bear in a band's behalf. It is a connection that so far has eluded 
the Meat Puppets. 
</P>
<P>
It was apparent from talking to Kirkwood that the band's continued existence as 
outsiders has left him with a tangle of uncertain feelings, ranging from pride 
about the band's ability to go on making its own style of music, to 
bewilderment that the Meat Puppets haven't been brought onto the big label fast 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkwood said it was easier to have a clear idea of the Meat Puppets' audience 
and the band's place in the scheme of things in early days, when the 
independent rock scene was a world apart from the mass marketing world of the 
major labels, and anything beyond a cult following seemed out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had more of a sense of where we were at and felt more comfortable," he 
said. "We didn't realize that the majors would usurp the whole little scene we 
had. These people with money stepped in and started taking all our peers away 
and made it much bigger than it was press-wise and record-wise, and we weren't 
included in that. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few bands that have had the kind of critical and cult success 
we have that are as unsuccessful in finance and record sales as we are. It's 
one of the premier dichotomies in rock 'n' roll. We still have to play these 
long tours in these cheesy RVs that fall apart. That 'Monster' album cost less 
than $10,000 to make. It's a technical masterpiece for that amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkwood said that "Monsters" had a chance of being picked up for distribution 
and promotion by a major label, but that SST vetoed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"The album is doing well, SST is doing a good job, but I think it would be 
something more special than it is" with a big label's muscle behind it, 
Kirkwood said. "It wound up costing the Meat Puppets an awful lot of money and 
publicity. I think it hurt the record in the long run. I don't blame the people 
at SST for thinking they could do a good job (without a major label's help), 
but on a certain level, reality has to step in." 
</P>
<P>
SST spokesman Ron Coleman said that the company's business philosophy calls for 
steering clear of alliances with major labels. "You're not an independent label 
when you hook up with a major label, because the major label holds your purse 
strings. We're an independent label. That's the beginning and end of it, and 
that's how we're always going to be." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Meat Puppets feel adrift in the music business right now, Kirkwood 
insists that the band has not lost any of its creative zest. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll is an all-consuming passion. It's a monster that demands that I 
do it," he said. "Anybody who plays guitar like I play, whether they're famous 
or not, is going to have a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 The Meat Puppets and Das Damen play Sunday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $13.50. Information: (714)

opera singer makes big emotional gestures in order to fill an opera house, the 
art singer is a miniaturist, alert to nuance, sophistication, understatement, 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
Among the few true art singers of our time must be counted Dutch soprano Elly 
Ameling, who will give a recital Sunday at 7 p.m. at South Coast Community 
Church in Irvine. Critics have heaped praises on Ameling's warmth and 
unaffected personality, her splendid technique and her fresh interpretations of 
a repertory that invariably delights connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
"Comparing art song to opera, people think, 'Ah, but opera is the real singing, 
and in art song, everything is often soft,' " Ameling said in a recent phone 
interview from Utah the day after her concert there. "That is not at all true. 
Take any song by Gabriel Faure. Within two bars, you have to go from piano to a 
double forte. And that is only Faure. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Art song is sung poetry, and the poetry is the whole reason why the art song 
was composed in the first place. There is finer detail and more attention to 
detail and coloring" in singing an art song," she said. "I think we do more 
coloring and are quicker within a phrase" than opera singers are. 
</P>
<P>
Ameling thinks that, although "we've been told (it) for 100 years," the size of 
the audience for song recitals is not diminishing. "Recitals are not at all 
becoming rarer," she said. "The only difference is that there are fewer people 
going to recitals than to opera. Opera is a thing for the big masses. Many 
people go there. Symphony concerts also attract more people than chamber music 
concerts. That is the difference, and it has always been like that." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Ameling will sing works by German and French composers, among them 
Schumann, Schubert, Ravel, Poulenc and Satie. 
</P>
<P>
She picked Schumann's "Frauenliebe und-leben" because it "is very sincere," she 
said. "It's almost the mirror of the love between Robert Schumann and (his 
wife) Clara Wieck. It's almost autobiographical." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she was not surprised to hear that some audiences find the text -- in 
which a woman expresses total devotion to a man -- too self-effacing and 
old-fashioned for current taste. "That is certainly true. But I am also 
convinced there are ladies today who do that for their lovers. They might not 
tell everybody . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she countered, the level of the poetry and the music overcomes these 
objections. "Schumann elevates the poetry to such a high level to express those 
feelings of warm love that we forget this idea of 'out of date.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, to provide some contrast, Ameling will sing Poulenc's "Fiancailles 
pour rire," another "cycle of a woman's songs but in totally different moods, 
all rather free-wheeling -- although there is some sadness here and there, 
especially in the second and last songs. It is very touching poetry. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is like most French music -- a lighter mood, there is not so 
much to worry as there is in the German Romantic nature. . . . Where do you 
find a German Romantic song that is not philosophic and only joyful? There are 
none." 
</P>
<P>
Also counterbalancing the heavy philosophy will be songs by Ravel and Satie's 
"Ludions". "This is just nonsense; kind of Dada," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ameling on Monday will conduct a master class at UC Irvine. She 
gives master classes, she said, if she can fit them into her schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Does she like to teach? "Yes and no." 
</P>
<P>
"When you give a recital, you sing your songs and give it all out. All your 
emotions that the music creates, you give right out to the audience. That's a 
one-way movement. But when I give a master class, they sing to you and you 
listen to how they sing, what they do right and what they do wrong. You have to 
take note of that in your mind. . . . Also, you try to (decide) what the singer 
can take for criticism, whether you can be forceful or because of the emotional 
state of the singer, more quiet and friendly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There are people you have to be extra careful with because singing lies very 
near to crying. Both are working from the diaphragm. One is controlled, and 
that is singing. And the other is uncontrolled, and that is sobbing. So you 
have to know how the possibilities are." 
</P>
<P>
She finds that many American vocal students lack a mastery of languages. 
</P>
<P>
"A Dutch singer will usually have much better languages for poetry that has to 
be sung than an Italian singer, but an Italian has better knowledge and ideas 
than an American," she said. "Singers here know very little German for the 
German lied and little French for the melodie. . . . That's the first problem 
that you always encounter in the United States. . . . "When you have to work so 
much on the language, you have to lose a lot of time before ever coming to the 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
"You do not have to be absolutely fluent" in the language, she added, "but you 
do have to have a good knowledge of the structure of the language as well as of 
the words." 
</P>
<P>
As for her own performing, she said she is booked through 1992, and she brushed 
away questions of slowing down. Now 55, she conserves her voice by scheduling 
recitals several days apart, and avoids giving interviews on the day of a 
concert. On days when she is to perform, she relaxes, lunches "as late as I 
can" and takes a nap. 
</P>
<P>
She may do "some vocalizing," she said. "It depends on how you feel. Just as 
with your legs; some days you're stiffer than others. That goes for the voice 
also." 
</P>
<P>
But if she does vocalize, she will not sing works on that night's program in 
order "to keep them as fresh as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Not that keeping them fresh is any problem for her. 'They only get more 
interesting," she said of the material. "You find new nuances to bring out -- 
inexhaustibly. That's really the heart of the matter . . . that keeps a source 
of joy, however often you have sung them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like seeing 100 times the same painting. There is something that is more 
than the sum of the parts, which is what we call the inspiration of it. You 
cannot give it a name. But it keeps you interested in it always." 
</P>
<P>
 Soprano Elly Ameling will sing works Sunday at 7 p.m. at South Coast Community 
Church, 5120 Bonita Canyon Drive, Irvine. Assisting will be pianist Rudolf 
Jansen. The recital is sponsored by UC Irvine. Tickets: $14. Information: (714) 
856-5000.

EXPERTS PUZZLED BY ABSENCE OF WOMEN IN MATH CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When mathematicians sifted through the latest results of the prestigious 
William Lowell Putnam college math contest, they saw glaring evidence of a 
phenomenon that has long puzzled and disappointed educators. 
</P>
<P>
Only one woman showed up among the 104 top finishers in the contest, open to 
college undergraduates. Nearly 2,100 students from 360 colleges and 
universities in North America competed in the 49th annual competition. 
</P>
<P>
The $5,000 top prize went to the Harvard University team, with lesser prizes to 
runners-up from Princeton and Rice, the American Mathematical Monthly reported. 
</P>
<P>
All those on the top teams were males, as were all those winning honorable 
mention. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that we worry about," said G.L. Alexanderson, a mathematics 
professor at Santa Clara University in California who helps run the Putnam 
contest for the Mathematical Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't know what we can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Women have traditionally fared worse than men on math exams -- and often better 
than men in tests of verbal skills -- and few women even enter the Putnam 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Mesirov, president of the MAA's Association for Women in Mathematics, 
nonetheless found the results not only "very disappointing" but symptomatic "of 
a larger disease (of mathematics weakness) more serious than the Putnam 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Mathematics professor Andrew Gleason of Harvard said the exam is composed of 
half-hour problems and that most of the problems in the real world take longer. 
</P>
<P>
He said members of Harvard's team had an edge in part because most were coached 
for similar exams in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Only about one-quarter of the math majors at Harvard are women, he said, but on 
average they do about as well at their studies as the men. 
</P>
<P>
Professor Loren Larson of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., who helps 
design questions for the Putnam, said the exam itself is not necessarily a 
guide to how well one will do as a mathematician. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had students who have gotten zero on the Putnam and gone to get PhDs at 
places like MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)," he said.

HANDWRITING PRO PUTS FINGER ON FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the rubber checks and forged contracts that handwriting expert James 
Black keeps in his files, there's a letter written in swirling script that 
reads: 
</P>
<P>
"I've been thinking about all those nights we spent in front of the fireplace 
in my apartment . . . Just six months until you're a daddy!" 
</P>
<P>
The wife who intercepted this romantic missive from her husband's mail hired 
Black to find out whether the writing belonged to a woman she suspected of 
having the affair. 
</P>
<P>
Black compared the note with writing samples the wife had pilfered from the 
suspected mistress. He concluded that the scripts did not match up, leaving the 
wife to search for a new scribe. 
</P>
<P>
As an "examiner of questioned documents," Black is more accustomed to dull 
business transactions that dangerous liaisons. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is usually pretty dry," Black says. "I don't see blood or gore. I see 
the writing." 
</P>
<P>
He works with seven police departments in Orange County and two in San 
Bernardino County detecting forgeries and fraud in documents. Most of the 1,200 
cases he handles a year involve bounced checks. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, though, Black will get an intriguing case, such as that of a 
young chemist and weightlifter from Fullerton accused of manufacturing steroids 
in his home. The chemist kept voluminous notes on each batch of steroids he 
concocted, rather like a Julia Child's of hormones. In a criminal court case, 
Black examined the cookbooks and identified the chemist as the author. 
</P>
<P>
In another drug-related case, Black was summoned by an attorney defending a 
woman who had been found by police locked inside her hotel room with a large 
amount of cocaine. The police also discovered an incriminating "buy and owe" 
sheet with the names of customers and how much they owed for the merchandise 
written in longhand. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she didn't know about the coke and the notes weren't written by her," 
Black says. 
</P>
<P>
Black compared the suspect's penmanship with the log and told the attorney he 
believed she had written the notes. At her attorney's suggestion, the woman 
pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Black works in his El Toro office, surrounded by the tools of his trade: a 
magnifying glass, microscope, copier and a computer that can enhance poor 
writing samples. His father, David, taught him the business 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he's handled thousands of civil and criminal cases as well as 
private disputes. 
</P>
<P>
He knows little about the cases stuffed in his files. His involvement is 
limited to issuing an opinion on whether a signature is forged. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, he's given checks written on accounts that have been closed or don't 
have enough money to cover the amount. 
</P>
<P>
"A checking account holder will deny having written the check. He'll claim his 
wallet was stolen, and who's to say otherwise? If the police suspect he's 
lying, they need the clout to say, 'You wrote a rubber check.' " 
</P>
<P>
Black gives them that clout. He compares the signature on the check with those 
on the account holder's bank application forms, driver's license and bank 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
"In a genuine forgery, the best I can do is rule out the account holder. It's 
harder to trace who wrote the forged signature," Black says. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, trace a cashier's check made out to cash for $1,000 to a 
high-ranking executive in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
To identify a forgery, Black studies the signatures under magnifying glass or 
microscope to see if they have all of the known characteristics of the true 
author's handwriting and no unknown characteristics. He'll look to see how the 
letters are formed, whether they're short or fat, round or square, straight or 
slanted. He'll study how the author crossed a "t" or dotted an "i." 
</P>
<P>
A forged signature usually lacks the spontaneity of a genuine John Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at your own signature. It flows. It has a naturalness. It's not halting 
or tremulous," Black says. 
</P>
<P>
"Forgeries are pictures of signatures. They're slow and shaky. The tremor of 
your deliberateness will be there" if you fake a signature. 
</P>
<P>
On one suspected forged check, for instance, he noticed three breaks between 
the letters of the first name and three more in the last. The account holder's 
known signatures contained just one break in each name, between the capital and 
small letters. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to studying penmanship, Black examines all kinds of documentary 
evidence, including the kind of paper used, the typed letters, the ink and even 
the staples. 
</P>
<P>
Black recently examined a will of an elderly woman who had left a generous sum 
to her live-in boyfriend. Her family thought the sum to be too generous, and 
called on Black to examine the will. 
</P>
<P>
The document was four pages long and typed. Black concluded that her boyfriend 
had used the same typewriter and paper to type up two different middle pages 
and substitute them in the will, "leaving him much richer." 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend had not counted on the original staples rusting. Nor did he count 
on a paper sleuth such as Black counting the rusty holes -- four in the first 
and last pages, but curiously, only two through the middle pages. 
</P>
<P>
He might have been a rich man, if the deceased had used a paper clip.
