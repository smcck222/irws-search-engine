Truer words were never printed than Holtzman's. There remains, however, one 
crucial factor to add to her list of reasons to support family planning: Global 
population is on the verge of tripling. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the population crisis more disastrous than in the United States, 
where each of the 1.5 million increased annual births impact the planet 60 
times as hard as those in underdeveloped countries. At a time when ecological 
emergencies abound, ignoring or discrediting the value of family planning is 
the most foolhardy attitude imaginable.

FISHING DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your Column One article ("Lure of Fishing Is Fading," Nov. 19), 
it is no mystery why California fishermen are giving up the sport. They are 
thoroughly disgusted with the Republican Administration which has made the 
Department of Fish and Game the enforcement arm of commercial fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
They see sportfishing license fees increase every year. Then this 
administration turns around and uses those collected revenues to rape and 
pillage the natural resources of this state for the benefit of the commercial 
despoilers and to the detriment of the outdoor-loving public. 
</P>
<P>
The public is tired of being robbed to enrich greedy commercial interests. They 
are refusing to pay these criminally high license fees that provide fewer and 
fewer recreational benefits to the public. Despite greater revenue, less is 
being spent each year for hatcheries and maintenance of wildlife recreational 
resources. Instead, these funds go increasingly to fund projects benefiting 
commercial interests. That is why there are decreasing numbers of fishing 
licenses bought each year.

COST OF WAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In The Times' special section (The Line in the Sand, Nov. 25) concerning the 
Mideast, (Desert Shield commander) Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf is quoted as 
saying, "We ought to think a little bit about what the cost is going to be. Not 
only to us, but to the enemy, too." 
</P>
<P>
Cost to the enemy? What does he think the situation is, a swap meet? Is he in 
the military or in the Peace Corps? I wonder what Gens. Eisenhower, MacArthur 
or Grant would have to say about that? 
</P>
<P>
If Schwarzkopf wants to cut costs on both sides, then he should challenge 
Saddam Hussein to a duel and hope that the best man wins. Or is he just another 
(Civil War Gen. George) McClellan?

THE EFFECT IS TO DENY MEDICAL SCIENCE A TOOL; 
</P>
<P>
BAN ON TESTING OF THE FRENCH ABORTION PILL IS ABSURD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington's effective ban on imports of a French-made steroid that can induce 
abortions is wrong. That's one issue. 
</P>
<P>
But there's another issue. That's banning imports for the purpose of further 
testing the drug RU-486 -- which shows great promise for treatment of some 
forms of cancer and other serious disorders. That's worse than wrong; it is 
heinous. 
</P>
<P>
In one preliminary test, for example, RU-486 -- also known as mifepristone -- 
reduced tumors in one of every five patients with advanced breast cancer that 
had not responded to such treatment as chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
THE BARRIERS: Yet politically motivated federal efforts to keep the drug out of 
this country are stalling research that could save countless lives. The 
presidential oath may be silent on curing disease, but the silence does not 
sanction interference with the responsibility of doctors under the Hippocratic 
oath. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush should order the federal Food and Drug Administration to sweep 
away any rulings that can even be interpreted as barriers to imports of the 
drug for research. Secretary Louis Sullivan's Department of Health and Human 
Services should use its influence to persuade the drug's European manufacturers 
that threats of retaliation by anti-abortion activists are not sufficient 
reason to continue to curtail exports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The drug is manufactured by Roussel-Uclaf of France, a German-owned 
pharmaceutical firm. It has been used without adverse effects by 65,000 women 
in France as an alternative to surgical abortion. Britain, Sweden and even the 
Soviet Union are either on the verge of approving use of RU-486, are using it 
in tests or are about to start tests. 
</P>
<P>
The vision that anti-abortion activists portray of abortion pills on every 
drugstore shelf is not even valid in France. It is a prescription drug that can 
be taken only in a clinic under medical supervision. Each pill is registered 
and must be accounted for. There is no reason to suppose that Roussel-Uclaf 
would make pills for export without similar restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1989, in an obvious attempt to appease the anti-abortion movement, the 
FDA put RU-486 on a short list of "import alert" drugs that cannot be brought 
into the country for personal use. Technically, researchers could apply for a 
license to import the drug for testing, but the alert has had such a chilling 
effect that no applications have been submitted since it was posted. 
</P>
<P>
THE CONSEQUENCES: The agency can argue, perhaps even brag, that its action is 
stopping abortions. But is it not also prompting some women to use other 
methods that are clearly more life-threatening than the professed concerns 
about profuse bleeding that the FDA used to justify the alert? 
</P>
<P>
Look at the list of other uses for RU-486 that the agency is blocking. Federal 
regulatory recalcitrance means, as we have noted, no tests of the drug on 
advanced breast cancers. The drug has also been effective in treatment of 
inoperable cases of meningioma, a non-malignant brain tumor, but that cannot 
even be tested in the United States. It shows promise as a drug for high blood 
pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, even AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
As Dr. William Regelson noted in an August issue of the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn.: "It is tragic that in this country 43,000 victims die of breast 
cancer each year, while abject surrender to abortion politics delays clinical 
studies that might help them." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and patients alike have a right to use RU-486 both as a safe 
alternative to surgical abortions and to explore its healing potential. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is a partner in medicine, certifying scientists' claims for their new 
drugs. As such, it shares the responsibility of physicians to provide help. In 
this case, the agency is hiding, not providing, and the White House must set it 
straight.

MCA BUYOUT BY JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The allusion, in your editorial "There They Go Again, Blaming Foreigners" (Nov. 
28), to Ronald Reagan's oft-spoken lament is all too appropriate. If, as you 
suggest, Americans' credit binges and poor savings habits have fostered foreign 
incursion into our economy, there are also several other contributory mistakes 
we have made as well. 
</P>
<P>
Two major ones have been the nation's past two presidential selections. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Town Hall Meeting in Los Angeles, T. Boone Pickens remarked, "Japan 
must abandon its keiretsu business practices before it can become a welcome 
participant in the global economy. Until that happens, these anti-competitive 
cartels are a wedge threatening to drive the U.S. and Japanese people apart." 
Pickens drew this conclusion after being insulted with epithetical references 
to the attack upon Pearl Harbor and being shouted down during the shareholders 
meeting of a Japanese manufacturing firm in which he holds a 26% interest. In 
order for our nation to compete, equitable rules must be negotiated and 
enforced by those "leaders" who shape our foreign and trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
If we Americans should not like what we see in the mirror, we similarly should 
be disgusted as we watch the former President accept millions as a mouthpiece 
for Japanese interests, and the current Administration prostrates itself along 
the Pacific Rim in order to keep the recession under wraps until after the next 
election. 
</P>
<P>
But far more unsettling is the specter of foreign dominance of one of our most 
important outlets for sociocultural expression, the motion picture industry. 
Perhaps it is not the film companies themselves over which control has been 
ceded; it may well be part or all of the First Amendment.

I would not worry about the sale of an American business to Japan.

<P>
The U.S. has plenty of foreign ownership all over Europe and elsewhere.

<P>
On my recent trip to France, I tried to buy some children's T-shirts with 
French writing on them. They were impossible to find but everywhere I found 
T-shirts from the U.S. Jeans, grocery products, cosmetics, etc. from America 
were available everywhere.

I must admit, they love everything American. Now it is our turn: Can we learn 
to love Japanese entertainment?

RAMS: L.A. BEATS CLEVELAND, 38-23, BUT TEAM KNOWS BETTER THAN TO GET OVERLY 
EXCITED ABOUT SUCCESS. 
</P>

<P>
Revived, relieved and reluctant to jinx their little run of success by 
recklessly predicting even greater things, the Rams Sunday settled into their 
first winning streak of the season calmly and without the normal chortles of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Having lived through their abysmal 3-7 start, they knew better. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody who has watched this team stagger into December knows better than to 
start plotting rosy playoff scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
Are they back? Are they the poltergeist of this weird NFL season, coming back 
to haunt the NFC contenders? Or is playing the curiously atrocious Cleveland 
Browns (2-10) merely a temporary cure for all ills? 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, after methodically dismantling the Browns, 38-23, all the 
Rams knew was that a 5-7 record is better than 4-8; and that a loss in a city 
that knows about wasted seasons would have been tantamount to throwing in the 
towel for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
They knew because Coach John Robinson, in the days leading up to this game -- 
and after the Rams' adrenaline-high victory over the San Francisco 49ers last 
Sunday -- told them so. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't beat the Browns.... 
</P>
<P>
 "What I was trying to say was that we've screwed this thing up pretty good 
before last Sunday," Robinson said. "This, now, is kind of a last chance to get 
back to being the kind of year that we want to feel proud of ourselves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If it's just going to be from the San Francisco game to the end of the year, 
that's what we're trying to do. If we reverted back to being the other kind of 
football team today, then that would've been really tough for us in terms of 
just our self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' self-respect was safe almost from the outset on Sunday, but it 
appeared that the Browns' might be a lost cause. The Ram offense, after 
tailback Cleveland Gary's third fumble in as many games, jumped out early and 
hard, and the Browns' defense did not have the talent, scheme or heart to 
respond. The Browns have lost seven in a row and show signs that seven might 
turn into 11. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett, who had thrown only one touchdown pass in his last 
five games and who declared his team out of the playoff hunt three weeks ago, 
threw four against the Browns -- who, oddly, found no reason to cover the Ram 
running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who was 22 for 29 for 261 yards, retired his crystal ball and threw 
his team's fate into the chill Ohio wind. It was a day for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before that I thought we were out of the playoff picture," Everett 
said. "But if something happens and we're in it, great. If not, we know that it 
was what we did early in the season that kept us out of it." 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams do poke their heads back into playoff contention, it was clear 
Sunday that the offense will have to take them there. 
</P>
<P>
They stirred memories -- particularly of those Everett-led shoot-'em-ups of a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are starting to roll for us," said tailback Gaston Green, who got the 
bulk of action after Gary's fumble and used the opportunity to run for 57 yards 
on 13 carries, catch a 16-yard touchdown pass and generally impress anyone who 
has seen him stand on the Ram sideline his whole career. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Rams gained 411 yards, made seven of 11 third-down tries, held the 
ball for 36:38 and gained an average of 6.5 yards each offensive play. They ran 
for 150 yards to set up the pass. They passed to score. And their defense had 
to hold on. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of offense we think we are," Robinson said, "or thought we 
were going into this season. We have been sporadic offensively, and after that 
first fumble, we executed things pretty darn well today. That's kind of what we 
anticipated our team being. We're pretty hard to stop when we get that kind of 
a thing going." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland started the day in proper fashion when punt returner Brian Brennan 
muffed Keith English's short punt right into the hands of Ram safety Pat 
Terrell. But Gary fumbled right after that, and thoughts of a true football 
Titanic were in order. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams capitalized on a big Darryl Henley punt return with a 30-yard Mike 
Lansford field goal and a 3-0 lead. Cleveland tied it on the next possession, 
but then the Rams revved up the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Pete Holohan scored the first touchdown on a fourth-and-goal 
touchdown pass from Everett inches from the goal line to culminate a 12-play, 
65-yard drive. It was Everett's first touchdown pass in four games, and after a 
tough goal-line stand, the play seemed to deflate an already rattled Brown 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Green capped the second drive with an easy 16-yard scoring reception when 
nobody covered him in the right flat. Ram running backs, who caught eight 
passes and scored on three of them, seemed to be open every time Everett wanted 
them to be. The Browns' linebackers blitzed a lot to try to stir up the 
intensity, but that simply made it easier for the backs to get open. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to be thankful we have a chance to go play again," Brown Interim 
Coach Jim Shofner said. "We have a chance to play somebody and play better than 
we played. That's the only way you can look at it." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' defense began to find out why Cleveland offense has struggled all 
season long. Linebacker Kevin Greene, who had three sacks, stormed in on Brown 
quarterback Bernie Kosar on consecutive plays in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had about four or five three-sack days," Greene said. "When I feel right, 
they start to come." 
</P>
<P>
On the first one, he hit Kosar clean from the blind side, popping the ball 
loose. It wasn't ruled a fumble, but it set the tone. 
</P>
<P>
On the Rams' first possession of the second half, they nearly put the game away 
with an eight-play, 67-yard touchdown drive straight through the Browns' 
defense. Everett was four for five, and at one point hit on three consecutive 
passes for 15, 18 and 15 yards. The last two were to receiver Henry Ellard, 
pushing him past Hall of Famer Tom Fears and making him the Rams' all-time 
receptor with 401 career catches. Ellard finished with six catches and 402 in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd of 61,981 murmured its obvious disapproval with the 24-3 score, 
the Browns showed a little life by scoring a touchdown on their next drive. But 
the resurgence was temporary. 
</P>
<P>
Everett found Robert Delpino drifting free down the left side of the field for 
a 21-yard touchdown and a 31-10 Ram lead a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the "Jump Art/2-14" balloon floated around the stadium in front of 
much-loathed Brown owner Art Modell's box, and the message got the most rousing 
response of the windy day. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-play, 70-yard drive, resulting in a three-yard dump pass from Kosar to 
fullback Kevin Mack, cut the lead. But The Rams came back with one last 
touchdown, Everett throwing his fourth of the day, 10 yards to McGee. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will play the Saints Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think New Orleans is a very good team, had a start something like ours and 
now is rolling along pretty good," Robinson said. "I think that's going to be a 
big game." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams deactivated tight end Damone Johnson and receiver Aaron Cox, both of 
whom have hamstring injuries. Pat Carter started in Johnson's place and running 
back Robert Delpino often was used as the team's third wideout. . . . Ram 
injuries listed: cornerback Bobby Humphery (lower back) and safety Michael 
Stewart (concussion).

RAIDERS RECEIVE A BIG HAND, BLOCK BRONCO RALLY, 23-20;

PRO FOOTBALL: SCOTT DAVIS DEFLECTS FIELD-GOAL ATTEMPT WITH SEVEN SECONDS TO

<TEXT>
<P>
In the end, Scott Davis raised his right hand and stopped another John Elway 
comeback. And maybe saved the Raiders' season. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a hand. Davis presented all five digits to reporters afterward as 
Exhibit A, identified the spot where the ball deflected, and rejoiced his body 
part in the Raiders' 23-20 victory over the Denver Broncos before 74,162 at 
Mile Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It looked like an ordinary hand, but if Davis doesn't stick his in the wind to 
block David Treadwell's 41-yard attempt that would have sent the game to 
overtime with seven seconds to play, the Raiders are maybe looking for playoff 
handouts. 
</P>
<P>
What might have been lost here after taking a 10-point lead with 4:18 left was 
difficult for Raiders to imagine: falling to 7-5 after 8-4 seemed a lock; 
wasting Bo Jackson's 117 rushing yards and a brilliant 62-yard fourth-quarter 
burst to touchdown; the memories of an ensuing blocked extra-point attempt that 
ended up staring the Raiders in the face as the Broncos lined up for the 
game-tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"All sorts of things raced through my mind," Davis said. "How it would have 
affected our season. Maybe that's what sparked us." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Davis came through with the last amount of effort he could muster 
after battling a bad case of flu, a windchill factor of eight degrees, the 
elusive legs of Elway and mile-high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think I got off the ground," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis lined up to the right of center, and said he charged in behind the push 
of Todd Peat, who was head-up over center. Davis didn't remember much after 
that. Bronco quarterback Gary Kubiak made a good placement of a high snap. 
</P>
<P>
Davis: "Is that what it was, a high snap?" 
</P>
<P>
Treadwell said he hit the ball square. When he kicked it, the game was tied -- 
in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It just never made it past the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elway or no Elway, the game seemed over with 4:18 left when Jeff Jaeger's 
46-yard field goal put the Raiders up 23-13. 
</P>
<P>
What else did the Broncos have left on the way to 3-9? 
</P>
<P>
Plenty, it turned out. Elway drove the Broncos' 80 yards in eight plays and 
1:49, capping the drive with an eight-yard scoring pass to Michael Young with 
2:29 remaining to cut the lead to three. 
</P>
<P>
Elway turned back the pages on this one, completing four of five pass attempts 
for 47 yards and rushing two other times for 29 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like the neighborhood kid," defensive end Howie Long. "He runs 5.2 when 
he runs. He runs about 4.8 when he's being chased." 
</P>
<P>
But could Denver get the ball back? They could. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders faced third and two at their own 28 with 1:47 left. Denver used its 
second time out. The game's over if the Raiders convert. Quarterback Jay 
Schroeder, who showed no effects of a sprained knee suffered last week, threw 
in the left flat to tight end Ethan Horton, who came within an inch of a first 
down. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders broke huddle on fourth down with the first unit, but it turned out 
to be a ploy to draw the Bronco defense offside. Kansas City used the 
hard-count to draw the Raiders offsides six times last week. Too bad the 
Raiders weren't going against their own defense. 
</P>
<P>
Denver held strong, and the Raiders were forced to punt. The Broncos got the 
ball back at their own 40 with 1:29 left. They were without timeouts, but not 
without hope. On first down, Elway threw deep to the left sideline for Vance 
Johnson, who was ruled out of bounds on what would have been a 27-yard 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the days before instant replay. Officials in the booth reviewed the 
play and ruled correctly that Johnson had actually made a legal catch by 
dragging his second foot across the sideline border. 
</P>
<P>
Opinions on instant replay, of course, run strong. 
</P>
<P>
"If it doesn't go in my favor, I don't like it," Raider linebacker Jerry 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Long likens instant replay to one of his favorite game shows. 
</P>
<P>
"That replay thing is kind of like asking for Door No. 1 or Door No. 2." Long 
said. "You open up Door No. 1 and a hammer hits you in the head. You just kind 
of stand there and it's like guessing which door. Why bother. I remove myself 
emotionally from instant replay." 
</P>
<P>
For Denver, it was a reversal of fortune. The Broncos found themselves with 
first down at the 33 with 1:23 remaining. Things were going well. A 
game-winning touchdown beckoned, but the Broncos made it just 10 yards further 
in the next minute, thanks to some interesting runs to the middle of the field 
from the team with no time outs remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders were saved from explaining away a loss that might have cost 
them the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't lose, so you can answer those questions," Robinson said. "We let 
them back in the game. It would have been really difficult to live with had 
they won the football game." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said it was a typical Raider finish. "As long as I've been here, the 
Raiders have never done things easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was no different. It appeared the Raiders might dominate after 
countering an early Denver field goal with a 13-play, 73-yard drive that ended 
in a four-yard scoring run by Steve Smith. The story on the march was the 
performance of Schroeder, who seemed a knee sprain away from being yanked from 
the starting lineup earlier this week. But remember that message drive in 
Miami, when the Raiders ran the ball eight consecutive times on their first 
drive? 
</P>
<P>
Well, this was a message in support of Schroeder, who was six-for-six on the 
drive for 74 yards. With the winds swirling, the Raiders played ball control 
through the air and used up 9:07 in the process. 
</P>
<P>
But a 7-3 was erased before halftime on a 21-yard scoring pass from Elway to 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders regained the lead in the third quarter after cornerback Terry 
McDaniel intercepted Elway's pass at the Denver 28. Two plays later, Bo Jackson 
scored the first of two touchdowns on an 11-yard scoring run with 8:53 left in 
the quarter, and then he scored again with 9:08 left, breaking three Bronco 
tackles on his 62-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who carried only two times in the first half, finished with 117 yards 
in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders used their last free roster move Sunday to activate tight end Mike 
Dyal from injured reserve. To make room, the team released defensive lineman 
Mike Charles. The move means that running back Greg Bell must spent the rest of 
the regular season on injured reserve. Bell has been on injured reserve since 
Oct. 20 with an ankle sprain, but he's been ready to return for weeks. The 
Raiders, however, have been playing with one tight end, Ethan Horton, and Coach 
Art Shell decided it was too much of a gamble. "I've been 100% for three or 
four weeks," Bell said after the game. "I'm ready to play. But I can't be 
bitter. Bitter is when you're not being treated fairly, where somebody is 
trying to spite you. I'm happy where I'm at." . . . Quarterback Jay Schroeder 
still hasn't thrown a touchdown pass since Oct. 21, but he did complete 16 of 
23 passes Sunday for 164 yards with no interceptions. Instead of trying to 
throw long, Schroeder opted for a short-passing game to Willie Gault, who had 
nine catches for 99 yards.

CLIPPERS' DOWNSHIFT KEEPS PACE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THEY REACH .500 BY SLOWING TEMPO THEY PLAYED AGAINST DENVER TO 
BEAT MINNESOTA.

<P>
From mile high to practically sea level, from speedway to pedestrian, from one 
time zone to another, the Clippers' weekend of contrast ran the gamut of NBA 
styles. And walked it. 
</P>
<P>
"A total turn around," Bo Kimble said. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no U-turns for the Clippers, who simply played well under both 
circumstances. The switch from playing at Denver to the slow-down style of 
Minnesota within about 24 hours went off without a hitch, the 102-77 victory 
over the Timberwolves Sunday night at the Sports Arena the best proof. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith, who scored 52 points against the Nuggets, slumped all the way to 
26 on 12-of-19 shooting, with 14 rebounds. But there were others who picked up 
the slack as the Clippers returned to .500, most prominently Kimble with 27 
points. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest showing of all was that the Clippers (8-8) played the 
transition game at its best in going from Denver's style to Minnesota's and 
stuck to their own course both times. One night, they stayed away from the 
running game, the next the half-court molasses offense. Both were success 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
"That's two straight nights we played outstanding team defense," Coach Mike 
Schuler said. "We really played well at that end of the court, which enabled us 
to get some easy baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we did extremely well. We didn't change our game plan, our attack, 
from what we wanted to do. Tonight, we had six or seven one-pass shots, when we 
would dribble down and shoot. They (the players) weren't told not to do that, 
whereas last night they were. Our game plan was to run, get out and go." 
</P>
<P>
Off they went in the second quarter, holding Minnesota, which came in with the 
second-best defense in the league at 97.1 points allowed an outing, scoreless 
for a span of 5:51 to turn a 32-28 lead into 43-28. That's the last the 
Timberwolves saw of a game. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't the largest Clipper cushion. That came in the third quarter, when 
Loy Vaught's two-foot hook with 1:21 left made it 77-55. It took the 
Timberwolves (5-11) the rest of the game just to make that up. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a lot of layups," said Minnesota guard Pooh Richardson, who had 12 
points and 10 assists, second to Tony Campbell's 20 for team-high scoring 
honors. "I thought they did a great job of breaking out and getting those 
shots. When they did have half-court sets, they made most of those thanks to 
rebounds and second-effort baskets." 
</P>
<P>
A bigger key early on was Kimble, who began play in a 12 for 32 slump the 
previous three games. By halftime, he had 21 points, already just one shy of 
his season best, and had made seven of 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He really came out tonight and asserted himself," Schuler said. "That was good 
to see. I think he had been playing a little tentatively lately." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble merely followed the game plan. He stayed away from passive play. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I was trying to make things happen every time I got it (the ball), 
whether for the team or me," he said. "I knew I would have a good game. 
</P>
<P>
"The first couple of games, I wasn't taking the shots I normally take. That's 
all part of the adjustment process that takes time. But tonight was totally 
different. I wasn't going to hesitate at all." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. The same could be said for the Clippers, who continued moving 
forward despite a weekend of turn arounds. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper, continuing his comeback from knee surgery, rejoins the Clippers for 
practice today, although he doesn't expect a full workout. "Let's call it an 
orientation," he said. Early January is still the most likely return time. . . 
. Danny Manning, working into shape after missing seven consecutive games 
because of tendinitis in a knee, had his time limit increased from 20 to 25 
minutes. . . . Barry Hecker, the Clippers' director of scouting, said he is not 
interested in leaving the organization to join the Minnesota Timberwolves. He 
has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Billy McKinney, who resigned 
Thursday, as director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman missed his fifth game on the injured list because of a sprained left 
ankle, meaning he is eligible to be activated for the next game, Wednesday 
against Dallas at the Sports Arena. He was examined before the game by team 
physician Dr. Tony Daly and given clearance to begin practice today. "It (the 
ankle) looked absolutely normal," Daly said. "A lot of times when you start 
pounding again, you get a little puffiness. But I don't expect any problems." . 
. . By going 6-8, the Clippers tied the team record for most November victories 
since coming to Los Angeles. They also won six in the opening month of 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith dived into the second row to save a ball during the second 
quarter and emerged with his right elbow covered with nacho cheese. That was 
mild compared to the lady who was eating the food one minute and wearing it the 
next. Smith tied the franchise single-game scoring record Saturday at Denver 
despite his last points coming on a pair of free throws with 1:29 remaining. 
The disappointment of not breaking the mark set twice by Bob McAdoo in 1976 
could have been worse -- Coach Mike Schuler was set to take Smith out of the 
game when he heard trainer Keith Jones mention the possibility of a record with 
26 seconds left. Schuler made a quick switch with Loy Vaught already at the 
scorer's table to check in and removed Manning instead. That was the only 
sideline help Smith was going to get, however, to break the mark. "With two 
minutes to go, we were only up by seven," Schuler said. "I'm not going to do 
anything extra creative to get him the ball. If I did, it would have been to 
win the game, not set a record."

When Georgetown played Southern Indiana Saturday, the attraction wasn't so much 
the team competition as the matchup between Hoya center Dikembe Mutombo and his 
older brother, Ilo. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Georgetown had little trouble defeating its Division II opponent, 
65-45, and the brother-brother battle might have been a draw. 
</P>
<P>
Ilo had 12 points and 11 rebounds, Dikembe six and nine. Dikembe blocked five 
shots, including two attempts by Ilo. 
</P>
<P>
A sentimental occasion? Georgetown Coach John Thompson wasn't having any of it. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson told Mark Maske of the Washington Post: "I predicted Dikembe would not 
have a great game. I told my staff before the game, 'I bet Dikembe stinks.' 
That kind of stuff never has a storybook ending."

AFC: COACH FAILS TO GET HIS 200TH REGULAR-SEASON VICTORY AS STEELERS FAIL TO 
SCORE A TOUCHDOWN.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Noll was trying to become the fifth coach in NFL history to win 200 
regular-season games, but the Cincinnati Bengals still have his number. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals overcame three turnovers with a ball-control offense and a late 
goal-line stand, holding Noll's Pittsburgh Steelers without a touchdown for the 
second time this season for a 16-12 victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three weeks that the Bengals defeated the Steelers 
and the sixth consecutive time over three seasons. The Bengals haven't lost in 
Pittsburgh since 1987 and have won seven of their last 11 visits to Three 
Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we have so much success against them," offensive tackle 
Anthony Munoz said. "I guess it's because every game against them is a big one 
and the coaches always seem to come up with a good game plan. Every game we 
play Pittsburgh, we're sky high for them." 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Cincinnati (7-5) a one-game lead over the Steelers and Houston 
Oilers in the AFC Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh fans got plenty of chances to cheer in the final three minutes, but 
the Steelers failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh drove to a first-and-goal at the Bengals' seven, but Bubby Brister 
threw four consecutive incompletions, the last when he couldn't hit an open 
Eric Green on fourth and 12. 
</P>
<P>
"He was open," Noll said. "(Bubby) overthrew a few people. Bubby didn't play a 
good game, it wasn't one of Bubby's better games. I don't know if anybody can 
stand up and say they played well." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers got the ball back once more after Cincinnati, held scoreless in 
the second half, punted. But rookie Mitchell Price picked off Brister's pass 
for Dwight Stone at the Bengals' seven with 1:17 to play for his first career 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great effort by a defense under siege," said Bengal Coach Sam Wyche, 
who is 10-4 against Pittsburgh. "It wasn't decided by fortune, luck, 
officiating or the weather. But nothing's been decided yet in the division." 
</P>
<P>
Brister, who completed 18 of 40 passes for 234 yards and an interception, said: 
"It's not over. If we win the rest of our games, we're 10-6 and that might be 
good enough to win the division. But everybody is angry. I'm angry, Chuck's 
angry, the whole team's angry. We had too many opportunities to win." 
</P>
<P>
A big defensive play also keyed Cincinnati in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals sacked Brister in the end zone for a second-quarter safety that 
made the score 9-6, then drove 63 yards in 12 plays over the next 7:01 after 
the ensuing free kick. 
</P>
<P>
James Brooks scored from the seven behind Bruce Reimers' trap block with 30 
seconds left for a 16-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Breech missed second-half field goals of 34 and 45 yards, but the Bengals' 
defense, ranked 26th in the NFL, again held Pittsburgh without a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals won, 27-3, in Cincinnati Nov. 18 and haven't allowed the Steelers a 
touchdown in 11 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks ended a streak of three consecutive 100-yard games against Pittsburgh, 
but had 81 yards in 20 carries as the Bengals out-rushed Pittsburgh, 165-79. 
</P>
<P>
Boomer Esiason threw only 14 times, completing eight for 165 yards as the 
Bengals constantly ran the play clock down to two or three seconds before 
snapping the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to take the crowd out of the game," Esiason said. "We wanted to be 
methodical. They're not going to stand there and yell for 45 seconds every 
play." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers' Gary Anderson, with four field goals, now has 202 in his 
nine-year career. He has made 49 in a row inside the 35-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The four-point margin was the first Steelers' game this season to be decided by 
fewer than 10 points.

VIKINGS IMPRESSIVE IN FIFTH STRAIGHT WIN; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: CARTER SCORES ON 56-YARD FLEA-FLICKER PLAY TO KEY 23-7 VICTORY OVER THE 
PACKERS.

<P>
The Minnesota Vikings struck quickly in the third quarter Sunday and stayed in 
the hunt for a playoff berth with a 23-7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Anthony Carter highlighted a 17-point outburst by scoring on a 
56-yard flea-flicker play that helped the Vikings (6-6) get their fifth 
consecutive victory and pull even with the Packers (6-6) in the NFC Central. 
Green Bay's loss clinched the division title for the Chicago Bears (10-2). 
</P>
<P>
The Packers took a 7-6 lead three minutes into the third quarter when Tiger 
Greene blocked Harry Newsome's punt then grabbed the ball and ran 36 yards for 
a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
A 41-yard field goal by Fuad Reveiz put the Vikings ahead, up 9-7 with 2:57 
</P>
<P>
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota forced a punt and, on the next play, Viking quarterback Rich Gannon 
handed off to Herschel Walker, who pitched back to the quarterback. Gannon 
heaved the ball downfield even though Mark Lee had tight coverage on Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Carter leaped and tipped the ball away from Lee and, as he was falling into the 
end zone, grabbed the ball for a 16-7 lead with 54 seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Carter made a similar catch, also a 56-yarder, to key a 27-22 victory over 
Denver in the game that launched Minnesota's winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if another receiver can make that catch," Gannon said. "In fact, 
I didn't think anybody could make that catch and I have a hard time thinking 
that A.C. could make that catch again." 
</P>
<P>
On the Packers' possession after Carter's catch, Anthony Dilweg was sacked by 
Al Noga, who knocked the ball away from the quarterback and recovered in the 
end zone with three seconds left in the third quarter. That capped Minnesota's 
17-point spree in a 2:54 span. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, only Green Bay's second in its last eight games against Minnesota, 
ended a three-game winning streak. The Packers are seeking their first playoff 
berth in a non-strike season since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to be two games ahead of these guys but now we're tied," 
Green Bay Coach Lindy Infante. "We took a step backward but we're not out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings appeared to be out of it five weeks ago, when their fifth straight 
loss dropped them to 1-6. Only the 1970 Cincinnati Bengals have made the 
playoffs after a 1-6 start. Instead, the Vikings have hopes of making their 
fourth consecutive postseason appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg, playing for injured Don Majkowski, threw three interceptions, fumbled 
twice and was sacked five times for 41 yards.

COWBOYS MARCH PAST SAINTS, 17-13;

NFC: AIKMAN DIRECTS TWO 80-YARD SCORING DRIVES IN SECOND HALF TO OUTSHINE 
FORMER DALLAS TEAMMATE WALSH.

<P>
Quarterback Troy Aikman continues to prove that the Dallas Cowboys made a wise 
decision when they traded Steve Walsh to the New Orleans Saints in September. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman outplayed Walsh Sunday in a duel of Dallas first-round draft picks as 
the Cowboys kept alive their hopes for a wild-card playoff berth with a 17-13 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 15 of 21 passes for 177 yards and directed two 80-yard 
touchdown drives in the second half to help the Cowboys (6-7) beat the Saints 
at Texas Stadium for the eighth consecutive time and score back-to-back home 
victories for the first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman had no passes intercepted for the first time in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy was just excellent," said Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson, who made the 
decision to trade Walsh, the quarterback who won a national title for him at 
the University of Miami. "Troy made some great plays against an outstanding 
rush." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed 18 of 27 passes for 177 yards for the Saints (5-7). 
</P>
<P>
But Aikman, who beat out Walsh in training camp, completed all 11 of his passes 
in the second half, including a five-yard scoring pass to Darryl Johnston for 
the go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough putting the duel with Steve out of my mind, but I just took a 'I 
don't care attitude,' " Aikman said. "Steve and I spoke before the game. I 
think he played well, hitting some key passes." 
</P>
<P>
Said New Orleans Coach Jim Mora: "I was very disappointed in our defense in the 
second half. We didn't play to our potential." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas cut a 10-0 halftime deficit to three points when Aikman connected with 
Kelvin Martin on a 45-yard pass play to set up a one-yard touchdown run by 
Emmitt Smith on the first possession of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas also got a 47-yard field goal from rookie Ken Willis with 53 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"That helped because New Orleans had to drive the length of the field without 
any timeouts," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The field goal came after Mora had decided to punt on fourth and 10 from the 
Dallas 38 with 3:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could hold Dallas and get the ball back," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
Saint kicker Morten Andersen said he thought he could have made what would have 
been a 55-yard attempt. He had kicked a 50-yard field goal earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to second-guess the coach's decision," Andersen said. "He wanted 
to punt. It would have been a longshot, but I feel I could have hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh guided the Saints on a 13-play, 89-yard drive in the second quarter. 
Passes of 22 yards to Gill Fenerty and 13 yards to Floyd Turner set up a 
15-yard scoring run by Rueben Mayes, who rushed for 59 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Smith gained 85 yards in 20 carries for the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, which was sweet revenge for a 28-0 loss to New Orleans last year 
in Jimmy Johnson's NFL coaching debut, marked the first back-to-back home 
victories for Dallas since 1985.

BUCCANEERS END LOSING STREAK AT 6;

<P>
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers ended a six-game losing streak with a 23-17 victory 
over the Atlanta Falcons. That's all that mattered to Ray Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of ugly, but I really don't care," the Buccaneer coach said Sunday 
after Vinny Testaverde teamed up with Mark Carrier on a 35-yard touchdown pass 
play with 39 seconds left to hand the Falcons their 17th consecutive loss on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We made lots of mistakes, but it was awfully beautiful at the end," Perkins 
said. "We played with more intensity and more belief that we could win than in 
the last six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde completed 17 of 33 passes for a season-high 351 yards against the 
NFL's worst pass defense. Tampa Bay's offense had its most productive day in 
eight weeks with Willie Drewrey scoring on an 89-yard reception and Steve 
Christie kicking field goals of 39, 44 and 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have scored a lot more points," said Perkins, whose team had scored 
only 53 during the six-game slide that prompted fans to call for the coach's 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know whether this takes the pressure off anything, and I don't 
care," Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat was the fifth in a row for Atlanta (3-9), which hasn't won on the 
road since Nov. 20, 1988. Adding to the Falcons' frustration was the loss of 
quarterback Chris Miller, who suffered a broken collarbone in the third quarter 
and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers (5-8) intercepted three of Miller's passes before he was injured 
after scrambling out of the end zone to the Atlanta 11, where Keith McCants 
made a diving tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Campbell replaced Miller and the Atlanta offense responded positively. 
Campbell completed his first five passes for 51 yards to sustain the drive, and 
the Falcons went ahead, 14-13, on Mike Rozier's nine-yard run. The drive took 
nearly nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's third field goal gave Tampa Bay a 16-14 lead with 10:03 to go, but 
Campbell held his composure, Rozier continued to run effectively, and the 
Falcons came back to regain a one-point lead on a 46-yard field goal by Greg 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott Campbell did a good job moving the ball," Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville 
said. "He gave us a chance to win."

DESPITE FATIGUE, TRAIL BLAZERS WIN

The Portland Trail Blazers ignored fatigue and outlasted the Utah Jazz, 101-97, 
Sunday night at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
While the Jazz spent Saturday night resting in Portland, the Trail Blazers 
battled through three overtimes at Seattle before pulling out a 130-124 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
They arrived home early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
With players such as Karl Malone and gigantic Mark Eaton, Utah is one of the 
NBA's more physical teams. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trail Blazers are showing signs of greatness. While improving the best 
record in the league to 14-1, they ended the Jazz's five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Buck Williams, who played only 41 minutes of the 63 minutes in the triple 
overtime, had a season-high 23 points and 11 rebounds and Terry Porter, who had 
38 points at Seattle, sank a three-pointer in the last minute to clinch the 
win. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers showed signs of fatigue and they had to overcome a 
magnificent game by Karl Malone, who had 36 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers led most of the game, but seldom by more than four or five points. 
Porter scored 10 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter, getting a basket both 
times after Utah cut the lead to a point. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 107, Milwaukee 103 -- The Pacers seemed headed for their fifth 
consecutive defeat when they fell behind the Bucks, 26-12 in the first eight 
minutes at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
But Chuck Person and Reggie Miller rallied the Pacers and by halftime, they 
held a 58-46 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The next surge was the Bucks and they pulled ahead 102-101. But in the last 20 
seconds both Person and Miller sank two free throws to give the Pacers the 
victory. DAN HAFNER

One man's prediction of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault from Illinois 
to Mississippi will prove to be a total non-event, a geologist said. 
</P>
<P>
But many residents waited anxiously for today to come and go, the day New 
Mexico climatologist Iben Browning said was the most likely for a quake. 
Skeptics partied to music like "Shake, Rattle and Roll" and ordered Jell-O for 
dessert so they could watch it wiggle. Seth Stein, chairman of the Northwestern 
University Geology Department, joined a long list of experts rejecting 
Browning's prediction: "I'll state it as clearly as I can: Browning's 
prediction has been evaluated and determined to be complete nonsense, without 
scientific foundation -- which is our jargon for: 'It's a crock.' "

The National Weather Service has fallen short of its mission to warn the public 
of savage weather that claims more than 400 lives and causes $6 billion in 
damage every year, a newspaper reported. The federal agency misses two-thirds 
of all tornadoes, three-fifths of all flash floods and 40% of severe 
thunderstorms every year, the Cleveland Plain Dealer said. The newspaper said 
its investigation was based on weather service internal computer records and 
other data.

at the 36-minute, 40-second mark. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 100th goal of the season for East Los Angeles (25-0), which outshot 
Moorpark 20-14. Zemansky had six saves.

Anthony Miller was a happy guy. He had just caught his first touchdown pass 
since Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
So he threw the ball in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
And then a fan dropped it. So he threw it back again. 
</P>
<P>
That cost him $500. NFL rules.

<P>
"I saw somebody up in the stands, so I thought I'd toss it to them," Miller 
said after the Chargers' victory over the New York Jets Sunday. "I heard it 
costs $200, and now I hear it costs $500. So that's the last time I do that." 
</P>
<P>
After he did it, the referee threw a flag and said a five-yard penalty for 
demonstration would be assessed on the ensuing kickoff. A minute later, the 
referee changed his mind and told Charger Coach Dan Henning that Miller would 
be fined but there would be no penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"For some unusual reason," Henning said, "the demonstration penalty is based on 
the judgment of the officials as to whether it was preconceived, which is 
silly. You've got to get in the guy's head. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Anthony's been figuring this out for three weeks because he hasn't had a 
touchdown in a while. If it were me, I'd have given him a five-yard penalty 
because I think he said somewhere along the line: 'I'm going to throw that 
(ball) in the seats when I get it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Henning was asked to confirm the amount of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Five hundred dollars, I think," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out that Miller had thrown the ball in the stands twice. Does 
that make it $1,000? 
</P>
<P>
"One ball is worth 500 dollars," Henning responded.

LEWIS ON RECEIVING END OF ACCOLADES 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nate Lewis had quite a day Sunday for the Chargers, but first let's clear this 
up. 
</P>
<P>
On the final touchdown of this 38-17 victory over the New York Jets at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, the one he scored from 10 yards out on a receiver 
misdirection run, what was the deal? Did Lewis really cross the goal line? It 
sure didn't look like it on the replay. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," Lewis said. "Well, my elbow was in and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but you don't hold the ball with your elbow, Nate. Didn't your knee hit 
before the ball made it across the goal line? 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"The referee said I got in," he said. "That's all that counts." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. Anyway, taking that touchdown away would take nothing away from 
Lewis, who collected more yards in receptions during Sunday's game than he had 
in all the other games combined. 
</P>
<P>
And there is more to it than that. His four catches for 89 yards were nice. So 
were his two touchdowns, particularly for a rookie. But what really counts is 
that Lewis took a small portion of pressure off the shoulders of Anthony 
Miller, the Chargers' primary target. Consequently, Miller found a little more 
room to maneuver in the New York secondary. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people have checked in and out of the spot reserved for the other wide 
receiver this season. Quinn Early gave it a try. Then it was Walter Wilson's 
turn. And finally, Lewis was given his chance, earning his first start in Week 
10 after he was out four weeks with a pulled muscle in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, just maybe, Lewis settled the matter on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say that," he said. "I don't want to get too cocky. I just 
want to say that I had a pretty good game." 
</P>
<P>
There was the 25-yarder in the first quarter when he grabbed the pass, fumbled 
and then pounced on the ball quicker than a dog jumps toward a T-bone steak. 
That set up the Chargers' second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
There was the 40-yarder in the fourth quarter when Lewis scorched cornerback 
Tony Stargell. That set up a 19-yard touchdown pass from Billy Joe Tolliver to 
. . . Nate Lewis. On that play, Lewis got open over the middle and reached up 
to clutch a fastball. Not Tolliver's fastest. Just fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that fast," Lewis said. "Not like he really can throw it." 
</P>
<P>
Not hardly. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw it pretty hard," Tolliver said. "But it wasn't as hard as I can throw 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was the disputed touchdown, on which he apparently bounced into 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
And all that was great to watch. But perhaps what got the attention of Charger 
Coach Dan Henning above everything else was that Lewis may have made the Jets 
think a little about putting all their efforts into stopping Miller. On one 
play in the second quarter, Lewis was sent deep down the middle. He and a Jet 
defender got tangled up and the ball fell incomplete, but Henning said that may 
have helped Miller score on his 24-yard reception in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the fact that he went down there and showed that speed, the safety hung 
in there (the second time) and didn't jump Anthony," Henning said. "It's nice 
to have a guy that can run fast and make people think twice about doubling 
Anthony." 
</P>
<P>
If Lewis turns out to be the guy who makes a few people back off Anthony 
Miller, then he has done himself proud when you consider that Charlie Joiner, 
the Charger receiver coach, had never heard of him at this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Joiner saw film of Lewis catching passes for Oregon Tech, a small school that 
has only produced one other player to be drafted by the NFL. Joiner was 
impressed, particularly with Lewis' ability to run with the ball after making a 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
So the Chargers took a chance and selected him in the seventh round. Things 
worked out nicely, though Joiner won't take credit for discovering a player 
nobody else knew about. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no," he said. "Every time we play some team some guy will tell me: 'Man, we 
really wanted that Nate Lewis, but we wanted him in a later round.' So he 
wasn't an unnoticed guy." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has helped his own cause. He acknowledges he was nervous when he first 
arrived in San Diego. Playing in the NFL is a whole different galaxy from 
Oregon Tech. But if part of the reason Lewis has reached this level is because 
he has a fine pair of hands, it is also because he has two good ears. Anytime 
he doesn't understand something that is being discussed in a team meeting, he 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
"He never goes out with a doubt in his mind," Joiner said. "That's the good 
thing about him. With his ability and his enthusiasm to work hard every day, I 
think he's going to be a good player." 
</P>
<P>
That would make him a bargain. You don't often find players of his caliber 
hidden in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope he turns out like the last seventh-rounder we got," Tolliver said. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Marion Butts.

Reagan and Marilyn: Did Ronald Reagan help launch Marilyn Monroe's career? Yes, 
claims Norma Jean Enterprises in Toronto. A spokesman for the company said 
Reagan was a captain in the Army's motion picture unit in World War II when he 
ordered David Conover to take morale-boosting photos of women. 
</P>
<P>
Conover found the young Monroe (then known as Norma Jean Dougherty) working at 
a defense plant in El Segundo and made the photographs that first caught 
Hollywood's eye.

War and Remembrance: When Gen. Colin L. Powell agreed to be honorary grand 
marshal for the King Week parade Jan. 21, he didn't know he would raise a 
ruckus in the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s hometown. Civil rights leader the 
Rev. Joseph Lowery said in Atlanta that Powell's role would conflict with 
King's teachings of nonviolence. King declared the U.S. government to be "the 
greatest purveyor of violence in the world" and vehemently opposed the Vietnam 
War, in which Powell served two tours of duty. Powell, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, often quotes the slain civil rights leader in his speeches.

Prison Growth: Evangelist Jim Bakker is doing fine behind bars. Basil Jackson, 
who treated Bakker after his mental collapse during his trial, says he recently 
visited Bakker at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., where Bakker 
is serving a 45-year sentence for defrauding his followers. "His faith is 
stronger now than it ever was," Jackson said. But his comment did not apply to 
the courts: "Naturally, he has questions about the system of justice."

ANN CONWAY: GLITZY GREETINGS ARE IN THE CARDS FOR THE WEALTHY 
</P>

<P>
They're the Rolls-Royces of holiday greeting cards, missives that say "Merry 
Christmas" with panache and a snooty price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Some sport imported French ribbon. Some a string of silver bells. Some a stream 
of glittering Mylar. And some a family picture taken by Orange County's 
photographer to the (social) stars, Greg Figge of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
All sell for a minimum of $12 apiece, several for as much as $30. It's not 
unusual, says Figge -- whose clients include L.A. Rams Coach John Robinson, 
Forbes 400 developer George Argyros and Allergan's top gun, Gavin Herbert -- 
for the rich to spend from $5,000 to $10,000 for a holiday mailing. Eileen Saul 
of William Ernest Brown stationers in Costa Mesa agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no limit to what a client can spend on a custom card," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Why spend a fortune on an item that will probably be glanced at, then tossed 
into the circular file? Image, of course. And tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep my Christmas cards," says Deeann Baldwin of Emerald Bay. Deeann 
and her husband, developer Al Baldwin, have been sending out family photographs 
taken by Figge for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a lot of work into it," says Deeann Baldwin. "It's one of my passions, a 
special way of keeping in touch. Every year, I try to come up with something 
different, surprise family and friends with a new theme. People have really 
enjoyed watching our children grow up." 
</P>
<P>
Sittings have included a formal portrait -- the Baldwins in black tie -- taken 
in the couple's living room. A casual portrait -- the Baldwins in blue jeans -- 
was taken on the beach. Last year, the couple sent out a photograph taken by a 
fellow tourist during a visit to Rwanda (yes, there was a gorilla in the 
background). Then there was the time the Baldwins flew Figge to their ranch in 
Wyoming for a sitting. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have been extravagant," says Figge, "but we sure got some great shots. 
Deeann doesn't hold back on quality or imagination. Even I can't wait to get 
her card each year." 
</P>
<P>
There was also the time the Baldwins wanted everybody to think their holiday 
photograph was shot in Colorado. "We couldn't get everybody to Aspen," says 
Deeann Baldwin, laughing. So, they did the next best thing -- posed next to a 
Newport Beach restaurant that looked like it was located in the village at the 
popular ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hysterical," she says. "Figge brought Styrofoam for snow and we brought 
our ski clothes. There I was in leather and a fur coat and it's 90 degrees and 
Balboa is packed. We're posing and people are beginning to look at us like 
we're nuts. One of my sons was so embarrassed he told them: 'This is an ad for 
GQ; we don't even know each other!' " But the trick photography worked. "It 
really looked like we were in Aspen in December. Nobody believes me when I tell 
them it was California in October." 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwins aren't alone when it comes to snowing friends with Styrofoam. This 
year, Figge says, a woman spent about $1,000 on snowmen balloons and trees at a 
local florist, then posed with them in a storm of the faux snow. Another couple 
hauled their family to the parking lot near Figge's studio and posed in crushed 
Styrofoam next to a brick building trailing with ivy. A nearby tree blazed with 
crimson leaves the size of saucers, Figge says. Who's to know the photograph 
was taken in a mall parking lot and not next to some Ivy League enclave? 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hunt, right arm to billionaire Donald Bren, recently posed with his family 
in a hammock for his holiday greeting card. Figge scouted the Hunt residence 
for the perfect spot, found the oversize hammock and told Hunt to hop in with 
family. During the $400 sitting ($150 if a client comes to the studio) the 
hammock flipped and the Hunts found themselves face-down on the lawn. That shot 
won't be mailed, of course. But the comedy of it won't be lost. While Figge was 
shooting, one of his co-workers was taking a video of the Hunts. 
</P>
<P>
"I get such a kick out of that. People posing for pictures and videos at the 
same time," says Saul of William Ernest Brown stationers, who, with partner 
Cindy Van Zandt, dreams up the cards that set off Figge's popular photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Videos have become another hot item to send during the holidays, Figge says. 
"We do some clever editing and add a little music. Usually, they're sent as 
gifts, not cards." 
</P>
<P>
When Gavin Herbert and his family posed for Figge recently, they stood, 
knee-deep in the tulips that dot Herbert's famous garden at his Casa Pacifica 
mansion. Last year, Judie and George Argyros posed for Figge on their boat 
wearing floppy reindeer-antler hats. The year before, the Argyroses sent out 
large cards from William Ernest Brown that were custom-painted, each with a 
different abstract design. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Baldwin family will be in "red" but the locale and theme of the 
400 cards they will mail are under wraps. "The theme is top secret until Dec. 
10," Deeann says. 
</P>
<P>
We'll be waiting.

PASADENA UNVEILS NEW HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena opened its big Christmas present -- the new Huntington Hospital -- 
early. On Friday night, lights outlined the Mediterranean edges of the 
$75-million three-story replacement structure at 100 W. California Blvd. 
One-thousand (at $200 a ticket) dined and danced to Wayne Foster for a "Pre-Op" 
party and first views of the elegant structure. Another 3,000 Huntington 
Hospital staff and their relatives toured Saturday and 300 more partied at the 
"Operation Party" Saturday night. Sunday afternoon the public swarmed in for 
the "Post-Op" party, a community open house. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, lots of comparisons to the Ritz Carlton," said hospital president Dr. 
Allen Mathies, greeting guests with his wife, Weta. 
</P>
<P>
The Friday night crowd meandered through admittance offices, and oohed and 
aahed over the gift shop, the newborn nurseries, 13 operating suites and the 
emergency department (including the San Gabriel Valley's only trauma center). 
</P>
<P>
The old core hospital building was erected in 1921. This evening was a goodby 
to grunginess. And hello to fresh paint and partying. In the huge white tent on 
the hospital parking lot, party co-chairs Katie Tuerk and Weta Mathies directed 
Cuisine Cuisine from Newport Beach to serve an antipasto salad, hot chicken and 
a fudge dessert. Ivy topiaries in the shapes of wreaths and Christmas trees 
dotted tables. 
</P>
<P>
Pride was showing. Dinner co-chairs William K. Doyle and Dr. James P. Blitz 
said thank-yous, hosting tables with their wives, Cheryl Doyle and Pam Blitz. 
Doctors were in abundance: Popular Dr. Millard McLain, now retired, got more 
hugs than a teddy bear. There were Dr. Morgans galore -- Dr. George Morgan and 
his son, Dr. Edward Morgan, and daughter-in-law, Dr. Karen Morgan, as well as 
Dr. Stan Morgan, not related. Dr. Bill Corey was on call; his wife carried his 
cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
Glitter was rampant. Shining in the masses of beads, bangles and diamonds were 
Pasadena-area leaders Verne (Huntington board chairman) and Sarah Orr, Stan and 
Marcia Hayden, Jane and Kris Popovich, Joan and Dean Schneider, Lorna and Chuck 
Reed, Dr. Bob and Jan Tranquada, Cornelius and Marjorie Pings, Patty and Davis 
Pillsbury, Bob and Louisa Miller, Dr. Bill and Susie Lattin, Dr. Mary Lee and 
Shelby Coffey III, Betsy and Frank Ulf, George and Chris Benter, Bill and 
Eileen Zimmerman, Henry and Nancy DeNero, Spike and Debby Booth, Bruce and 
Susan Seidel.

By CAROLYN SEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: FALL QUARTER by Weldon Kees with an 
introduction by James Reidel. Story Line Press, $18.95, 288 pages 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reading Weldon Kees' "Fall Quarter," and particularly the 49-page introduction 
by James Reidel, I had a very strong reaction. And not a good one. Weldon Kees, 
referred to here as "legendary," was a sometime poet and painter and critic and 
musician. In 1955, at the age of 37, he parked his car by the Golden Gate 
Bridge and either killed himself or changed his identity. 
</P>
<P>
Before the end of this life, Kees had written a number of novels he could never 
get published. This one, "Fall Quarter," a satirical novel about a young 
assistant professor teaching remedial English at an obscure Midwestern college, 
was read by an editor at Alfred A. Knopf two days after Pearl Harbor. Knopf 
decided to pass on the book. Now, 50 years later, it's in print. 
</P>
<P>
Here, according to James Reidel, is what Weldon Kees did when the manuscript 
was rejected and his agent, Mavis McIntosh, told him to put the book away. Kees 
wrote a friend: "Are these people completely humorless and dense, or is the 
book really bad?" The friend, an Army lieutenant named Getty, had already said 
he liked the book: "I read the whole novel through at one sitting. Under 
pleasant conditions too: got up from a nap about 4, showered, got out the 
manuscript, and settled down by a west window, with a good view of peacefully 
autumnal mountains at my side. . . ." Are you paying attention, gentle reader? 
Lt. Getty hasn't actually said one word about the novel. He's talking about his 
shower in the mountains! Also, he's a lieutenant in the Army. He's not in the 
publishing business. 
</P>
<P>
"Fall Quarter" ought to be required reading in every creative writing program 
in the land. As an exercise in humility, James Reidel's introduction ought to 
be memorized and recited aloud by every writer who starts playing the 
Misunderstood Genius game. Here's another favorite passage of mine from the 
introduction: "Kees planned to write novels. Yet not having sold a manuscript 
meant supporting himself in some way that would give him existential elbow room 
to be a writer. . . . Kees found this in his marriage to his small-town 
girlfriend, Ann Swan, whom he had known since senior year at the University of 
Nebraska." So . . . Ann worked, and Kees wrote these novels. And complained a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Reidel thinks that Kees didn't have a "grasping side." To prove this, he quotes 
Truman Capote, querying Kees: "Why don't you want to be a success? I can tell 
from the way you act that you don't want to be a success." 
</P>
<P>
Let me suggest an alternative interpretation here. People whose work is iffy 
play the Misunderstood Genius game hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Fall Quarter" is a madly derivative work: The tone and events come from 
Nathanael West, the Graham Brothers, with a tad of Evelyn Waugh thrown in. But 
West in particular seems at times to be almost paraphrased. This novel concerns 
a young man named William Clay who journeys to an obscure college in the Middle 
West to teach English. (We never see him in class, though scholarship is 
mercilessly derided.) William falls in love with a woman who treats him badly. 
He meets many a disgusting person who says many a stupid thing. He goes to a 
brothel but doesn't have sex, and to a succession of parties where he meets 
ever more disgusting people, drinks too much, gets mugged by a piano player, 
sees married people who hate each other, drinks too much, gets more depressed, 
and then gets more depressed. 
</P>
<P>
You can't blame World War II for this book not getting published. You can blame 
the fact that Nathanael West had been working for quite a while, and so had 
Carroll and Garrett Graham, and so had Mr. Waugh. You can also blame Mr. Kees 
for not revising his novel, and taking a good look at his plot, and for keeping 
his college sweetheart hard at work supporting a writer who couldn't/wouldn't 
publish. I now offer words of wisdom for writers everywhere: When they say 
you're "distinguished," that means you're not paid very much. When they say 
you're "legendary," that probably means you're a bum.

AARON COPLAND DIES; MUSIC FOUND THE AMERICAN MOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aaron Copland, who sought a recognizable American sound in serious music and 
was considered the nation's finest living composer, died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He died in Phelps Memorial Hospital in Westchester, N. Y. only two weeks after 
his 90th birthday, an occasion noted with celebrations and tributes from 
throughout the land. 
</P>
<P>
He had suffered two strokes and died of the complications from them, said his 
attorney, Ellis Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
Copland's true achievement, concert pianist Samuel Lipman once observed, was 
not the composer's use of rhythm, harmony, counterpoint or inventive structure, 
but his ability to evoke through melody the "mood of America" from the Civil 
War to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Copland, wrote the esteemed pianist, "catches the emptiness of the city and the 
quiet of the land. He has succeeded in fixing in the mind of a large public an 
aural image of what America, and therefore American music, sounds like."

Unlike other serious composers, the Brooklyn-born Copland did not spurn writing 
for the masses, although many of his works were abstract and some could be 
attempted by only the most skilled musicians. Compositions such as "Piano 
Variations" were not meant for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
(In 1928, during his first trip to the West, Copland heard another of his 
keyboard pieces, "Piano Concerto" with its frequently changing rhythms, hissed 
during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood Bowl.) 
</P>
<P>
But the sweep of his honors attests to his wide appeal. They included a 
Pulitzer Prize, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Guggenheim Foundation's 
first music fellowship and an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the composer who would lead American music out of the wilderness," 
Leonard Bernstein wrote in High Fidelity magazine for the occasion of Copland's 
70th birthday. "He was The Leader, the one to whom the young always came with 
their compositions." 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career, when he searched jazz and folk songs as well as Latin 
rhythms to find new musical forms, he was considered by many too avant-garde 
for the concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
He reached a wide audience with his ballet compositions: "Billy the Kid," 
"Rodeo" and "Appalachian Spring," the last written for dancer Martha Graham. 
</P>
<P>
His "Fanfare for the Common Man" became an anthem played around the world and 
was heard in such disparate places as the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer 
Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He did not consider himself above writing background music for films -- "Of 
Mice and Men," "Our Town," "North Star" and "The Red Pony" -- and for several 
years that work provided his main source of income. 
</P>
<P>
His Academy Award came for the score for William Wyler's 1949 "The Heiress." 
</P>
<P>
Copland, the youngest of five children of Russian Jewish immigrants, did not 
begin taking formal piano lessons until he was 12 or 13 and it was not until he 
was 15 that, he said, "the idea of becoming a composer seems gradually to have 
dawned upon me." 
</P>
<P>
That was an advanced age for a future professional composer to begin training, 
it was noted by Copland biographer Arthur Berger, "but his determination was 
such that things went rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
After studying piano with various teachers and learning composition under Rubin 
Goldmark, who believed some of his pupil's efforts mere "modern experiments," 
20-year-old Copland went to France to enroll in a new music school for 
Americans at Fontainebleau. 
</P>
<P>
He could afford to go there, Berger pointed out, because his immigrant father 
had a department store in New York and young Copland drew a "nice allowance" to 
supplement what he had earned working in the store and as a runner on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
At Fontainebleau, Copland met harmony teacher Nadia Boulanger and was 
overwhelmed by what he said was her enthusiasm and "clarity in teaching." He 
became the first of several noted American composers who studied under her. 
</P>
<P>
In post-World War I Paris, where Copland went to study with Boulanger, he found 
himself caught up in the excitement over the experimenting European composers 
-- Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Bela Bartok and Arnold Schoenberg. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a one-act ballet, "Grohg," from which he later extracted three 
movements to form his "Dance Symphony," subsequently winning with it a $5,000 
prize in a 1930 contest sponsored by RCA Victor Co. 
</P>
<P>
It was during his three years in France, Copland said later, that he became 
aware that French music sounded distinctly French. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't understand why we in America couldn't create serious music which 
people would recognize as typically American," he told an interviewer before 
his 80th birthday, "particularly since the jazz boys and the ragtime fellows 
had succeeded in doing it." 
</P>
<P>
He made up his mind to write serious music that would reflect America's 
diversity and somehow capture the national character. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to the United States at 23, Copland earned his living for a 
time playing in a Milford, Pa., hotel trio -- while writing for Boulanger a 
"Symphony for Organ and Orchestra" she was to perform with conductor Walter 
Damrosch and the New York Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the initial performance, which was not very successful by all 
accounts, Damrosch told the audience: "If a young man at the age of 23 can 
write a symphony like that, in five years he will be ready to commit murder." 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what Damrosch meant, but at a time when modern composers were 
regarded as doing little more than trying to shock the public, he may have felt 
that Copland's talent could bring him intense frustration. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, the Boston Symphony Orchestra performed Copland's symphony. Its 
conductor, Russian-born Serge Koussevitsky, was so enthusiastic about the young 
composer that he asked him to write a chamber orchestra piece to be performed 
at a League of Composers concert. 
</P>
<P>
Copland decided he had drawn upon European influences too much for his 
symphony, so he drew upon the jazz idiom for "Music for the Theatre." 
Biographer Berger observed that Copland, with his superb training, could 
utilize advanced harmonies that were beyond George Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
Although the league concert audience took "Music for the Theatre" in stride, 
the general symphony public did not. 
</P>
<P>
Berger wrote that "a veritable cabal was formed against the work . . . among 
staid Boston listeners, some of whom claimed that such music had no place in 
Symphony Hall and that Koussevitsky had given it with disguised malice, namely 
as a foreigner who wanted to show how bad American music is." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1975 New York Times interview, Copland recalled the difficulties of trying 
to write serious music that would appeal to a larger public without alienating 
those willing to accept only traditional forms. 
</P>
<P>
He told of fellow composer Roy Harris, who "was interested in writing big, 
serious symphonies in the Sibelius vein," being aghast at the jazz-flavored 
work Copland was writing for the Boston Symphony. Copland told the interviewer: 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him jumping up and holding his head between his hands and shouting, 
'My God, it's whorehouse music! It's whorehouse music!' " 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it was at the time of this brouhaha that Copland became the first 
composer to win a Guggenheim Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
By 1927, he decided he had done as much as he could with jazz and he went on to 
a new phase, producing "Piano Variations," "Short Symphony" and "Statements." 
</P>
<P>
They were difficult to perform or to understand. Critics noted that Copland was 
using dissonance, irregular rhythms and unmelodic themes. He had become a 
leading figure in modern music. 
</P>
<P>
Copland, however, was increasingly uncomfortable with the failure of composers 
to reach the music-loving public. 
</P>
<P>
So Copland went to a new style, composing and orchestrating by 1936 "El Salon 
Mexico," based on Mexican melodies. It was an immediate success. 
</P>
<P>
As he sought a broader audience and the true American musical idiom, Copland 
drew upon such folk sources as cowboy songs, New England hymns and Shaker 
melodies. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a play-opera for high school performance, "The Second Hurricane," as 
well as incidental music for two plays and even a puppet show that was 
presented at the 1939 New York World's Fair. 
</P>
<P>
His three major ballets were responsible for most of his fame. "Appalachian 
Spring" won him the 1944 Pulitzer Prize for music as well as the New York Music 
Critics' Award as the outstanding theatrical composition for 1944-45. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote music especially commissioned for radio performance and composed for 
films without, the critics said, sinking to the level of many Hollywood scores. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Arthur Berger wrote, Copland "exerted an influence on some of the 
resident, routine composers there and helped raise the general standards." 
</P>
<P>
In writing about Copland, pianist Lipman observed that "notwithstanding this 
opening to the masses," the composer already had resumed his interest in more 
abstract music with "Piano Sonata," "Sonata for Violin and Piano" and his 
"Third Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
The last was called by Koussevitsky "the greatest American symphony" and was 
the New York Music Critics' choice for the best orchestral piece of the 1946-47 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Copland's career also included his work as a performer of his own music and as 
a conductor -- both in concert and on recordings. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote three books: "Our New Music," "What to Listen for in Music" and "Music 
and Imagination." He also wrote articles for various magazines while others 
wrote several books and hundreds of articles about him. 
</P>
<P>
Copland was celebrated at length and interviewed often at the time of his 80th 
birthday in 1980, three years after his last composition "Midsummer Nocturne." 
He was living, as he had for years, in a rambling hilltop house overlooking the 
Hudson River at Peekskill, N. Y. 
</P>
<P>
His 90th birthday was marked by concerts and tributes stretching across the 
country. But this time his health was too frail for interviews or even comment. 
</P>
<P>
He never married and lived alone with his grand piano, stacks of music 
manuscript, dog and cat. A housekeeper, a cook and a secretary attended to his 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my hideaway, my solitude," he told one reporter many years ago. "You 
know what the composer's life is like in Manhattan. The telephone is always 
ringing, people are always dropping in. You are expected to go places and take 
part. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of keeping yourself free from interruptions."

GERMANY GIVES KOHL A MANDATE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: HIS CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION WINS AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY IN THE 
HISTORIC UNIFIED VOTE.

<P>
Germans voted freely as a united nation Sunday for the first time since the 
rise of Adolf Hitler, handing Chancellor Helmut Kohl an overwhelming mandate to 
lead them through the dawn of a new European era. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the historic significance of the vote, turnout was reportedly the 
lowest since 1949 -- a reflection of both a lackluster campaign and voter 
exhaustion after a year of stunning change that redrew the map of a continent. 
</P>
<P>
The cold and damp election day marked the finish line of an emotional marathon 
the Germans began just 388 days earlier with the breaching of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a day of great joy," a beaming Kohl declared, claiming victory a scant 
90 minutes after polls closed. "This is a tremendous success and we can be 
proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and the newly elected 656-member Bundestag, or lower house of Parliament, 
face a unique set of challenges to successfully meld together two economically 
and psychologically disparate societies under the mantle of an anxious country 
now cast in Europe's leading role. 
</P>
<P>
Returns early today gave Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its sister 
party, the Christian Social Union, a total of 316 seats in the Bundestag. 
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's liberal Free Democratic Party, the 
junior partner in the three-party ruling coalition, captured 79 seats. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democratic Party won 240 seats, while the restructured 
East German Communist Party grabbed 14 seats and the alternative Alliance 90 
gained 7. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters chanted "Hel-mut! Hel-mut!" as the beefy 60-year-old chancellor 
shouldered his way through a crush of reporters at his Christian Democratic 
headquarters in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best election result ever reached by a democratic party in 
Germany, and I have reason to be happy," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
With just 78% of 59.9 million eligible voters casting ballots, Kohl's 
center-right party and its Bavarian ally scored 44.1% with their junior 
partner, the Free Democrats, tallying 11%. The opposition Social Democrats 
suffered their worst defeat since 1957, garnering just 33.5% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Kicked out of Parliament altogether were the environmentalist Greens, once the 
toast of the German left and the driving force behind massive protests against 
NATO's deployment of nuclear missiles on German soil in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, voters in the east gave the restructured Communist Party the oomph 
it needed to win parliamentary representation, and the nationalistic 
right-extremist Republicans took a drubbing. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, voting trends in the eastern region mirrored those in the western part 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin, voting as a single city for the first time in 44 years, took a 
conservative turn amid urban unrest that hit a flash-point earlier this month 
when police clashed with violent squatters in the city center. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats, led by former West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, 
pulled in 37.5% of the vote in what acting Social Democratic Mayor Walter 
Momper called a "bitter defeat." 
</P>
<P>
Several divisive issues loom for the new German government, which is expected 
to be confirmed Dec. 20 in the official capital of Berlin, with Kohl being 
formally named chancellor the following day. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the new Bundestag must choose between Bonn and Berlin as 
the seat of government, decide whether to legalize abortion and consider 
amnesty for more than 1 million spies, informants, secret police, border guards 
and Communist officials who made East Germany a model of Cold War repression. 
</P>
<P>
That sinister past shadowed the reunited nation even on election day, as Soviet 
military officials blocked the arrest of former East German leader Erich 
Honecker on charges of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 78, has been confined since last April to a Soviet military hospital 
20 miles south of Berlin. An arrest warrant was issued Saturday, but Soviet 
officials refused to turn Honecker over without direct orders from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
German prosecutors hold Honecker responsible for the deaths of 190 East Germans 
killed while trying to flee to the West before a bloodless revolution forced 
the borders open and toppled the hard-line Communist regime in the fall of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The East German quest for democracy shifted virtually overnight into a call for 
German unity, and Kohl, long regarded as a plodding politician from the 
Rhineland, deftly seized the moment to become the respected architect of 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
"The script . . . was written for the government and we came out of it with a 
black eye," acknowledged Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democrats' challenger to 
Kohl, who campaigned as the "chancellor of unity." 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine, the acerbic 47-year-old prime minister of Saarland state, lost 
ground for the Social Democrats in what analysts said should have been the 
party's hour of glory by expressing reservations about accepting the flood of 
East German refugees who began fleeing to the West in the summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine's reluctance to join the call for quick unity clearly alienated many 
East Germans as well as older West German voters who had witnessed the postwar 
division of their homeland. After all, it was the Social Democrats who first 
advocated rapprochement with the East Bloc, and their chancellor at the time, 
Willy Brandt, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his ostpolitik (politics looking 
to the east). 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine, who nearly died when a deranged woman slashed his throat at a 
campaign rally last spring, attempted to put a brave face on Sunday's 
humiliation by insisting that the Social Democrats had "mobilized the youth" of 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"And that is the future," Lafontaine said in a somber party headquarters in 
Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Even more somber was the mood at the headquarters of the Greens, who failed to 
garner the 5% necessary to win representation in the Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
As campaign workers dabbed away tears, party leaders reflected on the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"First, we have to look at ourselves," said Hubert Kleinert, who was a Greens 
deputy in the last Bundestag. "The policy of the last four years hasn't been 
good, and most of all, it hasn't been presented well enough," he said in an 
interview on German television. 
</P>
<P>
"If this party doesn't change very quickly, then we'll be looking at a very 
bleak future," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Greens lose representation at a time when environmental issues are at the 
forefront, with the government expected to shell out millions of dollars to 
combat heavy pollution in what used to be East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Party of Democratic Socialism, the reformist successor to East Germany's 
iron-fisted Communist Party, was snubbed by voters in the western states but 
carried 10% in the east. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the party fared twice as well as Alliance 90, the umbrella party 
that includes many of the pro-democracy activists who spearheaded the 
grass-roots revolution that toppled the Communists from power in East Germany a 
little over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to bring a Socialist party into the first all-German Bundestag -- 
that's an achievement," said the party chairman, Gregor Gysi. "We are now the 
leftist democratic alternative party of choice." 
</P>
<P>
The small victory came despite recent revelations that the reformed Communists 
tried to hide $170 million in Moscow to prevent confiscation by the united 
German government. The party still controls millions -- if not billions -- 
worth of property and assets, though it has pledged to turn over 80% of its 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Whether to punish Honecker and his corrupt cronies is a decision the new 
Bundestag will have to quickly consider, since many of the dozen or so men 
involved are elderly or reportedly ailing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The last time Germany voted freely as a single nation was in November, 1932, 
when Kurt Schleicher was named chancellor. He resigned two months later amid 
growing civil violence and ineffectual parliamentary government. President Paul 
von Hindenburg then called on Adolf Hitler to become chancellor of a coalition 
government, and Hitler took office Jan. 30, 1933.

U.S. CHARITY SHIPS MEDICINE, FOOD TO MOSCOW 
</P>

<P>
In the first major U.S. contribution to the international effort to relieve 
widespread shortages of food, medicines and consumer goods in the Soviet Union, 
an American charity Sunday delivered 40 tons of drugs, hospital supplies and 
food to Russian hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Syringes, antibiotics, analgesics and a high-protein, vitamin-enriched drink 
arrived as the first of several deliveries of emergency assistance from 
AmeriCares of New Canaan, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first shipment of what we're calling an 'air bridge' of a million 
pounds of medicine and food," Stephen Johnson, AmeriCares' president, said as 
supplies were being unloaded at the Russian Republican Children's Hospital on 
the outskirts of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we can tell, there is no safety net at all here to help needy 
people. We understand there are almost no medicines available for average 
people." 
</P>
<P>
About half of the shipment was a liquid dietary supplement, which is frequently 
sent to Third World countries, AmeriCares spokesman Dwain Schenck said. 
</P>
<P>
Facing what many Soviet officials here say is the worst food crisis since World 
War II, Moscow has called for help from its new allies in the West, and pledges 
of assistance keep coming in. Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, France, 
Canada, Denmark, Japan and the United States have all promised aid or sent 
foodstuffs or medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
One truckload of drugs and medical equipment from AmeriCares, worth more than 
$1 million, went directly to the Republican Children's Hospital, which although 
five years old still resembles a muddy construction site with much work 
remaining to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other trucks were driven to a special storage facility of the Russian 
government that, Soviet officials said, will supply especially needy hospitals 
in western regions of the Russian republic, where people are still being 
treated for the effects of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done a lot of research to make sure the drugs will end up in the hands 
of doctors whose patients need them the most," said Vasily A. Drozdov, chief 
physician at Republican Children's Hospital, who advised AmeriCares on where 
the supplies are most vital. 
</P>
<P>
"We really need this shipment," said Yevgeny V. Varlamov, deputy chief of the 
hospital. "Right now, the Soviet Union doesn't have anything. Drugs and medical 
equipment are just one part of what we lack, but they are indispensable." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Republican Children's Hospital is one of the best-supplied in the 
Soviet Union, Varlamov said that it suffers from chronic shortages of the most 
basic medical supplies as well as shortages of imported medicines and surgical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"We can use anything they bring us," Varlamov added. "We care for more than 
1,000 children from all over the country, so nothing ever goes to waste." 
</P>
<P>
American pharmaceutical and food companies are donating the million pounds of 
food and medicine that AmeriCares is distributing to relieve shortages in the 
Soviet Union, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Western experts have expressed concern that donations would be stolen by black 
marketeers, who are widely blamed for sabotaging the Soviet economy, and so 
representatives from AmeriCares and the Soviet Interior Ministry will accompany 
the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to watch and make sure the aid does not disappear but gets to its 
intended recipients," Alexei V. Lyutykh, an officer of the Soviet Interior 
Ministry, said as he supervised the delivery of medicines at the children's 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has not yet decided whether to donate food to the Soviet 
Union because Moscow-based diplomats have advised their superiors that the 
shortages are the result of bad distribution and not impending famine. But 
Washington is now reviewing its policy and may offer humanitarian aid or 
governmental credits, President Bush said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the AmeriCares shipment represents the first major relief from the 
United States, aid has already started coming in to Moscow and Leningrad from 
European countries, with Germany in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
A transport plane arrived in Moscow on Thursday with 37 tons of food from 
Germany to feed children in hospitals and orphanages. A road convoy set out 
from the German Red Cross' central warehouse outside Bonn for the Soviet 
capital on Friday with 5,000 food packages, which had been prepared by 
individuals to help elderly and disabled Soviets survive the winter. 
</P>
<P>
The German government decided Thursday to donate to the Soviet Union those food 
supplies that had been stored in Berlin in case of a repeat of the 1948-1949 
Soviet blockade of that city. The reserves, which include canned meat, rye 
flour and butter, reportedly could feed 10 million Soviets for a month and are 
worth $340 million. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said that Soviet aid is his top 
foreign policy priority. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials blame the critical shortages of almost all consumer goods on 
inefficient distribution, a breakdown of the old centralized system of supply 
and a powerful black market. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday assigned the KGB state security agency 
to guard food shipments from abroad and to make sure those shipments get to 
their destinations intact. 
</P>
<P>
While Gorbachev has encouraged contributions from abroad to help his country 
through the difficult transition to a market economy, some people here say they 
are ashamed by their government's decision to beg for food from countries that 
were longtime enemies of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago the citizens of Western Europe were afraid of invasion by Soviet 
tanks, but today, they're withdrawing marks and guilders from their modest, or 
not very modest savings, ready to help us with our misfortune," Yevgeny 
Shulyukin wrote in a commentary published Sunday in the newspaper Trud. 
</P>
<P>
"To be frank, a feeling of discomfort or even shame arises in me. What in the 
world has happened across the vast spaces of our homeland? Were we shaken by a 
super-strong earthquake, or did huge fires scorch our fields and farms?" 
</P>
<P>
Shulyukin remarked with irony that after a record wheat harvest, the Soviet 
Union is on the brink of starvation. The most "humiliating" aspect of the 
disaster, he said, is that it has been caused by bad management and 
slovenliness. 
</P>
<P>
And, adding insult to injury, the ability of Soviet transport to get the relief 
goods to the people who need them before they fall into the hands of black 
marketeers is also in doubt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to make a deep study to understand that all we receive in aid 
and credit will be incomparably less than what we left buried in the fields, 
lost on the roads and let rot in storage." 
</P>
<P>
The West is eager to shore up Gorbachev and prevent the economic and political 
disintegration in the Soviet Union, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything, Western Europe is afraid of the exacerbation of the 
economic and political instability in our country, which could destroy the 
established climate of detente and mutual trust on the Continent."

<P>
A 28-year-old Oceanside man got two surprises when a California Highway Patrol 
officer pulled him over on a speeding charge one Friday night in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Although he felt unimpaired, he had downed enough beer after work that a 
Breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level to register .08%, the new 
legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was he arrested, but he was stripped of his driver's license, a second 
result of the state's new and tougher drunk driving laws. 
</P>
<P>
This year has seen some of the most significant changes in California drunk 
driving laws in a decade. Only three other states -- Utah, Maine and Oregon -- 
have legal blood alcohol limits as low as California. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, more drivers have been arrested on state highways than ever 
before, and drunk driving convictions are approaching an all-time high. The 
statistics are particularly striking in the seven-county Southern California 
region. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the new .08% legal limit, 16% more drivers have been arrested 
for drunk driving on the state's highways and 10% more drivers were convicted 
of the crime during the first ten months of this year than during the same 
period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
To their delight, law enforcement officers say the new law -- which lowers the 
legal limit from .10% to .08% -- is allowing them to snare a new kind of drunk 
driver. The ones, in the Oceanside man's words, who "are just a little bit 
drunk." They are drivers who were borderline under the old legal limit but 
clearly can be prosecuted now, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
(For an average 150 pound man, the new law means drinking two beers instead of 
three an hour before getting behind the wheel. Although the average level of 
intoxication in California is .17%, almost 10%, or 11,000, drivers arrested 
statewide so far this year by the California Highway Patrol had a level of .10% 
or less.) 
</P>
<P>
The new law also allows police to confiscate a drunk driver's license on the 
spot -- a provision that tends to leave an indelible mark on the memories of 
drunk drivers, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But the tougher laws have also had some unintended consequences: Many more 
drivers are choosing to fight the charges in court, believing they are 
unimpaired at the .08% limit -- a claim that medical authorities dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's understandable that a driver feels that way, but from a scientist's point 
of view, a driver is impaired at .08%," said Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a physician 
and trustee with the American Medical Assn., which prefers a .05% legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the lower limit also has been responsible for a rise of as 
much as 20% in jury trials in some areas, such as Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
At the lower blood alcohol levels drivers don't "feel they were under the 
influence. Their memory of the event is pretty good and they feel they didn't 
do it," said Judge John Ouderkirk of the Los Angeles Traffic Court. "At the 
higher range, they don't remember anything, and in their heart, they know they 
were under the influence." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in San Diego, who also report an increase in drunk driving trials, 
say that although they are prosecuting 15% more cases this year, the low-level 
cases are more difficult to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
In these cases, drivers can more readily perform the field sobriety tests -- 
such as walking a straight line -- and officers depend more heavily on chemical 
tests to show intoxication. During trials, the chemical tests draw fire as 
lawyers attempt to downplay their reliability. Experts say the tests can 
deviate by .01. 
</P>
<P>
"Skillful defense attorneys can -- through clever arguments -- persuade an 
earnest jury that there is a .02 deviation in the breath test. Some juries buy 
that," said Gretchen North, head deputy city attorney in San Diego. "But 
obviously we wouldn't be picking up the .08s if we weren't winning them." 
</P>
<P>
And DMV records show that the increase in arrests has led to more drunk driving 
convictions in the Southland. "The laws are doing what was intended -- closing 
the loopholes and increasing arrests and convictions," said Paul Snodgrass, the 
driving-under-the-influence coordinator with the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration's San Francisco regional office. 
</P>
<P>
"Increased conviction is increased deterrent as far as we are concerned -- the 
.08 law means less people will drive drunk," said Carolee Newman, spokeswoman 
for the Los Angeles chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. "The law is 
outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Gil Payne, a 20-year veteran assigned to the California Highway Patrol 
in San Juan Capistrano, says he sees a difference on the roads. Payne describes 
himself as a "Deuce Buster," or an officer who specializes in nabbing drunk 
drivers. For the last 16 years, Payne has worked a nine-hour shift that starts 
at 7:30 p.m. -- considered prime time for drinking drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way from 10 years ago," Payne said. "People are finding 
out that the risk just isn't worth it. The penalties are getting tougher and 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Friday night, Payne and his partner, Leon LaSage, patrolled the San 
Juan Capistrano highways and roadways, driving 162 miles. By the end of their 
shift, they had doled out several speeding tickets and made two drunk driving 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
One man, a 20-year-old from Laguna Niguel, had zoomed around a street corner, 
tires squealing. After being pulled over, he scored a low but still illegal 
blood alcohol level on the hand-held breath analysis device. Although readings 
from this device cannot be used as evidence in court, CHP officers frequently 
use it to double-check their own estimates of a driver's impairment. 
</P>
<P>
Handcuffed and placed in the patrol car, the man objected: "There are many more 
people who are more intoxicated than I am." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the introduction of a new law heightens awareness of a problem, which, 
in turn, tends to boost arrests and convictions, said Cliff Helander, research 
manager of the DMV's alcohol research unit. 
</P>
<P>
But some courts are limited in what they can do, many experts say. Across 
California, a DUI case takes an average of six months to adjudicate. Many 
experts say that by the time an intoxicated driver is punished by the legal 
system, he has long since forgotten his crime. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes of addressing the problem, the new prompt license suspension law went 
into effect in July. Traffic experts believe this sanction will probably do 
more to keep drunk drivers off the road than the .08% limit. 
</P>
<P>
Under the license suspension law, officers can seize the licenses of those 
arrested on suspicion of drunk driving if their blood alcohol level is .08% or 
higher. They can also yank the license if the driver refuses to undergo a 
chemical test. In place of the license, officers provide a 45-day temporary 
license. Drivers have 10 days to appeal the license suspension to the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Many, however, are unaware of the suspension law, so they are stunned when an 
officer plucks their license. Since July, 105,000 drivers statewide have had 
their licenses pulled when they were arrested for driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
One 29-year-old San Clemente woman said the sting of a license suspension was 
effective. "I made a stupid mistake, and it's the price I've got to pay," said 
the paralegal typist. "It's just a hassle. The whole thing made me feel like a 
criminal." 
</P>
<P>
With prompt license suspension, the punishment immediately follows the crime -- 
which makes it one of the most powerful tools to help keep intoxicated drivers 
off the roads, said Snodgrass of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
When you take a license away, some drive anyway, but most don't, he said. 
Similar license suspension laws are on the books in 28 states and the District 
of Columbia. One study in those states showed that prompt license suspension 
reduced fatal crashes by about 9%. 
</P>
<P>
So far, fatal traffic accidents of all kind, not just alcohol-related ones -- 
have declined by about 7% on California's roads. But officials are uncertain 
whether to credit the new drunk driving laws for this accomplishment or the 
fact that more people are wearing seat belts, said Sam Haynes, a CHP spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
While some lawyers have questioned whether this sanction violates a driver's 
right to due process, a Supreme Court case, however, upheld the law in 1979. 
Others -- drivers and lawyers -- say the law is crippling and poses hardship in 
Southern California, which has little public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
But many others say the double punch of yanking a license and the lower 
drinking limit is effective. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could turn back time, I would turn back Friday night," said the San 
Clemente typist. "I didn't need to get behind the wheel and drive. That arrest 
made me sober up fast."

 Lowering the blood alcohol limit for suspected drunk drivers in California has 
caused an increase in the number of arrests and conviction rates statewide.

Shows Canceled: Weekend shows by rock duo Bob Weir &amp; Rob Wasserman and 
country singer Vince Gill were postponed after the newly reopened Raymond 
Theatre in Pasadena was closed by fire marshals Friday because of inadequate 
fire retardant. 
</P>
<P>
The shows were the second and third bookings at the renovated movie house, 
which reopened on Nov. 16. The Raymond marks promoter Gary Folgner's entry into 
the Los Angeles concert market after his success with the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano and the Ventura Theatre in Ventura. No new dates for the 
postponed concerts have been announced, but a spokeswoman for Gill said that 
the singer probably won't perform in the area until next spring. CLAUDIA PUIG

Incense, Peppermints: Concert posters from the blissed-out era of acid rock, 
some featuring Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, are up for auction at a store in 
the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-poster assortment, also including those from concerts by the Jefferson 
Airplane, Santana and Chicago, was put up for bid by an anonymous owner, 
according to Robert Beerbohm, proprietor of the Best Comics store. The total 
asking price: $15,000. "There were only a thousand or fewer posters made for 
the concerts and most are gone," Beerbohm said. Included is what Beerbohm 
labels "the first psychedelic poster" promoting a 1965 concert by the 
Charlatans, a San Francisco band, which he expects to sell for $2,000. CLAUDIA

Who'll Take the Rap: A format change may be planned for KDAY-AM (1580), the 
nation's leading rap station, purchased recently by Realtor Fred Sands. 
Although the sale is not yet final, Gary Price, general manager of heavy metal 
station KNAC-FM, which is also owned by Sands, said that a study is being 
conducted to determine what format the powerful station should have. Retaining 
the rap music format is one possibility, Price said. CLAUDIA PUIG

Turkish Government Objects to Film: The Turkish Embassy has released a 
statement denouncing the Turner Network Television movie "Forgotten Prisoners: 
Amnesty Files," which debuted Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy called it an "unfair and avowedly fictitious film" and said it 
"falsely purports to portray contemporary reality in Turkey." The film, which 
was based on a composite of actual cases, centered around an American attorney 
who goes to Turkey on his first mission to document cases of government 
torture. The Turkish Embassy accused the movie of defaming Turkey and 
exploiting Americans' strong feelings about human rights violations. CLAUDIA

COUNTERPUNCH: HANDICAP NOT LEST YE BE HANDICAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PIERCE BROSNAN, Brosnan, the star of TV's Remington Steele, has also 
appeared in the features The Fourth Protocol and The Deceivers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It frequently amuses me (well, make that amazes me) how Hollywood enjoys 
picking the nit off the bones of upcoming films before they are confirmed 
casualties. There is a gleeful advance body count of every film on the horizon 
except for the consensus can't-misses, some of which eventually do miss. 
</P>
<P>
This Hollywood necrophilia all came racing to mind as I read "Hollywood Holiday 
Derby" (Nov. 14) in which anonymous experts raced to the gates to be the first 
in line to get in a doomsday stab at some unsuspecting new movie. 
</P>
<P>
And there, low and behold, in the very last paragraph is a first on-the-block 
requiem for a holiday film to which I make my own small contribution and which 
I had, until I read this obviously knowledgeable sad tiding, thought was a very 
good little film. Who am I to argue with these funeral directors who must see 
all new films in special screenings at Forest Lawn, although most don't even 
pretend to have seen them? 
</P>
<P>
The deck on Elaine Dutka's article began "Handicappers Set Early Line." And I 
realized that in a town not known for apt titles, someone had finally hit the 
nail on the head. These experts, these "handicappers," are the real handicap 
for new films. If any art form ever required an open mind and a closed mouth 
until the work had a chance to prove or disprove itself, it is the motion 
picture . . . a fragile concoction of fluff and passion in which the most 
important element, as the "Ghost" ad campaign reminds us, is that "you will 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
In regard to our own film, "Mr. Johnson" (which was scheduled for a Christmas 
release but will now open in February), I must admit that I did believe, and 
still do (the dark prognosis of Dutka's expert handicapper notwithstanding). It 
was, after all, directed by Bruce Beresford, who directed last year's 
Oscar-winning best film, "Driving Miss Daisy" (with nary a nomination of his 
own to show for the effort). 
</P>
<P>
Bruce made a believer of me, and so did the script, a literate adaptation of 
the Joyce Carey novel. It is a delicate exploration of the tidal zone between 
two very different cultures and the pull the opposite culture has on two 
dramatically different men. I hasten to add that my own role is very happily in 
support of a brilliant young African actor, Maynard Eziashi. When I finally saw 
"Mr. Johnson," his brave, insightful performance turned my belief into positive 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But what did Dutka's article conclude about "Mr. Johnson"? 
</P>
<P>
"No word at all on Bruce Beresford's 'Mr. Johnson' . . . but referring to its 
setting of road building in west Africa in the 1920s, one producer quipped: 
'They ought to put speed bumps in the aisle . . . to prevent people from 
leaving in droves.' " 
</P>
<P>
No word -- just a quip. This anonymous producer (an Oscar-winning anonymous 
producer, one might presume, if one were generous) was writing an obituary for 
a film by a major filmmaker based on an eight-word capsulization of the film's 
setting . . . capsulized by whom? 
</P>
<P>
How might one have capsulized the setting of Beresford's "Miss Daisy," "Tender 
Mercies" or "Breaker Morant"? And would the conclusions have been any less 
ungenerous? 
</P>
<P>
One might have fun with a Hollywood parlor game in which players have to 
identify classic films by an eight-word deprecatory description of the film's 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, this one producer had it exactly wrong. Our problem with "Mr. 
Johnson" will not be in keeping people in their seats, but rather in getting 
them into those seats. 
</P>
<P>
The intelligent audience, open to some new insights into the human spirit, will 
be well satisfied once paired with "Mr. Johnson." But, as with many delicate 
and different films, the challenge is to find a way to convey the movie's 
specialness to them in advance, to convey to them that Beresford does it again, 
which I believe he does. 
</P>
<P>
This challenge, common to all distinctive films, is not made easier by 
Hollywood's penchant for "handicapping" so many upcoming releases with glib 
disregard. How many people went on record last year predicting that "Miss 
Daisy" and "Look Who's Talking" would be among the year's giant winners? 
</P>
<P>
Why are expectations of disaster considered so amusing? People in the industry 
should be encouraging and be delighted when a movie maker dares to be 
different. They should be cognizant that the accuracy of these filmic 
death-wishes is probably substantially less than they might enjoy in calling 
the flip of a coin. 
</P>
<P>
And as they go off merrily to ring the bad-news bells, they might remember John 
Donne's caution as to for whom the bell tolls.

TALMI VENTURES BRUCKNER 7TH IN SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR GUIDES SYMPHONY TO A MAJOR-LEAGUE ORCHESTRAL SOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only the big, the bold and the brave venture Bruckner. 
</P>
<P>
Not every symphony orchestra dares approach the massive and mystical, sprawling 
yet subtle, essentially Wagnerian rhetoric of the unhappy Austrian master. The 
inherent technical demands are as daunting as the interpretive challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Impatient modern audiences, moreover, don't invariably relish sitting still for 
Bruckner's romantic indulgences and developmental convolutions. Not everyone 
finds the lengthy route that leads to the ultimate cathartic cadence heavenly. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Symphony, having endured all manner of fiscal and artistic 
crises, hadn't attempted much Bruckner prior to Friday night, when Yoav Talmi 
programmed the mighty Seventh. An official spokesman admitted that he couldn't 
recall a precedent. A check with the orchestra librarian revealed that this 
repertory hadn't even been attempted by the orchestra since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi, the new music director, obviously is no wimp. Bruckner happens to be one 
of his specialties. He rushed in where many a lesser conductor feared to tread, 
and emerged triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
He proved that the San Diego Symphony, in its present incarnation, is a fine, 
responsive, virtuoso instrument. He played that instrument with poignant 
finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Many conductors use Bruckner primarily as an excuse for muscle flexing and 
conspicuous perspiring. They revel in the extrovert gesture, piling climax upon 
climax. Above all, they make the music thunder. 
</P>
<P>
Although the forces at his command -- especially the brass -- are not exactly 
overpowering, Talmi did not shirk the thunder when it was essential. However, 
he put it in perspective. That perspective focused, with good justification, on 
Bruckner's lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli maestro knows a useful secret: If one performs heroic music with 
sensitivity, even with delicacy, the bombast will take care of itself. There is 
no need to stress the obvious, no advantage to making the grandiose sound 
vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi's beat is clear, his emotive vocabulary restrained. Under his stylish, 
subdued urging, the strings shimmered, the winds sang crisply and the brass 
declaimed with elegant point. 
</P>
<P>
Using the Nowak edition, he sustained transparent textures, balanced the choirs 
with special tact and invariably savored melodic grace. Although he lingered at 
the most poignant melodic flights, he never let tension flag. 
</P>
<P>
He invested Bruckner with the virtues of Schubert, analyzed the vast symphonic 
panorama as if it were chamber music. The 63 minutes passed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The attentive audience that nearly filled Copley Hall gave him an ovation. He 
deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to Bruckner's profundities, Talmi devoted the first half of the 
concert to the elegant charms of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. Ida Levin 
invested the solo lines with sweet if somewhat wispy tone, and the orchestra 
provided deft accompaniment. This was a competent, enlightened performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruckner was more than that.

COUNTERPUNCH: RETAILERS APPLAUD STING'S ALTERNATIVE CD PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAM HOROVITZ, Horovitz is executive vice president of the National Assn. of 
Recording Merchandisers, a trade association representing the wholesale and 
retail segments of the recorded music industry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers would like to go on record as 
applauding A&amp;M and Sting for their willingness to try a packaging 
alternative to the CD longbox. While many packaging prototypes are in 
development, none have yet to reach the marketplace, and the feedback from the 
testing of a new package will be invaluable in helping ultimately to steer the 
industry toward a viable solution for CD packaging. 
</P>
<P>
One of the questions that Patrick Goldstein raised relative to the AGI DigiTrak 
(Pop Eye, Nov. 25) had to do with the ability to recycle the small plastic 
struts that are currently part of the packaging design. NARM stands ready to 
work with A&amp;M on testing the feasibility of recycling these plastic parts. 
</P>
<P>
We should perhaps note that the DigiTrak, even including these small plastic 
struts, constitutes a substantial reduction in the amount of waste when 
compared to the existing 6 x 12-inch package in which 100% of the package is 
discarded. In fact, the goal of every packaging prototype now in development is 
to minimize the discarded portion of the package and to maximize the retained 
portion of the package. 
</P>
<P>
We certainly understand the eagerness of those artists who would like the 
longbox to disappear immediately, but we appreciate Sting's willingness to work 
with us in finding a better package not only for the retailer or the consumer, 
but for the environment as well. This response constitutes an understanding 
that problems of this magnitude are not solved overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the introduction of a new package because it may not be perfect is 
a little like saying, "Don't send food to famine victims unless you can 
guarantee that every mouth will get a bite."

CONTINUUM SAMPLES SOVIET MODERNISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Stalinist period excepted, social realism was not the necessary end of all 
Soviet art. Modernist and avant-garde impulses flourished in unlikely places, 
certainly beyond the pale of official art but not exactly underground either. 
</P>
<P>
Friday evening, the Continuum ensemble from New York offered a sampler of 
Soviet musical modernism -- though nothing by anyone under 55 -- at the 
Schoenberg Institute on the USC campus. 
</P>
<P>
First came a set from the 1920s, beginning with piano character pieces by 
Nicolai Roslavets and Alexander Mosolov, nervously played by Cheryl Seltzer. At 
this point, the unexceptional pieces -- diluted Scriabin and Schoenberg -- have 
more historical than purely musical interest. 
</P>
<P>
Mosolov's "Three Scenes from Childhood" proved much more striking in pictorial 
invention, and were sung by mezzo Ellen Lang with pouting charm and humor. 
</P>
<P>
Names such as Alfred Schnittke are now becoming familiar to us, and his 
shatteringly original Second Violin Sonata -- fierce abstract bangs and 
chitters exploding from tense silences -- has been heard in this hall before. 
Violinist Mia Wu and pianist Joel Sachs delivered it this time with scary zeal. 
</P>
<P>
Leonid Hrabovsky's recent "Kogda" was a Continuum commission, and provides 
expressive work for the group -- Lang, Wu, Seltzer and clarinetist Nathan 
Williams, conducted by Sachs. The settings of nine poems by Velimir Khlebnikov 
are acutely sensitive to the ironies and imagery of the texts, though the 
playing into the piano in the introduction completely failed in its effects. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that may have been due to the acoustical environment, filled with 
extracurricular noises that suggested to attendant wits many variants on the 
title of Edison Denisov's "Pain and Silence." Lang projected the wry, haunted 
gloom of that song cycle with austerity and authority, fluently supported by 
the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Williams demonstrated remarkably pure sound throughout and comprehensive 
resources in his firmly pointed account of Elena Firsova's wild Berio-esque 
solo Sonata. He also combined with Wu and Sachs in a dry reading of Galina 
Ustvolskaya's Trio, two movements of an odd sort of linear proto-minimalism 
followed by an emphatic neo-Baroque finale. JOHN HENKEN

A TRIUMPH AT DOHENY FOR DANIELS AND GARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recital Friday by clarinetist Eddie Daniels and pianist Mike Garson was 
more than your run-of-the-mill concert. It was a one-in-a-million triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the setting: The stunningly handsome Pompeian Room of the Doheny 
Mansion at Mount St. Mary's College, where jazz had never before been heard. 
Consider the repertoire: From Carl Maria von Weber and Francis Poulenc to David 
Raksin, Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
The mainly classical first half was no novelty in itself; Benny Goodman was 
playing Mozart and Bartok in the 1930s. However, the chamber music setting 
(under the auspices of the Da Camera Society), and the incorporation of both 
disciplines in the same concert, lent this occasion a special cachet. 
</P>
<P>
Weber's "Duo Concertante," a demanding work by any standard, was performed 
impeccably by Garson, whose part was particularly demanding, and almost 
flawlessly by Daniels. The Poulenc "Sonata for Clarinet and Piano" succeeded 
even more fully. Separating these works was a medley of David Raksin's "The Bad 
and the Beautiful" and "Laura," played with minimal ornamentation, to the 
delight of the composer, who was in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, the two men simply improvised. If it is true that jazz, 
with its need for instant creation, is the harder of the two art forms to 
master, Daniels and Garson were just the men to prove it. Without rehearsal, 
they moved spontaneously from random abstractions to a series of pop and jazz 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, who several times levitated the salon with an unaccompanied chorus or 
two, has become the total master of one of the most challenging musical 
instruments. He creates fascinating lines that swing implacably, often laced 
with wit and surprises. Garson, though seemingly coming more from a classical 
place, was the ideal partner; his solos were as inventive as his interaction 
with Daniels was intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
The audience, demanding encore after encore, reacted with a standing ovation 
and seemingly would have stayed all night. Many, it seemed, were concert-goers 
who had seldom before listened seriously to jazz on this level. One can only 
hope that with the ice now broken, this splendid room will be the setting for 
more such dual-purpose ventures. LEONARD FEATHER

'WALES' A SLICE OF DYLAN THOMAS WITH SOFTER EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A child's Christmas anywhere always seems to be part miracle. "A Child's 
Christmas in Wales," at the Grove Shakespeare Festival at the Gem, is part 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the show, which opened Friday, had been on the verge of 
cancellation due to a financial shortfall at the theater. It would not have 
opened if an anonymous donor had not stepped forward and provided the 
life-saving $10,000 that, together with a $6,000 grant from the Hyatt Hotels 
and additional contributions from the Garden Grove Fire Fighters and others, 
made it possible for this holiday event to go on as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
This 1982 musicalization of the Thomas work by Jeremy Brooks and Adrian 
Mitchell is in its fifth consecutive year in Garden Grove. It is not what one 
would label a great piece of work -- not enough of the Thomas language is 
allowed to come through -- but it is a show full of everything one likes to 
associate with the holidays: playfulness, warmth, wisdom, humor, caroling and 
goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
As a representation of Thomas' own childhood in the small Welsh seaside village 
of Swansea, it departs from more familiar holiday fare, though not entirely. 
The vigor of the Thomas language we do hear, and the dizzying euphoria of young 
Dylan and his playmates snowballing the neighborhood cats and taunting his coy 
girl cousins (who are better than the boys at ricocheting stones in the 
freezing sea), are a breathless, recognizable image of Christmas as seen 
through the eyes of a young boy, consumed with the exhilaration of that special 
day among special friends. 
</P>
<P>
The aunts, uncles and cousins who come for dinner are nicely delineated 
borderline cartoons we love to love. When Mother burns the Christmas bird and 
it is generously replaced by another from the Hotel Metropole, we relish the 
family moment. But when the show decides to cater to more traditional, 
harmonious visions of familial bliss, it's Dylan-Thomas-meets-Norman-Rockwell 
time, at the expense of the muscular Thomas poetry and Thomas' own keener, 
though not less loving, perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
This occurs chiefly in the Brooks-Mitchell adaptation, which also, mostly 
successfully, has fun imposing gently humorous lyrics on familiar carols. Those 
are the acceptable liberties taken by a show with nothing more complex on its 
mind than to lighten a few hearts. The events as Thomas has them, however, 
avoid saccharin, but Brooks and Mitchell (who developed this in 1982 for the 
Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival) make the experience both more universal and 
more ordinary by blunting its edges. 
</P>
<P>
As a family show, designed as much for children as their parents, it also runs 
on too long, with too many scenes that repeat themselves. Rather than tighten 
and trim, director Thomas F. Bradac has chosen to play along with this 
indulgence and allows snappy Danny Oberbeck as young Dylan (his fifth year in 
the role) to confuse cuteness with brightness. This is compensated some by the 
exemplary Gary Bell, who plays Dylan grown up (and Dylan's father) with a 
patriarchal composure that never slips into the self-important or patronizing. 
</P>
<P>
Neither, indeed, does the production. If Bradac should have been quicker with a 
blue pencil, he has mostly seen to it that what we receive is frolicsome. What 
is wanted -- and next year may provide it -- is something just a little less 
sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The sweetness should be reserved for the "Welsh Tea Time and Pastries" offered 
at the Gem after the matinees of Dec. 16, 23 and 30 (at a charge of $15). 
"Welsh Pub Nights," which happen postperformance in the Gem lounge on Fridays 
and Saturdays and include singing along with the cast, are free.

COMPUTER FIRM NCR TARGET OF AT&amp;T BUYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AT&amp;T, the telecommunications giant that has stumbled in its attempts to 
become a computer industry powerhouse, disclosed Sunday that it has offered $6 
billion for NCR Corp., the nation's fifth-largest computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would be the largest ever computer industry takeover, and the 
second-largest buyout of 1990 after the $6.13-billion agreement to merge MCA 
and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. But the proposed takeover of NCR could 
become messy. 
</P>
<P>
Although AT&amp;T stressed that it wants a friendly takeover, it said that, if 
it cannot reach agreement through negotiation with NCR's directors, it is 
willing to take the matter directly to the company's shareholders. AT&amp;T 
said its offer, which would give NCR shareholders $90 worth of AT&amp;T stock 
for each of their NCR shares, would expire Wednesday. An AT&amp;T spokesman 
said the company will decide then how to proceed and whether a hostile bid is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
NCR officials said late Sunday that they will review the latest proposal, but 
appeared unimpressed with AT&amp;T's $90-a-share offer. AT&amp;T officials said 
discussions between the two companies, which began in earnest about two weeks 
ago, have broken down. 
</P>
<P>
Hostile takeovers in technology are exceedingly rare because so much of the 
value of these companies rests with their employees, who are considered 
unlikely to give their best to an unwelcome suitor. 
</P>
<P>
NCR underscored this point in its statement Sunday by noting that AT&amp;T 
could not hope to combine the computer operations of the two companies under 
NCR's current management and name without the "support and confidence of NCR 
management." 
</P>
<P>
And even friendly technology takeovers have not fared well, especially among 
large companies. Burroughs Corp.'s $4.8-billion purchase of Sperry Univac in 
1986 -- still the largest technology takeover on record -- has been repeatedly 
questioned, as the surviving company, Unisys, continues to slip and suffer huge 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T freely acknowledged Sunday that it wants NCR in order to bolster its 
small and unprofitable presence in the computer industry, a business the giant 
phone company entered in 1984 amid high expections that it would soon rival IBM 
and other computer titans. 
</P>
<P>
However, it never happened that way. 
</P>
<P>
In the last seven years, AT&amp;T has repeatedly fumbled in its attempts to 
successfully create and sell a unified computer product line. And analysts 
estimate that AT&amp;T's computer losses run well into the billions. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said NCR, whose sales this year are expected to exceed $6 billion, 
would give AT&amp;T some much needed market presence in Europe and Asia and 
about double the phone company's computer sales in the United States, where it 
does virtually all of its business. 
</P>
<P>
Further, analysts have noted that NCR, an old company whose original product 
line consisted of cash registers, has a strong business selling computers and 
electronic networks and terminals to financial institutions and retail 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they'd be buying," said John B. Jones, an analyst at Montgomery 
Securities in San Francisco. "AT&amp;T could spend 10 years developing a 
European sales structure and still not get what NCR already has there." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it remains unclear how the deal will sort out. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, NCR informed AT&amp;T that it is "prepared to enter into private 
discussions" on the $90-a-share bid, according to a statement from the phone 
company. But then talks broke down, AT&amp;T said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although AT&amp;T said it is willing to negotiate all aspects of its proposal, 
including price, NCR has since repeatedly refused to meet with either AT&amp;T 
or its advisers," AT&amp;T said. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T released a letter dated Friday from Exley to Allen. In it, the NCR 
chairman said his company's directors rejected AT&amp;T's bid because it felt 
it was too low and out of concern over "the strategic and business logic" of a 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
Exley said in the letter that NCR would reconsider an AT&amp;T offer if it was 
increased. He did not say what price would be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
And in a statement released Sunday night, Exley appeared to criticize 
AT&amp;T's public disclosure of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"No ultimatum or demand will likely win that support or confidence. And no 
ultimatum or demand will intimidate the board of directors of NCR into doing a 
disservice to the company, its customers, shareholders and employees," Exley 
said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T also released a letter from Allen to Exley dated Sunday. In it, Allen 
said AT&amp;T was committed to completing a merger, and called on NCR to give 
information that would justify a higher offering price. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T said its $90-a-share bid represented an 88% premium over NCR's share 
price of $48 on Nov. 7, the day before reports of a rumored AT&amp;T bid for 
NCR appeared in the media. On Friday, NCR shares closed at $56.75 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current merger proposal, AT&amp;T's computer line would be combined 
with NCR's, and NCR would continue to operate under its own name from its 
Dayton, Ohio, headquarters, AT&amp;T said. AT&amp;T said it did not expect to 
close any NCR facilities. 
</P>
<P>
NCR, which has about 56,000 employees, announced this fall a strategic change 
in its computer line in which it will replace its proprietary machines with 
so-called open systems, which adhere to computer-industry standards and can 
work easily with models made by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
NCR's move was the most dramatic so far among old-line computer companies to 
deal with the computer industry's move toward open systems. 
</P>
<P>
NCR, formerly National Cash Register, also is a leading maker of automated 
banking machines and cash registers. It earned $412 million on overall revenue 
of $5.96 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T, with about 279,000 employees, entered the computer business six years 
ago as a result of the breakup of the old Bell System. But it never met the 
expectations of some observers that it would become one of the major computer 
makers.

GARFIELD STAYS HOME IN ERROR; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: A SCORING MISTAKE IN THE CITY CHAMPIONSHIPS KEPT THE BOYS' TEAM 
FROM RUNNING IN THE STATE MEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A scoring error in the City Section boys' cross-country championship Nov. 17 
deprived Garfield High School of an opportunity to compete in the state meet 
nine days ago. 
</P>
<P>
There was no attempt to rectify the error, nor was it disclosed to the parties 
involved at the time, even though it was found on Nov. 20, four days before the 
state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills Taft had originally been announced as scoring 115 points, second 
to champion Belmont, with Garfield third at 117. Three days later, a computer 
check of hand scoring showed that Garfield and Taft actually tied, 107-107, and 
Garfield should have been the runner-up because of a better finish by its 
sixth-place -- or first non-scoring -- runner. 
</P>
<P>
Taft and Belmont advanced to the state meet at Fresno, at which Belmont 
finished fourth and Taft sixth in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
City Section Director Hal Harkness said that, according to City rules, results 
announced after the meet at Pierce College in Woodland Hills were official, and 
when the mistake was discovered it was too late to correct because the entries 
to the state meet had been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the rules, any challenge to the scores would have to be made at 
the meet," Harkness said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a computer malfunction, only team totals and the top 15 finishers 
were posted at the City meet. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness declined to identify the scorer for the meet, saying only it was a 
veteran at the job. 
</P>
<P>
"If I wanted to hide (the error), I would have never mailed out the results," 
Harkness said. "It would have been easy, and no one would have figured it out. 
It's an unfortunate situation, but it's not the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Tell that to Garfield's runners. 
</P>
<P>
"There were about 20 kids in the office when we started adding up the scores, 
and when we found out we should have run in the state meet, the entire room was 
silent," Garfield Coach Steve Wright said. "Everybody has an empty feeling. Six 
out of my seven top runners are seniors, and it was their dream to run in the 
state meet. They worked hard and earned the right. They didn't go." 
</P>
<P>
Results were mailed over Thanksgiving and were not received by most coaches 
until Nov. 26, two days after the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the ten boys team scores behind Belmont deviate from the original 
results, but only the second and third-place standings were affected. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 team scores in the girls' race were incorrect, but scoring did not 
affect the qualifying teams. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness believes that the error might have occurred because non-scoring 
runners -- teams were allowed up to 10 runners, though only the top five scores 
should have counted -- were included. He added that only Wright had contacted 
him about the error. 
</P>
<P>
Taft Coach Mel Hein was not aware of the situation until contacted by The Times 
late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dumbfounded," he said. "I feel awful for Garfield because they deserved 
the trip. It's after the fact, but I'm absolutely shocked that nothing was 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Harkness said that the inscription on Garfield's trophies and City records 
would be changed to reflect the tie for second.

BRUINS EARN NCAA SOCCER TITLE

<P>
Before the 1990 collegiate season began, UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid told a few 
close coaching friends that his Bruins had enough talent to win another NCAA 
Division I soccer championship. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, after 150 minutes of scoreless play that included four overtimes, 
Schmid's premonition was fulfilled at the University of South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins beat Rutgers, 4-3, on penalty kicks to claim a second NCAA 
championship. UCLA won the first time, 1-0, over American University in eight 
five-minute overtimes in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The first NCAA tournament games decided by penalty kicks gave UCLA a title even 
though the Bruins were scoreless in 270 minutes Saturday or Sunday. In 
Saturday's semifinal against North Carolina State, UCLA won on penalty kicks, 
5-3, after two scoreless overtimes. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, freshman Jorge Salcedo's penalty kick -- UCLA's fourth -- slid under 
the cross bar, ending a 3-hour 20-minute match which degenerated as time went 
on because of fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"I said we were a team of destiny, and you've got to be lucky to win anything 
in a cup competition," Schmid said. "I don't want to see a lot more of those 
(penalty-kick) games." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (19-1-4) and Rutgers (20-3-2) played give-and-take through the first 90 
minutes, the Bruins taking control of the tempo after 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But Rutgers defended staunchly and used a little luck to push the game to 
penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Billy Thompson hit the post in the 84th minute, Joe Max-Moore missed 
wide from eight yards in the 114th minute and Paul Ratcliffe watched as a 
defender deflected what seemed a sure goal in the 137th minute. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Alexi Lalas' header off the bar in the 105th minute was Rutgers' 
only clear-cut chance. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, penalty kicks were the only way to decide the game. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting first, Lino DiCuollo of Rutgers scored, but UCLA's Sam George shot 
weakly, with Rutgers' Bill Androcki saving. 
</P>
<P>
Max-Moore scored in the second round to tie the kicks, 1-1, after Rutgers' 
Steve Rammel missed wide. When Dave Mueller of Rutgers shot high and Tim 
Gallegos of UCLA scored, the Bruins led 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers' Maurice Mazzocchi converted the fourth attempt, and UCLA's Chris 
Henderson matched him, keeping the Bruins ahead 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Beach kept Rutgers alive temporarily with a third conversion, leaving it 
up to Salcedo. 
</P>
<P>
There was never a doubt. The midfielder from Cerritos blasted a high, 
right-center shot directly under the bar.

If Devon White ever fulfills the infinite promise the Angels saw in him, it 
will be in another uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Finally conceding they can't wring out of him more than flashes of the 
brilliance he showed as a rookie in 1987, the Angels on Sunday traded White to 
Toronto in the first transaction of the annual winter meetings. In an effort to 
improve their offensive and defensive performance at second base, the Angels 
gave up White, reliever Willie Fraser and a minor leaguer to be named in 
exchange for switch-hitting outfielder Junior Felix, infielder Luis Sojo and 
another minor leaguer to be named. 
</P>

White, who will be 28 later this month, made an impressive debut in 1987, when 
he hit .263 with 24 home runs, 87 RBIs and 32 stolen bases. His batting average 
slipped to .217 this season, and he exceeded 100 strikeouts for the third time 
in four seasons despite a demotion to triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"After the whole year I went through, with all the ups and downs and going to 
the minors, I felt maybe this was best for the Angels and for Devon White," he 
said by phone from his home in Mesa, Ariz. "It's a fresh start. . . . It would 
have been embarrassing to me, after what I hit, to have come back." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto General Manager Pat Gillick hopes the artificial surface on the Blue 
Jays' Skydome field will help White's offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're looking to Devon White for defense. We're not concerned about 
his offense," Gillick said. "I think we have enough offense to carry Devon 
White, no matter what he hits. Our one big problem last year was defense, and 
Devon White will help that. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see guys with that kind of talent very much. You've got to take a 
gamble once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Fraser, who had a career-best 3.08 earned-run average in 45 relief appearances 
last season, could not be reached Sunday. Toronto Manager Cito Gaston said 
Fraser will be given a chance to become the Blue Jays' fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, 23, hit .263 with 15 home runs and 65 RBIs in 127 games last season. He 
played mostly right field, although the Angels plan to use him in center field. 
Sojo, 24, hit .225 in 33 games in Toronto after being promoted in July from 
triple-A Syracuse, for which he batted .296. His addition spells a probable end 
to Johnny Ray's tenure at second, a stretch distinguished by Ray's hitting but 
marred by his minimal fielding skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on everything we've been given, Sojo will set up as an almost ideal No. 
2 hitter," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "Felix probably has the God-given 
ability to hit third. His speed and power are the classical qualities for him 
to hit third." 
</P>
<P>
Felix's talent hasn't been doubted, but his attitude has. He was widely 
considered a temperamental player who was difficult to coach. Said a general 
manager who requested anonymity, "Our people feel they're (Felix and Soho) very 
talented young players, but at this point in their careers, they're very, very 
undisciplined players." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels and Blue Jays discussed various combinations of players for nearly 
two months before reaching an agreement late Sunday. According to General 
Manager Mike Port, trading White meant the Angels "may be giving up yards of 
defense for miles of offense," but it's an equation he accepted to get the 
improvement he considered vital at second base. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, Sojo was the guy from our standpoint that we wanted," Port said. 
"This was equitable and gave us the infielder we were really after. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's well acknowledged that Toronto is getting a man of superb physical 
ability (in White). Maybe we just didn't find the right key." 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Sojo could be the key to several other moves by the Angels. 
"This is the one we wanted to get done because it frees us to do other things," 
Angel President Richard Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the club is likely to complete another deal he described as 
"smaller in stature," during the meetings. Among the moves being contemplated 
is the signing of Dave Henderson, who is expected to be granted new-look free 
agency. Should the Angels sign Henderson, they could play Felix in right field. 
If they don't sign Henderson, the Angels' outfield could consist of Luis 
Polonia in left, Felix in center and Dave Winfield in right. 
</P>
<P>
After filling the Angels' hole at second, Port planned to turn his attention 
toward finding a third baseman and acquiring backups at various positions. 
Happy as he was to make the trade, he harbored a deep regret that the Angels 
never fully mined White's talents. 
</P>
<P>
"If he ever gets it together with any degree of consistency, you're talking 
about superstar capabilities," Port said. "(The trade) came down to equity in 
terms of positions and quality of player. . . . We know we're giving up 
something defensively in center field but we're picking up something 
offensively. Maybe Toronto will be able to get out of him the endless potential 
Devon possesses."

TOUCHDOWNS -- INCLUDING A 62-YARD RUN.

<P>
Raider tailback Bo Jackson, who celebrated his 28th birthday Friday, doesn't 
want to age like a mere mortal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's depressing," Jackson said. "I'm getting old. I don't like that. I wish I 
could stay 15 forever." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Jackson is immune from aging, but when he is old and gray, he can take 
out the video disc and show his grandchildren his 62-yard touchdown run in the 
Raiders' 23-20 victory over the Denver Broncos Sunday at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened so fast I don't know what happened, really," Jackson said when 
asked to describe the run, his longest of the season. "All I know is that we 
ran an off-tackle play to the right and I cut it back and saw orange flashes go 
past and as I cut across the grain. I slipped a couple of tackles and the field 
was open. I guess I wanted to get into the end zone worse than they wanted to 
stop me." 
</P>
<P>
Although it was designed as a simple play over the right side of the Raider 
line, Jackson improvised. 
</P>
<P>
Tacking the handoff, Jackson reversed his field, cutting back to the other 
side. Bronco safety Steve Atwater had a shot at Jackson, but he squirmed free 
of Atwater's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo's a great football player and that was simply a great run," Atwater said. 
"We missed a couple of tackles and he ran through some." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also broke two other tackles on the touchdown sprint. Jackson also 
eluded cornerback Wymon Henderson and linebacker Ronnie Haliburton. 
</P>
<P>
Bronco Coach Dan Reeves criticized his players for poor tackling technique on 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo Jackson is a great runner and I'm not taking anything from him when I say 
that we didn't tackle well today," Reeves said. "We had people trying to hit 
him with shoulder pads and helmets. We have to develop better fundamentals, 
especially when you have to face a 240-pound running back." 
</P>
<P>
Raider tailback Marcus Allen, who threw a key block on Jackson's touchdown run, 
was the first to congratulate Jackson, who rushed for 117 yards in 13 carries 
and scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad Bo had a good game today because we needed it," Allen said. "He 
stepped forward today." 
</P>
<P>
After spending most of the first half on the sideline while Allen was playing, 
Jackson faced a tired Bronco defense. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who carried only twice for 19 yards in the first half, rushed for 98 
yards in 11 carries and two touchdowns in the second half. It was the first 
time that Jackson had scored since he ran for two touchdowns in his first game 
of the season, against the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson carried two more times in the second half against the Broncos than he 
carried in the Raiders' loss to Kansas City last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure every running back that was out there would like to play the whole 
game," Jackson said. "But I'm not making the calls. You've got to talk to 
(Coach) Art Shell about that." 
</P>
<P>
Shell said Jackson didn't play much in the first half because the Raiders had 
only three offensive series. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was difficult to stay warm on a day when the wind-chill factor was 
eight degrees, Jackson said he was warmed up when he entered the game with 1:49 
remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's tough," Allen said. "My hat's off to Bo. It was cold out there." 
</P>
<P>
Did Jackson have an advantage because he was fresh in the second half, while 
the crippled Bronco defense was tired? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Jackson said. "I think they hit me just as hard in the fourth quarter as 
they hit Marcus in the first two quarters." 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders' game plan may have provided Jackson with an edge in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
After quarterback Jay Schroeder completed eight of 11 passes for 98 yards in 
the first half, the Raiders all but abandoned the pass, throwing for 66 yards 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
With the Broncos expecting Schroeder to throw, the Raiders, who rushed for only 
49 yards in the first half, got 99 yards on the ground in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders trailing, 10-7, in the third quarter, Jackson put the Raiders 
ahead for good when he scored on an 11-yard run with 8:43 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson sidestepped linebacker Michael Brooks before he stumbled into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I was going to score because I couldn't see over my 
shoulders," Jackson said. "I didn't know if someone was coming from my left or 
if someone was going to come from behind. I just went all out." 
</P>
<P>
Raider guard Max Montoya said Jackson didn't get much blocking on the run. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable," Montoya said. "We probably didn't block two or three 
guys. I still don't know how he got it in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who had a good view of the play, said, "I'm just in awe when I watch 
him do that."

ELLARD LEARNS RAMS' HISTORY BY MAKING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It used to be no fun playing Ram trivia with Henry Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Fears? 
</P>
<P>
Ellard kept waiting for you to finish the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Legs Hirsch? 
</P>
<P>
Some New York guy who sells used microwave ovens, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I never followed the Rams growing up," says Ellard, who grew up in Fresno. "I 
didn't know much about them. I was a Cowboy fan. The only time I watched the 
Rams was when Rod Perry, who used to play for Fresno State, started playing for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard is still no master of Ram football history, but he now has a better 
grasp of it. Ellard has done post-graduate work, field research. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he not only knows who Fears and Hirsch are, but where they are as well 
-- behind him in the Ram record book. 
</P>
<P>
A solitary high note in this broken record of a Ram season, Ellard is the one 
Ram who has broken records. On Oct. 21 against Atlanta, he surpassed Hirsch for 
most pass-receiving yards in a Ram career and now has a total of 6,657. Sunday, 
Ellard ran down Fears as well, catching six passes for a total of 402 
receptions as a Ram -- two more than Fears. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard knows Fears and Hirsch both have busts in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
What he doesn't know is what this means for Henry Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, m-a-a-n," Ellard says as he leans away from the questioner. "I don't even 
want to think about that. That'll drive me crazy. When I retire, I'll think 
about it then. But think about it now and you'll go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett is consulted for a second opinion. For the past five years, Everett 
has been Ellard's partner in the express delivery business. Everett is the man 
who pitched to Ellard on the field and pitches for him off it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't predict the future, but there's no doubt Henry deserves a special 
place for what he's doing for the Los Angeles Rams," Everett says. "There is 
not enough I can say about what he offers a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"He can run any type of route you want to throw -- square-ins, a come-back on 
the outside, a little hitch-and-go. He's so versatile in the routes he runs, so 
precise. . . . Truly, he's the best receiver I've ever thrown to." 
</P>
<P>
That includes Flipper Anderson, who already has begun chasing Ellard's numbers 
and wants you to know it. Observing the media mob around Ellard's locker after 
the Rams' 38-23 victory over Cleveland, Anderson grinned and called out, 
"Better tell him he better not retire, because I'm going to come and get that 
record." 
</P>
<P>
Someday. Maybe. But for the moment, Ellard is the champ, Anderson the 
challenger -- and Everett can appreciate the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Flipper's a fine receiver," Everett said. "Henry's an excellent one. Flipper 
will get better, but Henry is Henry. When he's in there, he makes our offense 
better. Henry makes it very balanced." 
</P>
<P>
Everett knows, having learned the hard way. Bothered by a sore right hamstring, 
Ellard played sparingly against the New York Giants and the Cowboys, catching 
four short passes. Last week against San Francisco, he didn't play at all. Over 
the same span, Everett failed to throw a touchdown pass -- culminating a 
five-game stretch during which Everett reached the end zone only once. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Ellard was back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Everett passed for four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
None went to Ellard, but Ellard helped make them possible. "Henry balances us 
out," Everett said. "When he's in there, I can throw to either end. That opens 
it up for me, and it opens up our running game, too." 
</P>
<P>
The completion that broke the record, Reception No. 401, was vintage Ellard: A 
crisp 13-yard out pattern, a sprawling grab inches above the cold Cleveland 
Stadium turf, a Ram first down at the Brown one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
One play later, Cleveland Gary scored off right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Gary carried a different football, though. The one Ellard caught was pulled out 
of play and tossed to the Ram sideline, destined for the Ellard family den. 
</P>
<P>
"This one I'm going to keep," Ellard announced. "The other one (for the yardage 
record) went to my mother and father. They've got theirs. I think I'll hold on 
to this one." 
</P>
<P>
After holding on to 400 others, it's not too much to ask. 
</P>
<P>
Still eight months shy of his 30th birthday, Ellard already owns most of the 
Ram receiving records worth owning. In 1988, he caught 86 passes to put away 
the franchise single-season mark. 
</P>
<P>
The receiver who never followed the Rams as a kid now has every other Ram 
receiver following him. 
</P>
<P>
Can there be any more milestones to meet? 
</P>
<P>
How about meeting the men behind the milestones? 
</P>
<P>
"I know about them now. If you look through the record book, Fears and Hirsch 
is pretty much all you see," Ellard said. "But I've never met them, either one. 
I hope someday to get the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
A few years down the line, maybe they can all do lunch in Canton.

DODGER OFFER TO DORAN: THREE YEARS, $5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The acquisition of Luis Sojo Sunday night left the Angels feeling they filled 
their need at second base. 
</P>
<P>
A Dodger move at that position may not be imminent, but club and other sources 
said Sunday that the extent of the club's interest in free-agent infielder Bill 
Doran can be measured by the following: 
</P>
<P>
They have made a three-year offer estimated at $5 million after recently flying 
Doran, 32, to Los Angeles to have his back checked by Dr. Frank Jobe. 
</P>
<P>
Doran, traded by the Houston Astros to the Cincinnati Reds in August, had 
surgery in late September for an abscess in a degenerative disk. 
</P>
<P>
The offer confirms he was cleared by Jobe and that the club wasn't swayed by 
Juan Samuel's .377 September awakening that improved his average to .242. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel is also a free agent and also represented by Jim Turner, Doran's agent. 
</P>
<P>
"My acknowledgement of the Dodgers' interest in Doran tells you that Samuel is 
no longer their choice at second base," Turner said. "What can I say? The facts 
are the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president, said Samuel was still an 
option, but added: 
</P>
<P>
"When I look at the makeup of our team -- and this is not meant as a criticism 
of Samuel -- I think that the defensive aspect at second base has to be the 
most important consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Has to be, Claire meant, because the Dodgers intend to play inexperienced Jose 
Offerman at shortstop and feel they need the reliability of a Doran at second. 
The Dodgers' current options are Samuel or a platoon of Lenny Harris and Mike 
Sharperson. 
</P>
<P>
Claire wouldn't confirm it, but the Dodgers are likely to offer arbitration to 
Samuel by the Dec. 7 deadline, which does the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Extends their negotiating rights to Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offers Samuel the chance to return to the Dodgers for a year (an unlikely 
scenario because he is expected to receive multiyear opportunities elsewhere). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Protects the club's compensation rights if Samuel signs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Nine teams, Turner said, have asked for medical reports on Doran, and two -- 
the Dodgers and Reds -- have made offers, with more expected. The Toronto Blue 
Jays, after trading Sojo, acknowledged a strong interest in Doran. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who are believed willing to deal outfielder Kal Daniels, met with 
the New York Yankees among other teams Sunday, with speculation centered on the 
possible reacquisition of second baseman Steve Sax. Fred Claire said it was an 
exploratory meeting and refused to confirm interest in Sax, who had been No. 1 
on the Angels' wish list. Yankee General Manager Gene Michael said he would 
only trade Sax if overwhelmed by an offer. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Dodger Kirk Gibson is guaranteed $3.65 million via his two-year contract 
with the Kansas City Royals. He will get a $400,000 signing bonus and salaries 
of $1.5 million and $1.75 million. He can make another $580,000 in appearance 
bonuses. . . . The commissioner's office announced that an agreement in 
principle has been reached with the minor leagues on a new player development 
contract, apparently ending their bargaining impasse.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: PERSONALITY CLASH BLAMED IN CHANNEL 
39 RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KNSD-TV (Channel 39) employees learned of the sudden departure of News Director 
Don Shafer early Thursday, when a terse memo from General Manager Neil Derrough 
was posted in the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say more than a few jaws dropped to the floor," said one newsroom 
source, who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Shafer made both friends and enemies during his 18-month tenure, but few 
suspected his job was in jeopardy. Although the memo said Shafer had left 
voluntarily, in an interview Thursday, Shafer confirmed that he had been asked 
to resign. 
</P>
<P>
In the newsroom, speculation immediately centered on Shafer's relationship with 
Derrough. Neither Derrough nor Shafer wanted to comment on specifics, but 
Shafer did say, "You have to get along with your boss." 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that Shafer and Derrough agreed on general philosophy -- 
the hard-news emphasis that Shafer brought to the newscasts -- but they are 
vastly different in terms of personal style. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrough is an uptown, New York City kind of guy and Shafer is not," said one 
newsroom source. 
</P>
<P>
With the situation at Channel 39 once again tense, to say the least, newsroom 
personnel interviewed for this story did not want to be quoted by name. But 
they made it clear that Derrough simply didn't mesh with Shafer, the veteran 
news director he hired to give the station a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
Within the industry, Shafer was largely perceived as a hatchet man when he 
first arrived at Channel 39 from KOLD-TV, the CBS affiliate in Tucson. A 
well-traveled veteran of the industry with a background in law enforcement, 
Shafer revamped the newsroom, firing several longtime reporters, such as Cathy 
Clark and John Britton. 
</P>
<P>
Shafer also brought a serious news focus to the station, particularly 
emphasizing "cops and robbers" news. He gave Paul Bloom leeway for his 
oft-criticized "Crime Watch" segments, as well as allowing sinced-departed 
reporter Bill Ritter freedom to pursue an array of topics. 
</P>
<P>
Although many in the newsroom were wary of Shafer's often abrasive style, a 
large contingent also respected his news judgment and the stability he brought. 
</P>
<P>
A large man with an often gruff manner, Shafer spent 20 years working within 
the slick and competitive corporate structure of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"Don has a huge bark to him, but he is kind of a big puppy," said one source. 
"The toughness he brought to the newsroom just melted around Neil." 
</P>
<P>
Derrough emphasizes meetings and communication among staffers, neither of which 
were Shafer strongpoints, a source said. Shafer's relationship with lead 
anchorman Marty Levin also was known to be strained, which certainly didn't 
help him. 
</P>
<P>
In the newsroom, it is widely believed that Channel 39's stilted coverage of 
the verdict in the Betty Broderick trial two weeks ago was Shafer's death 
knell. Channel 39 had made a big deal of the Broderick trial, televising 
portions of it live during the sweeps month. But when the hung jury was 
announced, Channel 39 seemed unprepared. Its coverage was brief and tentative, 
and the station was off the air while the competition was still reporting live 
from the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The mishaps reportedly were largely due to technical problems, but several 
people at the station were upset. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Neil was furious about the Broderick case," said a source. "I think 
that was just the final straw." 
</P>
<P>
Derrough downplayed his personal problems with Shafer, saying only that he felt 
the newsroom needed someone new to take it to the next level. But he emphasized 
that he was in no way interested in changing the station's "straight to you" 
news philosophy. And he offered the job to the employee most closely linked to 
Shafer, Irv Kass, who has been Shafer's right-hand man for a decade. He worked 
with him at several stations before joining him at Channel 39. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Friday, Kass declined to comment, even to say whether or not he had 
accepted the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Irv is a much more measured, thoughtful kind of guy" than Shafer, a source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the timing of Shafer's removal, coming the day after the end of the 
most important ratings sweeps month of the year, was no accident. The station 
will have a breather before entering the next sweeps period in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
But after an unusual few months of stability, Channel 39 employees now are left 
to wonder what is going to happen next. If Kass doesn't take the job, it could 
lead to months of turmoil and indecision at a station that has suffered through 
both for far too many years. 
</P>
<P>
KNSD-TV (Channel 39) could be excused for prominently using pictures of Charlie 
Rose in its November ads for "Personalities." It received word of Rose's 
departure from the show too late to change the ads. 
</P>
<P>
But ads during the November sweeps period for "A Current Affair" spotlighted a 
huge photo of smarmy anchorman Maury Povich. Povich hasn't been on the show for 
weeks, and it's widely known that's he's not coming back. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it on purpose," said Channel 39 promotions director Doug Gilmore. "I 
didn't think a picture (of the new anchorwoman) conveyed 'A Current Affair' as 
much as Maury." 
</P>
<P>
Two points for honesty. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8's Larry Himmel says he has received a contract offer from Fox 
Television. If he can work out a deal, he would work on a new game show being 
developed for the Los Angeles market. He also would have a chance to develop a 
"San Diego at Large" type of show. Nothing is definite. Himmel said he might 
even be able to take the gig and stay at Channel 8, although it would be 
difficult to continue his morning show on KIFM (98.1). His contract with KIFM 
expires Jan. 1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 10 General Manager Ed Quinn and former Channel 8 anchorwoman Allison 
Ross recently were spotted having dinner together. Perhaps a little discussion 
about a job over appetizers? Not so, says Quinn. "It was more just staying in 
touch." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The XTRA-FM (91X) morning team of Jeff Prescott and Mike Berger spent most of a 
morning last week doing jokes about flatulence, which pretty well sums up the 
current level of their humor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KUSI-TV (Channel 51) has started to operate like a real local television 
station, televising such community events as the Mother Goose Parade and the 
San Diego Marathon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Several TV news operations reported the story of MTV's refusal to air Madonna's 
new video by showing clips from the piece, which was considered too racy for 
MTV. Channel 10, in particular, registered its disgust by airing lengthy 
portions of it.

LAMB'S PLAYERS' HOLIDAY SHOW ANOTHER WINNER

<P>
Smooth and easy. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Cederberg Meads' newest script for the "Lamb's Players Festival of 
Christmas" -- the name always given for Lamb's Players Theatre's annual and 
usually new Christmas play -- goes down like a glass of unlaced eggnog: thick, 
sweet and creamy. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for anything challenging, cynical or ironic here. But like a good TV 
sitcom writer, Meads, who has written eight new scripts for the 13th annual 
"Lamb's Players Festival of Christmas" (five have been repeated), has developed 
a deft hand at keeping the laughs and tear-jerk sentiment flowing. 
</P>
<P>
All "Festival of Christmas" shows have this much in common: they are set on 
Christmas eve (the year and the place can be anywhere), they work in a full 
sampler of Christmas carols, they deal with Christmas and the Christmas spirit, 
and they are designed to leave audiences with a warm and fuzzy feeling. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's show, set on Christmas Eve, 1952, an amateur singing group from 
Dubuque, Iowa, wins a spot on a live television broadcast in New York City much 
to the television director's dismay. When all of the director's stars, guest 
stars and supporting cast are snowed out, the amateur singing group ends up 
doing the entire show solo. 
</P>
<P>
And because "A Festival of Christmas" always has a happy ending, no one should 
be surprised when -- surprise -- the amateur group does a terrific job. One of 
the female singers becomes an overnight sensation. The other female singer, 
given the chance to leave her job as a checkout girl at the Piggly Wiggly in 
Dubuque for a starring spot on this series, turns it down because she doesn't 
want to leave Dubuque or her boyfriend. And nearly everyone else finds their 
true love and the true spirit of Christmas in the course of the show. 
</P>
<P>
And because Meads does such a top-notch job at leavening the cliches with 
nearly nonstop verbal or visual humor (just try not to laugh at the commercial 
jingle with three of the actors playing a giant dancing toothbrush and two 
dancing teeth), she gets away with it. The direction of Robert Smyth, Lamb's 
artistic director, is similarly sure -- moving quickly from punch line to punch 
line in Act I, slowing the pace to lard the jokes with the required messages, 
morals and Christmas sentiment in Act II. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the audience even pulled out their handkerchiefs and cried when one of 
the characters made an impromptu speech about missing her father who was off 
fighting in Korea. With many local families missing a husband, son, father or 
brother in the Persian Gulf this holiday season, this scene may well have 
struck a responsive chord. 
</P>
<P>
The acting is usually a dependable pleasure at Lamb's, where the company relies 
upon a year-round ensemble and guest artists familiar to the company. This 
cast, which adds a few talented newcomers, is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
As the amateur singing group, Deborah Gilmour Smyth, Tom Stephenson, Leigh 
Scarritt and Arthur Morton, do a terrific job as the rubes overwhelmed by their 
big break in the big city. Gregory Adams is delightfully oily as the show's 
singing star, Steve Fairfield, a man passionately in love -- with himself. 
Darlene Trent is sweetly overbearing as the commercial sponsor's wife whose 
bright-eyed ideas drive the theater director (a spluttering, anxiety-wracked 
David Cochran Heath) to distraction. Ted Deasy has some choice moments as 
Frankie, the beaten-down technical manager who, when pushed to the breaking 
point by the director, gives back some of his own -- with interest. 
</P>
<P>
The cast's voices are lovely and do well by the dozen Christmas songs in the 
show. Vanda Eggington, who is credited with composing some memorable melodies, 
provided the excellent musical direction and many of the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Buckley did the simple, satisfying set design and Veronica Murphy Smith 
gets the nod for some of the outrageously funny costumes -- dancing sugarplums 
and, of course, that marvelous toothbrush and teeth. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the most remarkable elements in this production is the show's 
demonstration of how well Lamb's knows how to give its audience just what they 
want. By the time this review appears, tickets will only be available for five 
of the remaining 33 performances: the Dec. 18-21 matinees at 2 and a Christmas 
Eve performance Dec. 24 at 7:30 p.m. Yes, even the 10 a.m. Saturday 
performances are already sold out. 
</P>
<P>
That's because most "Lamb's Players Festival of Christmas" fans don't sit 
around waiting for the reviews. Even when the script is brand new, like this 
one, they know what to expect. And once again, they won't be disappointed. 
</P>

SPOTLIGHT / A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL; 
</P>
<P>
NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New England Patriots set some standards they probably would have wanted to 
avoid in their 37-7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Patriots set a team 
record with their 10th consecutive defeat, a feat performed in front of the 
smallest crowd in the NFL so far this season. The attendance of 26,280 undercut 
the previous low of 28,924 for the Indianapolis Colts' game at New England Nov. 
11. Kansas City also set an NFL record with its sixth blocked punt. The victory 
was Kansas City's fourth in its past five games. Stephone Paige scored on an 
86-yard pass play from Steve DeBerg on the Chiefs' first play from scrimmage. 
It was Paige's longest reception in his eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals' 16-12 victory over Pittsburgh denied Steeler Coach 
Chuck Noll his 200th regular-season victory in 22 seasons. It was Cincinnati's 
sixth consecutive victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Bills sacked Philadelphia quarterback Randall Cunningham six times 
in a 30-23 victory, ending the Eagles' winning streak at five games. Jim Kelly, 
with 334 yards passing, had his first 300-yard passing day of the season. James 
Lofton caught five of his passes for 174 yards to move into third place on the 
all-time receiving yardage list with 11,889, passing Don Maynard. Cunningham 
threw the NFL's longest touchdown of the season, a 95-yarder to Fred Barnett, 
but the Bills' heavy pass rush kept him from bringing Philadelphia back. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett ended a string of three games without a touchdown with four 
touchdown passes in the Rams' 38-23 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Henry 
Ellard led Ram receivers with six catches for 90 yards, giving him a 
team-record 402 receptions. He broke Tom Fears' record of 400. The loss was 
Cleveland's sixth in a row at home, a team record. 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde passed for 351 yards in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 23-17 
victory over Atlanta, handing the Falcons their fifth consecutive defeat and 
their 17th consecutive loss on the road. The victory ended the Buccaneers' 
six-game losing streak. Willie Drewrey's 89-yard touchdown reception from 
Testaverde was the longest in Tampa Bay history, breaking the record of 84 
yards from Doug Williams to Kevin House against Detroit in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Butler's field goal with 33 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter 
against Detroit was the 128th of career and tied him for the team record with 
Bob Thomas. Chicago quarterback Jim Harbaugh has thrown 146 consecutive passes 
without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Art Monk caught 10 passes in the Redskins' victory over Miami, 
giving him 112 consecutive games with at least one reception. Gary Clark caught 
three passes to give him 402 receptions in six NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
With three receptions for 25 yards against Dallas, New Orleans wide receiver 
Eric Martin became the Saints' all-time leader in receiving yards. He has 321 
receptions for 4,890 yards, breaking the record of 4,875 yards in 309 
receptions set by Danny Abramowicz. Saint kicker Morten Anderson has scored in 
106 consecutive games. He kicked field goals of 43 and 50 yards and had one 
extra point. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Marion Butts gained 159 yards in 26 carries against the New York 
Jets to become the seventh player in Charger history to rush for more than 
1,000 yard in a season. He has 1,154 yards this year. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Johnson's 42-yard field goal in overtime gave Seattle a 13-10 victory over 
the Houston Oilers. It was the fourth time the Seahawks had their game decided 
on the final play. They've won three of them, including a 13-10 victory at San 
Diego last Sunday on Johnson's 40-yard field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROLE REVERSALS 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday, the Miami Dolphins had the leading defense in the NFL; the 
Cincinnati Bengals' defense was No. 26 in the league. Chances are they'll be 
ranked a little closer this week. Earnest Byner ran for 157 yards and three 
touchdowns and the Washington Redskins riddled the Dolphins for 467 total yards 
in a 42-20 victory. The Redskins, who had three consecutive long scoring drives 
to take a 21-0 lead, had 222 rushing yards against a defense that had been 
giving up only 85 a game. Byner became the first player to rush for more 100 
yards against the Dolphins. Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien almost doubled the 
Miami season total for passing touchdowns allowed. Rypien threw three touchdown 
passes; the Dolphins had only given up four and had not allowed a touchdown 
through the air in five games. 
</P>
<P>
At Pittsburgh, the Steelers made the Bengals look their best, again. The 
Steelers had apparently righted their early-season offensive problems more than 
a month ago with one-sided victories over the Rams and Atlanta Falcons. Then 
they played the Bengals and were held without a touchdown in a 27-3 loss. The 
next week, the Steelers got back on track with a 24-7 victory over the Jets 
before Sunday's rematch with the Bengals. Cincinnati prevented a touchdown 
again with a 16-12 victory. The Steelers haven't scored a touchdown against the 
Bengals in 11 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller suffered a broken right clavicle in the third 
quarter against New Orleans and probably will not be able to throw for four or 
five months, Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville said. . . . Pittsburgh tackle Tunch 
Ilkin, sidelined for a month with a dislocated elbow, left in the third quarter 
against Cincinnati with a bruised back. . . . Detroit cornerback Bruce McNorton 
suffered a broken left arm in the first half against Chicago. . . . Phoenix 
running back Johnny Johnson left the game against Indianapolis in the second 
quarter after aggravating a twisted right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BRADSHAW FACTOR 
</P>
<P>
Former Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Terry Bradshaw minced no words on "The 
NFL Today" on CBS before the Rams played the Browns at Cleveland Stadium. 
Bradshaw questioned the wisdom of Bernie Kosar's complaining about the 
dedication of his teammates and the Browns' management after last Sunday's 
30-13 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Bradshaw indicated he believed a player in a 
leadership position who takes a tack such as Kosar's could have a more 
detrimental effect on a team than help it, and he predicted a blowout victory 
for the Rams, who handed the Browns their seventh consecutive defeat, 38-23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EASY MARK 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas, who began the day with a league-leading 
15 sacks, didn't play in the Chiefs' 37-7 victory over the New England Patriots 
at Foxboro, Mass. He rested a knee he injured last Sunday in a 27-24 victory 
over the Raiders. Apparently, the Chiefs didn't miss Thomas' contributions. 
Despite his absence, the Chiefs applied pressure on New England quarterback 
Tommy Hodson all day and sacked him six times. They lead the league with 42 
sacks this season. Defensive ends Bill Maas and Neil Smith had two sacks each. 
Hodson completed 20 of 39 passes for 211 yards, but he also had two passes 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
New England Coach Ron Rust, after the Patriot's team-record 10th loss in a row, 
37-7 to the Kansas City Chiefs, was asked if his team had reached its low-water 
mark of the season: "I hope it is. I thought we hit it a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief quarterback Steve DeBerg, who passed for 312 yards in the first two 
quarters against the Patriots: "That's as well as I've ever seen an offense 
function for a full half." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's Seth Joyner, who intercepted a pass late in the 30-23 loss to 
Buffalo then fumbled the Eagles' chances away when he tried to lateral the ball 
to a teammate: "We're an opportunistic defense, an opportunistic team. We live 
by the sword and we die by the sword. Today, it didn't work for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's Bubby Brister, after a 16-12 loss to Cincinnati gave the Bengals 
a one-game lead over Pittsburgh in the AFC Central: "It's not over. If we win 
the rest of our games, we're 10-6 and that might be good enough to win the 
division. But everybody's angry: I'm angry, Chuck's (Noll) angry, the whole 
team's angry. We had too many opportunities to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle kicker Norm Johnson, after his field goal in overtime gave the 
Seahawks a 13-10 victory over Houston, the fourth Seattle game this season 
decided on the last play: "I kicked two field goals and an extra point and I'm 
completely exhausted. These kinds of games wear you out, even if you're a 
kicker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OOPS, GREAT CALL! 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Mike Ditka's decision in overtime first looked like a blunder, 
then turned out fine in the Bears' 23-17 victory over the Detroit Lions. The 
Bears, who had tied the score, 17-17, on Kevin Butler's 19-yard field goal with 
33 seconds left in the fourth quarter, decided to defend the north goal and get 
a strong wind at their back. The Lions drove to the Chicago 17-yard line. Eddie 
Murray made a genius of Ditka and missed a field-goal attempt from 35 yards. 
The Bears then picked up three first downs before Jim Harbaugh and Neal 
Anderson connected on a 50-yard pass play for a touchdown and the victory. Said 
Ditka: "This isn't good for my health. We were fortunate, and sometimes in life 
you have to be fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIVALRY REBORN 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh, former first-round draft picks who battled for a 
starting position with the Dallas Cowboys, went head to head as opposing 
quarterbacks. The Cowboys' Aikman and Walsh, traded to the New Orleans Saints 
two months ago, were nearly identical statistically, but Aikman prevailed in a 
17-13 victory. He directed the Cowboys on two 80-yard touchdown drives in the 
second half. "Troy was just excellent," said Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson. "Troy 
made some great plays . . . and, for the first time in 14 games, had no 
interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed 18 of 27 passes for 177 yards and no touchdowns; Aikman 
completed 15 of 21 for 177 yards and one touchdown. There were no 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE EASY WAY 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers clinched their division championships 
Sunday off the field. The 49ers won the NFC West title when the New Orleans 
Saints were beaten by the Dallas Cowboys. After Chicago defeated the Detroit 
Lions in an afternoon game, the Minnesota Vikings defeated Green Bay at night. 
That victory gave the Bears the NFC Central championship.

SOVIET UNION: AMID GROWING NATIONAL UNREST, HE FIRES A LIBERAL MINISTER IN BID 
TO PLACATE CONSERVATIVES. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, confronted with growing unrest across the 
Soviet Union and conservative demands for tougher measures to counter it, 
replaced his liberal interior minister on Sunday with a hard-line Communist 
Party official and appointed an army general as deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev gave no explanation for the changes, conservative members of 
the Soviet Parliament on Saturday had demanded the removal of Vadim V. Bakatin 
as interior minister on grounds that he had failed to halt separatist 
movements, reduce economic crimes and arrest the social chaos that is rapidly 
enveloping the country. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, himself an embattled and increasingly lonely 
figure, on national television Sunday evening underlined the conservatives' 
call with a demand of his own for greater discipline in Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the situation today calls for discipline and order in the 
country," Ryzhkov said. "This will be by different methods, not those used for 
30 years (under dictator Josef Stalin), for those times will not come back. But 
we have to find methods and approaches for our society to become highly 
organized. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We have movements that are on the path of destruction, whose activities are 
just political rallies, which simply arouse people's emotions. Everyone must 
understand that we suffer together if we fail. We need stability in the country 
and confidence in tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Bakatin, 53, interior minister since October, 1988, and a member of 
Gorbachev's Presidential Council, will be Boris K. Pugo, also 53, chairman of 
the party's central control commission. Pugo's first deputy will be Col. Gen. 
Boris V. Gromov, 47, the last Soviet commander in Afghanistan and currently 
commander of front-line forces in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Interior Ministry is responsible for enforcement of the country's 
criminal code and most of its other laws. It controls all the country's police, 
including an estimated 400,000 internal security troops. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's latest decree follows earlier orders authorizing workers' groups to 
police the distribution of food and other scarce commodities and prohibiting 
the formation of paramilitary units under republican and regional governments 
that would challenge the Red Army. 
</P>
<P>
He had pledged a week ago to make broad changes in the country's top posts as 
part of a realignment of the government to deal with the present crises and 
promote further reform. He is due to present an overall plan later this week. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet president appears increasingly to be attempting to placate 
conservatives, notably the military, while attempting to work out the next 
phase of his political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The country's multiple crises -- the increasingly evident economic 
disintegration, the breakup of the Soviet Union as a state and a political 
system incapable of dealing with either -- have intensified the pressure on him 
for fast solutions to halt the country's growing systemic collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a firm belief that any society, any state, even a small workers' 
collective, cannot live without discipline and order," Ryzhkov said, appearing 
to voice the concern of most political moderates and conservatives. "Today, we 
have left the strict discipline that was based on such severe measures. We are 
moving in a more human direction. 
</P>
<P>
"But, unfortunately, the economic measures and moral values do not enable us to 
maintain discipline and order in the country in the required degree. I am 
deeply convinced that until we have such order and discipline in the country at 
all levels, starting from the government and extending to every working 
collective and individual, we will not progress." 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov recalled the brief rule in the early 1980s of the late Yuri V. 
Andropov, who succeeded President Leonid I. Brezhnev and tried to yank the 
country out of its decay and apathy with tough measures. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very demanding," Ryzhkov said. "But his demands and his call for 
responsibility fell in prepared soil, and the people supported him." 
</P>
<P>
Bakatin, an engineer by training and a party official for the past 15 years, 
has been one of the most prominent members of the "perestroika generation" to 
emerge under Gorbachev and was regarded as a possible successor to Ryzhkov as 
one of the most liberal members of the present government. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's decree that replaced Bakatin said he was being transferred to 
"other duties," and a promotion, perhaps even to the new post of vice 
president, could not be ruled out, for his popularity remains high with 
reformers. 
</P>
<P>
Pugo's reputation, by contrast, remains largely sinister from his years with 
the KGB, the state security and intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
Also an engineer by training, Pugo turned to politics almost immediately, 
becoming a party official. In 1976, he joined the KGB where his energetic 
pursuit of Latvian nationalists and other dissidents won him promotion to the 
head of the Latvian KGB in 1980 and to the local party leadership in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Swept aside as first secretary of the Latvian party by a wave of nationalism in 
1988, Pugo was given a job at party headquarters in Moscow as the head of the 
watchdog control commission, which is charged with maintaining party 
discipline, preventing the abuse of authority and fighting corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Gromov, who was the last Soviet soldier out of Afghanistan after commanding the 
expeditionary force there in its last two years, has emerged as an important 
political as well as military leader. Now a three-star general, Gromov commands 
immediate attention whenever he speaks at meetings of the party's Central 
Committee or legislative bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he has been linked frequently in rumors -- he dismisses them as "rubbish" 
-- to a possible military coup d'etat that would oust Gorbachev and install a 
conservative leadership to restore order.

Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi, comparing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to 
Egypt's slain leader Anwar Sadat, said Sunday that Iraq might emerge from the 
Persian Gulf crisis a friend of the United States and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"History always repeats itself," Kadafi said in a speech to political science 
students at Fatah University in Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
He said President Sadat, gunned down by Muslim zealots in 1981, entered the 
1973 Arab-Israeli War a sworn enemy of the United States and Israel, as Iraq is 
now. "He (Sadat) emerged from the war their closest friend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sadat and Kadafi became arch-enemies shortly after that war because of 
ideological and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq can one day be another Egypt . . . whether the confrontation over Kuwait 
ends peacefully or through war," said Kadafi, quoted by the official Libyan 
news agency Jana.

Masked gunmen drove up to their car and opened fire with automatic weapons, 
police said. Gilmore died instantly and his wife was hit three times in the 
neck and body, a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.

BUSH TAKES TRADE PLANS TO LATIN NATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BRASILIA, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush embarked Sunday night on a weeklong visit to South America, 
seeking to promote the economic restructuring now under way throughout the 
continent by building support for his free-trade proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to the President, who was scheduled to arrive here early today, said he 
was not bringing much in the way of new proposals but that he will focus on the 
trade-building aspects of his Enterprise for the Americas initiative and on the 
strengthening of democracy, lately on the rise in the part of the world long 
plagued by military dictatorships. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Brazil, he will visit Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative, unveiled last June as a plan for 
a "new economic partnership" with Latin America, would create a hemisphere-wide 
free-trade zone stretching from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego at the southern 
tip of Argentina and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
It includes a relatively modest $100-million-a-year U.S. grant in response to 
"market-oriented investment reforms" intended to boost private enterprise in 
Latin American economies. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential visit to Brazil, the first by an American president in eight 
years, comes at a time of a sharp turnaround in South America's political and 
economic environment. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Cuba and Haiti, U.S. officials have pointed out -- 
overlooking several quasi-democratic regimes -- each of the governments in the 
hemisphere holds office as the result of free elections. And on the economic 
front, fiercely protective trading practices are giving way to a concerted 
effort to open up borders with the hope of increasing markets. 
</P>
<P>
By 1994, for example, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay hope to have 
created a common market patterned after the economic and trade association of 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United States in the past several months has signed bilateral 
trade agreements with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
The warmer trend in the U.S. relations with its southern neighbors was noted by 
President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil, who took office last March. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in Gazeta Mercantil, a national financial newspaper, the 40-year-old 
Brazilian leader said: "Over the last few months . . . Brazilian-United States 
relations have no longer been marked by the contentious trade issues that had 
achieved such notoriety in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazil has completed its process of political transition to democracy. We are 
moving toward the consolidation of a solid and modern market economy, capable 
of ensuring that Brazilians are rescued from the extreme poverty in which a 
majority still live," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
As much as U.S. officials are seeking to promote moves toward democracy, 
Brazilian and other officials are taking every opportunity to call attention to 
the fact that the rightist military regimes of the past have been turned out, 
leftists are no longer threatening takeovers and trade, rather than direct aid, 
is what is needed to pull the continent's nearly 400 million citizens out of 
the dire poverty in which so many of them live. 
</P>
<P>
"The strategy of anti-communism and 'assistancialism' (giving of assistance) is 
no longer a suitable approach to Latin America," Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Jose Francisco Rezek said. 
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of this hemisphere recognize that in the global economy in which 
we live and operate, what is crucial to regimes is a chance to attract foreign 
investment, to expand trade, reduce trading barriers, gain access to technology 
and to international financial institutions, (and) reduce debt burdens," a 
senior Bush Administration official said, speaking with reporters in Washington 
on Friday.

<P>
The pioneering telescopes aboard the space shuttle Columbia went into service 
Sunday night and began an extraordinary reconnaissance of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything looks fine, just like the book says," astronomer Ronald A. Parise, 
a civilian member of the crew, told mission control here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfect," said Arthur Davidsen, chief scientist for Johns Hopkins 
University's ultraviolet telescope, one of three such instruments aboard the 
shuttle. "Everything works exactly as planned." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists were planning to concentrate on their first "targets" early today, 
including two stars that revolve rapidly around each other. 
</P>
<P>
But the first day of the 10-day mission was devoted to making sure that the 
sensitive telescopes aboard the shuttle survived the rigors of Sunday morning's 
launch. All reports indicated that the instruments were in excellent shape, 
although engineers were working on a few minor problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been three big thrills for the scientists," said Steve Maren, an 
astronomer with the Goddard Space Flight Center. "The first was the launch," a 
long-delayed event that scientists have been awaiting for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"The second was the erection of the instrument pointing system," which will 
keep the telescopes trained on some of the most active objects in the universe 
with pinpoint precision, Maren said. 
</P>
<P>
"The third was first call," the moment when scientists on the ground at the 
Marshall Space Flight Center here began talking with their colleagues in space, 
an extraordinary link between experts on the ground and four astronomers who 
are for the first time practicing their art in space. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntsville, this is Astro," Mission Specialist Robert A. R. (Bob) Parker, an 
astronomer as well as a career astronaut, told mission control, indicating that 
the link between orbiting scientists and their colleagues on the ground had 
been established. This is the first flight to be controlled out of the space 
center here instead of the Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Astro mission has been eagerly awaited by scientists because the telescopes 
will look at the universe in wavelengths of light -- ultraviolet and X-rays -- 
that are filtered out by the atmosphere and do not reach the Earth. Ultraviolet 
light and X-rays are emitted by objects that are many times hotter than the 
sun, and thus they are remnants of some of the most violent events in the 
universe -- such things as the birth and death of stars. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the telescopes will radio data back as it is collected, so scientists 
won't have to wait to see their results. That includes the University of 
Wisconsin's Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment, dubbed WUPPE, which is 
pronounced just the way it looks; Goddard Space Flight Center's Broad Band 
X-Ray Telescope, and the Hopkins telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Only the fourth instrument, Goddard's Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope, will 
capture all of its data on film. Scientists working on that project will have 
to wait until the shuttle lands to see whether they have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
This will be a busy flight, with the seven crewmen divided into two teams that 
will alternate on 12-hour watches. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia is skippered by Vance D. Brand, 58, the oldest man to fly in 
space. The pilot is Guy S. Gardner. The other members of the crew are civilian 
astronomer Samuel T. Durrance, astronaut/astronomer Jeffrey A. Hoffman and 
astronaut John M. Lounge.

Because clocks are more precise than Earth's own rotation, an extra "leap 
second" in 1990 will adjust for the difference, timekeeping officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The world keeps official time according to "atomic clocks," which operate by 
measuring the vibration of a single atom and are accurate within one-billionth 
of a second a day. Earth's rotation, by comparison, is off "by a few tenths of 
a second per year," the Time and Frequency Division of the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo., reported.

TRADE TALKS WILL OPEN AMID AIR OF PESSIMISM

As representatives of 107 nations arrived here Sunday to begin the final 
meetings in four years of ambitious talks aimed at breaking down international 
trade barriers, agreement remained well out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, delegates held a flurry of behind-the-scenes discussions in 
advance of the official start of the talks today. Also on hand were a number of 
U.S. lawmakers and representatives of virtually every industry. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills told reporters that she sees no signs 
of a breakthrough in agriculture, the single most difficult area to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
The talks began in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, as an effort to revamp the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international arrangement that was 
becoming frayed under mounting pressures for protectionism. A major goal of 
current negotiations is to expand the limits of the 43-year-old GATT accord to 
cover a host of businesses and issues that have become vital to worldwide trade 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has encountered stiff resistance from the 12-nation European 
Community over the U.S. demand for sharp cuts in worldwide agricultural 
subsidies. American farmers say that heavy subsidies have allowed European 
farmers to capture much of the world market, despite the fact that they are 
less efficient in many ways than their U.S. counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, opening up trade in agriculture is crucial to drawing 
developing countries into the ultimate agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes to win concessions from these countries that would 
allow U.S. services -- such businesses as airlines and shipping, insurance, 
banks and entertainment -- more access to their markets. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also wants greater protection for copyrights and trademarks. 
Officials estimate that U.S. firms lose $60 billion a year to overseas firms 
that sell copycat versions of American products. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the countries resisting agreement in these areas are part of the 
heavily indebted developing world. Without opportunities to strengthen their 
economies by selling more of their farm products worldwide, they will have 
little incentive to agree to other parts of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations in all areas have been badly affected by agriculture," Hills 
said. "We are at a stalemate." 
</P>
<P>
However, EC Trade Commissioner Frans Andriessen countered: "The whole world is 
asking the European Community to make concessions in agriculture. . . . What is 
the world prepared to give in return?" 
</P>
<P>
Success in concluding an international trade accord here could mean a huge 
bonanza of more than $4 trillion to the world economy over the next decade, 
according to Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond my comprehension that the civilized nations of the world could 
duck this opportunity (of) an economic renaissance that could last well into 
the 21st Century," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the negotiations will reach their ambitious goals or fall apart should 
become clear in the next few days. "The fever is higher," said U.S. Rep. Sander 
M. Levin (D-Mich.), who is part of the official congressional delegation. "I 
don't know if that's because it's about to break or the patient is about to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Dunkel, director of the Geneva-based GATT, added: "Negotiators have to 
get out of this crisis in the first hours and days" of the final week of talks. 
</P>
<P>
The sessions are officially scheduled to end Friday, although many believe they 
may continue a few days longer.

RESCUERS FREE 5 HIKERS STUCK ON LOFTY LEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What looked like a short cut down a mountainside in Placerita Canyon State Park 
led to a 125-foot-high ledge where three women and two boys were trapped for an 
hour Sunday before being rescued by firefighters, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
After frantic calls for help to park visitors below, the stranded hikers were 
carried to safety. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, said Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Don Heflin. 
</P>
<P>
"There was definitely the possibility that we could have fallen straight down," 
said a relieved Judy Bakenhus, 30, of El Sereno. "I was definitely frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Rescued with Bakenhus from the area east of Newhall were her friends Margaret 
Suarez of El Sereno and her son Alan Vasquez, 4, and Yvonne Duran of San 
Gabriel and her son Javier Garcia, 4. 
</P>
<P>
Bakenhus said the group was following a hiking trail about 1 p.m. when it 
turned onto what authorities said was a narrow animal path that eventually led 
to the ledge on the 45-degree slope. 
</P>
<P>
The group was unable to backtrack because the soil was too slippery and loose, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hikers yelled and waved their arms to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
A Fire Department helicopter crew found the hikers and landed about 300 yards 
above the ledge. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters lowered themselves onto the ledge with ropes and carried the 
hikers to safety.

ROUTES NEEDED OVER ENCINO HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to refute the misrepresentation and misinformation in the letter 
"Paving Over Isn't Answer" by Bill Crane of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Transportation has not informed the Encino 
Hillside Traffic Safety Organization, of which I am president, that "opening up 
new routes for traffic alleviates a situation for a maximum of about two 
years." Rather, the Department of Transportation has recommended multiple 
cross-mountain routes -- including a connection of Reseda Boulevard with a 
paved Mulholland Drive -- as the only viable solution to the traffic problems 
in the Encino hills. 
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was the result of a Department of Transportation in-depth study 
of traffic in the Encino hills 11 years ago when the traffic conditions were 
serious but not as horrendous as they now are. The Southern California Assn. of 
Governments has also recommended the connection of Reseda Boulevard to a paved 
Mulholland Drive as one of several solutions to relieve the traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Yet our Councilman Marvin Braude and our City Council have done nothing to act 
on the recommendations of these costly studies, even though they know that the 
highway traffic on the narrow, steep and winding Encino hillside streets poses 
danger to the residents and their property. 
</P>
<P>
Crane is again incorrect when he says that paving of Mulholland Drive will 
stimulate development in the Santa Monica Mountains. The three-mile strip from 
Reseda Boulevard to Encino Hills Drive that the Encino Hillside Traffic Safety 
Organization wants paved is in an area that is almost totally owned by the 
federal, state and county governments, so that private development is 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The West Valley is developing regardless of the availability of roads, and the 
existing phenomenal growth is taxing existing roads beyond endurance. A 
cross-mountain route in the West Valley to accommodate the growth in the West 
Valley is only fair and necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Crane seems to be touting the new rhetoric of the so-called environmentalists, 
who profess sympathy with the traffic plight in Encino yet vigorously fight 
remedies for its solution in order to preserve their own agenda. Those truly 
concerned with the environment know that idling cars damage the environment 
more significantly than paving a three-mile strip on Mulholland Drive.

DON'T AX YULE TREE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent decision by Judge Janavs to bar Joe Cicero from selling Christmas 
trees on the leased Pierce College property is indecent, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
The judge is a jerk. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, I bought produce of high quality at the previous Cicero 
location. Beyond the family's dedication to good stuff offered at reasonable 
prices was their dedication to providing an aura of pleasure to children. 
</P>
<P>
Free popcorn and Kool-Aid; goats and rabbits and ducks and pigs and other 
animals that the kids could watch, talk to and pet. All the animals were clean, 
well-fed and cared for. 
</P>
<P>
The kids loved the free ride through the crop fields, sitting on bales of hay 
on a big trailer drawn by an old tractor manned by a good-natured Cicero 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
And now, a major source of needed income for the Ciceros has been threatened by 
a disastrous judgment by the court. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned Valley residents arise. Prevent this tragedy. I'm going to send a 
check for a tree to be donated to anyone who cannot afford one. Just do it. 
</P>
<P>
Happy Christmas.

RESTAURANTS ARE A FAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to development of the corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Ventura 
Boulevard in Studio City, Polly Ward, claiming she represents homeowners in the 
area, is protesting the issuance of liquor licenses to three restaurants 
planned for the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
I am a homeowner just a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
I believe the developer, Ira Smedra, is doing us a favor by bringing three 
upscale restaurants, with liquor licenses, to the area. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to go on record as a homeowner who approves of this kind of growth 
and welcomes the presence of new businesses in my neighborhood, especially food 
establishments that have proven successful in other parts of the city, as 
Kaktus, the Daily Grill and Louise's Trattoria have. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Ward does not speak for me or any of the residents of this area that I 
know of. 
</P>
<P>
Her arguments against these liquor licenses make no sense. There are indeed 
other establishments that already serve liquor in the neighborhood (30 by her 
count). 
</P>
<P>
So what? 
</P>
<P>
Studio City is not exactly characterized by drunks roaming the streets in 
search of alcohol. This is an adult community. Its residents are quite capable 
of monitoring their own alcoholic intake. We do not need a headmistress taking 
care of us. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the people who agree with me comprise a silent majority. For 
now, you have only my own strong objection to one self-anointed spokesperson 
pretending she speaks for the residents of Studio City. She does not.

VASQUEZ CAUGHT IN MIDDLE OF NORTH-SOUTH JAIL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
YORBA LINDA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the arid hills and sprawling ranch-style homes near Gypsum Canyon, 
residents boast that their community is as safe as it is quiet and pleasant. 
And they passionately insist that it's no place for a jail. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of a maximum-minimum security jail here is obscene," said Carol 
Cantwell, a member of the local parks and recreation commission. "It's the 
safety of everybody's daughter and not just mine that we're worried about. And 
it's sons, too." 
</P>
<P>
About 25 miles south in Lake Forest, another tidy neighborhood inhabited by a 
not-so-different group of young families strikes a similar chord: In their 
case, they've spent years living a few hundreds yards from the minimum-security 
James A. Musick Branch Jail, and they're tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Darn right we'd like to get rid of it," said Pam Russell-Ogden, who moved into 
a new home in Lake Forest four months ago. On her front lawn, a pair of signs 
warn visitors that the house is guarded by a security system that promises an 
"armed response." 
</P>
<P>
"We just bought this home, and we installed the security system," Russell-Ogden 
said from behind a partially open front door. "They tell us there are people in 
there who do drugs, and they periodically walk away. Well, where are they going 
to come? Right here. We're the next street over." 
</P>
<P>
Caught between these two communities and their fears is one elected official: 
Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. On Dec. 18, the interests of these 
South County and North County residents will clash head on, and Vasquez, who 
represents both areas, will face a moment that no politician would envy. 
</P>
<P>
That day, the Board of Supervisors is expected to consider a staff 
recommendation to move ahead with building the Gypsum Canyon jail, which is 
slated for a site just outside of Anaheim and Yorba Linda. Vasquez has long 
opposed that, but the county staff now is suggesting that the government raise 
some of the money for the $1 billion-plus project by closing the Musick jail 
and selling the land there for development. 
</P>
<P>
So Vasquez has a choice: He can reverse his longstanding opposition to Gypsum 
Canyon and vote to build a new county jail there. If he does that, some Anaheim 
and Yorba Linda residents say they will never forgive him. Alternatively, 
Vasquez can stay the course, and in the process dash the hopes of Lake Forest 
and El Toro residents who see Gypsum Canyon as the key to ridding themselves of 
their unwelcome neighbor, the Musick facility. Those constituents will not soon 
forget Vasquez's vote either. 
</P>
<P>
"Gaddi is caught in the middle," Yorba Linda Councilman Henry W. Wedaa said in 
an interview last week. "Now we'll see what kind of politician he is because we 
don't want it here and they don't want it there." 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of Vasquez's district, Bill Krause, general manager of the 
Lake Forest II Master Homeowners' Assn., agrees. "The supervisor is going to 
have to acknowledge what his constituency role is here and what it is in the 
North County, and he's going to have to make a decision," Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Vasquez calls the talk of closing Musick to fund Gypsum "highly 
speculative" and says he refuses to raise false hopes in Lake Forest by 
suggesting that the Musick jail might soon close. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the supervisor remains steadfast in opposing Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"My opposition to Gypsum Canyon is well-documented and unchanged," Vasquez said 
in one of several interviews last week. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez joined with Supervisor Don R. Roth in voting against selecting the 
canyon as the county's new jail site in 1987, and their two votes were enough 
to block acquiring the property through condemnation, a procedure that requires 
four votes of the board. They've held to that position ever since, and progress 
on the Gypsum jail has stalled. 
</P>
<P>
But with the county's jail overcrowding problems mounting and a federal judge 
poised to consider imposing strict new limits on the county jails, pressure is 
building for the supervisors to move ahead with plans for a new facility. The 
Dec. 18 session will give them a chance to demonstrate progress when they take 
up a recommendation to reaffirm their support for Gypsum Canyon and to direct 
their staff to draw up plans for financing construction of that facility. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy. The county is in deep financial trouble, and planners concede 
that they have no way to pay for Gypsum. Selling Musick would help, but Vasquez 
and others note that it may be a more complicated transaction than it appears 
on the surface. The Musick jail sits on the edge of the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station, so selling the property for new homes probably is not realistic. 
It could, however, be transformed into office space, as could the land it abuts 
to the west. 
</P>
<P>
The Musick facility covers 100 acres, and turning it into an office park could 
bring the county upward of $100 million, hardly enough to cover the cost of 
building Gypsum Canyon, but enough to make a sizable down payment. 
</P>
<P>
More troublesome is how the county would deal with the 1,200 prisoners that 
Musick can house on a typical night. It would presumably be years between 
Musick's closure and the opening of Gypsum Canyon, and during that period the 
county would have no place to house those inmates. 
</P>
<P>
But even with some questions unresolved, news of the staff report recommending 
that Musick be shut down has already reached Lake Forest. And residents there 
are eager to know whether Vasquez will represent their interests when the 
matter comes before the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they close this jail," said Eugenia Rios, a Lake Forest resident who 
has lived near the Musick jail for 13 years. "It worries me all the time. Why 
should (Vasquez) keep this open near us if he can close it?" 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, Carol Barlow agreed. "They say that when they escape, they 
leave the area," she said. "But you never know. What if my car was sitting 
right out here, and one of them needed to get away?" 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor after neighbor agreed, almost without exception citing the nagging 
uncertainty that comes with living near a jail. Moreover, as long as the Musick 
facility exists, the residents worry that the county might someday enlarge it 
or turn it into a maximum-security facility. Only with the jail gone will they 
finally rest easy, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
But if there is concern in Lake Forest, it hardly compares with the virulent 
public opposition that exists in and around Gypsum Canyon. Residents of that 
area live farther from the proposed jail than the distance between Lake Forest 
homeowners and the Musick facility. But in the Anaheim canyons, they are faced 
with the prospect of a 6,720-bed maximum-security jail moving in just up the 
road. That jail would house accused killers, rapists and other prisoners 
accused of serious crimes and awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of it has residents of Anaheim and Yorba Linda seeing red. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more breakouts than we really hear about," said Craig S. Miller, who 
chairs Citizens Against Gypsum Canyon Jail and who is building a home a little 
more than a mile from the proposed jail site. "I have three children. I worry 
about the type of transients that are going to be in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Like his neighbors, Miller is watching Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Gaddi keeps his commitment to us," he said. "He promised to keep the 
Gypsum Canyon jail from happening. I don't think he can change his vote at this 
late date." 
</P>
<P>
But, Miller, who currently lives in Yorba Linda, added later: "Lots of 
politicians make a lot of promises that they don't keep." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim city officials are for the most part confident that Vasquez will stand 
by them, but they too are aware of the pressure that the supervisor's South 
County constituents might bring to bear. To protect itself, the city has moved 
to incorporate Gypsum Canyon so that it can control the development of the 
area, preferring to let the Irvine Co. build thousands of homes on the land. 
</P>
<P>
And though city leaders are sympathetic to the pleas of Lake Forest residents, 
they echo the views of their constituents when they declare that Gypsum Canyon 
is the wrong place for a jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I cringe when I think about this," said Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter, whose home 
is a few miles from the site and who has long opposed it. "The whole area on 
both sides of the freeway is single-family homes. Why would you want to put a 
jail in middle of single-family homes? It's mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
This issue is simple, Hunter adds, uttering a refrain that haunts the jail 
issue generally and Vasquez in particular: "I'm not against a jail. I'm just 
against a jail here."

A BIG DEAL: The Angels made the first splash of the winter baseball meetings 
with a six-player trade (C1) with the Toronto Blue Jays. They sent center 
fielder Devon White, above, pitcher Willie Fraser and a minor leaguer to be 
named later to Toronto for outfielder Junior Felix, infielder Luis Sojo and a 
minor leaguer to be named later. The two clubs had been talking since the World

COME AGAIN? Youth gangs in Irvine? Police say some gangs are forming (B10), but 
what do school officials say? . . . School administrators are legendary for 
their circumlocution, and the Irvine Unified School District's apparently are 
no different. Asked whether Irvine campuses have gang activity, a spokesman 
replied: "We're seeing some increase in the number of young people who are 
demonstrating some posturing of group affiliation that may be inappropriate." .

UNUSUALLY HIGH TIDE PACKS THE PUNCH OF OVERFLOWING BATHTUB 
</P>

What do you get when the moon and sun align with the Earth? 
</P>
<P>
The dawning of the Age of Aquarius? No, the meteorological equivalent of the 
comet Kahoutek. 
</P>
<P>
The highest tide in 17 years struck Southern California Sunday morning with all 
the force of an overfilled tub sloshing onto the bathroom carpet. The 7.3-foot 
high tide at 8:08 a.m. splashed onto sidewalks at King Harbor in Redondo Beach 
and oozed into a portion of the nearby Marina Cafe, causing some patrons to 
take off their shoes and splash around in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"The water came up and went down. That was about it," said Patrice Brousseau, 
30, manager of the cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The tide was more than two feet higher than normal, a result of the combined 
effects of the unusual alignment of the moon, sun and Earth. Some businesses 
had put out sandbags, in case the wind kicked up and increased the force of the 
tide. But as the morning shone clear and mild, those who made special early 
morning trips to the beach to watch nature exert itself were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the devastating storm of 1988, which caused heavy damage up and down the 
coast, this weather was rated G. Fathers walked along the waterline lecturing 
small children who listened with earnest, confused faces to the finer 
scientific points of the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-foot-tall sand dunes had been erected to protect the three-story, 
southern district lifeguard headquarters building on Hermosa Beach from winter 
storms. But Greg Allen, 44, a senior lifeguard, said, "Today is no problem." 
</P>
<P>
The word "Caution" had been written in chalk on the board on which ocean 
conditions are posted, yet the water was stippled with the usual contingent of 
surfers. 
</P>
<P>
John Teague, 45, who has surfed for 35 years, was not impressed as he sat on 
his bicycle on the pier. "There's too much water under there" for good surfing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Lt. Gail Kulisch in Orange County said that boaters need to take 
special care for the next several days, as extreme low and high tides will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
The tide did arouse memories of big storms of yore, when high tides were 
combined with severe weather to cause extensive damage along the coast. Doyal 
Adair, 60, of Torrance, recalled the 1988 storm, which split the dock and 
snapped three-quarter-inch lines on his boat, "Loose Screws." 
</P>
<P>
At the Good Stuff restaurant on the Strand in Hermosa Beach, waitresses could 
not help comparing Sunday's high tide to the storm of 1983, memorialized by a 
large photograph on the wall that shows water covering the beach and splashing 
up to the door of the restaurant. "It flooded the floors and everything," said 
Sharonne Paradiso, 20, of Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, this high tide was a washout.

SICKOUT BY NIGHT NURSES CONTINUES AT COUNTY-USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, night-shift nurses staged a sickout at Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center's neonatal intensive care unit in an apparent 
protest over understaffing and unsafe working conditions, hospital 
administrators said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of eight night-shift nurses called in sick for the 7 p.m. shift, said 
Women's Hospital Administrator Connie Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
"We're down to 20 babies now," said Diaz. "We have enough nurses either staying 
over (from the day shift) or coming in to care for those babies." 
</P>
<P>
Day-shift nurses reported to work Sunday. But the first night-shift sickout 
Saturday forced officials to transfer 12 of 37 babies in the unit to private 
hospitals, Diaz said. The condition of the infants -- all critically ill and 
confined to incubators -- was unavailable Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all very tiny and very sick," Diaz said. "Normally, it's not a good 
idea to move them. . . . But there wasn't a whole lot of choice." 
</P>
<P>
All eight nurses scheduled to work from 7 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday called 
in sick, requiring administrators in the country's busiest labor ward to 
scramble for replacements. Some outside nurses were called in to assist 
day-shift nurses who stayed late to pitch in, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not too good," said attending physician Ramanathan Rangasami, noting the 
staff was stretched thin. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday evening's action by the nurses, Diaz was optimistic that the 
night shift would return to work. 
</P>
<P>
"These are outstanding nurses and they really love those babies," Diaz said. 
"They are very dedicated people and if this is a planned thing, I'm sure it's 
reflecting their concern for the ongoing care of the babies." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz said hospital administrators were hoping to meet with the nurses today. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't asked for a meeting," she said. "But since they called in sick, 
we'll have to wait until they come back to work for a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Irving Cohen, director of administration and finance for the county Department 
of Health Services, said he was disturbed by the nurses' tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a crisis because the delivery rate in L. A. County is skyrocketing," 
said Cohen, whose agency funds County-USC. "If this is their way of showing 
compassion . . . we're not quite pleased." 
</P>
<P>
A woman who identified herself as one of the absent nurses, but said she did 
not want to reveal her name for fear of losing her job, said state standards 
require at least one nurse to every two neonatal ICU babies. County-USC, with 
its huge obstetric caseload, at times has a ratio of one nurse to four babies, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've asked that the number of babies be kept down to a load we can endure," 
the woman said. "The nurses are very, very concerned about the babies' 
welfare." 
</P>
<P>
But Diaz said the state allows different nursing ratios depending on how ill 
the infants are, and that a 4-1 ratio is acceptable for less critically ill 
babies. Most of the infants in the unit on Saturday, however, required the more 
intensive 2-1 ratio, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even under normal conditions, one or two of the infants may be transferred to a 
private hospital every day because there are not enough nurses to care for 
them. Most of the babies are covered by Medi-Cal, so the parents usually are 
not affected by the move to more expensive private facilities, Diaz said. She 
said she did not expect the county to be billed, either. 
</P>
<P>
The labor ward at Women's Hospital last year delivered about one of every 200 
infants born in the United States, making it the country's busiest facility. It 
is equipped to handle about 45 births daily, with a maximum of about 15,000 
each year. But the hospital has not delivered fewer than 16,000 babies since 
1982 and, since July, has averaged about 55 a day. 
</P>
<P>
To dramatize what they termed "battlefront obstetrics," staff doctors last 
December threatened to make public a videotape that included scenes of more 
than a dozen women in labor crowded in halls. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem, the hospital receives a large percentage of high-risk 
patients that private facilities are unwilling to care for, Diaz said. Nearly 
85% of the women are Latino, most of whom are immigrants, indigent and without 
adequate prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
When their children are born prematurely, ill or with congenital defects, they 
are placed in the neonatal intensive care unit. The ICU is licensed to handle 
48 babies, but because of staffing shortages rarely accepts more than 30 or 35, 
Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am in sympathy with the problem," Rangasami said. "This has been 
ignored for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, half of the staff nurses at County-USC's Women's Hospital 
joined nurses at county hospitals in a two-day sickout to protest pay and 
working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the County Board of Supervisors cut $7.6 million from the county's 
health services budget, with County-USC taking the brunt of it. A Superior 
Court judge has ordered the cuts restored, but supervisors have not agreed on 
how to come up with the money.

4 BOOKIE SITES RAIDED AT HEIGHT OF SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: EIGHT CLERKS ARRESTED BY DEPUTIES AND $1.25 MILLION IN PRO FOOTBALL 
WAGERS WERE DISRUPTED, OFFICIALS SAY.

If they were early enough, callers to (213) 261-9472 on Sunday placed illegal 
sports bets with three clerks, employed by one of the county's largest 
bookmaking rings, in an East Los Angeles office with no name on the door. 
</P>
<P>
But shortly before 10 a.m., minutes before the start of professional football 
games on the East Coast, the phones were being answered by sheriff's deputies 
who diligently noted code numbers, passwords and wager amounts. The clerks sat 
on the sidelines, under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was repeated at three other sites in Diamond Bar, Encino and Marina 
del Rey as the sheriff's vice bureau raided bookmaking sites run by three 
networks that together control an estimated 45% to 50% of the county's illegal 
gambling, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight clerks were arrested and about $1.25 million worth of wagers -- one day's 
take -- were disrupted, said Lt. David Kading of the vice bureau. 
</P>
<P>
It is the height of the bookie season -- which, not coincidentally, parallels 
the pro football season, the biggest lure for sports gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
In October, law enforcement officers in three Southern California counties 
dismantled a $1-million-a-week operation. In November, a separate series of 
arrests broke up a $2-million-a-week ring. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's raids dismantled business at offices that took in about $3.5 million a 
week, but deputies did not lodge fatal blows against the organizations that run 
them. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 3, deputies arrested nine others at five other sites run by the same 
groups, stopping $1 million in bets. The three networks have about 10 sites 
apiece, Kading said, and probably bring in a total of $15 to $20 million a 
week. He would not provide details about the suspected leaders or further 
characterize the organizations because the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
The raids pointed up the newly decentralized nature of bookmaking, a 
development helped along by telephone technology such as call-forwarding and 
toll-free 800 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days -- the old days being not so long ago -- there would be one 
room, with 20 or 30 clerks and a switchboard that looked like a police phone 
room," Kading said. "This way, they don't lose everything if one location is 
shut down." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, at four other places searched by deputies Sunday, phones were on 
call-forward and authorities could not determine where wagers were actually 
being recorded. Warrants could not be served and the action apparently 
proceeded -- somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles alone, Kading said, $500,000 in bets would have been placed 
on Sunday had business not been interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies broke in the door of a room on the second floor of a Whittier 
Boulevard medical building, they surprised two women and a man sitting around 
four folding tables that formed a rectangle. Each clerk had a four-line phone, 
wager forms, odds sheets and an adding machine. 
</P>
<P>
A television was tuned to the station that would carry the Los Angeles Rams vs. 
the Cleveland Browns. The clerks were set to pass a pleasant morning, with 
bottles of soda, cups of carry-out coffee, a paperback novel and a box of 
crayons littering the table tops. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought tamales. Can we eat them?" joked Ventura Aguayo, 49, of Los 
Angeles. Like her colleagues, Louise Marie Lopez, 38, of West Covina and Juan 
Jorge Menriquez, 43, of Los Angeles, she was booked on suspicion of felony 
bookmaking. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said the clerks had operated out of the room "for just a few months." The 
target organizations routinely shut down locations and open new ones, Kading 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aguayo's name provided the office password. "Aguayo Appraisal," the clerks said 
when they answered the phone. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies said the same thing when they sat down as replacements to gather 
evidence. In the space of 15 minutes, they took several hundred calls from the 
likes of "449 Joe" and "Tracy for Augie." The bets ranged from $50 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a Marina del Rey apartment, Earl Balos, 70, was arrested. At 
another apartment in Encino, Douglas Dimock, 41, William Anderson, 33, and 
Richard Anderson, 41, were taken into custody. Authorities also found a 
false-top desk there where bookmaking paraphernalia could be secreted. In a 
Diamond Bar house, Rex Tidd, 71, was arrested.

BUDGET CRUNCH MAY HIT ANTI-TRUANCY AIDES;

<P>
L.A. SCHOOLS: TEN ATTENDANCE COUNSELORS FACE LAYOFFS IN FEBRUARY BECAUSE OF THE 
DISTRICT'S FINANCIAL CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Kim Bertram recalls the rodent-infested, urine-stained garage she discovered 
the day she visited the home of a 7-year-old Huntington Park girl who was 
chronically absent from school. 
</P>
<P>
As an attendance counselor for the Los Angeles Unified School District, Bertram 
frequently made house calls to check up on truant pupils. But this was no 
hooky-playing student. Huddled on the cold concrete floor lay a sick and hungry 
little girl. Her mother, confined to a wheelchair and dying of kidney failure, 
was unable to care for herself, much less get her daughter ready for class each 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
With help from Bertram, the family began receiving assistance from the Los 
Angeles County Health Services agency and the little girl returned to school. 
When the mother died later that year, Bertram counseled the student as she got 
settled in with a foster family. The Huntington Park incident was just one of 
600 cases handled last year by the 26-year-old Bertram, who has a master's 
degree in social work. 
</P>
<P>
Come February, however, Bertram and nine other attendance counselors at Los 
Angeles schools may find themselves out of a job. The school board is 
considering eliminating their positions because of a continuing financial 
crunch. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cuts have thrown the spotlight on a little-noticed program that 
school officials say is responsible for persuading hundreds of students to 
remain in school each year. There are 185 attendance counselors for the 625,000 
students in the district, or one for about every 3,380 children. 
</P>
<P>
But their numbers are dwindling. Earlier this year, the district eliminated 14 
attendance counselor positions as part of sweeping cuts in which $220 million 
was slashed from its $4 billion annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Children need to be in school to succeed, and if these positions are lost, it 
is the children who will suffer," says Bertram, who divides her time among five 
elementary schools in South Gate and Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the counselors, who appeared before the school board recently to 
argue their case, also pointed out that their jobs actually make money for the 
district, because schools receive state funding based on student attendance. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Bill Anton has said he hopes to find a way to avert the cuts, but 
district officials said last week there is no guarantee the jobs can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a shortage of funds," said Tom Killeen, a district administrator of 
personnel services. However, he called the positions "a priority," adding that 
attendance counselors "perform a very valuable service, they help get kids . . 
. who are at risk get back into school." 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of the students in the system are absent every day, and the figure 
rises to between 15% and 20% on Mondays and Fridays," said Cheryl Fayson, a 
district specialist who works with truants. Dropout rates approach 50% at some 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
While each school handles absences differently, Bertram is usually brought in 
after a student misses three days and teachers have been unable to reach 
parents at home. At that point, Bertram usually visits the family of the truant 
child at home. 
</P>
<P>
During her three years on the job, Bertram has been threatened with physical 
harm, chased by dogs, had doors slammed in her face and found parents drunk or 
strung out on drugs at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In response, she has set some ground rules for home visits. She won't enter 
unfamiliar neighborhoods in the late afternoon. If she is uncertain, she checks 
with the local police first. If the area is indeed dangerous, she visits in the 
morning, sometimes bringing a friend along for protection. 
</P>
<P>
"Most activity in dangerous areas doesn't start until afternoon, because in the 
morning, they're still sleeping from the night before," Bertram says. 
</P>
<P>
If parents refuse to cooperate, Bertram may turn the case over to a panel 
composed of police officers, county children's services representatives, school 
counselors and members of the community to hear testimony and make 
recommendations. If parents still fail to comply, the district may turn the 
case over to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office for prosecution. 
If found guilty, parents can be fined up to $500 and sentenced to attend 
parenting classes. 
</P>
<P>
As a vital link between the school and home, attendance counselors work closely 
with Los Angeles County child welfare and public health agencies, probation 
officers and local police. If they detect evidence of physical or sexual abuse, 
they notify the proper authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Bertram says that success stories, such as that of Francisco and Jesus 
Alcauter, make her work worthwhile. She first heard about the boys last spring, 
when an anonymous caller reported two children living in a South Gate motel. 
When she knocked at the room, a woman in her late 20s opened the door a crack, 
then slammed it shut when Bertram tried to talk to her in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But she persisted, and after several weeks, built up a rapport with the mother, 
Catalina Alcauter, who had just arrived from Mexico six months before. "She 
didn't know about the school system, she didn't know there was free schooling 
or that school was a good place for her children to be," Bertram says. 
</P>
<P>
Bertram helped get the children clothes and canned food. Then she drew the 
woman a map of the school, which was two blocks away, and walked with the 
family to school that first day. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the children "didn't have any of the social skills needed to sit at a 
desk," Bertram recalled. Today however, the two boys, aged 7 and 8, have 
perfect attendance and are improving their grades. Bertram is now working to 
get their mother enrolled in adult school. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance counselor Laura Orenstein, by contrast, works with junior high 
school students, who are more prone to drop out as they get older. Orenstein, 
whose job may also be eliminated in February, often works with students who are 
bused into the San Fernando Valley from more crowded schools elsewhere in the 
district. One case that tested her mettle last year involved a 13-year-old girl 
from Los Angeles who was bused into a junior high school in Granada Hills. The 
teen-ager, who had been physically and sexually abused, had been removed from 
her family and placed in a foster home. Traumatized, she reacted by ditching 
school and running away to a boyfriend's house. 
</P>
<P>
But Orenstein, who had won the girl's confidence during earlier discussions, 
said the teen-ager called from her new hide-out to assure the counselor that 
she was all right. 
</P>
<P>
When Orenstein drove out for a visit, she found the girl living with her 
16-year-old boyfriend, who also was a truant. After long talks, including meals 
at a local fast-food restaurant, she persuaded them both to return to class. 
</P>
<P>
And when school let out for the summer, Orenstein received an unexpected 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
"You . . . make me proud and happy . . . you're like my family," the 
13-year-old girl wrote to Orenstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really going to miss you. I hope you come visit (during) summer. It was 
nice and wonderful riding in your car, you taking me to McDonald's. I hope God 
pays (you for) all these things you have done for me."

A new on-ramp and off-ramp to the Santa Ana Freeway at Beach Boulevard will 
open this week, eight months ahead of schedule, Caltrans officials have 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a win-win situation," Caltrans resident engineer Junior Reichert told 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It is eight months ahead of schedule and within budget too." 
</P>
<P>
The northbound ramps are expected to open today and the southbound ramps are 
scheduled to open Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The $4.1-million interchange, which links Beach Boulevard to the Santa Ana 
Freeway, is seen as a crucial link for the Buena Park central business 
district, which depends on Beach Boulevard for access and visibility. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an event we have waited for for a long time," said Fred Sica, director 
of the Buena Park Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Although construction was completed ahead of schedule, getting the project 
started wasn't an easy task. It was mired on the California Department of 
Transportation's eligibility list for more than 20 years and consistently fell 
victim to budget cuts.LYNDA NATALI

Actor Burt Lancaster remained in stable condition Sunday night at the Los 
Alamitos Medical Center following a moderate stroke last week that left him 
with some weakness and speech problems, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Academy Award winner had been visiting a friend at a Los 
Alamitos center for Alzheimer's patients on Friday morning when he was felled 
by the stroke and rushed to the medical center, just a block away. 
</P>
<P>
He has been plagued by failing health in recent years, prompting his withdrawal 
in 1988 from the film "Old Gringo." 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster has starred in more than 60 films, winning an Oscar in 1960 for his 
portrayal of an evangelist in "Elmer Gantry" and sharing another as co-producer 
of "Marty," honored as Best Picture of 1955.ERIC LICHTBLAU

POLICE BEGIN PROBE AS BINGO PROFITS DIP

<P>
Police for the past two weeks have been investigating the possibility that as 
much as $10,000 was stolen from proceeds of Huntington Beach High School's 
bingo nights, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Friday that financial inconsistencies that touched off the 
investigation may have been attributable to other factors related to the weekly 
bingo games. The games raise money for a variety of the high school's 
activities and programs. 
</P>
<P>
But after financial examiners were unable to rule out the possibility that 
theft may have been involved, bingo officials turned the matter over to police. 
</P>
<P>
The games usually attract about 200 players per week and raise from $1,500 to 
$3,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach High School Booster Promotions Inc., a group of parents who 
since May have coordinated the Tuesday night games, became concerned after 
profits appeared to decrease during September and October, booster president 
Reno Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the amount of winning payoffs can vary dramatically from week to week, 
Bellamy said it is difficult to determine exactly how much revenues decreased. 
Based on the financial examinations, however, he said the group cannot account 
for a sum of money estimated to be between $1,200 and $10,000 during the 
two-month period. 
</P>
<P>
The group had attributed the September figures to low attendance, he said. 
Parents became suspicious, however, when the turnout picked up in October and 
revenues did not. 
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the discrepancies may be explained by a large sum in payoffs 
coming early in the school year. But he also brought up the possibility that 
funds were stolen over several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe that anybody would rip us off," Bellamy said. "But we're 
putting up the red flag in case somebody did." 
</P>
<P>
If money has been stolen, the thief would almost certainly have to be a parent 
volunteer helping to operate the games, Bellamy and school principal Gary Ernst 
said. "That's what's so frightening and sad about this," Ernst said. "Why would 
a parent volunteer his time and energies for this, only to take away from 
it?"JOHN PENNER

Residents attending City Council meetings can now be inappropriate. But forget 
about being disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
New conduct rules remove the 10-year-old prohibition against "inappropriate 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
The change, approved by the council last week, was prompted by a complaint from 
a resident who thought the previous code was stifling. 
</P>
<P>
Mark P. Petracca, a frequent critic of the new, conservative council majority 
elected in June, had said that the old rules of conduct could violate state and 
federal laws guaranteeing free speech by prohibiting criticism of council 
members during meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The rules of conduct are part of a "blue sheet" of information outlining how 
the council conducts its business, how to arrange to address the council in 
person, and what conduct is allowed. The blue sheets are stacked at entrances 
to the council chamber. 
</P>
<P>
After Petracca complained about the rules, City Atty. John L. Fellows studied 
the issue and agreed that the mayor would have no legal grounds to end the 
tirade of a public speaker by ruling the behavior "inappropriate." Instead, 
Fellows' report stated, conduct would have to disrupt the meeting before the 
mayor could silence or eject a speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Petracca, an assistant professor of political science at UC Irvine, said he was 
generally happy with the changes to the blue sheet. He disliked the former 
rules of conduct, he said, because he feared Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan would 
use them to silence criticism of council members. TOM McQUEENEY

WARFARIN EASES RISK OF STROKES

<P>
Low doses of blood-thinning drugs are highly effective in reducing the risk of 
strokes caused by abnormal heartbeats, a study confirms. Such strokes afflict 
75,000 Americans annually. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a major study found that a single daily aspirin tablet dramatically 
reduced strokes triggered by atrial fibrillation, abnormally rapid beating of 
the heart's upper chambers. 
</P>
<P>
A new report, published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, found 
that the drug warfarin also worked well in people with this condition. 
</P>
<P>
Both aspirin and warfarin interfere with the body's tendency to form blood 
clots. The heart's rapidly beating chambers can produce these clots, which may 
travel to the brain and clog up blood vessels, causing strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Warfarin, the active ingredient found in some brands of rat poison, is 
routinely used to prevent strokes in people with severe atrial fibrillation 
caused by damaged heart valves. However, doctors have been reluctant to use 
this medicine in people with milder cases because of the chance it could cause 
serious bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
The new study found that the bleeding risk is slight when the drug is carefully 
controlled by physicians.

FISHING AND POLLUTION POSE INCREASING THREAT TO DOLPHINS, PORPOISES; 
</P>
<P>
SEA LIFE: THE DANGER IS NOT AS DRAMATIC AS THE ONE FACED BY WHALES, SCIENTISTS 
SAY. BUT IT IS REAL NONETHELESS, AND HAS PUSHED SOME SPECIES TO THE BRINK OF 
EXTINCTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Grass-roots and governmental efforts ended the wholesale slaughter of the 
Earth's great whales and saved some species from ignominious extinction for the 
sake of lamp oil, fertilizer and pet food. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists at a recent symposium here warned that the whales' compact 
cousins, porpoises and dolphins, continue to be killed in numbers at least as 
large as those racked up by the deadliest harpoon-wielding whalers of earlier 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Extinction, for some species at least, may be only a decade away. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the American Cetacean Society conference said some cetaceans -- 
the scientific order of whales, dolphins and porpoises -- are vanishing slowly 
because of people's growing appetite for fish and the rapid pollution of the 
seas. And while this scenario is less dramatic than death by harpoon, it 
nonetheless amounts to extermination, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
"In one sense, we have traded the harpoon for the sewage outfall and the 
fishing net," said Scott Kraus of the New England Aquarium in Boston, while 
describing the danger now facing cetaceans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is great reason to be concerned," said Robert Brownell of the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service station in San Simeon, Calif. "For about half the cases 
where we have enough information to make a judgment (about the possible 
extinction of a species), things are going to hell in a hand basket." 
</P>
<P>
Bernd Wursig, a professor in the Marine Mammal Research Program at Texas 
A&amp;M University, said 28 species of small cetaceans are in "very real and 
immediate danger" of extinction, many by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing is the most dangerous threat for several reasons, scientists postulated 
in two dozen papers presented over two days. One reason is that humans 
out-compete cetaceans for food, leaving too few squid, for example, in a 
traditional breeding ground to support a new generation of juveniles and their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Another is that fishing boats inadvertently snare and suffocate porpoises and 
dolphins in the huge nets used to sweep oceans clean of tuna and other 
commercial fishes. Pledges by American tuna boats and canners to abandon 
fishing methods that kill dolphins has not stopped foreign vessels from taking 
their place and feeding a growing taste for tuna in other countries, the 
scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
"The human predator has become an efficient and voracious competitor who 
threatens domination at all levels of the food web," warned Charles (Stormy) 
Mayo of the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
A third impact of fishing is even more disturbing, scientists said. It is the 
increasingly common "targeting" of dolphins and porpoises -- netting them on 
purpose, as a source of relatively inexpensive protein in such impoverished 
countries as Peru and Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands are taken for food each year now -- a substantial increase in 
just a few years -- and the trend is growing. Several dolphin and porpoise 
species, such as the beautiful freshwater beiji in China's Yangtze River and 
the squat little vaquita in the northern Gulf of California, already are being 
pushed close to extinction, scientists warned. 
</P>
<P>
As the annual kill climbs -- and researchers said spotty statistics indicate 
that it already is well over 100,000 small cetaceans annually -- other species 
may follow them toward oblivion unless public pressure and the International 
Whaling Commission are brought to bear on the problem, scientists warned. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the beiji and vaquita, Brownell said that cetacean populations now 
facing serious problems are the striped dolphin in the Mediterranean Sea, the 
familiar bottlenose dolphin off South Africa and the harbor porpoise along the 
east and west coasts of the United States, including California. 
</P>
<P>
"Without immediate and significant intervention, we are going to see the loss 
of some species, and we are going to see it soon," Brownell told the other 
scientists and environmental activists who gathered for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Such warnings overwhelmed small slivers of good news also presented at the 
conference, such as an encouraging report that gray whales, the species most 
often spotted by California whale-watchers, are growing in numbers. Brownell 
said that in the last three decades the worldwide catch of whales has fallen 
about 99%, to 669 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, however, incomplete and anecdotal data indicate that the 
worldwide slaughter of smaller cetaceans has grown dramatically as commercial 
fishing technologies have evolved and Third World economies have declined. 
</P>
<P>
High seas drift nets, miles-long webs strung across the open ocean to snare 
whatever is unlucky enough to encounter them, have been used for only about a 
decade, Brownell said. But their devastating impact on cetaceans, as well as 
many other species, already is being felt. 
</P>
<P>
Squid drift-net fishers in the Pacific, for example, reported inadvertently 
killing 19,000 members of one cetacean species last year alone, he said. Drift 
nets are promoted by economic-development agencies as a cheap and efficient way 
for poor countries to catch food for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There is now evidence that the dolphin population of the eastern tropical 
Pacific cannot continue to withstand this predation and continue to survive," 
Wursig said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds more are taken annually by foreign tuna-fishing fleets that snare 
spotted dolphins in order to catch the yellowfin tuna that inexplicably swim 
below them. Under public pressure, American tuna boats abandoned this practice, 
but foreign fleets have eagerly stepped in to succeed them. "Now Mexico has the 
largest fleets -- and the largest (dolphin) kills," Brownell said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican fishermen -- as well as American farmers and city-dwellers -- also are 
in danger of wiping out the Gulf of California harbor porpoise, a stocky, 
silver, shovel-nosed cetacean also known as the vaquita, or little cow. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the vaquita is a microcosm of the danger facing small cetaceans 
around the world, said Omar Vidal of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and 
Higher Studies in Mexico. He said vaquitas are imperiled by a combination of 
fishing, pollution and changing habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Vidal said fishermen inadvertently snare vaquitas while fishing for shark, 
shrimp or totoaba, another endangered species. Totoaba fishing is illegal, but 
the species is pursued anyway because an unscrupulous fisherman can cut off a 
totoaba's head and pass it off as a corvina, a popular sportfish. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, vaquitas are being poisoned by DDT and other agricultural 
chemicals that leach into the Colorado River in the rainy season and are swept 
into the Gulf of California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And when the rain is light, he added, drinking water demands by cities, 
irrigation and hydroelectric dams prevent any river water at all from reaching 
the gulf, radically changing the region's ecology by affecting salinity, food 
types and food availability. 
</P>
<P>
Vidal said he has documented 95 inadvertent deaths just in fishing nets since 
1985, and estimates there are 200 to 500 vaquitas left. The true death toll, he 
said, is probably closer to 30 or 40 a year, or 15% to 20% of the entire 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Without swift and intensive human intervention, he concluded, the vaquita "is 
in very serious danger of imminent extinction." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Read of the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, said that such 
"incidental" kills are beginning to give way to higher, intentional catches of 
cetaceans for food, in wealthy Japan as well as such impoverished countries as 
Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
In Peru, as in other nations with a growing taste for dolphin and porpoise, 
cetaceans originally were caught by accident in nets set for shark, bonito and 
other pelagic, or open-ocean, fish. Poverty forced some fishermen to eat their 
unintended catch, and its popularity grew. 
</P>
<P>
At $1 per kilo, or less than 50 cents a pound, the meat of dusky dolphins, 
Burmeister porpoises and other cetaceans is cheaper than beef and chicken in 
that South American country, Read said, and therefore has become "an important 
protein source for poor Peruvian families." 
</P>
<P>
Landings at one Peruvian port, Pucasana, were 2,300 dolphins last year, up 
sharply from 200 just four years earlier, Read said. Extrapolating those 
figures to the rest of the country, he estimated that Peru alone may be taking 
as many as 10,000 cetaceans annually for food. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem, he said, is that most of the dolphins are caught in 
August and September, the prime calving season. Read said fishermen often sell 
the valuable adult females they catch and bring home their near-full-term 
fetuses to feed their own families. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unlikely the population can withstand this predation" for long, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution is perhaps the most subtle threat to cetaceans of all sizes, but Mayo 
of the Center for Coastal Studies cautioned that sewage, oil spills and urban 
and agricultural runoff are "acting as a catalyst for rapid and unpredictable 
change" in the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
"Largely for avarice and ignorance, we treat the greatest ecosystem on Earth 
not as our garden but as our dumping ground," he said. "We do so on the archaic 
idea that if we cannot see our wastes on the surface, they are gone forever." 
</P>
<P>
Ramona Haebler, a research veterinary pathologist at the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency station in Narragansett, R.I., said she is investigating the 
role pollution might have played in precipitating mass beaching of bottlenose 
dolphins along the U.S. coast between June, 1987, and May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Necropsies showed the proximate cause of death was "overwhelming intrusive 
infection" of apparently unrelated origin. But she thinks the infections may 
have spread so rapidly because the dolphins' immune systems were depressed by 
chemical contamination. She said the dolphins were tainted by polychlorinated 
biphenyls, or PCBs, at levels 350 times that in Great Lakes fish, which are 
very polluted. 
</P>
<P>
PCBs were used to insulate electrical equipment before PCB manufacture was 
banned; this suspected carcinogen now helps researchers to estimate total 
pollution in animals. Animal fat readily absorbs PCBs, and when they are found 
they indicate the presence of a predictable range of other industrial 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
With so many pressures simultaneously bearing on cetaceans, Mayo said that the 
only hope is for scientists and environmental advocates to make pollution, 
habitat alteration and the slaughter of small cetaceans as visceral a public 
issue as was the rapaciousness of whaling. 
</P>

TELLING DOLPHIN FROM PORPOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just what is the difference between a porpoise and a dolphin, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Not much. At least not much to the casual whale watcher. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Cetacean Society, "It would be convenient to 
differentiate dolphins and porpoises, if only there was some rule we could use. 
. . . Unfortunately, there isn't." 
</P>
<P>
"Some animals are always known as dolphins, and some are always called 
porpoises," the society explains simply in a guide written by Richard Ellis, 
author of "The Book of Whales" and "Dolphins and Porpoises." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, however, small cetaceans with a "beak" are called dolphins; those 
with a rounded head profile are referred to as porpoises. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most small cetaceans conveniently fit this profile. The spinners, 
spotters and bottlenose are all dolphins, while the harbor and speedy Dall's 
porpoises have more rounded heads. 
</P>
<P>
But there are notable exceptions, often quite confusing. The pilot whale, for 
example, is not really a whale, but a member of the dolphin family. But its 
head is distinctively rounded, like that of a porpoise. 
</P>
<P>
The killer whale, too, is not a whale but a dolphin. Yet it also has a head 
more rounded than beaked. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some true whales have beaks, such as the giant bottlenose 
whale or the Cuvier's beaked whale. 
</P>
<P>
A more specific -- though, for most casual observers, less useful -- way to 
distinguish porpoises from dolphins is to look at their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that true porpoises have spade-shaped teeth, while those of most 
other small cetaceans are tapered and sharply pointed. MARK A. STEIN

MAN INJURED IN 2 SUICIDE ATTEMPTS

<P>
A 24-year-old La Habra man set himself on fire and hurled himself in front of a 
moving car Sunday in separate attempts at suicide, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whom police identified as Daniel Dobbs, was rushed to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers said Dobbs suffered serious burns on both legs as well as 
injuries when the car struck him. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at UCI would not confirm the extent of Dobbs' injuries but said he 
was in fair and stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident began about midday Sunday when friends of Dobbs were 
trying to persuade him to seek help for depression. Dobbs, who lives in the 
Wood Lake Village apartment complex on West Lambert Road, apparently grew angry 
and locked himself inside a gated area surrounding the complex's pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses said he lit his clothes on fire," La Habra Police Sgt. Phil 
Stufflebean said. "When his friends saw what was happening, they got into the 
pool area and threw him in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
That put out the fire, and once out of the pool Dobbs agreed to walk across the 
street to the Friendly Hills Medical Center. Although Dobbs at first appeared 
willing and accompanied his friends, he jumped into oncoming traffic when they 
were halfway across the busy, four-lane roadway, Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
"He jumped in front of the car, without any provocation and without any warning 
to the driver," Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
Dobbs hit the front windshield, shattering it and leaving the driver badly 
shaken, The impact of the collision tossed Dobbs about 100 feet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Dobbs was conscious when officers arrived about 1 p.m. He was treated at the 
scene and then taken to UCI. JIM NEWTON

IRVINE AUTHORITIES HOPE TO SNUFF OUT FLEDGLING GANG ACTIVITY;

<P>
CRIME: POLICE EFFORT IS AIMED AT PREVENTING THE CITY FROM BECOMING A HOME TO 
PERMANENT GANGS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Think of gang activity in Orange County and a picture might come to mind of a 
carload of Santa Ana youths opening fire at a rival gang member's house. 
</P>
<P>
But a recent report by Irvine police found that, although this planned 
community of mostly upper-middle-class residents is no mecca for street gangs, 
the city has gang-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, police have encountered a growing number of Irvine 
teen-agers involved in fights, stabbings and beatings. Police also estimate 
that gang members from surrounding cities are responsible for half of the 
city's burglaries and vehicle thefts. 
</P>
<P>
This rise in gang activity prompted police investigators to spend two months 
last summer examining gang-related crimes and taking a hard look at Irvine's 
fledgling gangs. The resulting 32-page report and recommendations show that 
while gang problems are small, they are growing noticeably. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a crossroads," said Sgt. Philip F. Povey of the Irvine Police 
Department. "It's time for us to formulate some policy on (gangs). This will 
affect what Irvine looks like five, 10 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police are recommending a coordinated anti-gang approach that would add 
seven new officers to handle anti-gang activities and involve the school 
district and community groups. The effort is aimed at preventing Irvine from 
becoming a home to permanent gangs, Povey said. 
</P>
<P>
The city does not now have any officers assigned to gang crimes. The extra 
officers would concentrate on keeping track of outside gangs and watching the 
growth of the city's ganglike youth groups, Povey said. They would also be 
available for stakeouts and other specialized crime work. 
</P>
<P>
Other police recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
* Adding a Drug Awareness Resistance Education officer to teach anti-drug and 
anti-gang classes at Irvine's four high schools. The district now offers the 
courses only for sixth graders. 
</P>
<P>
* Notifying parents when police believe their children are involved in gangs, 
and establishing a gang-diversion and counseling program for gang members and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
* Working with schools to develop a peer counseling program for teen-agers and 
training teachers and administrators to identify actual and potential gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
* Encouraging Irvine service clubs to sponsor youth programs that would give 
teen-agers more constructive after-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not reveal the cost of their anti-gang plan, but based on current 
police department costs, the increased staff and programs would total at least 
$500,000 a year. Due to uncertain economic times ahead for the city, the Police 
Department might not immediately ask for money from the City Council, said Lt. 
Vic Thies. 
</P>
<P>
"With the recession coming, it doesn't look too bright," Thies said. "If the 
money's not there, we'll come up with alternative recommendations and start the 
ones that don't require as much money." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the far-reaching recommendations, Povey said Irvine's gang problem 
should not be seen as major. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is very, very small, and we're not trying to say the sky is 
falling, because it's not," he said. "I'm sure other Southern California cities 
would trade with us in a heartbeat, their gang situation to ours." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Robert Sayne, head of the Santa Ana Police Department's gang unit, said 
Irvine might have troubles with delinquent teen-agers but he doubted it would 
ever have a true gang problem because it lacks the poverty and the long history 
of gangs facing cities such as Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a trendy thing to do," Sayne said of Irvine's problems. "These 
kids are bored to death in a community where every home has 2.5 kids and a BMW. 
I don't feel gangs will establish themselves in Irvine and continue to thrive." 
</P>
<P>
While police say none of the 16 potential gangs identified in Irvine has 
reached a "hard core" stage, several of the groups have engaged in violent or 
criminal behavior -- the key definition of a gang. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as them being highly organized like gangs in Santa Ana or some of the 
Asian gangs, no, they're not even close to that," Thies said. "And hopefully 
they never will be." 
</P>
<P>
Still, groups resembling gangs are emerging among Irvine teens, often spurred 
by a student who has moved into the city from an area where gangs are a way of 
life, the report said. Most prominent among these formative gangs is the 
2-year-old Los Suicycos Locos, a multiracial group of 20 to 60 Irvine and 
Tustin-area teen-agers whose members have been linked to several recent, 
violent confrontations, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Suicycos came to the Police Department's attention in March, 1989, after 
members got into a fight with athletes from Woodbridge High School at a Del 
Taco restaurant. Three youths were arrested after two students were hit by a 
car and two others suffered cuts and stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
At first, police dismissed it as a fight between students from rival high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
But later that year, an 18-year-old Los Suicycos member was arrested as a 
suspect in the shooting of a 19-year-old alleged rival gang member in a Tustin 
park, and another member was arrested in Newport Beach after allegedly beating 
up a student with a baseball bat during a high school basketball game. And 
early this year, police suspected a Los Suicycos member of stabbing a teen-ager 
at a Costa Mesa dance club. 
</P>
<P>
"They went from drinking and occasional graffiti to the big time . . . with 
guns and weapons," said Tustin Police Sgt. Steve Lewis, who helped investigate 
the Tustin shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Even more ganglike, police said, were the attitudes of two victims of a July 
fight between a splinter group of older Los Suicycos members and a group of 
Mission Viejo youths. The two injured youths refused to cooperate with police, 
saying they would take care of their assailants themselves, a response more 
like those of hard-core gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're acting like, they're talking like, and they want to be like (a gang)," 
said Thies, who called Los Suicycos "our in-house gang." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, recent overtures from two outside street gangs have Irvine police 
worried that the Suicycos might form an alliance with a bigger, tougher gang. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling 60s Crips in Pomona and the Lopers in Santa Ana have offered to 
link with the Suicycos for drug sales, promising the protection and reputation 
of a bigger gang, Povey said. So far, Los Suicycos have rejected the alliance 
offers, but the deal might seem attractive because they have been on the losing 
end of several fights with other non-gang youths, such as student athletes, 
Povey said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of occasional intrusions by gang members from other cities onto Irvine 
high school campuses, Irvine Unified School District officials have been 
working with police on the potential growth of gangs, said Paul Mills, director 
of alternative and adult education and chairman of the district's Operation 
Safe Campus Committee. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the district's board of trustees adopted a formal policy stating 
that the district will not tolerate gang activity on campus. The policy says 
that schools should work with police and community organizations to prevent 
gang activity.

GARY FUMBLING AWAY STARTING ROLE

<P>
Don't look now, but the role as the Rams' primary tailback is beginning to slip 
out of Cleveland Gary's hands as swiftly as those footballs have been the past 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After Gary fumbled one away in Sunday's first quarter -- his third lost fumble 
in three weeks -- Coach John Robinson yanked him in favor of little-used Gaston 
Green, and then after the Rams' 38-23 victory over the Browns, the coach had 
much praise for Green. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson didn't have quite so many kind words for Gary, however, who saw 
limited post-fumble time. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you call on-the-job training," Robinson said of the Gary hook. "He 
can't fumble the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been negligent, I guess you'd almost say, in (not) playing Gaston. And he 
has earned the right to play on this football team." 
</P>
<P>
Green, who had only 31 carries all season before Sunday, rushed 13 times for 57 
yards and caught one pass for a 16-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I really haven't had the chance too much in my career, so it felt good to get 
in there early and get some carries," Green said. "Coach Robinson decides who 
plays when, and I just wanted to do everything I could in this opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
With Gary's fumbles bothering Robinson, could Green begin to challenge for the 
starting spot? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're both good players," Robinson said. "I don't want it to be one 
of those teeter-totters where one's up, the other's down, but they're both good 
players. Gaston has proven that he can do some things." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Greene said he was just as surprised as everybody else when the referee 
waived off his apparent forced fumble on a sack of Bernie Kosar, Browns 
quarterback. Greene came at Kosar from the blind side, and the ball appeared to 
spring loose on impact. It was recovered by defensive tackle Alvin Wright, but 
the referee ruled Kosar was in Greene's grasp and blew the play dead as a sack. 
</P>
<P>
"In the grasp?" said Greene, who had three sacks Sunday. "I hit him. I hit him. 
OK, I can understand if I was pulling him to the ground and then he fumbled. 
OK. But I thought I put a pretty good shot on him." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams and Browns were involved in some pushing and shoving in the final 
moments of the game when the Rams were deep in Cleveland territory and trying 
to get their newest running back, Marcus Dupree, an NFL touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After Dupree dived into the line, several Browns appeared to take swings at him 
in the pile, and one player seemed to be twisting his leg after the play was 
blown dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I was saying, 'What's going on? What's going on?' " said Dupree, who got 
his first playing time since the Giants' game and gained eight yards in two 
carries. "I had to get up fighting, get a little respect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Carson is gone, fired as the Browns' coach four weeks ago, and in Cleveland 
they're campaigning for a similar fate for owner Art Modell. 
</P>
<P>
Two T-shirts were making the rounds at Cleveland Stadium Sunday. One read: 
Losing Is A Work of Art. The other featured mug shots of the Three Stooges with 
the following inscription: Larry, Curly and Moe-dell. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger messages were reserved for the bedsheet banners hanging all over the 
stadium. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 Art + Modell = 2 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Santa, We Want A New Owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Must Go. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey Art, Stop The Maddness. 
</P>
<P>
Hey Dawgs, check your spelling.

A Southern Section hearing, originally set for Tuesday to determine if Charlie 
Brande violated section rules while he coached girls' volleyball at Corona del 
Mar High School, has been postponed indefinitely, Brande said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Brande said he will meet with Stan Thomas, section commissioner of athletics, 
today and said "the whole thing will probably be dropped." Brande said he will 
not return as Corona del Mar's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas confirmed Sunday that the hearing has been postponed and has not yet 
been rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Brande was suspended in August in the wake of an investigation into his 
coaching of club players with high school eligibility remaining. Corona del Mar 
won the State Division I title Saturday night. MIKE REILLEY

HIGH SCHOOL: KATELLA'S ORIZABA HAS FOUND A HOME ON THE FIELD DESPITE SEVERAL 
CHANGES OFF IT.

<P>
Armando Orizaba waited to hear his name. . . . and waited. 
</P>
<P>
It was last spring during Spanish class at Katella High School, and the 1990 
All-Empire League soccer team was being announced over the public-address 
system. Orizaba felt his name would be called, but because the Knights had 
finished fifth in league play, he wasn't expecting much. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe I would get first team," Orizaba said. "When all the teams had 
been announced, my name had not been mentioned. I figured maybe next year." 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba figured too soon. In another moment, his classmates were applauding, 
patting him on the back and congratulating him on being named the league's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
It was a heady experience for Orizaba, whose childhood involved a good deal of 
adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Mexico, but at the age of 6, he came with his family to the 
United States, where he struggled to learn English and learned not to struggle 
with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the wrong people, Orizaba played soccer, which he learned from his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Now a senior, Orizaba already has had a successful high school career and is 
looking at a future that includes college, soccer and, maybe, another Empire 
League MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer is my life," said Orizaba, who is 5 feet 5, 140 pounds. "I want to play 
in college and, if possible, I want to be a professional." 
</P>
<P>
Given Orizaba's ability, those might be more than idle dreams. 
</P>
<P>
In his first three seasons on the varsity, Orizaba scored 32 goals. He scored 
16 last season even though he was constantly defended by two or more players. 
Because the Knights were inexperienced, most opposing teams concentrated on 
Orizaba, who had been a first-team all-league selection as a sophomore. But he 
still was able to create opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba also is adept at scoring on direct kicks. He scored on six last season, 
including the game-winner against Baldwin Park in the final of the Brea-Olinda 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams are lucky to score three or four goals on direct kicks, and Armando 
had six," Katella Coach Ray Smith said. "He's an exceptional player." 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba was born into soccer. His father, Armando Sr., and his five uncles 
played for club teams in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Sr. even tried out for America, a professional team in Mexico City, and 
survived until the final cut. Five months later, he brought his family to Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The change was tough for Armando Jr., who did not know English. Along with the 
language problems, he was wary of his neighborhood, which he said was plagued 
by gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad area, but I tried to stay away from the people who were trouble," 
Orizaba said. "I really didn't have any problems, but you never knew in that 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer was the one thing that made him feel comfortable. His father played 
sweeper -- a defensive position -- for several club teams during the following 
years. Every weekend, the family would watch. 
</P>
<P>
"It was big family outing," Orizaba said. "I remember the time when they beat 
this team from New York on penalty kicks. He played great that day." 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba also was developing into a good player. He played in youth soccer 
leagues in the Santa Ana area until he was 11, when he joined a club team for 
players 18 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba received constant coaching from his father, which helped him develop 
faster. After every game, Armando Sr. would give his son advice. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad always joked with me that the day I could take him one-on-one, he would 
quit soccer," Orizaba said. "It was always fun to play with him. We'd go to the 
park and he'd defend against me." 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba developed into a skilled offensive player. Although he was much smaller 
than other players, he had good instincts and quickness, which made him 
difficult to defend. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he became so good that by the time he was 13, he was playing on a club 
team with his father and uncles. 
</P>
<P>
"Armando has been playing against older players since he was very young," Smith 
said. "That has made him a much better player. He's far more advanced than the 
average high school player." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Orizaba was going to give up the sport in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
During that fall, his parents got jobs working for a shirt manufacturer in 
Anaheim and moved the family to a neighborhood near Katella. Orizaba, who had 
been attending Santa Ana Valley High School, was faced with another change. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, Smith put Orizaba on the varsity, where he felt more 
isolated and intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seemed so big," said Orizaba, who says he was 5-3 at the time. "I 
didn't have any friends on the team at first. It was hard." 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba didn't enjoy the sport any more and was uninterested in practice. His 
grades also began to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
What turned him around was Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Armando wasn't happy," Smith said. "The older guys liked him, but they 
used to tease him a lot. Armando kept asking me to put him on the frosh/soph 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried that he would fall in with the wrong people without soccer. I 
knew it would be better to keep on the varsity, where I could help him more. I 
told him we needed him to win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights did win the 1988 league title, their first since 1982. Orizaba 
scored two goals as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
After the season, Smith and Orizaba discussed what his goals should be for the 
the rest of his high school career. Smith also worked out a class schedule that 
included plenty of college prep classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Smith saved me," Orizaba said. "He's more than a coach; he's a good 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba is finally at home and adjusted. He has even wandered outside the area 
of soccer. This year he was the placekicker for the Katella football team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time in 20 years that I went after a student to play football," 
Katella Coach Larry Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Orizaba made five of six field goals and 18 of 19 extra points. Both his misses 
were the result of blocks. 
</P>
<P>
He set a school record for longest field goal with a 48-yarder against Western 
and earned a spot on the all-league team. 
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of the season for Orizaba was his lone tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was against El Dorado, and this guy breaks a kickoff up the sideline," 
Anderson said. "Armando was the last guy, and he made the play. Not only that, 
but he got a mark on his helmet. The rest of the season, he would come up to me 
and show me that mark. He was really proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
Football was fun, but soccer remains Orizaba's love. He has received letters 
from a few colleges, including UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
If he doesn't get a scholarship to a four-year school, Orizaba said he would 
play at a community college. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm going to play somewhere," Orizaba said. "But right now I'm only 
concerned about this season. I want to win the league championship." 
</P>
<P>
And another MVP award will likely follow. 
</P>

Theater Chain Expansion: Despite the slumping economy, Newport Beach-based 
Edwards Theatres says it will continue its $45-million expansion program.

<P>
Edwards, one of Southern California's largest theater chains, says it has eight 
multi-screen theaters under construction. Most of the deals were done several 
years ago, according to company Chairman James Edwards Sr. "We're not backing 
off," he said, though he does expect a recession to hurt ticket sales. Among 
the movie houses under construction are theaters in Alhambra, Del Mar, 
Murrieta, La Verne, Ontario and Rancho California.

Canada Is in Recession, Government Says: After seven years of robust growth, 
Canada's economy has officially slipped into recession, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
It reported that gross domestic product, a wide measure of economic activity, 
fell for the second consecutive quarter -- Canada's definition of a recession. 
In the July-to-September period, the economy contracted at an annualized rate 
of 1%. In the second quarter, output declined at a 1.2% rate. Economists said 
the downturn is mild, however, and, barring a Persian Gulf war and further oil 
price increases, should end sometime next year.

Firms Cut Hiring Plans: Hiring plans of U.S. companies will drop steeply to 
recession levels the first quarter of 1991, particularly in the economically 
battered Northeast, the world's largest temporary help firm said. Manpower Inc. 
said its sampling of more than 15,000 businesses showed that 15% plan to 
increase hiring while 16% plan to cut their workforces, for a net hiring drop 
of 1%. It said the net drop is the first that the survey has turned up since 
the first quarter of 1983, when the nation was emerging from the last 
recession.

Industry Profit Falls, S&amp;P Says: Industries earned slightly less than 5 
cents profit on the dollar in 1989, down 10% from the previous year -- with no 
outlook for improvement in the near future, Standard &amp; Poor Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
Companies making up the S&amp;P Industrials saw profits fall from an average of 
5.46 cents on the dollar in 1988 to 4.91 cents in 1989, and the average 
continues to slide. Profits for the four quarters ending in June fell to 4.38 
cents for each sales dollar earned. The S&amp;P Industrials group entered the 
1980s at almost the same profit level that it ended the decade with. In 1980, 
profit on the sales dollar was 4.92 cents.

Gillette Threatens To Close Plant: The consumer products firm is threatening to 
close the world's largest razor blade plant if Boston bans ozone-depleting 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering outlawing chemicals that deplete the ozone layer 
protecting the Earth from damaging rays from the sun. Gillette Vice Chairman 
Joseph E. Mullaney said the ban would put the company at a competitive 
disadvantage, and if the bill is adopted, Gillette will close its South Boston 
plant next year. The plant employs 3,100.

HOLDERS OF JUNK BOND FUNDS ARE URGED TO SELL; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTING: AN ORGANIZATION THAT TRACKS DEFAULTS PREDICTS THAT $50 BILLION WORTH 
OF THE HIGH-RISK ISSUES WILL GO SOUR IN 1991 AND 1992.

The Bond Investors Assn. is offering some advice to junk bond mutual fund 
investors: Get out before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit organization, which tracks bond defaults, predicts that $50 
billion in junk bonds will go bad in 1991 and 1992. Mutual funds that invested 
in the dismal junk bond market are holding many bonds that they would sell if 
they could find buyers, the Miami Lakes, Fla.-based association said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the funds have been forced to sell their liquid holdings as investors 
cash in shares, they are left with default-vulnerable and hard-to-sell issues, 
said C. Richard Lehman, the association's president. That leads to a number of 
problems, according to Lehman, including the possibility that the bond funds 
will default at a rate higher than that for other types of investments. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the group says, the bond funds' daily net asset values, or net 
worth, are routinely overstated. If the bond funds could actually sell their 
unwanted securities, the bonds' market prices would likely plummet, bringing 
down the net asset value, the Bond Investors Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
"A fund holder who is selling his shares is being overpaid relative to the 
realizable value of the portfolio," the association said in the December 
edition of Defaulted Bonds Newsletter. "The only benefit fund holders still 
have is the ability to liquidate their holdings even while their fund cannot." 
</P>
<P>
The association did not mention particular mutual funds. "We decided not to try 
to finger the specific candidates, although we could," Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond fund managers declined to talk about the report. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, Betty Hart, said investors 
frequently hedge their risk by diversifying. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of different types of mutual funds with varying objectives 
and, generally speaking, for any fund that is highly aggressive, whether it be 
equities or bonds, good financial planning principles suggest people have more 
than one investment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The association also takes bond funds to task for their accounting methods. The 
group wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to force the funds to set 
aside some of the bonds' interest income to cover losses expected from 
defaults. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not unlike a business concern that sells its products on credit to 
high-risk customers without booking a provision for uncollectible accounts 
receivable," the newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
There is good news, though. 
</P>
<P>
If the junk bond market ever recovers, there could be huge gains. The 
association advises investors who want to stay in junk bonds that they should 
sell their current fund holding and buy into a newly established fund -- or one 
with assets of less than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
It says go ahead and pay the typical 5% front-end load. "A new fund should 
outperform an existing fund by many times this cost," the newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
Junk funds have been feeling the heat lately. The collapse of the market has 
sent prices reeling and their corresponding yields soaring. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the funds to make it 
clear to potential investors that high yield means high risk. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds' prices have been beaten down as the market has become more fearful 
that a recession will make it hard, if not impossible, for some issuers to make 
interest and principal payments.

'WAITING FOR THE DOUGH,' A DRAMA STARRING R. H. MACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks now, R. H. Macy &amp; Co., the financially distressed retailer, has 
told people that it is raising $250 million of new money from its stockholders. 
But Macy's has yet to receive a penny of the promised funds, and it isn't clear 
when the money will appear. If you made a drama out of this, you would have to 
call it "Waiting for the Dough." 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, Macy's money will show up before Godot -- who, as you may recall, 
was due at any moment but never put in an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's, to its credit -- no pun intended -- has managed to get amazing mileage 
just by telling the world that its shareholders, who include some of America's 
richest and smartest investors, were riding to the rescue. The announcements 
that General Electric Capital Corp. will buy Macy's credit subsidiary for $100 
million, and that GECC and other Macy's stockholders will fork over $100 
million to $150 million to buy new Macy's shares, reassured Macy's suppliers 
and kept merchandise flowing in. 
</P>
<P>
So Macy's has made it to the peak of the Christmas selling season, now under 
way, with a maximum of merchandise on its shelves and a minimum of bad 
publicity. Which is a lot better than Federated Department Stores, now in 
bankruptcy, did under similar circumstances a year ago. If Macy's had managed 
its business as deftly as it has managed the news, it wouldn't be in any 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But the talk is starting to wear a bit thin. Godot, where are you? 
</P>
<P>
The key to whether Macy's management and its stockholders are serious about 
helping the company or whether they're just trying to bluff their way past 
Christmas, is the stock purchase deal. The sale of Macy's Credit is nice -- 
every $100 million helps, even when you're $5.6 billion in debt. But under 
Macy's loan agreements, the cash that the company gets from that sale, which is 
supposed to close in January, must be used to repay relatively low-cost bank 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
The stock sale is where the real drama lies. A sale, I must mention, that 
values Macy's equity at the same $300 million that investors paid in Macy's 
1986 leveraged buyout. A price that is a mere one-fifth of the price that 
Macy's was asking for its stock in September, swearing up and down that it 
wouldn't sell for less. That quick 80% markdown gives you an idea of how badly 
Macy's needs the money, which it could use to buy back perhaps $400 million of 
its bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Even if $150 million of new cash arrives soon, Macy's will still be left with 
its basic problem: It is so heavily laden with debt from the LBO and the 1988 
purchase of two Federated chains that it's hard to see how it can dig its way 
out. The company's operations make money, but not enough to cover its interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't just me trying to depress you. This is essentially what the Standard 
&amp; Poor's bond-rating people said recently when S&amp;P announced that it is 
thinking of downgrading Macy's already depressed bonds. 
</P>
<P>
If you cast an eye over Macy's balance sheet and income statement, then look at 
the recession/depression that's starting to afflict its major markets, you have 
to conclude that Macy's has a good chance of going Chapter 11 in 1991. (The 
company, you should know, says I'm full of beans.) 
</P>
<P>
A Macy's bankruptcy is not something I'm eager to see, if only because Macy's 
is the biggest advertiser in Newsday, the newspaper that pays my salary. But a 
Macy's bankruptcy wouldn't be the end of the world. Even with Macy's in Chapter 
11, its namesake chain and its Bullock's and I. Magnin department store chains 
would operate, as would its Aeropostale, Charter Club and Fantasies by Morgan 
Taylor specialty chains. After all, Federated is in Chapter 11, but 
Bloomingdale's is still around. 
</P>
<P>
But a bankruptcy would pretty much wipe out the value of Macy's stock. Given 
that fact -- and the fact that you can make up to 80% a year on your money by 
buying Macy's bonds if the company doesn't default -- why would anyone in his 
right mind buy Macy's stock, which is riskier than the bonds? 
</P>
<P>
Given the identities of the four investors who have committed to buy $100 
million of the stock if other holders don't come across -- GE Capital ($43.1 
million), Laurence Tisch's Loews tobacco-television-insurance conglomerate 
($25.8 million), Michael Price's Mutual Shares mutual funds ($22.4 million) and 
Michigan shopping mall mogul A. Alfred Taubman ($8.7 million) -- we are 
obviously dealing with people in their right minds. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious thing for these investors to do, if their motivations are merely 
financial, is keep their checkbooks in their pockets until after Christmas. If 
Macy's has a decent Christmas, they buy the new stock and pray. If Macy's has 
an awful Christmas, they put the company into Chapter 11 and try to use their 
$150 million to buy control of the post-bankruptcy Macy's, which will have much 
less debt than the current Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's won't say anything but wants it known that it expects the stockholders 
to buy their shares before Christmas. A spokesperson for GE Capital, the only 
stockholder that would talk on the record, first said the deal is supposed to 
be completed next year, then the next day retreated to vague generalities. 
After Macy's made a call or two to GE, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
All four investors have an interest in Macy's other than its stock: Loews and 
Mutual Shares own bonds whose price would increase if new stock is sold, GECC 
is a big lender to Macy's and is eager to buy Macy's Credit, and Taubman leases 
tons of space to Macy's stores. Still, those interests aren't enough to justify 
a new $100-million investment. At least, I don't think they are. 
</P>
<P>
If the stock purchase closes before year-end, anyone who cares about Macy's 
will owe stockholders a rising vote of thanks, because they will be acting as 
financial statesmen willing to take a risk without the commensurate rewards. 
If, however, their money doesn't show up until 1991, these stockholders will be 
the Milli Vanilli of finance -- a great show, but not much substance. Tickets, 
anyone?

REP'S 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' RINGS WITH HOLIDAY JOY

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Repertory Theatre has produced a bold, challenging, beautifully 
wrought version of "A Christmas Carol" on its Lyceum Stage that will not be to 
everyone's taste. 
</P>
<P>
To bring home Dickens' message about the poor of his day in the show's 15th 
annual year here, directors Walter Schoen and Tavis Ross have contemporized the 
setting so that we can see Charles Dickens' story as it might be discovered by 
the poor of our day. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens himself, a passionate advocate for the overworked and underfed, would 
probably love it. But post-show complaints mixed with praise from an audience 
that seemed divided about having their old-fashioned "Christmas Carol" tampered 
with. 
</P>
<P>
Without changing the words in the faithful adaptation by Douglas Jacobs, the 
company's artistic director, the story begins in a contemporary urban setting, 
not unlike the streets surrounding the theater itself. The actors are dressed 
like our own homeless, crowding around barrels of burning paper for warmth. And 
their varying ethnic backgrounds -- African-American, Anglo, Latino -- hold up 
a mirror to our own multicultural society. 
</P>
<P>
Into this mix, a little boy, played by the adorably precocious 10-year-old Kory 
Abosada, brings a copy of "A Christmas Carol" home to read to his mother. Just 
as he gets started, the police sirens start shrieking and the people run to 
hide. The little boy returns with his book before the others do and encounters 
an old man (Leon Singer) checking the place out. The boy approaches the man, 
and the man slaps him -- hard. The other homeless return and surround the old 
man menacingly. 
</P>
<P>
The old man's punishment as mimed by the company? He has to act out "A 
Christmas Carol" with them, playing the part of Ebenezer Scrooge. The boy plays 
the parts of both Tiny Tim and the youngest of the Ebenezers that Scrooge meets 
in his subsequent journey with the Ghost of Christmas Past. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the story ends, with the cast pulling props from their environment 
and singing haunting Christmas melodies that come out of their variety of 
heritages, the old man who plays Scrooge has had a change of heart. This time 
when the sirens come, he puts his arm around the little boy protectively. Like 
Scrooge, he has learned a lesson about keeping Christmas in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
This year's production is an extension of the contemporary setting explored by 
Schoen as solo director last year. But while the idea seemed unfinished a year 
ago, this time the added pantomimed prologue brings the message home. 
</P>
<P>
One certainly cannot imagine any improvement on the performances. 
</P>
<P>
Singer, an actor who hails originally from Mexico, is a memorable Scrooge -- so 
crusty and cynical that it is all the more moving when he melts. Lance E. 
Nichols is stalwart as Scrooge's good clerk, Bob Cratchit, Richard Ortega 
utterly charming as Scrooge's good-hearted nephew, Fred. Tavis Ross suggests 
pain even as he inspires fear as the ghost of Scrooge's old partner in 
parsimony, Jacob Marley. Osayande Baruti brings charismatic life to the 
high-stepping Fezziwig, the good master Scrooge had as a young apprentice. And 
Cristina Soria lends fine support in her double role as Fezziwig's and 
Cratchit's wives. 
</P>
<P>
Narrators Dana Pere and Alyce Smith-Cooper keep the story flowing as they pass 
the story from hand to hand. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nelson, who plays the oldest of the young Ebenezers, provides the 
spirited choreography that is such a delight in the Fezziwig scene. Musical 
director Linda Vickerman does such a fine job with the arrangements and 
compositions sung by this terrific array of voices, that one wishes more music 
could have been included. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Buderwitz's sets, nicely lit by John B. Forbes, are as they were last year 
-- intelligently evocative of a modern street scene, with props designed to 
look as if they came naturally from such a place. The costumes by Mary Larson 
also seem reminiscent of those from last year, but again cleverly so. The best 
of the pleasing bunch has got to be the Ghost of Christmas Present costume 
which makes the big, hearty-voiced Richard Allen look like a human Christmas 
tree, with tinsel and name brand packaging hanging from his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
But the true completion of the contemporizing concept here is the San Diego 
Rep's Magic Christmas program. Each patron is requested to bring an unwrapped 
present for disadvantaged children and/or their families from the Hillcrest 
Receiving Home, St. Vincent de Paul, Casa de Amaro, Hidden Valley House, 
Southeast Emergency Quarters, Project Safehouse and Casa de Paz. The presents 
will be placed under a tree in the Lyceum lobby and on Dec. 19, the actor 
playing Scrooge will give out the presents after a benefit performance for 
children and families from these shelters. 
</P>
<P>
For that audience, this setting should certainly bring the Dickens' story home. 
</P>
<P>

PUTTING OUT CHILDREN'S URGE TO PLAY WITH FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
ARSON: A COUNTY PROGRAM AIMS TO DETER YOUNGSTERS THROUGH A GRAPHIC PRESENTATION 
THAT CAN INCLUDE PHOTOGRAPHS OF BURN VICTIMS. 
</P>

<P>
Ann Hughes stripped her house of every match and lighter in an effort to stop 
her son from setting fires. 
</P>
<P>
But she knew that was not enough when she picked up the boy's 2-year-old 
brother one morning and found that half an inch of the toddler's hair was 
singed black. 
</P>
<P>
"I freaked out," Hughes said, recalling the day that she made the discovery 
seven years ago. "The only thing I could think to do was call a fireman." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Hughes enrolled her son in the Ventura County Fire Department's 
Juvenile Firesetter Program. The program, which pairs each child firesetter 
with a firefighter, uses education and rewards to discourage children from 
playing with fire. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' son is one of more than 500 children under 13 years of age who have 
gone through the county program since it began in 1983. According to officials 
connected with the program, no more than 10 of the children have reverted to 
setting fires. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem of children setting fires is serious, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Juveniles, either acting alone or with an adult, were responsible for 84% of 
the 44,000 fires intentionally set in California in 1988, according to the most 
recent data available from the Office of the State Fire Marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Children who were simply playing with lighters or matches were responsible for 
6,000 of the fires, which resulted in six deaths, 119 injuries and $15.5 
million in damage, according to the data. 
</P>
<P>
State Fire Marshal James F. McMullen said children ages 2 to 7 who play with 
matches and lighters usually do so out of an innocent curiosity about fire. 
Children ages 7 to 11 may set fires to get attention because of an underlying 
problem, such as abuse or loneliness. And youngsters ages 12 or older may have 
psychological problems, McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, if unchecked, a curious firesetter becomes a juvenile arsonist 
and then an adult arsonist," McMullen said. "It's a graduating problem if it's 
not cared for." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said she saw a dramatic increase in the number of fires her son set in 
the six months before she enrolled him in the Ventura County program. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said the child's occasional interest in setting fire to piles of 
Popsicle sticks and shoelaces became a daily habit. But the fires stopped 
immediately after her son began meeting with Fire Engineer Jim Ackerman, Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' son, now 15, has set only one fire since he completed the program. That 
slip was quickly corrected with one additional meeting with Ackerman, Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he started realizing the seriousness of what could happen," Hughes 
said of her son. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County program, which is presented in three sessions, introduces 
children to the dangers of playing with fire. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can explain it like a firefighter -- the pain of burns and the treating 
of burns," Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
During the first meeting, the firefighters tell the children and their families 
a story about what happens to people who are seriously burned. The detailed 
narrative, called the burn treatment story, is illustrated with snapshots of 
fire victims that show everything from how dead tissue is pulled from burned 
areas to the way skin grafts are performed. 
</P>
<P>
The firesetters are also shown pictures of children who have sustained burns so 
severe that their facial characteristics have been obliterated. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the children are asked to rub a basketball while 
firefighters liken the sensation to the tough, unpliable texture of a burned 
person's skin. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters may go on to say that some burned children cannot throw a baseball 
because of damage to their hands. And they sometimes talk about how sad it is 
when toys, such as skateboards, are destroyed in a fire. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes children are taken to the site of a fire so they can smell the smoke 
and witness the destruction firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to make them experience it without going through the tragedy," 
Ackerman said. Later in the session, the children are asked to apologize to 
their parents for setting fires. Then, the family is coached in fire-safety 
practices, such as the "stop, drop and roll" technique of squelching flames on 
one's body or clothing, Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters also use the first visit, which takes place at the children's 
houses, to evaluate the home environments of the firesetters. During an 
interview with the children alone, the firefighters try to determine whether 
the children are simply curious about fires or are problem firesetters who are 
reacting to underlying trauma. 
</P>
<P>
If the firefighters notice something that indicates possible child abuse or 
other problems, they contact another county agency, Ackerman said. In the case 
of problem firesetters, the firefighters confer with mental health experts and 
decide whether to run their educational program in conjunction with counseling, 
Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
During the second meeting, which is held two weeks after the first, the 
firefighters discuss smoke detectors and exit drills from the house in case of 
fire. The children are enlisted to check the smoke detector once a month to 
make sure it works, Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
The reward for good behavior comes a month later with a trip to the fire 
station, where the children are encouraged to put on firemen's gear, play on 
the firetruck and squirt water from a hose. They are given mock firefighter's 
badges and certificates signed by the fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County program was begun in 1983 because firefighters began getting 
more and more requests from parents who needed help. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 firefighters got together and organized a meeting with a staff 
psychologist from Ventura County on how to interview a firesetter. They also 
relied on a guide put out by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that 
discusses counseling juvenile firesetters. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 firefighters are now involved in the program, which has grown to 
include agencies such as the Ventura Fire Department, the Santa Paula Fire 
Department, the county Correctional Services Agency, county Mental Health 
Services and the Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn Foundation in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
The department also runs a Teen Fire Prevention Program developed four years 
ago for teen-agers who have been cited for arson by the police or a fire 
investigator, Ackerman said. The juveniles meet with firefighters and listen to 
the burn treatment story, then spend about 25 hours collecting aluminum cans. 
The proceeds from the cans are donated to the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation to 
help send burned children to a special summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
Ackerman also has compiled a book on the program, which includes the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency material and referral information for problem 
firesetters and possible child abuse victims. The book, which also includes the 
burn treatment story and pictures, has been sold to fire departments in other 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees with all parts of the Ventura County program. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Fineman, one of the first Southern California psychologists to treat 
young arsonists, said he is uneasy about the program's practice of showing 
pictures of burn victims to children for fear it might traumatize them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that that is necessary at all," Fineman said. "The scare approach 
is not effective." 
</P>
<P>
But county officials argue that they have had no complaints about the pictures, 
which are shown to the children only after parental permission is obtained. 
</P>
<P>
And Linda Ramos, a typist for the county, said the pictures of the burn victims 
helped curb her 9-year-old son's firesetting tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
"They like to see things going up in flames," she said of child firesetters. 
"They don't like to think it might be themselves going up in flames." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said her son, who set three fires in one week in September, has not set 
one since he finished the program. And he constantly wears the firefighter's 
badge he earned, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after he takes a shower, he will put the badge back on his pajamas," 
Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said she would also like to enroll her 3-year-old son in the program 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it saved my kids' lives as well as ours," Ramos said of the program. 
"He could have burned the house down as well as us in it."

FAIR-GOERS CRITICIZE ANTI-WAR PROTESTERS; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATION: SOME CROWD MEMBERS APPLAUD THE 60 MARCHERS OPPOSED TO A WAR IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST. OTHERS HONK HORNS OR FLASH PEACE SIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As they marched through the crowds of a Ventura street fair Sunday, protesters 
in the county's first demonstration against a possible Middle East war were 
spat upon, cursed at and accused of undermining American soldiers in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration by Ventura County's fledgling movement against a potential 
Persian Gulf war -- forged at a hasty meeting of area peace, environmental, 
civil rights and church groups Thursday -- rekindled the type of animosity that 
divided communities and families during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
A passing truck driver screamed that the protesters cost the lives of U.S. 
servicemen in Vietnam, and a man waiting at a food stand accused them of aiding 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's cause. "You're all a real comfort to the 
troops in Saudi Arabia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleen Ashley, a longtime peace activist carrying a "Honk for Peace" sign, said 
one passing motorist spat on her and others made obscene gestures. "I got the 
one-finger peace sign several times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People say we're lousing up a happy day at the festival," said Patrick 
Forrest, 60, a Camarillo High School teacher. "But things may really get loused 
up on the 15th of January," he said, referring to the United Nations deadline 
for Hussein to withdraw troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
It was not all taunts and ridicule for the 60 peace marchers at the Ventura 
Holiday Festival, which caused closure of several downtown Main Street blocks. 
Some festival-goers applauded, others honked car horns or flashed the 
two-finger peace sign. One shouted, "Bring our boys home." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the protest, one of a growing number of peace demonstrations nationwide, 
was striking for its confrontations and signs of polarization, which also 
marked the Vietnam conflict. 
</P>
<P>
James McKinney, a 30-year-old machinist from Camarillo, confronted marcher Matt 
Egan, demanding an alternative to armed conflict in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"Should we appease Hussein like Britain and France appeased Hitler?" McKinney 
asked, leaning closer to Egan. "He's trying to build nuclear weapons, and your 
inactivity will lead to 1,000 times more deaths than in World War II." 
</P>
<P>
Egan, 17, a senior at Buena High School in Ventura, responded that he had no 
solution to the crisis. Later he said he is absolutely sure that access to 
Mideast oil is not worth jeopardizing his life or the lives of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"If some country invaded our soil, or someone was arbitrarily killing thousands 
of people, I'd fight," Egan said. "I can't see fighting for an oil monarchy." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the estimated 50,000 attending the festival took little notice of the 
protesters as they marched between vendors hawking pineapple pie a la mode and 
sirloin-on-a-stick and booths selling quilts, crystal ornaments and Christmas 
wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
Mandolin player Barry Kaufman, however, paid musical tribute to the passing 
demonstrators, segueing from a Christmas carol into Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the 
Wind," an anthem of the 1960s anti-war movement. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Murray, 46, had a personal reason for joining her first peace march. Her 
daughter, Joette, a 22-year-old Army sergeant, is encamped in the Saudi desert. 
</P>
<P>
"War seems very obsolete to me, something we should be beyond by now," said 
Murray, a barber who lives in Silver Strand. "The Arab countries are brothers, 
and we're being used to do a job for them. When we're gone, they'll probably 
give Hussein his seaport access anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Ginny Connell, who unsuccessfully challenged Assemblyman Tom McClintock 
(R-Thousand Oaks) in last month's election, said she joined marchers in support 
of a negotiated settlement. She said she is also concerned about the welfare of 
her son, who turns 18 in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to negotiate seriously, not just as a ploy to declare war a 
month from now," said Connell, 50, a former Catholic nun who is chairwoman of 
the Ventura County Democratic Party. "It doesn't take long to go from a 
volunteer Army to an involuntary draft." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Hopkins, 67, of Oxnard carried a sign declaring "No blood for oil. Use 
hemp." Hopkins said 6% of the nation's agricultural land could be used to grow 
hemp as an alternative fuel source. 
</P>
<P>
"A war in the Middle East will be a massive carnage and a sheer blood bath with 
all those thousands of troops already glaring at each other," said Hopkins, a 
member of Action Central America, one of the march organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Some protesters said they were surprised that they did not meet with greater 
scorn, given the oil interests and military presence in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
They did find strange bedfellows in members of the John Birch Society, an 
ultraconservative group that staunchly supported the Vietnam War. On Sunday, 
its members were distributing literature against a Middle East war and the 
spilling of American blood "to guarantee oil shipments for anyone, especially 
Japanese and Western Europeans, who are far more dependent on Middle East oil 
than Americans." The flyer supported increased offshore oil drilling and 
further development of nuclear energy. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the political spectrum, Green Party member Mindy Lorenz saw 
the underpinnings of a White House conspiracy pushing the United States toward 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"World opinion has been manipulated and we've been coercing support for a 
military confrontation," said Lorenz, who was a write-in candidate for Congress 
in the November election. "In a democracy, you don't have to line up behind a 
president if you don't believe in his policies."

COUNTY CRITICIZED OVER $16,000 COST OF MAUI SEMINAR; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: DESPITE A FUNDING PINCH, COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY SENDING SEVEN EMPLOYEES 
TO THE CONFERENCE WILL BE WORTH IT.

<P>
At a time when the Ventura County Health Care Agency is squeezed by a shortage 
of state dollars, seven top agency officials and physicians have scheduled a 
$16,000 trip to Maui in late January to attend a weeklong conference on 
improving hospital administration. 
</P>
<P>
The county officials said it is important that they attend the conference that 
is to offer advice from the nation's experts on problems such as those facing 
administrators who are reorganizing the Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Durand, the county's assistant health care director, said information 
from past seminars helped administrators turn around the medical center, which 
had accumulated more than $20 million in losses by 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We pick what we feel is the best national conference with the top national 
experts," Durand said. "We cannot allow ourselves to get stale. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But the expense of the trip to Maui has raised concerns among some county 
officials and a watchdog group for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were holding the conference in Pico Rivera and these people wanted to 
go, that would be fine," said Jere Robings, executive director of Ventura 
County Taxpayers Assn. "I don't think it looks good to the taxpayers for county 
staff to be taking trips to Maui." 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Maggie Erickson and Chief Administrative Officer Richard 
Wittenberg, who have decided to cancel their reservations for the conference, 
questioned the cost of the trip. They also worry about the public perception of 
using tax dollars to go to a tropical island in midwinter. 
</P>
<P>
"It frustrates me that it is in Maui because it raises such a question," said 
Erickson, a strong advocate of the Jan. 27-Feb. 1 conference held by the Estes 
Park Institute, a nonprofit organization that sponsors medical seminars. She 
decided not to go because the seminar would conflict with her wedding and 
honeymoon plans in late January. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is very expensive, unusually so, and that has bothered me," said 
Wittenberg, who also supports the conference. He said he wants to stay in 
Ventura County to be available to the county's two newly elected supervisors, 
Maria VanderKolk and Vicki Howard, when they assume office in January. 
</P>
<P>
Those scheduled to attend the conference are Phillipp K. Wessels, director of 
the county's Health Care Agency; Durand; Dr. Samuel Edwards, director of the 
county's medical center; Dr. Richard Ashby, the medical center's assistant 
director; Dr. Thomas McBreen, president of the county medical staff, and 
Patricia Rumpza, associate administrator for patient services. 
</P>
<P>
Jonette Duchai, another hospital administrator, has been named as the probable 
replacement for Ronald A. Pavellas, who left his job as hospital administrator 
after being scheduled to attend the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Tuition for the popular Estes Park conference costs $675 for each participant. 
The county has prepaid $1,066 per person for five nights at the Westin Maui, 
records show. With air fare and other expenses, county officials estimate that 
the conference will cost the county slightly more than $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
As members or staff of the Medical Center Oversight Committee, delegations of 
county officials have attended the Estes Park conferences in past years at 
Monterey, Calif., and Naples, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
But Erickson, chairwoman of the oversight committee, is having second thoughts 
about the Maui conference. She said the committee at its Dec. 7 meeting may 
decide to send a smaller delegation or attend another conference later in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are concerns on every front about spending money," Erickson said. "Given 
the situation we are facing now with tighter budgets, maybe only some of the 
oversight committee should be going." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbi Ryan, vice president of the Estes Park Institute of Englewood, Colo., 
said Ventura County administrators are among the few who attend from public 
hospitals. Nearly all of the participants are from private hospitals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Estes Park likes to hold conferences in attractive spots to garner interest, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
Wittenberg said information from the Estes Park conferences helps officials run 
the county medical center more like a private hospital, reducing taxpayer 
subsidies to levels far lower than in other counties. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Maui conference was selected because of its subject matter, not its 
location. The conference, entitled "9 Hospital Problems of the 1990s and What 
to Do About Them," has sessions ranging from financing health care for the poor 
to a patient's right to die. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the best things that our oversight committee can do," Erickson 
said. "If you look at what we have done with hospital finances and operating 
our clinics on an entrepreneurial basis to save money . . . it becomes worth 
it."

MAN DENIED PAROLE IN WIFE'S DEATH

<P>
A former Thousand Oaks resident convicted twice in the death of his wife has 
been denied parole by a Delaware parole board. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Hughes, 42, a former math teacher at Ascension Evangelical Lutheran 
School and a member of the Thousand Oaks church, was denied parole last week 
because he would not admit he killed his wife, Serita. 
</P>
<P>
"It did come up, and he continues to deny it," Parole Board Chairman Oliver W. 
Casson said. Casson said Hughes can reapply for parole in a year. 
</P>
<P>
After his wife's death in Delaware in 1976, Hughes moved to Thousand Oaks with 
his two sons, where he drew supporters who believed he was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Some church members still keep in touch with Hughes regarding his case, said 
Pastor Willis Moerer. Hughes taught eighth-grade mathematics at the Ascension 
Evangelical church school in 1977 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to a reduced 
charge of manslaughter in September, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
When he entered the plea, he had already served four years for two previous 
first-degree murder convictions in the strangulation of his wife. Both times, 
he was sentenced to life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
But both convictions were overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court -- once for 
prosecution misconduct and the second time because the jury may have been 
prejudiced. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes entered the guilty plea three weeks before he was to be tried a third 
time. He has consistently maintained his innocence, even after he pleaded 
guilty. PSYCHE PASCUAL

WARNING ISSUED ON CHIMNEY COVERS

<P>
Moorpark officials plan to send notices to homeowners warning them that their 
fireplaces might be unsafe to use. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Leigh, a building and safety official, said Friday the city will send 
flyers to homeowners in the coming weeks warning them not to use their 
fireplaces this winter if their chimney covers have not been checked or 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County fire officials said the covers or "shrouds" can force heat and 
soot back into the chimneys, drying their outer wood frames and making them 
flammable over time. 
</P>
<P>
Four house fires in Moorpark last winter were blamed on the decorative chimney 
covers that were installed by some developers of tract houses without the 
approval of chimney manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the fires in December and January in the Glenhaven, 
Marlborough and Pacifica tracts and the Peach Hill area. One fire caused 
$10,000 in damage, but the others were minor. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh said many of the houses in these four subdivisions have since had chimney 
covers inspected or replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Three house fires similar to the ones in Moorpark occurred in Camarillo in 1988 
and led to the replacement of chimney covers on about 300 houses there. CARLOS

<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors has given the city of Moorpark 
permission to hold a special election March 5 to fill a seat on the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The seat was left vacant when former Councilman Paul Lawrason was elected mayor 
in the Nov. 6 election. Lawrason had two years remaining on his council term. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted recently not to appoint an interim member to fill the fifth 
seat, saying it was better left to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The city is required to pay the cost of the special election, said Jane 
McCarthy, special elections coordinator for the county. City officials estimate 
the cost at about $15,000. CARLOS V. LOZANO

<P>
A plan to protect motorists on the Ventura Freeway from flying balls near a 
municipal golf course will be introduced at the Thousand Oaks City Council 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will consider paying $70,000 to install 1,500 feet of 
protective nylon nets around the Los Robles Golf Course on Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Director Robert S. Biery said netting up to 50-feet high may be needed 
where the risk to cars from wayward balls is greatest. 
</P>
<P>
The nets may reduce the number of claims filed by motorists whose vehicles have 
been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, 57 claims have been filed against the city by drivers whose cars 
and windows were smashed by golf balls. The city paid $14,870 to settle the 
claims, according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are concerned that increases in freeway traffic and golfers using the 
course could mean an increase in legal claims. PSYCHE PASCUAL

JASPER JOHNS' 'MAP' PLEDGED TO MOCA; 
</P>
<P>
ART: OWNER HOPES HER DECISION WILL INSPIRE OTHER COLLECTORS TO DONATE MAJOR 
WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Heralding the holiday season and looking forward to a new year when income tax 
laws will once again encourage donations of artworks to museums, the Los 
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art has announced a major addition to its 
collection. "Map," a seminal painting by Jasper Johns, is a gift of Marcia 
Weisman, a founding director of the museum and a long-time art collector. 
</P>
<P>
By donating the painting that is generally regarded as the most important piece 
in her collection, Marcia Weisman said she hoped to inspire others to give the 
best of their collections to museums that will use the art and share it with 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the motivations for giving this is to encourage people to go to MOCA 
and see this wonderful painting among all the other good things at the museum. 
You can't appreciate art unless you see the real thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Map" will go on view on Jan. 20 and again on April 7 in two exhibitions from 
the museum's permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Richard Koshalek said the gift of this "genuine masterpiece" is 
a "symbolic" act that bodes well for 1991, when donors will be able to deduct 
the full appreciated value of artworks donated to museums. The tax law change 
was enacted for one year only, but arts supporters are hoping to extend the 
provision, which was in effect until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Map," a trademark Johns done in 1962, depicts a map of the continental United 
States with the states' names in stenciled letters. Despite its mundane subject 
matter, the 60x93-inch work is a very "painterly" painting, awash in slashing 
brush strokes and drips of pigment. Executed in encaustic and collage on 
canvas, it is predominantly blue-gray with rich passages of reds and yellows. 
</P>
<P>
The work is typical of Johns' revolutionary use of familiar, flat objects, such 
as targets and flags, which challenged the Abstract Expressionists' emotional 
approach and ushered in the Pop age. "Map," in particular, combines 
Expressionistic painting with a new interest in popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
At MOCA, the painting provides a link between works by Jackson Pollock -- 
donated by the Taft and Rita Schreiber estate and by Philip and Beatrice Gersh 
-- and later works in the collection, Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman has been wooed by several museums, but she decided to give the Johns to 
MOCA "because everything goes to the East. The map is coast-to-coast and art 
should be that way too," she said, noting that her gift coincides with the 10th 
anniversary of Koshalek's tenure at MOCA. 
</P>
<P>
Her donation is a "partial gift," with an as yet undesignated percentage of 
ownership and possession going to the museum this year and additional portions 
ceded over time until the museum has sole ownership and possession. This 
legally binding practice has become increasingly popular in recent years as a 
means of allowing collectors to keep their donated works part of the time and 
to spread tax deductions over an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
The museum declined to put a dollar value on the gift, but major works by Johns 
-- whom many critics regard as America's most important living artist -- have 
routinely sold for more than $1 million at auction. Johns made front page news 
in 1988 when his painting "White Flag" was sold for $7 million one night at 
Christie's New York and another painting, "False Start," brought $17 million 
the following evening at Sotheby's. Art prices have subsequently fallen as 
speculators have withdrawn from the market, but Johns' work has suffered no 
loss of status in the art world.

NEW LAW TAKES AIM AT TV VIOLENCE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: LEGISLATION GIVES ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO NETWORKS TO DISCUSS THE 
ISSUE. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the day five years ago when Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) turned on a 
hotel television and saw a chain saw tearing through a torso, he has been on a 
personal crusade to reduce the level of violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm old enough to know it's not real, but it still bothered me that night," 
Simon recalls. "And then I wondered, what happens to a 10-year-old or 
12-year-old who watches this?" 
</P>
<P>
His crusade achieved an important victory Saturday when President Bush signed 
legislation paving the way for the television industry to set standards on 
violent programming. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, contained inside unrelated legislation, is an unusual measure. For 
one thing, it does not require TV programmers to take any action. Instead, it 
simply grants the networks and other broadcasters and cable operators immunity 
from federal antitrust prosecution should they decide to meet and discuss the 
issue of violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
But despite years of discussion, public hearings and research about the issue, 
no one is quite sure whether broadcasters will respond to Congress' 
not-so-subtle hint, or indeed, whether the law will have any effect at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a well-intentioned effort on Congress' part," said Martin Franks, a CBS 
vice president in Washington. "But this is a problem that is not easily 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
Public watchdog groups say that while the three major television networks have 
somewhat lowered the level of violence in prime time in recent years, 
television is still twice as violent now as it was only 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Sullivan of the National Coalition on Television Violence said that 
prime-time programming averaged 9 to 10 violent acts per hour in the 1989-90 
season, up from 4 to 5 violent acts in the 1980-81 season. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers differ over whether watching violence on television is harmful to 
viewers, either adults or children. Some studies have suggested that for 
viewers who are "vulnerable," watching violence on television may stimulate 
violent behavior or have other undesirable results. A task force of the 
American Psychological Assn. is drafting a report that concludes that "viewing 
violence on television is causally associated with increases in aggressive 
attitudes and aggressive values and behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The television networks and the American Civil Liberties Union insist, however, 
that the research is equivocal. 
</P>
<P>
Simon has no doubt. "There is no question about the harm. The evidence is just 
overwhelming. The question is what we do about it," he stressed last week in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The television industry has been uncertain about how to respond to Simon's 
legislation. Caught in a bind between serving the public interest and heeding 
competitive and First Amendment impulses, industry organizations have neither 
supported nor opposed his bill and largely have been noncommittal about what 
they would do once enacted. 
</P>
<P>
The Simon bill "is clearly offensive to the spirit of the First Amendment," 
Barry W. Lynn, legislative counsel for the ACLU, said in testimony before 
Congress this summer. "It would be terribly unwise, and harmful to the 
maintenance of an open society, to allow government to influence the content of 
speech based on theoretical speculation and ambiguous data." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons that some TV programmers, especially pay-cable networks and 
independent stations, oppose industry rules is that sexually explicit and 
violent material gives them a competitive advantage over the more conservative 
ABC, CBS and NBC. And the networks fear irritating television producers and 
filmmakers who complain when their work is "censored." "On the one hand, the 
creative community views us as overly stodgy. On the other hand, the public 
policy community sees us as overly permissive," complained CBS' Franks. 
</P>
<P>
If the industry fails to take advantage of the congressional exemption, Simon 
vows, he will call them into his office "and see if we can get the ball 
rolling."

DUNHAM HONORED AS PIONEER IN BAD OLD DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: THE 81-YEAR-OLD DANCER/CHOREOGRAPHER IS INDUCTED INTO THE IMAGE AWARDS 
HALL OF FAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From the 1983 Kennedy Center Honors presented by President Reagan to the 1989 
National Medal of Arts presented by President Bush, Katherine Dunham is no 
stranger to awards. France, Brazil, Haiti and UNESCO have paid homage to both 
her artistry as a dancer-choreographer and her influence as a pioneer artist of 
color -- and she even holds the Albert Schweitzer Award for her humanitarian 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the 81-year-old dance matriarch received another honor as the Beverly 
Hills/Hollywood NAACP Image Awards added her to its Hall of Fame in a program 
at the Wiltern Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview shortly after arriving in Los Angeles for the event, Dunham 
proved disarmingly self-deprecating about being selected. "I have been aware of 
the NAACP for many, many years," she said, "but I knew very little about them 
because we were traveling outside the country a good deal of the time. And 
since I've been back I just somehow lost track of them, but I think it's quite 
wonderful that they didn't lose track of me." 
</P>
<P>
Although she has been an anthropologist, writer, painter, teacher and also 
reached the highest level of initiation in the Haitian religion vodun, Dunham 
is best known as a star dancer and the leader of a phenomenally popular, 
self-subsidized company that toured internationally from the early '40s to the 
mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing in nightclubs, musical comedy, films and opera, as well as concert 
performances, the Dunham company gave unprecedented opportunities to 
African-American dancers and made non-black audiences aware of Caribbean 
culture (her specialty) in all its splendor. 
</P>
<P>
"Katherine Dunham was a pioneer, very truly," wrote Agnes de Mille in her 
recent book, "Portrait Gallery." "She had to train her company, as a good many 
others have. But she also had to take care of them, shield them, protect them, 
and in a real sense maintain them. She had no money, but she had to see that 
these people were housed and fed despite every possible prejudice and barrier. 
It amounts to a historic achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Dunham's choreography can be seen in vintage films (from "Carnival of 
Rhythm," in 1939 to "The Bible" in 1964) and in a lavish compilation, "The 
Magic of Katherine Dunham," mounted by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Dunham admires the Ailey company but admitted some concern about contemporary 
dancers mastering her style. "I understand the problems of rehearsal and what 
I'm so afraid of is that the dancers will become a little bit too mechanized," 
she explained. "Our work was very emotional, had a lot of feeling. I never 
depended so much on a variety of steps as upon absorbing the total complex of 
wherever the dance came from. And those things take more time. It's not just 
learning a routine." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the new generation of choreographers, Dunham said she had been 
"quite excited by Garth Fagan's work," like hers deeply influenced by Caribbean 
culture. And, she noted happily, "he thanks me." 
</P>

Dunham finds encouraging the growing solidarity between African-American 
choreographers but worries that our society as a whole is, in her words, "going 
backwards. If just a part of the money that is spent on trying to keep us in 
touch with oil could be spent on our population needs, then young people could 
see some hope -- that's what's troubling me." 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line we, Americans, have lost the capacity to sense and 
feel what's going wrong in our society and do something about it," she said. 
"The main thing we're lacking is compassion. American education doesn't help 
you know more about people and learn how to live as a humanitarian but how to 
fix it so that you can have more than your neighbor. That's a whole lot to 
undo." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Dunham divides her time between her home outside Port-au-Prince, 
Haiti, and East St. Louis, where she settled in the late '60s and created a 
performing arts training center. Indeed, her teaching and writing activities 
dominated her conversation as she looked back on six decades of prominence in 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
"East St. Louis has been so badly thought of for so many years but for me it's 
quite intriguing," she said. "The year before last there were two Olympic gold 
medalists who came from East St. Louis. So did our former U.N. ambassador. 
Josephine Baker, Tina Turner, Miles Davis -- the material is there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a city that's built on family life. In many ways the grandmothers run 
things. And I was able to teach people what I wanted: educating people for life 
-- especially people who hadn't been spoiled by some other form of education." 
</P>
<P>
Though no longer associated with Southern Illinois University, Dunham maintains 
a museum in East St. Louis and a program for children that she calls 
"socialization through the arts." She is currently finishing her fifth book, 
"The Minefields," and acknowledged some disappointment that she is not better 
known as an author. Ultimately, though, she decribed herself as "more of a 
catalyst than anything else, and once you discover that you were put on earth 
to do something, that makes it much easier." 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, I don't even have to wonder about what to do with my life," she 
said. "It's just supplied for me."

<P>
Much of the Midwest and Great Lakes region received an early jolt of wintry 
weather today, as snowfalls of up to 10 inches closed schools, toppled power 
lines and snarled travel. A blizzard warning was posted in parts of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
In hard-hit Iowa, Iowa State and Drake universities were among scores of 
schools and businesses that closed their doors or delayed opening today as high 
winds and heavy snows brought much of Iowa to a standstill. The Dubuque 
Regional Airport was closed, with snowdrifts of 2 to 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said that the storm was caused by an intense low-pressure system 
that was moving across central Illinois into northern Indiana this morning, and 
that the East would begin to feel its effects later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Ferry in Des Moines said the 
combination of snow and wind was the most severe in central Iowa in five years.

A wind-fanned fire gutted a single-family home in the Porter Ranch area this 
morning, then quickly spread on wind gusts to the roofs of two adjacent homes 
and nearby trees and brush, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire that spread to other homes was quickly knocked down by firefighters 
and water-dropping helicopter crews, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reported injuries in the fire that was reported at 11:15 a.m. at 
Tribune Street and Melvin Avenue, Wells said. The cause was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana winds in the 10-15-m.p.h. range carried embers to the nearby homes 
and brush, but firefighters contained the blaze in about 45 minutes, Wells 
said. About 50 firefighters and three helicopters battled the fire.

A Hindu leader in Bali says British rock star Mick Jagger's recent wedding to 
longtime girlfriend Jerry Hall is illegal and merely imitated parts of a

I Wayan Surpha, chairman of the Indonesian Hinduism Assn. in Bali's capital of

But Surpha objected, saying, "It should not be so easy to hold such a

BUSH PROCLAIMS 'NEW ERA OF HOPE' IN SOUTH AMERICA

<P>
President Bush today proclaimed "a new era of hope" in newly democratic South 
America as he opened a five-nation tour. He promptly blamed Iraq for making 
poor countries pay expensive oil bills. 
</P>
<P>
Bush arrived in Brasilia at dawn after an overnight flight from Washington, 
accompanied by a mostly junior staff. He was greeted by a 21-gun salute and 
military pageantry at the pillared Plantalto Palace, the workplace of President 
Fernando Collor de Mello. 
</P>
<P>
While celebrating the rebirth of democracy in South America, Bush put a strong 
emphasis on the Persian Gulf crisis and Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Czechoslovakia, where he visited last month, is paying $1.5 billion 
in additional fuel costs because of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's refusal to 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Collor, during a picture-taking session with Bush, said Brazil is paying $5 
billion more for oil. 
</P>
<P>
Bush responded, "That's why, (when) people say to me, 'Well, this can go on and 
on and on,' I say, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bush raised the gulf crisis again during a speech to the Brazilian Congress. "I 
realize the sacrifices that Saddam (Hussein's) brutality has caused this nation 
and its people, has caused many nations around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he will not abandon plans to stop Wednesday in Buenos Aires, where 
President Carlos Saul Menem declared a state of siege after the fourth military 
uprising in four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great confidence in the security there," Bush said.

The nation's first female president, Mary Robinson, was inaugurated today at 
Dublin Castle, and she extended a hand of friendship to both Protestants and 
Catholics in strife-ridden Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I will seek to encourage mutual understanding and tolerance between all the 
different communities sharing this island," Robinson said in her acceptance 
speech, delivered in English and Gaelic. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-gun salute echoed across the Irish capital as Robinson was sworn in by 
Chief Justice Thomas Finlay at the medieval, turreted castle after an 
interdenominational service. About 500 church and state dignitaries and 
Dublin-based foreign diplomats attended. 
</P>
<P>
The president, a 46-year-old feminist lawyer, campaigned for the largely 
ceremonial post on a liberal platform of change and a more involved presidency. 
She won the Nov. 9 election with 52.8% of the vote.

Government troops today surrounded bases and buildings seized before dawn by 
mutinous soldiers in an uprising two days before President Bush is scheduled to 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Saul Menem declared a state of siege, suspending 
constitutional guarantees and giving his government sweeping powers to ensure 
public order. His government demanded that the rebels surrender 
unconditionally. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in Brazil, indicated he had no plans to cancel his visit to Argentina, 
and the military said the situation is being brought under control. The rebels 
said they are not trying to overthrow the government but are trying to force 
changes in the way the military was run. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising, the fourth military revolt in Argentina in four years, began when 
insurgent soldiers seized part of the downtown army headquarters, several coast 
guard buildings nearby, a tank factory 16 miles to the northwest and infantry 
base five miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Loyal troops tried to retake the installations, but by afternoon the rebels 
were still holed up in the buildings they seized. The army said at least three 
loyal soldiers were killed and 14 wounded in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off major roads in Buenos Aires, a city of 10 million people. 
Federal police banned public gatherings and the Economy Ministry declared a 
bank holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The army said a total of 200 rebel soldiers were involved, but rebels claimed 
700 followers at several bases, including a tank battalion in Entre Rios 
Province, north of Buenos Aires Province. 
</P>
<P>
The private news agency Noticias Argentinas said government troops were mining 
the exits from the tank factory to prevent the rebels from driving tanks out. 
It also said the government troops dynamited a bridge and blocked a tunnel that 
cross the Parana River north of the capital to prevent a column of rebel tanks 
and armored vehicles from leaving Entre Rios province.

An Israeli military court sentenced 12 Arab guerrillas to 30 years in prison 
today for a foiled seaborne raid in May that prompted Washington to sever

Israel killed four Palestinians and captured 12 in the attempted speedboat raid 
on beaches near Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Front faction led by Abu Abbas was behind the assault, 
which the Israeli army said was launched from Libya. It prompted the United 
States to break off its 18-month dialogue with the parent PLO, which had 
resumed after Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism in December, 1988.

NEW MADRID, Mo.

<TEXT>
<P>
High noon came and went today and the people of New Madrid issued a collective 
sigh of relief. The great earthquake scare of 1990 seemed to be over. 
</P>
<P>
Noon marked the midpoint in a disputed but disruptive prediction of a major 
earthquake in the central United States along the 120-mile fault line named for 
New Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
New Madrid Mayor Dick Phillips, engulfed by a sea of cameras, lights and sound 
booms, summed it up: "After noon it's history. I think after today people will 
rest easier." 
</P>
<P>
The man in the Tom's Barbecue truck from St. Louis who had been selling 
sandwiches packed up and headed out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the invading swarm of news media people had apparently decided as well 
that the story wasn't worth another 48 hours of waiting. 
</P>
<P>
The prediction by Iben Browning, a climatologist from New Mexico, called for a 
quake of 7.0 magnitude 48 hours either side of today. Some schools were closed 
in parts of five states, police and fire departments were on standby and 
disaster plans had been drawn up from Arkansas north to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
For New Madrid, the center of attention because of geography and name, each 
hour that passed uneventfully spelled relief from a relentless media 
microscope. Some of the hundreds of press and broadcast representatives and 
scores of satellite dish-equipped TV trucks were already making plans to 
depart. 
</P>
<P>
While most residents were hospitable to the intruders, some were showing the 
strain of being interviewed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't walk down the street to pick something up at the store without 
having someone stick a microphone in your face and asking you a lot of 
questions that you just answered 10 feet earlier," said Dianne Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
One man sitting on a curb was selling interviews for $5 a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting a little tiresome," said the mayor.

Trouble with the $150-million Astro observatory today delayed Columbia 
astronauts' scientific research, and as the hours ticked by scientists on the 
ground said some planned observations would not be made. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a definite loss as we go," said mission scientist Ted Gull. "Some 
objects are just going to slip off the list." 
</P>
<P>
Despite hours of efforts that stretched into early afternoon, NASA officials 
had trouble calibrating the observatory's instrument pointing system, which 
affects all three ultraviolet telescopes. A problem involving a computer that 
controls the movements of one telescope, however, was solved. 
</P>
<P>
Mission manager Jack Jones said another star tracker on board, attached to one 
of the telescopes, will be used to point the telescopes if the main pointing 
system continues to malfunction. The instrument is more awkward to operate, 
however, since it is designed for another purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"Whichever one of these we demonstrate can work first, our plan is to 
immediately go into that mode of operation and start gathering science," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Astro had been expected to look at about 250 high-energy objects, including 
stars, quasars, galaxies, Jupiter, a supernova and Comet Levy. 
</P>
<P>
The ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from these objects cannot be seen by 
ground-based instruments because they are unable to penetrate the Earth's 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Because at least half a day of work has now been lost, that number will be 
trimmed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we're disappointed, but we knew this was a crucial step and might go 
slower than we planned," said Arthur Code, a University of Wisconsin scientist 
who helped design one of the telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia blasted into orbit early Sunday on a mission that was originally 
scheduled to fly in 1986 but was postponed by the Challenger explosion. 
Hydrogen leaks forced three launch delays earlier this year, and a telescope 
problem halted a fourth countdown.

Disgraced East German leader Erich Honecker, facing arrest on manslaughter 
charges, was moved to a Soviet military hospital heart clinic today because of 
high blood pressure, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin's Justice Department issued a warrant Saturday for the 78-year-old 
ex-Communist Party chief, who has been living on the grounds of the hospital in 
Beelitz, south of Berlin, with his wife since April. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said it has evidence that Honecker gave a shoot-to-kill 
order leading to the deaths of 190 on the Berlin Wall and East-West German 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet spokesman Igor Molotkin, speaking to reporters outside the gates of the 
Beelitz hospital, could not say how long Honecker will be in the heart clinic. 
</P>
<P>
German police can arrest Honecker only with the agreement of the Soviet 
military authorities.

The Finance Ministry has decided to allow foreign investors to purchase stock 
in Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. and will release 500,000 to 1 million 
shares annually over a 5- to 10-year period starting in fiscal 1991, Kyodo News 
Service reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has sold 5.4 million of a total of 15.6 million NTT shares 
over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Existing law requires the government to hold one-third -- or 5.2 million shares 
-- in NTT, the world's largest telecommunications company. Foreign investors 
now are barred from acquiring NTT shares. The government plans to revise the 
law soon, Kyodo said.

<P>
The final round of the most ambitious free trade talks ever attempted opened on 
a pessimistic note today, bogged down by a transatlantic dispute over farm 
subsidies and heckled in the streets by farmers worried about falling income. 
</P>
<P>
Paramilitary police fired tear gas and used water cannon to control about 
30,000 mainly European farmers who tore out trees and traffic signs and burned 
tires to protest the GATT talks. 
</P>
<P>
Their anger was aimed at proposals to cut agricultural subsidies -- the focus 
of a dispute between the European Community and the United States and its 
allies that is delaying adoption of a major plan to free commerce for the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the world trade body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
told ministers that they had spent four years negotiating the 107-nation 
so-called Uruguay Round of trade talks and had only one week to achieve 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"This leaves us with no option but to negotiate, negotiate and negotiate and 
waste no time in political shadow boxing or mutual recrimination," GATT 
Director General Arthur Dunkel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fate of the round hangs in the balance," U.S. Trade Representative Carla 
Anderson Hills said. "This is the final -- I repeat -- the final week of the 
Uruguay Round. There will be no extension. The time for rhetoric has passed." 
</P>
<P>
Hills warned of a new slide toward protectionism and political instability if 
the talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the 14-nation Cairns Group of farm exporters want 75% to 
90% cuts on subsidies and import barriers on agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
The EC has offered to cut internal support by 30% from 1986 levels but refuses 
to commit itself to explicit cuts in export subsidies or to better access to 
its market, saying these would flow from its offer. 
</P>
<P>
Other issues in the talks -- ending textile quotas, strengthening laws against 
piracy of patents and copyrights, and writing rules for trade in services -- 
have been held up by the impasse on farm supports. 
</P>
<P>
EC ministers discussed the farm issue Sunday night before the talks opened, but 
did not appear to give EC Farm Commissioner Ray MacSharry any more room to 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"The only flexibility I have is to explain in detail the impact which 
reductions in internal support will have on export subsidies and market 
access," MacSharry said as he entered the opening of the Uruguay Round meeting. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Undersecretary for Agriculture Richard Crowder said: "We understand their 
position. We don't need it explained. We need some movement."

NCR STOCK UP BUT DIRECTORS HIT AT&amp;T OFFER

<P>
NCR Corp. stock skyrocketed today, gaining more than $25 a share on news of a 
$6-billion takeover offer by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., but NCR's 
directors called the stock-swap bid, valued at $90 a share, "grossly 
inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts viewed AT&amp;T's proposed merger with NCR, the nation's fifth-largest 
computer company, as a last-ditch effort to salvage AT&amp;T's ailing computer 
business. 
</P>
<P>
An NCR spokesman said today that the company's financial advisers "regard the 
latest AT&amp;T offer to be grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Charles Exley Jr. said NCR's board will review the offer and "advise 
its shareholders accordingly."

State casino investigators today expressed concern about the financial 
stability of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Resort but said it is too early to 
accurately predict the gambling hall's fate. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement before the state Casino Control Commission, Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Thomas Auriemma said the Taj Mahal's slot machine performance continues to lag 
and that a debt restructuring agreement reached with bondholders on Nov. 16 
fails to reduce the gambling hall's $675-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
"The Taj Mahal is not reducing its overall debt," Auriemma said. 
</P>
<P>
Auriemma and Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis agreed that the commission can 
examine the restructuring agreement although its exact terms have yet to be 
finalized. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke as the casino commission began a hearing to examine the financial 
stability of the Taj, which opened last spring and is undergoing restructuring 
that will temporarily throw it into bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
If they conclude that the casino is financially unstable, the commission 
members could lift its license and appoint a conservator to operate it. 
</P>
<P>
Trump himself was not at the hearing this morning. It is expected to last at 
least two days. The flamboyant developer, author of the best seller "The Art of 
the Deal," has battled financial and marital problems for most of the year.

UMPIRE TALKS, EXPANSION FEES ARE '91 ISSUES: VINCENT

Commissioner Fay Vincent today listed negotiations with the umpires and 
expansion fees allocation as baseball's toughest problems heading into 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent was unable to attend the winter meetings because of a respiratory 
illness, but a text of his speech was made available. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with the umpires expired after the season and talks will start 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
"These negotiations are right around the corner and the potential for another 
dispute is very real," Vincent said. "I have been working with our league 
presidents -- Bill White and Dr. Bobby Brown -- who will be conducting these 
negotiations, and will continue to follow this process in our effort to reach 
an equitable and sound agreement for the leagues as well as the umpires." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said there could be a problem in dealing with the allocation of 
expansion fees. The National League is scheduled to expand by two teams in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, expansion fees have been paid directly to the expanding league, 
and then divided equally among the teams of that league. Also, in the past 
expansion endeavors, only those teams in the expanding league shared the burden 
of supplying players for the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
"In the current expansion process, the American League has requested that it 
receive a share of the expansion fund and, in return will make its players 
available in the expansion draft." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said he has asked that each league form a committee to discuss the 
proposal.

NBA FINES 11 PLAYERS FOR FIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The NBA issued a new round of fighting fines today -- including one of $4,000 
to Harvey Grant of the Washington Bullets -- bringing the league total in the 
past four days to 19 players penalized for a total of $21,750. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven players -- eight from a Washington-Detroit game Saturday in Landover, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
-- today were fined a total of $15,000 for fighting. On Friday, the NBA fined 
eight players from the Pistons and Atlanta Hawks a total of $6,750 for a fight 
that occurred last Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Grant received the biggest fine for starting a fight with Joe Dumars of the 
Pistons. Dumars got a $1,000 fine for retaliating, and six others were fined 
for coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster of Washington got $2,000, Darrell Walker of Washington $1,500 and 
Dennis Rodman of the Pistons $1,000. Fined $500 were Mark Aguirre, William 
Bedford and James Edwards, all of Detroit, which lost 94-83. 
</P>
<P>
The other fight, also Saturday night, occurred in East Rutherford, N.J., near 
the end of the third quarter between Derrick Coleman of the Nets and Mark Acres 
of the Orlando Magic. Coleman was fined $1,000, Acres $500, and Jack Haley of 
the Nets got $2,500 for coming off the bench after Acres.

MAJOR LEAGUES, MINORS NEAR PACT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: EXPECTED RATIFICATION OF CONTRACT WOULD HEAD OFF A MASSIVE 
RESTRUCTURING OF MINOR LEAGUES WHERE PROFITS AND SUBSIDIES HAVE BEEN AT ISSUE.

<P>
A contract between baseball's major leagues and the National Assn. is expected 
to be ratified within 10 days, avoiding a massive restructuring of the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for the major league owners outlined their latest contract offer at 
the winter meetings on Sunday and said only some language needed to be ironed 
out. They said an agreement had been reached on all the major points of the 
contract and knew of no area where key differences remained. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to reach an agreement by Dec. 15 would have resulted in a total 
restructuring of the current minor league system. The major leagues had planned 
to move most of their minor league operations to the site of their spring 
training complexes in Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, major league owners argued they are paying too much to subsidize 
minor league clubs, which they have contested are making huge profits. 
</P>
<P>
However, under the new agreement the major league clubs will actually spend 
more on their minor league operations -- a minimum of $50,000 a year -- but in 
exchange gain more control. The clubs estimate they spend about $6.5 million a 
season on the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to take a look at the old system we had and tried to simplify it," 
said Bill Murray, the owners' chief negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed contract, in 1991 and 1992 the minor league clubs will pay 
travel and hotel expenses for 28 Triple-AAA players and 27 Double-A. In 1993 
and 1994, minor league clubs will pay travel and hotel costs for 30 players at 
all levels. 
</P>
<P>
The major league clubs have agreed to pay all minor league player contracts, 
meal money, equipment, umpires (including salary increases), statistical 
services and inspection of minor league contracts. The meal money will be 
increased by $4 a day in the first year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to offset the major league clubs' expenses, the minors have agreed 
to revenue sharing. The formula would be about 5% of the net profit by the 
minor league teams.

<P>
UNLV, which got the news it wanted last week when the Runnin' Rebels learned 
they could defend their national championship, remained the No. 1 team in the 
college basketball poll today. 
</P>
<P>
The Runnin' Rebels, who opened their season Saturday night with a 109-68 
victory over Alabama-Birmingham just two days after learning the NCAA shifted 
their probation from this year's tournament to next season, received 45 
first-place votes and 1,579 points from the nationwide panel of sportswriters 
and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (6-0), the only other school to receive first-place votes, and Arkansas 
(5-1) held second and third, while Syracuse (4-0) and Duke (5-1) each jumped 
three places to fourth and fifth, respectively. UCLA moved up from 12th to 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Three teams joined the Top 25 this week -- No. 21 South Carolina, No. 24 Temple 
and No. 25 Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, which was No. 1 on 19 ballots, had 1,555 points, while Arkansas, which 
lost to the Wildcats in the preseason NIT championship game, had 1,435. 
Syracuse had 1,312, 80 more than the Blue Devils, whose only loss was to 
Arkansas in the NIT semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (3-0) and Indiana (4-1) each jumped three places to sixth and 
seventh, respectively, while UCLA, Ohio State and North Carolina rounded out 
the Top Ten. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (4-0), which has set the school's single-game scoring record twice this 
season -- most recently last night in a 149-98 win over Loyola Marymount -- had 
1,097 points.

Gerry DiNardo, offensive coordinator at Colorado, was named Vanderbilt 
University's new football coach today, and Pete Cordelli Jr., offensive 
coordinator for Notre Dame, was named head coach at Kent State University. 
</P>
<P>
DiNardo, who developed Colorado's I-bone offensive scheme, replaces Watson 
Brown, who was reassigned to a fund-raising post with the school's Alumni and 
Development Office. 
</P>
<P>
DiNardo said he signed a five-year contract Sunday night. Terms were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
As a collegiate player, DiNardo earned All-America honors in 1974 as an 
offensive guard at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Commodore players signed a letter Sunday denouncing Brown's dismissal and 
urging that offensive coordinator Steve Sloan be promoted to the head spot. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt ended its 1-10 season Saturday by losing 49-20 to Sugar Bowl-bound 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Brown had a 10-45 overall record in his five years at Vandy, where he was a 
quarterback from 1968 to '72. 
</P>
<P>
Cordelli replaced the fired Dick Crum at Kent State. 
</P>
<P>
A Notre Dame assistant coach since 1986, Cordelli, 37, has coached in seven 
bowl games, including Notre Dame's national championship title in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Crum was fired Nov. 14 after compiling a three-year record of 7-27 with the 
Golden Flashes. 
</P>
<P>
In another coaching move, Larry Blakeney, an assistant football coach at Auburn 
for 14 years, today was named head coach at Troy State University at Troy, 
Ala., which is moving up to Division I-AA.

Nearly 3,000 people packed a concert hall and hundreds stood outside in 
freezing weather Saturday for a Tchaikovsky anniversary concert featuring 
American violinist Itzhak Perlman, cellist Yo Yo Ma and soprano Jessye Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Loudspeakers projected the 1812 Overture and other works by the Russian 
composer onto Leningrad's snow-covered Artists Square on the 150th anniversary 
of his birth. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, my dear, I am so tired of living in this mess -- all these 
congresses, demonstrations, decrees and rationing. Here, for an hour or so, you 
can forget about all that," said 89-year-old Anna Smolina, who stood outside in 
minus-14 degree temperatures to hear the two-hour concert. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's original score for the 1812 
Overture, church bells rang and 16 cannon from South Bend, Ind., boomed. 
</P>
<P>
The concert was broadcast on television across the Soviet Union and to an 
estimated audience of 25 million people in more than two dozen other countries. 
It is scheduled to be shown later this year in the United States on PBS, 
according to Kim Smedvig, an assistant to the concert's organizer. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began with the orchestra playing Tchaikovsky's Polonaise. Perlman 
then played the Serenade for Strings, followed by the Waltz-Scherzo. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet pianist Boris Berezovsky, winner of the 1990 Tchaikovsky Piano

LIZ SMITH: OF LIZ TAYLOR AND GOATS, LAWSUITS, BEAUS, FORBES, AIDS

IT IS my theory, which usually works out to be true, that Elizabeth Taylor 
invariably makes big news during the holiday season -- announces an engagement 
or divorce, breaks an engagement, enters a clinic, has an accident. And this 
year is no exception. Today on your newsstands you will find a beaming, healthy 
Elizabeth on the front of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who is in the midst of one of her by-now near mythic recoveries, gives 
reporter Landon Y. Jones an intimate and candid interview. She speaks of her 
nearly fatal bout with pneumonia of course, brushes aside ex-beau Henry 
Wynberg's lawsuit with a wrinkle of that classic nose and tells of current 
boyfriend Larry Fortensky's present to her during the early days of her 
hospitalization -- a live baby miniature goat. Of the obvious difference in her 
and Larry's financial status (he still works on construction sites in L.A.) 
Taylor says, "No boy is poor if he's rich at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Her suit against the National Enquirer is full steam ahead. She says that the 
Enquirer's claim that she was drinking in the hospital resulted in thousands of 
letters saying, "We've looked up to you. How could you?" 
</P>
<P>
"I felt betrayed, and I felt I was betraying others," Elizabeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the late Malcolm Forbes, Elizabeth declares, "I loved him. He loved me. He 
knew how to give joy, and he loved to share. He was the least stingy soul I 
ever met." When reporter Landon broaches the subject of Forbes' sexuality, 
Taylor flares, "It's nobody's business what Malcolm's sexual preferences were. 
It's nobody's concern. I respected him, which means I respected his choices, 
all the way around. We knew each other very well." 
</P>
<P>
And Elizabeth's work for AIDS, which began in 1984, is ongoing and her 
determination to raise funds and consciousness is stronger than ever: "It was 
my anger that involved me with AIDS, and it still is. Nobody asks for this 
disease. Nobody deserves it. We are all as innocent as babies in the eyes of 
God." Elizabeth Taylor sails into the first year of the new decade with renewed 
vigor.

COURT WON'T TOSS OUT SUIT OVER COLLEGE BARRING PLAY

<P>
The Supreme Court refused today to kill a lawsuit against a California 
community college's officials accused of unlawful censorship for blocking the 
on-campus performance of a racially charged play. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment today, rejected an appeal by the college officials. 
</P>
<P>
The case raised the question of whether college administrators have the same 
broad power as public high school officials to limit freedom of speech in 
school-sponsored activities. 
</P>
<P>
The California dispute began in June, 1986, when Alan DiBona, a drama teacher 
at San Diego Community College, planned a class production of "Split Second." 
</P>
<P>
The play, written by Dennis McIntyre, is about a black New York City police 
officer who fatally shoots a white suspect after the suspect has taunted him 
with racial slurs and epithets. The officer, following his split-second loss of 
control, places a knife in the victim's hand to make the shooting look like 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
DiBona planned to have the play performed at the Educational Cultural Complex, 
a branch of the San Diego college. Students auditioning for parts in the play 
were to receive course credit. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Matthews, president of the branch college, and James Hardison, dean of 
arts and sciences there, opposed the performance. 
</P>
<P>
They said community church leaders who learned about the planned performance 
were upset. The college officials also expressed concern over profane language 
used in the play, saying it could inflame racial tensions already sparked by a 
local murder case in which a young black man was accused of shooting two police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Hardison told DiBona to choose a play that was more uplifting. He suggested 
"The Wiz," an adaptation of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" with an all-black 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
When DiBona refused, the college canceled his class. 
</P>
<P>
He and his students performed "Split Second" off campus. None of the students 
received course credit for the performance, and DiBona was not paid by the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
DiBona and a student, Scott Gundlach, sued Matthews and Hardison for allegedly 
violating their free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
A judge threw out the suit. But it was reinstated in July by a state appeals 
court, which ordered a trial. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said, "A central premise of the constitutional guarantee of 
free speech is that difficult and sensitive political issues generally benefit 
from constructive dialogue of the sort which might have been generated by 
'Split Second.' " 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court also drew a distinction between the censorship powers of 
college administrators and high school officials. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court noted that the Supreme Court in 1988 upheld the power of a 
high school principal to remove two controversial articles from a student 
newspaper. But college students are adults, the appeals court said, adding, 
"Where children are concerned, the legitimate role of the government in 
regulating speech is substantially broader."

JAY THOMAS SAVORS HIS VARIETY

<P>
"Guest star to the world" is how Jay Thomas, the abrasive tabloid-TV host Jerry 
Gold on "Murphy Brown," describes his career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like I have this fit for three hours every morning -- and then go 
to work," Thomas said in the Dec. 8 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles radio listeners know Thomas as "The Morning Zoo" host on radio 
station KPWR-FM. On his weekday "nothing is sacred" show, he trashes 
everything, including his Emmy nomination for "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Then it's off to the set of his current show -- "Married People" -- as Russell 
Meyers, a yuppie writer and househusband. Thomas also plays hockey goalie Eddie 
LeBec on "Cheers" and was deli owner Remo DaVinci on "Mork &amp; Mindy."

REAL MOTHER JOLTS ED BEGLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Begley Jr., the father in television's "Parenthood," says when he applied 
for his driver's license at 16 he learned who his real mother was from his 
birth certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Begley, 41, said in the Dec. 8 issue of TV Guide that it took him some time to 
adjust to the fact his father's first wife was not his mother, as he had 
assumed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty strange when you think one woman is your mother and you find out 
it's another woman," he said. "That lady who used to bring you Lincoln Logs? 
Yeah, I remember her. Well, for good reason, son. That's your mom." 
</P>
<P>
Begley said he gets along great with his mother, whom he knew as a family 
friend during his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the woman was not revealed.
