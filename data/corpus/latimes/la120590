The Bush Administration stepped up its campaign to give all parents the right 
to choose the schools their children will attend. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos announced the opening of the Center for 
Choice in Education, a resource center in Washington that will dispense 
information on the effort to force public schools to compete for students. 
Eleven states have adopted academic choice programs. "When schools compete for 
students, the quality of instruction improves and the diversity of programs 
offered increases," Cavazos said. Critics contend that such programs can foster 
racial and economic segregation.

Residents in the Midwest were digging out after a deadly blizzard that dumped 
up to two feet of snow. The snowstorm caused at least nine deaths in Wisconsin, 
six in Iowa, one in western Pennsylvania and four in Indiana. At least four 
inches of snow and 25-m.p.h. winds hampered driving in north-central Indiana.

U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, in Miami, ruled that transcripts of 
prison-taped conversations between Manuel A. Noriega and his lawyers, which led 
to a showdown in court between the defense attorneys and Cable News Network, 
are public property. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler's decision answered other news organizations' demands for access to 
the transcripts. The Miami Herald, Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station 
WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today had claimed that the public 
has a right to the facts behind a case that tested 1st Amendment protection 
against restraint of the press. CNN lawyer Terry Bienstock said the network had 
not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling.

I take exception to Keith's remarks "that the average federal pensioner is 
getting double dips and triple scoops, all of them with COLAs like me." 
</P>
<P>
Very few are getting Social Security. Social Service retirees receive COLAs. 
Why not federal retirees? 
</P>
<P>
I do not believe, however, that all individuals should be eligible for Social 
Security benefits; if they have an income over a certain amount, they should 
not receive Social Security.

Mr. Keith, if you believe that through your double or triple dipping you are 
overpaid, you are probably right and have the privilege of refusing one of your 
pensions or returning it to the proper authorities. On the other hand, you have 
the right to use the surplus to help the homeless or any other unfortunates. 
</P>
<P>
However, I beg you to cease this effort to stop COLA increases since you 
obviously do not know what you are doing. 
</P>
<P>
I worked very hard to earn a government pension. I certainly earned much more 
than the $21,850 salary you mention, and my pension is less than half that 
amount with COLAs. What's more, my Social Security pension is cut in proportion 
to the amount of government pension I receive with the result that my Social 
Security check is chicken feed. In fact, it would not support a chickadee. 
</P>
<P>
By combining my pensions with those of my husband, including COLAs, we are 
barely able to keep our heads above water and keep bread sans butter on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
I have been retired only four years and already I have had to dip into savings 
for such things as car and home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Without COLAs, we would lose all hope of surviving and soon join the homeless.

<P>
The commentary of Keith unfortunately ignores the facts of the federal 
retirement system and basic economics. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming a federal employee made $40,000 per year, his yearly contribution (7%) 
to the retirement system would be $2,800, which is matched by the federal 
government for a total of $5,600. 
</P>
<P>
After 30 years and at age 55, approximately $327,000 would have accumulated 
(assuming a conservative 4% yearly return on these contributions). That person 
would be entitled to a pension of 56.25% or $22,500. Again, assuming that those 
funds would continue to earn 4% interest, it would take 22 years before the 
$327,000 would be exhausted. At that point the retiree would be 77, which is 
approximately the average life expectancy today. 
</P>
<P>
The average government worker does not receive an overly generous pension 
including the COLA provisions. However, those elected officials, like Keith, 
who receive inflated salaries and pensions that in many cases they have voted 
for while in office, are the true individuals receiving gross federal benefits 
and something needs to be done to rectify that situation.

EXCLUSION OF BLACK AUTHORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mathabane takes to task the Encyclopedia Britannica for not including black 
authors among its "Great Books of the Western World." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for this is straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
Black writers have written predominantly about the experience of being black. 
That puts them in a category with Philip Roth and Leon Uris, who have written 
about the experience of being Jewish, and Betty Friedan who has written about 
the experience of being a woman. Roth, Uris and Friedan are also not in the 
"Great Books." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, these are very good writers and authors. But a key criterion for 
admission to the "Great Books" series is "universality." And that means 
something more than an author writing about his or her own community, however 
adroitly. 
</P>
<P>
At its base, then, Mathabane is simply one more voice calling for quotas, 
race-based preference and the like.

MUST YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE?; 
</P>
<P>
A DRIVER DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BOMBED TO BECOME A PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Witnesses near a San Diego Freeway exit in Orange County Monday must have 
thought they were watching a stunt on a studio lot. A car flew off the exit 
ramp, flipped through the air and crash-landed in a restaurant parking lot. The 
driver was charged with drunk driving and trying to elude a motorcycle officer, 
but fortunately he was not hurt. And the driver suffered only minor injuries -- 
if major embarrassment and arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Things do not always turn out so fortunately. In a state where the automobile 
is a way of life, where so many depend for their safety on the judgment of 
others who happen to share the road at any moment, it makes sense to have some 
of the toughest anti-drunk-driving restrictions in the country. 
</P>
<P>
This year, California joined Maine, Utah and Oregon by adopting a stricter 
blood-alcohol standard. That reduction of the level from .10 to .08 appears to 
be doing some of what it was intended to do, increasing significantly the 
number of arrests and convictions for drunk driving. Statewide, arrests are up 
16% and convictions are up 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Any drunk-driving law is most effective in the deterrent stage, and that's 
harder to quantify. But by reducing the legal limit by what amounts to one 
drink per hour, California has given the social drinker food for thought, which 
is not a bad companion for one's holiday glass of cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The new limit itself was a political compromise; it's actually .03 higher than 
the .05 level at which the American Medical Assn. says the average person's 
motor, hand-eye coordination and depth perception skills begin to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
That means a driver doesn't have to be bombed to become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
And since July, 105,000 drivers statewide have had their licenses pulled under 
the new prompt suspension law, a tough penalty indeed for Southern California, 
which lacks an advanced mass transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
The holidays are a good time to affirm sense about drinking and driving. The 
state's tough penalties are an incentive for that.

THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT -- STILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drawing the line between the right of society to protect itself from crime and 
the right of those accused of crime to defend themselves from the accusations 
of the state has never been an easy task and it's not going to get any easier. 
The police are increasingly overwhelmed by crime, court dockets clogged with 
cases. The role of the court in reviewing criminal convictions must be neither 
to nit-pick the police to death nor chisel away at the constitutional rights of 
citizens. The job is made even harder when in the particular case under review 
the alleged crimes are truly heinous and the police have worked hard to crack 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Minnick vs. Mississippi, which was decided Monday by a 6-2 
U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of a defendant who escaped from jail and 
then allegedly shot two men. The Mississippi Supreme Court had ruled that 
police acted properly when they resumed questioning after permitting the 
defendant, as required by Miranda vs. Arizona (1966), to consult with counsel. 
But the high court has now said that police can't question a suspect without an 
attorney present when one has been requested. 
</P>
<P>
Although in effect an affirmation of Edwards vs. Arizona (1981), the ruling was 
unexpected, because the Supreme Court in recent years has appeared to reflect 
in some rulings the view in some circles that Miranda is an impediment to good 
law enforcement and the war on crime. The truth is that Miranda has proven not 
an impediment but an enhancement: It provides police with clear and reasonable 
guidelines for their interrogations. Nothing galls the cops more than to have 
all their hard work thrown out on a technical error that could have been 
avoided had the ground rules been laid out for them clearly. 
</P>
<P>
The procedures of Miranda in fact were taken from pre-existing FBI 
interrogation guidelines; now they are used by state and local law enforcement 
throughout the nation. Miranda simply underscores the notion that in the United 
States the accused has a vested right to silence unless choosing to speak out 
in the "unfettered exercise of his own will." That's a standard all good cops 
can live with. It's a standard a free society cannot live without.

High above the corner of Western and 6th avenues, above the drunks in the 
parking lot, the seedy display of magazines on the newsstand, the Westmor 
Ballroom stirs in the early morning. It takes up the top floor of what must, in 
1928, have been the latest in French Chateau Chic. It is still a long, 
beautiful room -- a faded room of a certain age. 
</P>
<P>
Noise and light are filtered through heavy, opaque windows. Sugar-pink walls 
are covered in mirrors, reflecting for the moment airiness and emptiness above 
the springy wooden floor. There is a bandstand framed in painted garlands; 
imagine, if you will, the musicians who once played here. Men and women have 
danced in this room for years; something must linger of their spirit, invisible 
magic of their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, figures drift before the mirrors. Bernard from Hawaii in high heels and 
tight trousers teaching a man in heavy rubber-soled shoes, his wife in long, 
baggy cardigan. Shyly, timidly, they step through their first waltz for some 
family party. Bodies held stiffly, heads ducked, the complicity of their 
awkwardness touches Bernard, who is gentle with them, his young sinuous energy 
held in check. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn and Mara, the Danish champions, are visiting for a day or two to work 
with eager couples. They swoop through tangoes, glide through foxtrots, in 
quest of the unbelievable elegance of the dance, the tiniest movement of an 
ankle, the exact position of a head. This is not some stardust ballroom with 
elderly women shuffling past their memories. Dance at Westmor is a sport, an 
art, a passion. 
</P>
<P>
One couple stand out, their images gliding from mirror to mirror. He is very 
tall, fair, long-haired, long-legged, skimming the huge floor in patent dance 
pumps beneath stylish black pants. His partner's long, thin, perfect hand rests 
on air, almost as if it would break were she to strain more. Each time her head 
turns, there is a flurry of deep red curls, bright eyes in vivid makeup -- a 
shining about her. Perhaps the fox-trot queen from Oregon practicing nearby has 
a more imperious carriage. Perhaps the young, much-praised dancer working with 
the visiting Danes has a more precise foot placement. Neither dances with the 
simple delight of this slender, almost theatrical figure, turning and turning 
in the mirrors to the sound of bygone tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and again, the couple stop and confer earnestly about some detail or 
other with their teacher, Ricky, an older, wiser, colorless man who has seen 
glamour come and go. Then it is possible to see the unexpectedness of it all. 
Stig, a man in his 20s, Danish, a championship dancer once in Europe. His wife, 
Joanie, in her 50s perhaps, fluid and graceful, leopard-print jump-suit, high 
dancing pumps, golden jewelry gleaming like Christmas decorations. This is her 
second marriage. The day after her first husband left, she went out and bought 
an emerald-green suit. "He had always seen me as subdued and quiet -- 
everything he bought me was gray or brown." Brown carpet, brown furniture, gray 
life -- the legacy of a marriage. But there were two grown daughters and a 
lingering dream -- that of learning to dance, she who had never danced as a 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
She went to work and she went to dancing lessons. It was a thawing out; the 
shy, stiffly held arms unfolded. "You carry it with you", she says of ballroom 
dancing. "It's not just something you do 'out there.' It's a state of grace." A 
state of being alive. 
</P>
<P>
She met Stig dancing and they married two years ago. And if he dresses better, 
so does she. And if he sleeps more comfortably in the Long Beach house from 
that first marriage, so does she. She lives now with white walls, white carpet, 
glass and space. The den has been cleared, the furniture stored and they dance 
together on the parquet floor that used to be brown carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a week they drive up to Western and 6th to take dancing lessons: an hour 
of smooth with Ricky, an hour of exotic Latin with Bernard. "Investing in 
yourself," Joanie calls it. 
</P>
<P>
Even here on the early morning Westmor floor, those who dance are made 
beautiful by the dance. The short, stocky man, balding and too neat, becomes 
tall and hawk-like. The slightly older blonde with worn hair loses her 
apologetic air and turns to the mirror, to the stranger herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Dancing is ageless," Joanie says. "You've got something no one can take away 
from you. You own it." 
</P>
<P>

RESCUE THE HOSTAGES AND IRAQ WILL FALL; 
</P>
<P>
WITHOUT HIS EMBASSY CAPTIVES, HUSSEIN WILL HAVE NO CARDS LEFT TO PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY S. CLINE, Ray S. Cline, a former deputy director of the CIA, is chairman 
of the United States Global Strategy Council in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crux of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis is Saddam Hussein's desperate move of taking 
Americans and other foreigners as hostages. President George Bush has firmly 
insisted not only that Kuwait be liberated from Iraq's occupation but also that 
hostages be freed as a matter of moral principle and international legality. 
The President is right. 
</P>
<P>
The repercussions from Iraq's abrupt invasion and military occupation of Kuwait 
have turned the world upside down. As time goes by the danger of the necessity 
of war against Iraqi military forces raises anxiety, but the issue must be 
faced. Iraq's uncivilized treatment of the foreign residents in both Iraq and 
Kuwait makes military hostilities all the more likely. 
</P>
<P>
With the deployment of substantial U.S. military forces in the Arabian Sea and 
the Red Sea, Saddam Hussein is facing the time of truth. The international 
consortium is trying to force him to withdraw from Kuwait forthwith and accept 
a dramatic, humiliating, political retreat. If the United States holds firm and 
backs Iraq into a corner, Hussein may soon try to play more intensively than he 
has so far the only card he has remaining in his hands -- the exploitation of 
American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Given Hussein's own conspiratorial criminal background, he is very likely also 
to unleash attacks against Americans and American installations anywhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Dictators never should get compensation for discontinuing actions that no 
civilized leaders would ever contemplate in the first place. If Iraq is allowed 
to buy much more time for further political maneuver by the hostages ploy, the 
whole American effort to rescue the Mideast may begin to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
What the United States must do within the next 45 days is to seize the moral 
high ground by announcing an operation to rescue the Americans in the U.S. 
Embassy in Kuwait with the minimum use of force and minimum loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. assault teams of the special-operations forces should be quickly 
deployed into Kuwait to rescue the American Embassy personnel held hostage; in 
effect, the forces will be acting on a peacekeeping mission and seeking no 
military confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
* The assault teams should be equipped to use available non-lethal technology, 
such as stun guns and infrasonic devices to disorient or disable, without 
killing, the Iraqi troops holding the hostages. Their rescue attempt will 
indicate their aim is peace, not war. 
</P>
<P>
* A much larger unit of American troops with highly lethal weapons and air 
cover will back up the assault teams. 
</P>
<P>
* If the non-lethal rescue effort of the assault teams escalates because of 
Iraq's intransigence, the inexorable consequences will be that American forces 
will neutralize any and all threatening Iraqi military forces, primarily by air 
and missile attack but also by tank and artillery gunfire insofar as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
After the American rescue effort is mounted, Hussein will have no more maneuver 
room. He may try to make a face-saving deal, or he may be replaced by his own 
cohorts who do not want to see their power destroyed. If, however, the Iraqi 
regime decides to attack American forces with lethal weapons, the result will 
be that its army will be wiped out. The soldiers may wisely desert the 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue effort will either bring military hostilities by Hussein's own 
decision or the beginning of the liberation of Kuwait.

MORNING BRIEFING: EXTRA EARS IN THE HUDDLE CALLED NO FACTOR IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, it was "You Make the Call." Now, CBS-TV has come up with "You Take the 
Call." 
</P>
<P>
If you want to. 
</P>
<P>
Before Texas A&amp;M's two-point conversion attempt late in its 28-27 loss to 
Texas Saturday, a CBS field crew trained a camera and a shotgun microphone on 
the Aggies' sideline huddle. A national audience was in on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
When running back Darren Lewis was stopped well short of the goal line, Aggie 
fans cried foul. But officials from both schools said the telecast had nothing 
to do with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Hitzges of KLIF Radio in Dallas, whose sports show was besieged with calls 
after the game, said: "The question is, shouldn't we be a little careful here? 
Twenty to 25 seconds before the ball was snapped, a lot of people knew what the 
play was." 
</P>
<P>
Add CBS telecast: Robin Brendle, a publicist for CBS Sports, said broadcasting 
the play was inadvertent but added: "A big part of our telecast is trying to . 
. . capture the essence of the game. We certainly don't want to affect the 
outcome of the game, but we want to bring our viewers into the huddle." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: How many current NFC head coaches played pro football? 
</P>
<P>
Who is Eugene Dooley?: After Indiana State dropped its Indian chief mascot last 
year, the school polled its 11,600-plus students, asking them to suggest a new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 62 students who responded, 20 said a mascot was not needed. And 
according to Eugene Dooley, president of the Student Government Assn., the 
other suggestions were ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
One student recommended Bart Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
In-bounds friendship: When rookie Derrick Coleman replaced Jack Haley in the 
New Jersey Nets' starting lineup a month ago, the two began feuding. 
</P>
<P>
They kept it going before a game at Phoenix in late November, with a shoving 
match over complimentary tickets. 
</P>
<P>
But when Coleman got in a fight with Mark Acres of the Orlando Magic Saturday, 
the first to come to Coleman's defense was Haley. He was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Chicago's Mike Ditka and Detroit's Wayne Fontes. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Seattle forward Xavier McDaniel, after making only one of 10 shots 
and scoring only two points in the SuperSonics' 135-102 loss to the Celtics at 
the Boston Garden Monday night: "When you look at the word stink, that's what I 
did tonight." TED BROCK

<TEXT>
<P>
Among those benefiting from the Kings' fast start is General Manager Rogie 
Vachon, who has been rewarded with a new three-year contract. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What vindication for the former all-star goaltender who was blamed every time 
the Kings made a bad trade and then had to hear how the good deals were really 
made by Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was Vachon who pulled off the heist that has helped to lift Los Angeles to 
the top of the Smythe Division standings -- forward Craig Duncanson to 
Minnesota for goaltender Daniel Berthiaume. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Those exhibitions between NHL and Soviet Union teams should be dumped. The 
crowds have been dwindling, and both sides are taking unnecessary risks in the 
middle of the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If that was great defense Monday night at Candlestick, then I'd much rather 
watch great offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New York took Jerry Rice and Rodney Hampton out of the game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
O.J. Anderson's best runs were off Phil Simms' fumbles, but Bill Parcells stuck 
with the veteran over the talented rookie Hampton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line was that Joe Montana made the big pass play and Phil Simms 
didn't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Although they are in different divisions, the Giants and 49ers have played each 
other at least once every season since 1984 in the regular season and/or 
playoffs. San Francisco has won six of the nine games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I don't think Ronnie Lott and Simms were discussing the delightful San 
Francisco weather after the game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Highlight of my evening was watching a tape of Philadelphia quarterback Randall 
Cunningham's incredible touchdown pass against Buffalo Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Something ought to be done about the loose interpretation of the intentional 
grounding rule. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Bills might be the best team in the NFL right now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland and Tampa Bay chose off-weeks to change coaches, as though that would 
make a difference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Steve Spurrier and Pat Sajak. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If college football season lasted much longer, Miami would keep winning and 
fall out of the top 10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's a wonder more quarterbacks don't wear shields to keep them from tipping 
off pass plays with their eyes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The battle for control of Hollywood Park is getting nasty. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos, who hasn't been landing good mounts, showed prospective clients 
that he's sincere about making Southern California his base when he signed a 
lease on a house in the San Gabriel Valley. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Three Kentucky Derby winners and seven Breeders' Cup winners have competed in 
the Futurity at Hollywood Park, which will be run Sunday, but none has won the 
$1-million race that decides the meeting's 2-year-old championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers are advertising "guaranteed seats for all playoff games" to those 
who buy rest-of-the-season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
But can they guarantee the playoffs? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bill Musselman, coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, is partial to 
overachievers who follow his orders. He has five former Continental Basketball 
Assn. players on the roster. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The New York Knicks must have wanted to hide their coaching change, making it 
on the day of the Giant-49er game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It will be surprising if weary John Thompson remains at Georgetown longer than 
two more years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame might have the fourth-best basketball team in Indiana behind 
Indiana, Purdue and Butler. . . . 
</P>
<P>
My college hoops guru, Sonny Vaccaro, says to watch out for Georgia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA could start all M's -- Tracy Murray, Don MacLean and Zan Mason up front 
and Darrick Martin and Gerald Madkins in the backcourt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Bruin-Arizona game Jan. 12 in Tucson probably will be a matchup of 
unbeatens. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dick Enberg and Keith Jackson used to do sports on the Channel 5 news programs. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
You mean to tell me that the United States doesn't begin Davis Cup zone play 
until February? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Myrella Moses, wife of Edwin, phoned Angela Worthy, wife of James, with words 
of encouragement. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When Brett Butler becomes eligible for new-look free agency in January, the 
Dodgers should run, not walk, to his door. He would fill two needs -- center 
fielder and leadoff hitter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Ken Griffeys, Jr. and Sr., will be typecast as Seattle Mariner ballplayers 
on an episode of the Fox television network series, "Harry and the Hendersons." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't confuse Junior Felix with Felix Jose. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Remember when $2 million a year wasn't a standard wage in baseball?

Coach Art Shell doesn't like the run-and-shoot offense that the Raiders will 
face when they play the Detroit Lions at the Pontiac Silverdome Monday night, 
and he's not sure how to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of people running all over the place," he said of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got four wide receivers running all over the place, and it seems when 
you watch them, somebody's always open. You've got to make sure you confuse the 
quarterback a bit, and always be aware of where Mr. (tailback Barry) Sanders 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson's 117 yards rushing Sunday during the Raiders' 23-20 victory over 
the Broncos in Denver was his first 100-yard effort of the season. . . . With 
his eight-yard sack of the Broncos' John Elway, Greg Townsend has tied his 
career-best sack mark of 11 1/2 in a season. He has four games remaining. 
Townsend finished with 11 1/2 sacks in 1988 and 1986. CHRIS DUFRESNE

GAME WATCHED BY RECORD 41 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers' 7-3 victory over the New York Giants was the 
most-watched game in the 21 years of ABC-TV's Monday Night Football, the 
network said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While its A.C. Nielsen rating was well off the record, the game was watched by 
an estimated 41 million. 
</P>
<P>
The game drew a national rating of 27.0 and a share of 42. The record was set 
Dec. 2, 1985, by a Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game rated at 29.6 with a 46 
share. That game, however, was watched by an estimated 39 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' Ronnie Lott, who made two crunching hits on Giant tight end Mark 
Bavaro Monday night, suffered sprained knees and possible ligament damage in 
the fourth quarter. Coach George Seifert said Lott was "very suspect" for San 
Francisco's game Sunday against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't personally ruled out (playing) because I finished the game," Lott 
said. "But that was mainly on adrenaline. We'll see. We'll take it day by day." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Rose Mofford and Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona will lead a delegation 
that is to meet Friday with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to discuss the 1993 
Super Bowl. Tagliabue has said he will urge NFL owners to move the Super Bowl 
to another state because Arizona rejected a paid state holiday to honor Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Redskins waived punter Ralf Mojsiejenko, a one-time Pro Bowl 
player, and replaced him with former Kansas City Chief Kelly Goodburn.

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
LESS FROM JORDAN SPELLS MORE FOR BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the season began, Michael Jordan, who led the NBA in scoring the 
previous four seasons, gave his blessing to a change in the Chicago Bulls' 
offensive system. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to get more of Jordan's teammates involved in the point-making. 
</P>
<P>
You could say that Jordan is scoring less but enjoying it more. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had a mere 27 points Tuesday night at Chicago when the Bulls set a 
regular-season, no-overtime team scoring record in a 155-127 victory over the 
Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls' record is 156 points, but it took four overtimes in Portland to get 
that many. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth consecutive victory for the Bulls, but it was a little 
different from their recent victories. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous three, Jordan scored often in the first quarter, the Bulls took 
a big lead and the 6-foot-6 all-pro guard was allowed considerable rest. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, one of the better teams in the West, came out ready to run and played 
the Bulls on even terms in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns led, 75-73, when Bill Cartwright and Horace Grant sparked a 9-0 Bull 
burst in two minutes shortly after intermission. The Bulls' lead grew to 19 
after three quarters and they went on to score their fourth victory in a row of 
by at least 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Grant had 25 points and 12 rebounds and Cartwright had 16 points in 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I never shot this well," said Jordan, who was 12 for 22 after going 39 for 52 
in the three previous games. "Until this season I was too concerned about what 
kind of defense I was up against. Now, I come out firing and let the other team 
worry." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had 21 points in the first half before turning the chores over to 
teammates. The Bulls had seven players in double figures, two with nine points 
and another with eight. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando 113, New York 102 -- A coaching change isn't necessarily the answer, 
the Knicks discovered. 
</P>
<P>
In their first game under John MacLeod, who replaced young Stu Jackson, the 
Knicks hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
They were a 13-point favorite over the Magic, who had lost seven games in a row 
and all 10 road games this season. 
</P>
<P>
After a tight first half, the Magic opened the second half with three-pointers 
by Scott Skiles and Dennis Scott to trigger an 11-0 spurt. The Knicks never got 
even again. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 109, Milwaukee 108 -- Charles Barkley made two free throws with no 
time showing in overtime at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who finished with 42 points, rallied the 76ers for a tie in regulation 
after they fell behind, 88-76, with 10 minutes to play. His driving layup with 
10 seconds to play sent it into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks took a 108-103 lead with 2:42 left in overtime, but they never scored 
again. They still led, 108-107, when Jack Sikma was called for a charge with 17 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers missed two shots, but Barkley grabbed the second rebound and was 
fouled by Sikma before the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a courageous call by (referee) Mike Costabile," Barkley said. "I got 
fouled. Most officials wouldn't make that call in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Portland 98, Miami 95 -- With his running mate at guard, Clyde Drexler, in a 
shooting slump, Terry Porter has taken charge in the stretch for the Trail 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener of a four-game trip east, the Blazers were tied with the Heat, 
93-93, when Porter made a 20-foot jumper. After Grant Long made one out of two 
free throws, Porter was fouled and made two free throws to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Portland improved the best record in the NBA to 15-1 with its fourth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler, the Blazers' leading scorer, was only seven for 29 from the field in 
two previous games. He was six for 16 in this one. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry just keeps stepping up and making key shots," Portland Coach Rick 
Adelman said. "He's a money player. That's why I'm glad I get to coach him." 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 103, Dallas 83 -- Antoine Carr came off the bench to score 31 points 
at Sacramento, and the Kings rolled to their second victory in 15 games, ending 
a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had lost 12 consecutive games at home, but their bench strength 
overcame the injury-riddled Mavericks. The Kings led by 11 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 113, Houston 110 -- Glenn Rivers scored 26 points, including a 
clinching 15-foot jumper with 18 seconds left, and the Hawks ended their 
nine-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks rallied after trailing by 13 points in the third quarter at Houston, 
closing the gap with a 21-10 run. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Moncrief's three-pointer gave the Hawks the lead for the first time with 
five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 106, Seattle 102 -- With Dale Ellis still ailing, the SuperSonics 
are losing because their guards are being outplayed. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets' Reggie Theus scored 29 points at East Rutherford, N.J., and Net guard 
Mookie Blaylock had 16 points, 10 assists and a key block in the closing 
seconds to send the Sonics to their sixth consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets won for the fifth time in their last six games although they went 7:37 
in the second quarter without making a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets led during most of the game but blew all but one point of an 11-point 
lead before scoring the last three points. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing a better job of handling adversity than we did a year ago," Coach 
Bill Fitch of the Nets said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 121, Denver 117 -- With the Cavaliers missing injured stars Mark 
Price and John Williams, they are a team the Nuggets can compete with. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge, the NBA scoring leader, had 12 of his 31 points in the first 
quarter to help the Nuggets take a 13-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cavaliers pulled within three with 12 minutes to play, and Gerald 
Paddio scored a point a minute in the last quarter to lead the winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 83, Indiana 81 -- The Timberwolves' Sam Mitchell made two free throws 
with 0.1 seconds to play at Minneapolis after Minnesota blew an 18-point lead 
in the fourth quarter. DAN HAFNER

RED WING STREAK ENDED BY BRUINS

<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Burridge scored his eighth goal 63 seconds into overtime Tuesday night at 
Boston, and the Bruins ended the Detroit Red Wings' six-game unbeaten string, 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings' leading scorer, Steve Yzerman, scoreless during the streak, sent the 
game into overtime when he scored with 62 seconds remaining in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who blew a 3-1 lead, wasted little time in the extra session. 
Goalie Tim Cheveldae of the Wings made a save on Bob Sweeney, but the puck 
bounced right to Burridge and he banged it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins improved their record to 15-8-4 and stretched their lead in the 
Adams Division to five points. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin goalie Andy Moog turned aside 35 shots and ran his lifetime record 
against the Red Wings to 11-1. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 4, New York Islanders 2 -- Greg Adams scored the tiebreaking goal 
with 5:13 left at Uniondale, N.Y. to lead the Canucks to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bozek intercepted an errant pass and fed the puck to Adams, who skated 
across the crease and flipped the puck over goalie Glenn Healy's pads. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks are unbeaten in five games (3-0-2) and the Islanders are winless in 
five games (0-3-2). DAN HAFNER

Eleanore Gusenbauer was a farmer whose fields overlooked the notorious 
concentration camp at Mauthausen. She long endured the sight of beatings and 
shootings in the rock quarry where inmates were literally worked to death, and 
she finally did something about it. Frau Gusenbauer filed a complaint with the 
authorities: 
</P>
<P>
"I am sickly and such a sight makes such a demand on my nerves that in the long 
run I cannot bear this," she wrote in 1941. "I request that it be arranged that 
such inhuman deeds be discontinued, or else be done where one does not see it." 
</P>
<P>
Farmer Gusenbauer's plaint is recounted by Gordon J. Horwitz in "In the Shadow 
of Death" as an example of the intimate and morally ambiguous links between the 
machinery of the Holocaust and the common folk who lived and worked in its 
bowels. 
</P>
<P>
Horwitz, a historian at Illinois Wesleyan University, has added something 
important and distinctive to the literature of the Holocaust: How, he asks, did 
these ordinary men and women cope with the inescapable reality of torture and 
murder in their own back yards? 
</P>
<P>
"The enormity and horror of the concentration camp led us to conceive of it as 
a separate universe," Horwitz writes. "Yet this universe of torment and killing 
was never completely sealed from the ordinary world beyond its perimeter. . . . 
Citizens living in the vicinity were daily witness to mounting atrocities, and 
. . . confronted with terrible choices." 
</P>
<P>
The town of Mauthausen in Upper Austria was chosen by the German government as 
the site for a concentration camp because of its stone quarries, which offered 
the SS both an instrument of torture and a source of profit. 
</P>
<P>
Here were the notorious "186 steps" leading out of quarry, where inmates were 
forced to carry heavy loads of rock at a killing pace. The SS guards delighted 
in simply shoving the exhausted inmates over the 300-foot verge of the quarry: 
"Attention! Parachutists," the jolly torturers would call out as their victims 
fell to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
His study focuses narrowly on one of the smaller concentration camps in the 
Holocaust -- only 119,000 people died at Mauthausen complex, one-third of them 
Jews -- but the real context of his book is literally the human soul. Horwitz 
reminds us again and again that the common folk of town and country lived with 
guilty knowledge of crimes against humanity, and even helped to commit those 
crimes by their work as nurses, secretaries, bookkeepers, plumbers and truck 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The author is not without compassion for the fearful souls who lacked the 
courage to fight back or even to speak out. Indeed, he allows us to see heroism 
in the act of dropping a scrap of bread on a path where an inmate might later 
find it. 
</P>
<P>
But the townsfolk of Mauthausen hardly come off as heroes. We are shown exactly 
how they profited from the business of death by burning bodies, for instance, 
or making use of slave labor, or trafficking in dental gold yanked from the 
mouths of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Horwitz is a gifted writer, and he displays a genius for the matter-of-fact 
observation that resonates with deeper meanings. Horwitz describes, for 
example, how the residents of outlying districts were forced to cross the 
concentration camp on their way to town; the passage becomes a metaphor for the 
behavior of a passive people under a brutal government: 
</P>
<P>
"A person who made the journey learned a valuable lesson in how to behave in 
the vicinity of the camp," Horwitz writes. "He learned to control his 
movements, to stop and start on command, to keep his neck stiff, to fix his 
gaze straight ahead, and pass to the opposite side as quickly as possible. 
Above all, the resident learned to be thankful he was only momentarily in 
transit, and not a permanent inhabitant of the camp." 
</P>
<P>
No matter how much I read about the Holocaust, I am always shocked to learn 
about some new horror that sprang from the boundless imagination of the Nazi 
mind. "In the Shadow of Death" is full of such gruesome revelations. 
</P>
<P>
But the book also offers a glimpse of moral courage, however faint, and we 
should cherish these sparks of nobility in the black landscape of the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
I shall never forget one small observation that Horwitz makes almost in passing 
in describing how ashes and bone fragments were trucked from the gas chamber 
and crematorium near Mauthausen to be dumped in the Danube. 
</P>
<P>
"When such pieces of unground bone fell from trucks," he writes, "residents are 
said to have collected these remains and built 'little piles' of them along the 
roadside to signal to the murderers their awareness of the crime."

ADMIRALS PUNISHED FOR NOT AIRING JET PROGRAM FLAWS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: CAPTAIN ALSO REMOVED. CHENEY WAS UPSET ABOUT NOT BEING INFORMED OF 
$1-BILLION OVERRUN, DELAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy said Tuesday that it has removed three senior military officers, 
including a vice admiral who oversees naval aviation programs, because they 
failed to report serious flaws in the secret A-12 attack aircraft program. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation report released by the Navy concluded that information about a 
projected $1-billion overrun and a one-year delay of the A-12 development 
program never reached Defense Secretary Dick Cheney when he undertook a major 
review of the A-12 and other programs last March and April. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks of issuing upbeat findings and testifying to Congress in late 
April that the program was in good shape, Cheney was left embarrassed by the 
disclosure by the A-12's prime contractors that the aircraft program faced 
major financial and schedule problems. 
</P>
<P>
The punishment issued against the three Navy officials is among the most severe 
in recent history. Vice Adm. Richard C. Gentz, commander of the Naval Air 
Systems Command, will retire no later than Feb. 1, 1991, the Navy said. The 
A-12 program executive officer, Rear Adm. John F. Calvert, and the program 
manager, Capt. Lawrence G. Elberfeld, have been reassigned to other duties and 
received letters of censure from Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy report found that senior Navy officers erred by failing to anticipate 
substantial cost overruns on the A-12 and failing to warn of greater risks in 
the program in meetings with Defense Department officials. An independent 
Pentagon analyst found after two days of study that the program would incur a 
$1-billion overrun, but that information did not reach Cheney either. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than a month after Cheney completed his rosy review of the A-12, 
the two firms jointly developing and producing the attack plane, McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., warned the Pentagon of impending 
financial disaster. The companies then disclosed to investors on June 11 that 
they would post major losses in the program when they reported their 
second-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy report concluded that the two firms were "overly optimistic" in their 
cost projections to the Navy before their disclosures. It said the companies' 
program managers "perceived significant pressures from upper management" to 
keep up the flow of cash to the program by being optimistic about its progress. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy goes to the heart of a longstanding problem in defense 
procurement, in which deficiencies in weapons programs are suppressed and left 
to fester secretly, until their disclosure creates political bombshells. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated reforms, critics contend that the military services 
chronically withhold politically damaging information in an effort to protect 
their budgets and their programs. Indeed, the Navy report concludes: "Unless 
means can be found to solve this abiding cultural problem, the failures 
evidenced in this report can be anticipated to occur again in the same or 
similar form." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear signal to anyone in acquisition that the bad news has to come 
up the ladder," a senior Navy official said Tuesday. "If it doesn't, then 
you're out of here." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics, the nation's two largest defense firms, 
are developing the A-12 under a fixed-price contract awarded in June, 1986, 
which carried a ceiling price of $4.78 billion. Costs above the ceiling were to 
be borne by the two firms. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier-based A-12 Avenger, which will use stealth technology to evade 
enemy radar, would replace the existing A-6 Intruder fleet in attack bombing 
missions. The aircraft, which is being assembled in Tulsa, Okla., could 
eventually cost $100 million each to produce. 
</P>
<P>
The overruns and the high price tag are expected to generate increasing 
political pressures against the program. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Acquisition Board, a panel of senior defense executives that 
controls major programs, will review the future of the A-12 program Friday. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics have been pressing for major concessions 
in their contracts that would essentially bail them out of losses that will 
reach more than $500 million for each firm. With the schedule problems facing 
the two firms, a delay in full-scale production is likely. 
</P>
<P>
A McDonnell spokeswoman said the company "is in the process of reviewing the 
inspector general's report with our partners at General Dynamics. We have 
solved the technical issues in the program and believe we have an excellent 
aircraft and plan to deliver that aircraft under the direction of the Navy's 
new management team. We remain committed to progress and successful completion 
of this very critical program." 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy report indicates that the program was long troubled and remained 
so until earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that "there was early evidence of trouble affecting the 
production schedule." By the summer of 1989, the Navy's program manager had 
indications that the first flight date of June, 1990, would be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft tooling should have been in place by December, 1989, and aircraft 
assembly started, but they were not. The firms, meanwhile, overestimated their 
ability to recover, displaying at best "a plain lack of objectivity," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was much heavier than designed. Stop-work orders were issued to 
redesign parts for lower weight. Production was continually delayed. Parts were 
in short supply. Although production reports going to the Navy should have 
indicated all of these problems, nobody was paying attention, the Navy probe 
found. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy even paid the firms for work that was not complete, the study found. 
And finally, the Navy exercised a $1.2-billion production option for six 
aircraft on May 31, 1990, even though senior officials were "aware of recent 
information indicating significant cost schedule and technical risk not 
previously displayed to senior management." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett blamed the failure to provide accurate cost and scheduling estimates to 
Cheney not on the Navy's procurement system but rather on "errors of judgment 
and failures within the program management chain of supervision," according to 
a memorandum he sent to Cheney Nov. 29. The memorandum was released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is sure now to question whether Garrett himself, along with 
Undersecretary of Defense John Betti, exercised poor judgment or may have been 
involved in a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who said he found the Navy investigation report disturbing, asked 
Donald J. Atwood, deputy defense secretary, to review the A-12 program and the 
individuals involved. Recommendations are expected as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
Also released Tuesday were findings by the Defense inspector general that were 
highly critical of Betti for putting too much credence in "general assurances" 
by the contractors that the project could be completed on time and within the 
cost ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord Christle, deputy director for cost management under Betti, was asked 
March 26 to conduct an independent cost analysis of the A-12. Within two days, 
he concluded that it was headed for a $1-billion overrun, according to a letter 
from Inspector General Susan J. Crawford to Rep. Andy Ireland (R-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
But Christle's analysis -- completed about one month before Cheney's public 
announcement April 27 of the upbeat findings in his so-called major aircraft 
review -- was never provided to the defense secretary, Crawford's letter says. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy report referred to Christle's analysis as a "last-minute effort" and 
said that, even though Christle briefed Navy officials on his finding, they 
were not aware of its significance. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ireland who called for the probe after he questioned why Cheney 
testified to the committee that the A-12 was in good shape only weeks before 
the contractors disclosed that the program was a year behind schedule and far 
over its contract ceiling. Ireland said Tuesday that the House Armed Services 
Committee would hold hearings on the incident as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland said the inspector general's report illustrates fundamental flaws in 
the practice of military program managers relying on contractors for their cost 
estimates. In an interview, he said that suppressing negative information is a 
widespread problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very typical of the Defense Department," Ireland said. "You have all 
these people with vested interests -- not only their personal careers. So many 
of our programs are literally jobs programs that they have a life of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the bureaucracy, nobody wants to take responsibility. So they don't 
pass the information on."

COURT REJECTS STATE TAX ON MULTINATIONALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An appellate court has dealt California another setback in the high-stakes 
battle to save its so-called "unitary tax" on foreign-based multinational 
corporations -- a ruling that could cost the state hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento, deciding in favor of 
London-based Barclays Bank and its California subsidiary, found that 
California's unitary system is unconstitutional because it violates the foreign 
commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling is not expected to have an immediate impact on the state 
budget problem because of likely appeals that could drag on for months or 
years, state Controller Gray Davis called it "another dark cloud on the state's 
already gloomy finances." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the loss to the state, once appeals are exhausted, would be $526 
million in back taxes, interest and administrative costs. There also would be 
ongoing, still unknown losses because of California's inability to continue 
levying the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, chairman of the Franchise Tax Board, which administers the tax, said an 
appeal was all but certain. "As a practical matter, the decision would preclude 
our auditors from examining the books of foreign-based multinationals," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, handed down last Friday, marked the latest chapter in a bitter 
controversy between state tax officials and foreign business interests that has 
been raging since the early 1970s. Under the unitary system, the state taxes 
multinational corporations on the basis of each firm's worldwide earnings, 
payroll and property holdings. The state figures that if 2% of a corporation's 
business operations are in California, then the state should have the right to 
apply its bank and corporation tax to 2% of a company's worldwide taxable 
income. 
</P>
<P>
California established the tax in the belief that unless taxable income is 
based on a corporation's worldwide operations, the firm will be able to shift 
profits from one subsidiary to another, report losses locally, and escape an 
income tax here altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign business interests contend that California's unitary method is used 
nowhere else in the world, requires them to keep separate sets of books, 
unfairly taxes profit centers outside of California, and requires them to turn 
over confidential corporate records to state auditors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, holding that the 
unitary system was a legally sound way of taxing corporations. That ruling 
failed to definitively address the foreign policy questions and whether the 
state was usurping the federal government's role in setting tax policy. In the 
latest decision, the appellate court ruled that the tax usurped federal 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Legislature, hoping to defuse the political and legal powder keg, 
revised the state's taxing system to give multinational corporations a tax 
break that now amounts to about $300 million a year. Controversy continued over 
the unitary tax. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne M. Garvey, a San Francisco attorney who represents Barclays, said the 
unitary system "has been an international cause celebre from the moment the 
state tried to apply it." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said the unitary method "is contrary to all international tax systems," 
contending that "even the federal government has had nothing but problems with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous opinion, the Court of Appeal seemed to agree, ruling that the 
unitary system is unconstitutional because it poses a threat to international 
commerce and runs contrary to federal policy on taxing of foreign corporations 
as voiced by the administrations of four Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
The case was filed by Barclays Bank after a state Franchise Tax Board demand 
that the British firm pay an additional $154,098 in 1977 state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The governments of the United Kingdom and Canada joined Barclays in the 
protest, arguing that the tax violates widely accepted international standards 
and could lead to retaliation against U.S. firms operating in their countries. 
The U.S. Justice Department joined the two foreign governments in the appeal, 
arguing against the California tax. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member state appellate panel, in a decision written by Associate 
Justice Hugh A. Evans, described the tax as "an irritant in our foreign 
commerce relations" with "adverse implications for American foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
The Barclays ruling does not affect a second major unitary tax suit on its way 
to a decision -- filed by Colgate-Palmolive Corp. and representing the legal 
interests of U.S.-based corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Should the state also lose that suit, Controller Davis said the state could 
lose an estimated $3.3 billion in tax refunds, penalties, interest payments, 
fees and lost tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary. It's one more hole in the dike whose leak is all but fatal now," 
said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee, which is grappling with a budget shortfall that could 
reach $6 billion over this year and next, even without the adverse court 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
On the broader budget front, lawmakers -- after a little more than 24 hours in 
session -- returned to their districts Tuesday without acting on Gov. George 
Deukmejian's proposed $1-billion austerity plan. 
</P>
<P>
Both houses of the Legislature left committees behind in the Capitol to study 
the lame-duck governor's plan. Leaders acknowledged that no action on the 
budget was contemplated until after Gov.-elect Pete Wilson takes office in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do it piecemeal," Vasconcellos said. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblyman said it made more sense for lawmakers to act on a projected 
$800-million deficit in the current year's budget at the same time the 
Legislature is looking at how to extricate the state from a possible 
$4.9-billion shortfall next fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate recessed until Jan. 7, the day Wilson will be sworn in. The Assembly 
recessed until Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) calls them back 
to town. In all likelihood, that will be Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The unitary tax was established in California more than 50 years ago to make 
sure that multinational corporations paid their fair share of taxes to the 
state. Using a complex formula, a company's taxes are based on a share of its 
total income worldwide. The British conglomerate Barclays Bank challenged the 
tax as being unconstitutional after the state Franchise Tax Board determined 
that the company owed an additional $154,098 for 1977. The company won in 
Superior Court in Sacramento and won again after the tax board appealed.

<P>
RECORDS SHOW THAT WARNINGS ABOUT CONFUSING AND UNSAFE CONDITIONS HAVE GONE 
UNHEEDED. DETROIT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY CRITICIZED BY PILOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A jetliner accelerating down runway 21C at Detroit got an urgent command from 
the tower to abort takeoff. Almost simultaneously, and just in time, the pilot 
saw the problem. Up ahead, another jetliner was taxiing across his path. "It 
was an 'almost,' " the pilot wrote in a report on the near-accident. 
</P>
<P>
That was early in 1985, but in the years leading up to Monday's collision 
between two Northwest Airlines jetliners at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, many 
more "almosts" would be reported at that airfield -- and hundreds more around 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, warnings by pilots and other aviation experts about confusing and 
potentially unsafe conditions on the runways at Detroit and other U.S. airports 
went unheeded for years. Records reviewed by The Times show numerous examples 
of runway violations over the last five years, many of which required aborting 
landings or takeoffs to avoid disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The reports -- written by pilots and air traffic controllers and filed within 
10 days of an incident with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
-- show that runway problems are widespread. Among local airports most 
frequently criticized by pilots is Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The thousands of NASA reports include some that read like chapters from "The 
Perils of Pauline." 
</P>
<P>
One chagrined jetliner captain who made a wrong turn at Detroit and found 
himself "nose to nose" with an oncoming aircraft in 1986 wrote: "I believe that 
taxiway markings at all major airports must be improved -- especially at night 
or in fog." 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates airplane 
accidents, has yet to fix blame in Monday's collision. But from Detroit to New 
York to Burbank, the accounts of near-misses detailed in the pilot reports 
share a common element: For whatever reason, someone moves his plane onto the 
wrong runway or taxiway and into conflict with another aircraft. In many cases, 
eerily perhaps, the passengers in back never knew how close to disaster they 
came. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a new problem," Mike Benson, a spokesman for the NTSB in Washington, 
said in an interview. "This is an area we've been concerned with for some time. 
We would have hoped that it would have received more attention than it has" 
before the recent Detroit accident. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, since a spate of near-accidents on the ground in the late 1970s, 
nearly everyone in the aviation industry -- from pilots and air traffic 
controllers to the NTSB -- has been pressing the Federal Aviation 
Administration to improve ground operations at the nation's major airports. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the NTSB warned that ground accidents posed "a high potential for 
catastrophe." Since 1986, the agency has put ground safety improvements on its 
list of "Most Wanted" recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The world's worst aviation accident occurred on a runway in the Canary Islands 
in 1977, when two Boeing 747s collided in the fog, killing 583. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, an Eastern Airlines jet ran over a small plane that had 
landed on the same runway at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, 
killing the pilot of the small plane. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit has been especially criticized in past years by pilots who complained 
about confusing or badly weathered taxiway markings. One veteran airline pilot 
who inadvertently taxied across an active runway complained in a lengthy 1986 
report that the taxiway markings were "very confusing" and sometimes 
"illogical." The pilot complained also that it "has been a known problem at 
this airport for some (time)." 
</P>
<P>
About a year later, a jumbo jet pilot "became disoriented" when taxiing to a 
maintenance ramp and ended up on a runway just as another jetliner was lined up 
to land on it. An alert traffic controller ordered the landing aborted about 
700 feet from touchdown. The controller said that similar errors occurred 
"several more times" in one evening. 
</P>
<P>
Noting problems with Tarmac area markings and the confluence of taxiways and 
runways in a heavily trafficked area, the controller also wrote: "The location 
of this intersection causes the probability of collision to be very high." 
</P>
<P>
In another Detroit incident, a jetliner actually took off over the top of a 
smaller passenger plane that had landed ahead of it but had failed to find its 
way off the active runway. The 1986 near-miss occurred on the same runway as 
Monday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA says potentially dangerous ground hazards are created by a wide range 
of conditions and the many "aircrafts, vehicles, persons or objects on the 
ground" that could accidentally disturb the routine operations of taxiing 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also blamed forgetfulness, misunderstandings between cockpit and 
control tower, attention lapses and pilot failures to see runway markings for 
most of the reported runway errors. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA's official tally of what it calls "runway incursions" shows no 
discernible pattern, averaging about 280 mishaps between 1986 and 1989. Through 
October this year, the FAA has reported 220 runway incursions at the nation's 
400 government-supervised airports. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FAA reports few runway incidents involving Southern California 
airports, the NASA records reviewed by The Times reflect considerable pilot and 
air traffic controller concern about the problem, especially at Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1987, for example, a jetliner aborted takeoff when the pilot noticed 
"out of the corner of my eye" that another plane was taxiing to take off on a 
crossing runway, each of them initially blocked from the view of the other by 
the Burbank terminal building. Both planes hit their brakes. One was able to 
stop short of the intersection as the other continued through. "The passengers 
neither noticed the other aircraft, nor became alarmed at the braking," the 
pilot wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1985, another pilot complained of dodging a second airliner as the tower 
instructed two planes to taxi toward the same intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One veteran of airline operations at Burbank complained that it "is the 
only airport I have seen where they will use crossing runways in everyday 
operation rather than assign an active runway and use it (exclusively). You are 
always being sequenced 'to the intersection' of the crossing runways," the 
pilot said in recommending that runway operations be simplified. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot complaints of landing, takeoff and runway procedures at Burbank and other 
government-supervised airports are directed at the FAA, which has 
responsibility for those operations. But Paul Stofall, a spokesman for the FAA, 
brushes off such criticism, saying the FAA is "moving rapidly" to make runway 
operations safer. 
</P>
<P>
"In hindsight, it's always easier to say something should have been done 
sooner," he said. "It's always easier to point your finger at someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Stofall acknowledged that a ground radar system might have helped 
avoid the Detroit incident. 
</P>
<P>
"A ground radar system in a low visibility situation is a definite advantage in 
controlling aircraft on the ground," he said, adding that such a system is 
being tested in 12 cities and is expected to be improved and installed in 20 
more cities over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Tim Neale, a spokesman for the Airline Transport Assn., a Washington 
organization representing the nation's air carriers, accused the government of 
being too wrapped in bureaucratic red tape to produce the state-of-the-art 
technology needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been very critical of the FAA because so often their programs get so 
far behind schedule," Neale said in an interview Tuesday. "Whether this 
technology could have been brought along faster, I don't know. But, in general, 
they have been slow to apply technology to existing problems. They are hampered 
by a lot of rules and regulations that inhibit their getting things done." 
</P>
<P>
The NASA reports show that ground conflicts are dangerously common at airports 
around the country. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At San Francisco International in 1987, one airliner had two close 
encounters with cluttered runways. First, the crew was forced to "go around" 
once when the runway was not clear for it to land. Then, after touchdown and 
turning off onto the taxiway, the pilot reported that "a commuter (plane) 
appeared to my left taxiing rapidly . . . coming at me. I hit the brakes. He 
hit the brakes, and we stopped 20 feet apart, nose to nose." The tower 
controller apologized for not warning the airline captain to use a different 
runway exit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More recently at San Francisco, a captain of only three days who had flown 
into the airport only once before -- in daylight -- was preparing for a night 
takeoff alongside a co-pilot with only two months on the job when the co-pilot 
said: "Something is really wrong here." By then the plane was throttled 
forward, gaining takeoff speed. The captain immediately pulled back on the 
throttles and aborted takeoff. It turned out they were on the taxiway, not the 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Los Angeles International in 1988, an airliner landed and exited the 
runway on the angled "high-speed" turnoff to the taxiway. It was cleared by 
ground controllers to proceed directly to the passenger gate. Another plane on 
the taxiway was told to hold and wait. The other plane didn't stop, however, 
and the landing captain complained: "I immediately came to a rapid stop. As the 
other aircraft passed by us, with no more than 20 feet of clearance between his 
wingtip and the nose of our aircraft, we observed the first officer give us the 
notorious finger salute." 
</P>
<P>
 -- After landing on runway 35R at Dallas-Ft. Worth, a pilot taxied across a 
runway without traffic controller permission. Radio frequencies to the tower 
were jammed, he said. Before crossing, he "observed the area to be clear," but 
it turned out that he cut off an unseen jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB says it has been worried about the runway safety problem since a 
series of near-collisions occurred between June, 1978, and February, 1979. And 
after a near-collision involving a jumbo jet at Minneapolis-St. Paul in 1985, 
the agency put the issue on its "Most Wanted" list. 
</P>
<P>
Among its proposals, the safety board suggests that the government require 
better communications procedures between taxiing pilots and control tower 
officials and improve runway markings. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the FAA has adopted some of the board's recommendations, but officials 
said greater improvements in communications procedures and runway marking 
systems are needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have hoped (all the recommendations) would get more attention than it 
has," said Benson at the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers also are impatient for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many problems in the air that we haven't focused as we should on 
runway problems," said Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic 
Controllers Assn.

THE INVESTIGATION 
</P>
<P>
Heavy fog and a lack of ground guidance systems are being studied as possible 
contributing causes in Monday's collision of a DC-9 and a 727 on the center 
runway of the Detroit airport. 
</P>
<P>
* The DC-9 should have been on taxiway X while the 727 was accelerating for 
takeoff on runway 3C. 
</P>
<P>
The Collision: The tip of the 727's right wing hit the right side of the DC-9 
begind the cockpit, rake along its fuselage at about window height and knocked 
off its right tail engine.

COMPANIES SEE GULF CRISIS AS MARKETING OPPORTUNITY; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: FIRMS ATTEMPT TO LINK THEIR PRODUCTS WITH TROOPS IN THE DESERT, 
EITHER BY ADVERTISING OR GIVEAWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Now, from those wonderful folks who brought you the American Buy-centennial and 
the official snack food of the Olympic Games, comes . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf Crisis. 
</P>
<P>
With national advertising campaigns and well-promoted giveaway programs for the 
troops, U.S. companies that market everything from cosmetics to cold drinks to 
long-distance telephone calls have attempted to draw links between their 
products and the country's fighting men and women in Saudi Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
"War itself is not attractive, but there are aspects that are," said David 
Stewart, a USC marketing professor who specializes in consumer psychology. 
"There are heroes. . . . There is goodness and nobility. It's like a super 
sporting event." 
</P>
<P>
While the appeals of such marketing campaigns are obvious, there are also 
traps. Marketing experts have kept a close watch on public opinion polls, which 
generally have shown a gradual weakening of what was once overwhelming support 
for Operation Desert Shield. There are lines of taste and commercialism that 
must not be crossed. 
</P>
<P>
"Retribution from consumers is swift and fierce if you go over the edge," said 
Owen Dougherty, vice president for communication for the Foote, Cone &amp; 
Belding advertising agency in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the troop buildup, however, oil companies, media groups, department 
stores, a labor union, a pro-nuclear energy group, a beverage container 
manufacturer and others all have have invoked the crisis in advertising 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in one of the more arresting pitches, Macy's department stores and 
Cosmair cosmetics company took out a full-page advertisement in the New York 
Times in an attempt to persuade consumers to buy bottles of "action-oriented" 
Drakkar Noir after-shave, shampoo or deodorant as Christmas presents for 
soldiers in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"Make it a merrier Christmas for family and friends overseas," read the 
advertisement, which featured a photograph of a camouflaged infantryman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the ways we can participate," said Suzie Davidowitz, a Cosmair 
spokesperson. "A lot of people are doing things to help. We just happen to sell 
fragrances." 
</P>
<P>
Such ads are in the great wartime tradition of entrepreneurial America. During 
the Civil War, some people made fortunes hawking war bonds, steel-clad 
protective Bibles and even guaranteed lifelike embalming to anxious recruits. 
In World War II, products such as Coca-Cola and Lucky Strike cigarettes 
skyrocketed to international prominence through their exposure to GIs around 
the globe. In the Korean War, often dubbed the "forgotten war," and the 
unpopular Vietnam War, however, advertisers shied away from combat-related 
marketing strategies. 
</P>
<P>
With the Persian Gulf, however, some companies have sensed a foundation of 
public support that can translate into successful promotional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unlike Nike sponsoring a marathon," said Debbie MacInnis, a marketing 
professor at the University of Arizona. "It's just smart business. As a 
consumer, it is a little disconcerting to see business capitalizing on a 
national crisis, but as a marketer, it's a very interesting idea." 
</P>
<P>
MacInnis said the gulf crisis, for the moment, has many of same qualities as 
other special events that attract advertisers: the excitement of the Super 
Bowl, the patriotic fervor of the Olympics, the Rockwellian glow of a Main 
Street parade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patriotism and Americana," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The daily prominence of the crisis in the news media makes it even more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's front and center stage in the public's mind now," said Howard Bell, 
president of the American Advertising Federation, a trade group 
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the gulf-related advertising has been restricted to print 
media. Advertising experts said the situation in the Persian Gulf is too 
volatile to justify investing the longer lead times and higher production costs 
of national television advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
No product has been too esoteric to ballyhoo. Just five weeks after the 
invasion of Kuwait, Tetra Pak, a Shelton, Conn., company that packages 
beverages in aseptic containers, declared in a barrage of large advertisements 
in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and USA Today: 
</P>
<P>
"Technology has made it so our GIs can have American milk in the Saudi desert. 
. . . We are proud of our armed forces. And we are proud that our beverage 
packaging makes it possible for them to get the nutrition they need so far from 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Not content with demonstrating the drink box's role in maintaining military 
readiness, the company launched two more campaigns showing the container's 
contribution in saving refugees in Jordan and conserving worldwide fuel 
supplies because of its shipping efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Tetra Pak spokeswoman Virginia Harger said: "You can just see the applications 
and say, 'Wow!' " 
</P>
<P>
Some advertisements have attempted to bolster public images. For instance, 
hotel queen Leona M. Helmsley, convicted recently on tax evasion and mail fraud 
charges, took out a full-page advertisement in September to lambaste Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein and throw her support behind the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have gone beyond gulf-related advertising and employed a more 
direct method to gain high-profile exposure for their products: They have gone 
to the desert and given them away. 
</P>
<P>
Companies have flooded Saudi Arabia with free products, largely to aid the 
military effort, but also to curry favor with a group of consumers that 
marketing professionals see as the most lucrative in the world: American youth. 
</P>
<P>
The list of donations includes 1,000 flying disks and boomerangs, 2,500 
hand-held video games, 3,250 portions of dehydrated ice cream, 10 tons of 
official National Football League souvenirs, 100,000 boxes of official Major 
League Baseball cookies, 2,000 cases of nonalcoholic beer, 20,000 puzzle books, 
1,000 yellow-striped, high-visibility footballs and a still-to-be-determined 
number of Wiffle Balls. 
</P>
<P>
"The key here is that people who fight in wars tend to be young," said USC's 
Stewart. "They're forming preferences now that will stay with them for the rest 
of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
It's a process he calls "consumer socialization." 
</P>
<P>
"Cigarette and beverage companies sponsor a lot of car racing and professional 
sporting events because that's where young people congregate," he said. "It's 
trying to tie a product with an experience. War is just a much more intense 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said Gillette gave away safety razors to soldiers during World War II. 
When the war was over, the soldiers continued using the razor, leading to the 
disappearance of the straight razor. 
</P>
<P>
"Spam is a classic example," he said. Troops who ate the processed meat during 
World War II continued eating it at home, turning it into a common household 
food. 
</P>
<P>
(A digest-sized version of The Los Angeles Times is being made available for 
free distribution to the troops.) 
</P>
<P>
Some experts said the risks are too great to justify gulf-related promotions. 
To begin with, they said, an overabundance of such ads could provoke a consumer 
backlash. In addition, any advertising campaign runs the risk of appearing to 
be grandstanding or exploitation of a national crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Said John Yost, general manager of the San Francisco-based advertising firm Hal 
Riney &amp; Partners: "Most people wouldn't want to touch this with a 10-foot 
pole. In fact, to use the crisis is in pretty bad taste. You don't want to mess 
with something as serious as international politics where lives are at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Also, experts said, the eagerness to tap into the gulf crisis could fade fast 
if the face-off turns bloody, transforming the patriotic image of troops in the 
desert into a vision of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Winer, professor of marketing at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, 
said he believes that companies already have begun to shy away from the crisis 
as public opinion has grown more mixed in the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot riskier now," he said. "In the beginning it was all parades and 
flag waving. Now it's getting more serious. If the shooting starts and you 
start seeing body bags, a lot of this will stop." 
</P>
<P>
The Suntory Water Group considered exactly that point when it decided not to 
advertise its contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"It was discussed very early on," Somerstein said. "You could spend $100,000 on 
an advertising campaign and tomorrow, the situation could change." 
</P>
<P>
Somerstein cited the Vietnam War -- a conflict that was rarely present in 
advertising. "A company could make a donation and then public support could 
turn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said a product that became too closely allied with a conflict could just as 
easily become tainted by controversy this time around. "When it comes down to 
it, people won't separate the two," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The logistic challenges of organizing giveaway promotions can be formidable. In 
August, the Coca-Cola Co. managed not only to distribute nearly 500,000 cans of 
soda, but delivered them cold and to distant outposts. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerated trucks were sent out crammed with red and white, bilingual 
Arabic-English cans of Coke Classic. Deep in the desert, camouflaged Army 
all-terrain vehicles would rumble up, load a couple of chilled cases and 
disappear over the sandy horizon. For many soldiers, it was the first cold 
beverage they had had in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"They had the same look in their eyes that my family gets whenever I go home," 
one American worker who helped distribute the drink said. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola got a promotional return for the effort, as the program received news 
media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Donaldson, a Coca-Cola spokesman said there was a better payoff than 
laudatory press: "To take a person there and help them, well, you've got a 
lifelong friend. That's clearly a benefit for any company." 
</P>
<P>
Other companies have suffered setbacks as they have discovered that Saudi 
Arabia is not the ideal location to show off a product. Candy bars have melted 
in the 100-plus-degree heat. Beer companies have been stymied because the 
Saudis ban alcoholic beverages. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. had to 
cancel a program offering all military personnel free phone calls to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The program, intended in part to demonstrate a new long-distance service it had 
recently started in Saudi Arabia, proved too popular. Soldiers flocked to every 
available phone. Lines of desert-camouflaged troops gathered at phone booths 
around the country. At a pace of 1,500 GI calls an hour, the long-distance 
system was soon swamped. AT&amp;T was besieged with infuriated Saudia Arabian 
business people, angry that they couldn't dial out of the kingdom.

DRAFT ORDINANCE SPELLS OUT AUTHORITY OF SHERIFF'S REVIEW BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A civilian review board approved by voters to oversee potential misconduct in 
the San Diego County Sheriff's Department should consist of 11 members, include 
four permanent staffers, and might cost as much as $337,000 a year, according 
to a draft county report obtained Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Voters approved creation of the review board last month through Proposition A, 
and county attorneys have drafted an ordinance that county supervisors will 
consider Dec. 11. The ordinance, which details the specific authority of the 
board for the first time, is contained in the draft report. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would give the review panel broad authority to investigate any 
allegation of department misconduct, including use of excessive force, illegal 
search and seizure, false arrest and criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted in its present form, the ordinance would give the board the power to 
review and investigate any death resulting from an action of a sheriff's deputy 
or officer and to recommend discipline to the sheriff. It would also have the 
power to subpoena witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The board also would be permitted to disclose trends regarding department 
misconduct to county supervisors, the chief administrative officer, the sheriff 
and the county's probation officer and be permitted to summarize its 
recommendations and actions each year. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the board that oversees the San Diego police and has no staff, the 
sheriff's review panel would hire a permanent executive officer, a special 
investigator, an administrative secretary and a clerk, according to the draft 
report drawn up by Norman Hickey, the county's chief administrative officer. 
Hickey's recommendations must be approved by the board of supervisors in 
addition to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Hickey recommended that the executive officer be paid $78,000 a year, the 
investigator $52,000, the secretary $26,000 and the clerk $22,000. In addition, 
the board probably will need to spend $24,000 a year on outside counsel, 
$76,500 to $94,500 a year for leased office space, $3,000 to $19,800 a year for 
parking, $7,200 a year for telephones, $3,500 a year for mileage and $10,000 a 
year for office expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity in parking and office rent has to do with whether supervisors 
choose to have the review board offices downtown or in Kearny Mesa, where the 
cost is less. 
</P>
<P>
Hickey will seek volunteers sometime this month and his office will distribute 
application forms throughout the county, the report says. Hickey will nominate 
the membership, probably within 30 days, and supervisors will choose the 
members. 
</P>
<P>
According to the draft application form, members must be "qualified electors of 
San Diego County and should have a reputation for integrity and responsibility, 
and a demonstrated active interest in public affairs and service." 
</P>
<P>
County employees and law enforcement officials would not be eligible. Members 
would have to complete a training course within three months of joining the 
board or be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Four members would serve a three-year term, four would serve two years and 
three would serve a year. When those terms expire, members would serve 
three-year terms. Nobody would serve more than two consecutive terms, and any 
member could be removed by a majority of the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In nominating members, Hickey is expected to reflect "comprehensive 
representation of age, sex, socioeconomic status, racial and ethnic background 
and geographical distribution" of the unincorporated areas and the cities that 
the Sheriff's Department serves. 
</P>
<P>
Members who miss three consecutive meetings could be dismissed and all 
vacancies would be filled within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
The review panel would be required to accept complaints and notify those who 
complain that their allegation has been received and how it has been handled 
once the matter is resolved. Any recommended discipline or opinion could not be 
used in a court action against a law enforcement officer, the proposed 
ordinance says. 
</P>
<P>
The board will keep confidential "any personnel records, citizen complaints . . 
. and information obtained from these records," the proposed ordinance says. 
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Sheriff's Assn., the organization that represents most of the 
department's 1,349 deputies, has threatened to challenge the review panel 
created by Proposition A and has argued that the county never met with 
association members before drafting the ballot language.

FEES FOR TRACT DELAYED AFTER BUYERS PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to protests from residents of a new housing tract, the Simi Valley 
City Council has decided to delay plans enabling a developer to charge the 
property owners $140 a month for services and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 homeowners in the Greenbriar tract, built by Griffin Homes, told the 
council during a public hearing Monday night that the developer had misinformed 
them about the assessment fees. 
</P>
<P>
Had they known that they would have to pay an extra $140 a month for the next 
20 years, they said, referring to the assessment, they never would have bought 
their houses. They said the assessment fee would hurt the resale value of the 
63 houses at the area southwest of Royal Avenue and Corto Street. 
</P>
<P>
"We were totally misinformed," said homeowner Judith Owen. 
</P>
<P>
Owen said Griffin sales representatives told her and her husband Richard that 
there could be an assessment fee to pay for construction of sewers and streets 
but downplayed the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Sales representatives said such a fee would in no way amount to $140 a month, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We told a sales representative that we were uncomfortable . . . and his 
reaction was, 'Don't worry about it . . . it probably won't happen anyway,' " 
Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that if this information had been communicated to any of our 
lenders, we would not have qualified for our home," Owen said. "Therefore I 
believe a direct intent of concealment was made by Griffin Homes. They should 
be held accountable for fraud and deceptive tactics." 
</P>
<P>
"The salespeople obscured the facts," homeowner Tim Hodge said. "They 
misrepresented how much it would cost." 
</P>
<P>
But Charles J. Dragicevich, senior vice president of Griffin Homes, said that 
the developer had acted in good faith and that buyers were aware of the 
possible assessment fee. He said each of the 63 homeowners in the subdivision 
signed a disclosure statement informing them of the potential fee before the 
close of escrow. In some cases, buyers signed a statement months before 
closure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are chagrined this whole thing happened," he said. "Our intent was right 
and honorable. We tried to do everything humanly possible in telling them 
everything we could" about the assessment fee. 
</P>
<P>
Dragicevich said Griffin was willing to reduce the amount each property owner 
would have to pay by $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, the council directed its staff to try to find a way to pare 
down the assessment fees. The council, however, noted that the city entered 
into an agreement with the developer in 1989 to form an assessment district in 
the Greenbriar tract and is limited in what it can do to remedy the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the homeowners should file a lawsuit if they believe that 
the developer misled them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the body that makes those kinds of decisions," Councilman Bill Davis 
said. "We're not a judge. We're not a jury." 
</P>
<P>
The staff is scheduled to report back to the council on the matter at its Dec. 
17 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Greenbriar residents said they will wait to find out what the city 
might do before deciding whether to sue.

AGENCY EMPHASIZES HELP FOR HOMELESS OVER HOLIDAY FRILLS; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: VENTURA'S ONLY ORGANIZATION FOR THOSE WHO LIVE ON THE STREETS 
OFFERS NOURISHMENT, SHOWERS, SUPPORT AND COMPANIONSHIP.

Christmas may be around the corner, but at Project Understanding in Ventura 
you'd never know. There are no trees or decorations, and no Christmas carols to 
be sung. 
</P>
<P>
With resources stretched the thinnest when they are needed the most, the 
biggest Christmas presents that Ventura's only agency for the homeless can 
offer are a shower, a cup of coffee, maybe some takeout food and, most of all, 
support and companionship. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets cold, we definitely have more people here, and they're here 
earlier, waiting to get inside," said Carol Ward, a Project Understanding staff 
member. "With more people here, it's harder to meet people's needs." 
</P>
<P>
So there will be no Christmas celebration at Project Understanding, and the 
street people who feed, clothe and bathe themselves there will be invited to 
attend celebrations elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the homeless are aware that Christmas is coming and it's hard on 
them," said Rick Pearson, the agency's director. "But survival needs today are 
so demanding that planning for Christmas is impossible. Just to continue to do 
what we do all year is as much as we can manage." 
</P>
<P>
Although there might not be enough money to celebrate, the doors will remain 
open Christmas, as they have all year, in the old building of faded white walls 
that used to be a fire station, and is now home to Ventura's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
At Project Understanding, thousands have been helped since the agency opened in 
1977. Financed by a coalition of churches, with help from the city and other 
groups, Project Understanding has served more than 120,000 meals since starting 
a meal program four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has also run a winter shelter for a dozen homeless families 
and helped thousands of others with money, counseling, job referrals and school 
tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
At Christmas time, however, the agency's shortcomings are more evident than its 
successes. For every person that gets help, scores of others are turned away 
because of the agency's limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Every month, we help about 12 or 13 families who are trying to stay off the 
streets," said Pearson, 40, a Methodist minister with a long, red beard and an 
easy, gentle smile. 
</P>
<P>
"But for everyone we help," he added, "we have to turn five or six away." 
</P>
<P>
In the lobby one recent morning, a dozen street people sat in dead silence, 
with trash bags full of rags at their feet. They sipped hot coffee and devoured 
English muffins, saying nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, in the steamy bathrooms, men put on the fresh clothes that they had 
just pulled out of the always busy washing machines. Bathed and clothed, they 
reappeared in the lobby, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
At the pantry in the back room, volunteers Denise Abdun-Nur McBreen and Carlton 
Nebreklievski chatted while they filled hundreds of plastic bags with two 
scoops of oatmeal each. 
</P>
<P>
Every day they hand out a week's food supply to a long line of people. Each 
client gets no more than four packages in one year. 
</P>
<P>
"They have so much dignity," Nebreklievski said. "Did you know one of them came 
to my liquor store last month begging for money and when he recognized me he 
was so embarrassed he never came back again?" 
</P>
<P>
For all their efforts, Pearson said, Project Understanding can't even make a 
dent in the county's homeless population, estimated at 4,000 to 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Powerless to win the war, the agency's volunteers cherish their small 
victories. Rudy Alarcon made his way that morning to Project Understanding -- 
not unlike dozens of other homeless, hungry and poor -- and got a small piece 
of what he needed. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular morning, the 46-year-old Alarcon -- unemployed, and homeless 
for more than 20 years -- was seeking neither food, shelter or money. All he 
was seeking was a little understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Alarcon has been living in his car lately, a beat-up blue Datsun loaded with 
all the little gadgets and mementoes that Alarcon picked up along the way: 
there are three mini-fans hanging atop the windshield; a dozen buttons with 
psychedelic designs pinned to the doors and visors, miniature cars on the 
dashboard, stickers on the roof and a small tape recorder on the steering 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the souvenirs he carried in his car, Alarcon said his life was 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening? Life is what's happening, brother," he told social worker 
Bob Costello. The two men sucked on cigarettes as they leaned against a garbage 
dumpster near the agency's back door. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just learning to live, but it's kind of hard," he continued, encouraged by 
Costello's friendly nod. "Some of us have to drink or take drugs to get through 
it, or steal or cheat -- anything to get through the moment. We're not afraid 
to die, we're afraid to live." 
</P>
<P>
For Costello, who has been helping the homeless for years, Alarcon's confession 
was as unusual as it was encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real pleasure," he said afterward. "A lot of them are too much into 
denial and frustration to take that kind of look at themselves. They don't 
understand why they can't get back to where they once were."

ST. JOHN TO FACE TRIAL IN THEFT OF FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING: SHE IS CHARGED WITH TAKING $178,000. JUDGE SAYS THE CASE AGAINST MAYOR 
BRADLEY'S EX-BUSINESS ASSOCIATE APPEARS WEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Municipal Court judge Tuesday ordered a longtime associate of Mayor Tom 
Bradley to stand trial on charges that she bilked a city-funded Los 
Angeles-Africa trade task force out of $180,000, but warned prosecutors that 
"it would be very difficult at trial to prove this case beyond a reasonable 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Juanita St. John is charged with felony theft of $178,000 from the UCLA-based 
Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, which St. John headed. The city, 
largely at Bradley's behest, gave the task force nearly $400,000 between 1985 
and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
St. John, a San Marino resident, also will be tried on charges that she stole 
$5,000 as treasurer of an anti-genocide group and filed false state tax returns 
from 1985 through 1987. St. John has denied wrongdoing and charged that her 
prosecution is politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge David Doi ordered the trail after a lengthy preliminary 
hearing, but added that he believes the high-profile case appeared weak. 
</P>
<P>
"My only determination is that the (prosecution) is entitled to a trial," Doi 
told Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen S. Licker. "I would suggest it would be very 
difficult at trial to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt." Doi, who 
heard extensive testimony and reviewed voluminous records during the 
much-delayed hearing spanning three months, did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, St. John's lawyer, Victor Sherman, said Doi's comments 
show that the case should be dropped. "I think he said, based on the evidence, 
there's no possible way you can win in front of a jury. . . . Don't waste 
(taxpayer) funds" on a trial," Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Licker said "all of the evidence isn't necessarily presented" at a 
preliminary hearing. The case "wouldn't have been filed if we didn't think we 
could get a conviction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force scandal has figured prominently in the ethics controversy 
surrounding Bradley. The mayor and St. John were partners in a real estate 
venture at the same time that Bradley was lobbying to fund the program. Bradley 
sold his interests earlier this year. Also, St. John hired Bradley's daughter 
at the task force and Bradley hired St. John's daughter at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Outlining his case, prosecutor Licker on Tuesday said St. John, who has a 
history of personal financial problems, stole task force money "to fund her 
private debts (and) daily activities." He cited large, irregular withdrawals 
from task force accounts immediately after annual city grants would arrive each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Licker argued that St. John at times "laundered" her use of task force monies. 
In August, 1985, St. John wrote a $21,000 task force check to "cash," Licker 
said in court papers. She used the check to purchase a $21,000 cashier's check 
at one bank and then went to a second bank to purchase another $21,000 
cashier's check made payable to her mortgage lender, Licker said. 
</P>
<P>
Such actions were "rationally inconsistent" with St. John's claim that she 
merely took salary and reimbursements due her, Licker said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sherman insisted that most of the money St. John allegedly stole was part 
of a $75,000-a-year salary she gave herself. Members of a Bradley-appointed 
task force advisory board testified St. John did a good job and was given a 
free hand in the group's financial affairs, he noted. "She earned her pay. They 
trusted her and she set her salary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman said St. John was at most guilty of sloppy bookkeeping. "So what? 
Where's the fraud? There isn't any," Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
Licker said that a $75,000 salary was nearly twice what St. John was legally 
authorized and that the claim to such a salary was "an attempted cover-up" of 
improper activities. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's arraignment was set for Dec. 12.

BABY-CARE NURSES END 3-DAY SICKOUT; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: COUNTY-USC HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES SAY THEY WILL RESUME JOB ACTION IF 
PROMISES TO CORRECT UNDERSTAFFING ARE NOT KEPT. THE UNIT CARES FOR CRITICALLY 
ILL INFANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A three-day sickout by nurses in the intensive care unit for newborns at 
County-USC Medical Center's Women's Hospital ended Tuesday, although nurses 
said they would resume their job action if hospital officials failed to fulfill 
their promises to correct understaffing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are back to work today as a sign of good faith in the negotiations," Lisa 
Nicholson, a neonatal intensive care unit nurse, said at a news conference. "We 
would like to cooperate with the county." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, standing with three other nurses in front of the hospital, said the 
nurses had obtained a commitment from administrators to meet the state staffing 
standard for neonatal intensive care of one nurse for every two critically ill 
babies. Recently, the ratio has often been one nurse for every four babies. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital plans several steps to help meet the standard, which was 
established because such babies require minute-to-minute care. 
</P>
<P>
These measures include transferring additional babies to private hospitals and 
hiring additional nurses to work on a per diem basis, according to hospital 
administrator Connie Diaz. Some administrative details of transfers will be 
taken care of by non-nursing personnel. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, there were 15 nurses on duty to care for the 30 babies in the unit, 
Nicholson said. "Today it is safe to work in the unit. If the situation becomes 
unsafe tomorrow, we will not be at work." 
</P>
<P>
Said Diaz: "(The nurses) are back. We will deliver on what we promised them." 
</P>
<P>
Nurses said they called in sick to protest working conditions that they believe 
put the lives of newborn babies in jeopardy. They also said they have tried for 
months without success to get officials to correct staffing problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to call attention to a critical situation since January," 
Nicholson said. "We were just fed up." 
</P>
<P>
Women's Hospital is the nation's busiest maternity facility, caring for about 
one of every 200 infants born in the United States. Since 1982, at least 16,000 
babies have been born at the hospital each year. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses said that a ratio of one nurse for every four critically ill babies 
is not only unsafe but is so stressful that it is difficult to hire and retain 
staff. "It is very difficult to watch four babies," Nicholson said. "It is 
nearly impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Babies who are less ill do not require one nurse for every two babies, but most 
of the babies at County-USC fall into the more serious category. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz has not disputed the understaffing, but said the hospital has worked to 
remedy the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses and administrators met Monday afternoon and discussed "tentative ideas 
both short-term and long-term" to alleviate understaffing, Diaz said. They also 
agreed to "meet weekly on an on-going basis" to help prevent the development of 
another "crisis situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, some measures, such as increased use of temporary nurses, may 
require approval of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Current 
personnel policies, which limit the ability to hire such nurses, would have to 
be modified and additional funds for salaries would have to be made available, 
Diaz said.

WELFARE-FRAUD INVESTIGATORS FAIL TO MEET STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego is the only populous county in the state whose welfare-fraud 
investigators fail to meet the minimum state requirements for sworn peace 
officers, casting doubts on the legality of some prosecutions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to meet state standards has left the county in the perilous position of 
having investigators working for the Department of Social Services who might 
have conducted criminal inquiries without legal authority. 
</P>
<P>
A state official also said the county could be exposing itself to civil 
lawsuits by using unqualified investigators to examine welfare-fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is nothing new to local officials. The state has been reminding the 
county Department of Social Services since 1980 of the need to have its 30 
investigators meet the minimum standards. A law passed that year extended peace 
officer status to welfare-fraud investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The department was reminded again in March, 1989, in a memo written by a state 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the county has failed to conduct background checks of its 
investigators, submit their fingerprints to the state Department of Justice and 
FBI for clearance and has failed to subject them to a medical and psychological 
screening. These, and other more routine requirements, are mandated by state 
law for sworn peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Ann Zaid, who supervises the welfare investigators, said Monday she is 
taking steps to make sure each investigator meets those state requirements. 
Zaid, who assumed command of the investigative unit in January, said she does 
not know why the department failed to abide by the law. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognized that we hadn't done the fingerprinting. . . . I saw it as being a 
problem and moved to correct it," Zaid said. "Background checks are also being 
currently done. I can't tell you why it wasn't done in the past. As for 
psychological screenings, we're in the process of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Tibbitts, an official with the Fraud Management Bureau of the state 
Department of Social Service, said that San Diego County's failure to require 
its investigators to meet minimum standards "is indeed unusual." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the law," he said. "Search warrants can only be served by sworn peace 
officers. This could make their warrants defective." 
</P>
<P>
Tibbitts said that sometimes smaller counties, with one or two investigators, 
fail to meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is unheard of in larger counties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Background checks are "especially crucial," said Tibbitts, "because you want to 
know who's working for you when you have him in a job that provides access to 
law enforcement records." 
</P>
<P>
In a June 19, 1985, memorandum made available to The Times, an employee warned 
then-chief investigator Carol Bauer of the agency's continued failure to 
require its investigators to meet minimum state standards. The author, who was 
not The Times' source for the memo, complained that "we may have no more 
authority than private citizens." 
</P>
<P>
"Any investigator not meeting the minimum standards . . . cannot legally sign 
affidavits for search warrants, or serve search warrants; cannot legally 
conduct criminal investigations and may be civilly liable for conducting them 
without having the legal authority to do so," the memo stated. 
</P>
<P>
Several other memos made available to The Times by former investigators 
repeated the warnings. 
</P>
<P>
Several defense attorneys said the county skirted the law by having 
investigators with the district attorney's office sign search warrant 
affidavits in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
Marsha Duggan, who has represented dozens of defendants charged in 
welfare-fraud cases, said she never saw a search warrant affidavit signed by an 
investigator from the county Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
"If there ever was a search, the D.A. investigator usually obtained the search 
warrant. I don't recall ever seeing an affidavit signed by a DSS investigator," 
Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Fear, who supervises welfare-fraud prosecutions, said 
the welfare investigators' failure to meet state standards will not affect any 
past convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"This has no bearing on their ability to interview a witness and gather 
evidence to get a conviction. . . . I don't know where this would void any 
conviction," Fear said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DAIRY QUEEN, ARMED WITH BLIZZARD, HOPES TO SCOOP S.D. ICE 
CREAM MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY

<TEXT>
<P>
At last, an economic trend to cool the mouth and warm the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Dairy Queen, the royalty of ice cream sellers elsewhere in the country, has 
begun a gung-ho assault on San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, there were but two local Dairy Queens: Lakeside and North Park. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are 10, heading to 30 or more by the end of next year. Coming soon to 
a shopping center near you, mostly in North County. 
</P>
<P>
For half a century, Dairy Queen has been a part of rural Americana: summer 
nights, a double scoop of soft vanilla dipped in chocolate, a former homecoming 
queen working behind the counter. 
</P>
<P>
But now International Dairy Queen Inc. of Minneapolis isn't content with 5,206 
stores worldwide and 48% of the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
It wants to bust into suburbs, heretofore the turf of Baskin-Robbins and 
designer ice creams. It figures the market is poised for a backlash to 
Haagen-Dazs, a flight from Frusen Gladje, a return to the heartland. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Bruce Hungate, a Dairy Queen brat (mom and dad own a Dairy Queen in 
Tucson) turned "urban territory operator" for San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
He started a Dairy Queen in Solana Beach two years ago. Since then he has found 
franchisees for Dairy Queens from Pacific Beach to Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
He says he's got a secret weapon: the Blizzard, a scoop that can be smothered 
with all manner of delectables like crushed Oreos, shredded Butterfingers, and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blizzard is the key to the yuppie market," Hungate said. "It's the biggest 
thing to hit Dairy Queen since the invention of the cone." 
</P>
<P>
The franchise-holders in the Carmel Mountain Ranch Town Center are James and 
Solan Ni. I stopped by to research the product. 
</P>
<P>
The Nis also run a Baskin-Robbins in Mira Mesa. They arrived in San Diego seven 
years ago from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Dairy Queen franchisees are recent immigrants who have decided 
their road to the American Dream is paved with ice cream. That's another trend.

there would be a riot if we sent guys up there with the ring cards."

Now, Councilman Ron Roberts wants the $65,000 restored from $300,000 left over 
from the Soviet Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
His move is part politics, part sentiment: Roberts was a School Safety Patrol

JUDGE RELENTS, WILL LET HOMELESS IN FROM COLD; 
</P>
<P>
SHELTER: MIDLAM LIFTS HIS BAN ON USING VISTA COURTHOUSE AS A SHELTER BUT CALLS 
USE 'INAPPROPRIATE.'

<P>
A Superior Court judge has rescinded his order banning the use of the Vista 
courthouse as an emergency homeless shelter Tuesday after receiving assurances 
from county officials about the building's security. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Midlam reversed the decision he made last week after Norman Hickey, the 
county's chief administrative officer, assured the judge Tuesday morning that 
the building will be secure. 
</P>
<P>
"I still maintain, however, that the utilization of this facility (as a 
cold-weather shelter) is inappropriate, and I would hope they would take action 
to reconsider the policy," Midlam said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inconsistent with the whole use of the courthouse," Midlam said. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 homeless people were allowed to spend the night of Nov. 27 at the 
courthouse annex -- a small building with two courtrooms, a coffee shop and 
administrative offices -- as part of the county's cold-weather shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Midlam learned that people were sleeping in the hallways outside 
his courtroom and issued an order banning people who are not county employees 
from the building after 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Midlam said the use of the courthouse as a homeless shelter poses security 
risks, including the exposure of confidential documents and the removal or 
destruction of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Midlam also was angered because no one had told him or the marshal that the 
annex would be used as a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't 'the judge versus the homeless,' my concern is in having unauthorized 
and unsupervised personnel in this facility," Midlam said. 
</P>
<P>
"The things that could happen are so legion and so outweigh the benefits that 
are so minor in relation to the concerns of the homeless," Midlam said. 
</P>
<P>
County counsel, however, advised Hickey on Monday that the Board of Supervisors 
has the right to control access to all county facilities, including the Vista 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Supervisor Brian Bilbray called Midlam's initial order "kind 
of funny," and labeled it "John Duffy-like confrontational politics." 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a lack of communication, that's fine, and you say very sternly 
you don't appreciate not being told about it and make sure it doesn't happen 
again," Bilbray said. "But you give the system a chance to work, to correct the 
problem, before you start trying to burn the house down." 
</P>
<P>
Leon Williams, Board of Supervisors chairman, said in an interview that he was 
unsympathetic to Midlam's position. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me to be totally incomprehensible that such an issue would be 
raised, and there would be an attempt to limit the use of that building," 
Williams said, "especially (by) a judge who's getting a nice fat salary at the 
public's expense." 
</P>
<P>
Midlam said that he has recommended to county staff that the policy on use of 
the courthouse be amended. 
</P>
<P>
Hickey, who could not be reached for comment, stated in a press release that a 
security guard has been on duty when the Vista facility has been used as a 
shelter over the past three years and that "we will continue to ensure that the 
security of the courtrooms in that building is not compromised."

SHERIFF'S SATURATION PATROL PUTS HOLIDAY HEAT ON DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONICA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Sheriff's Department has revived the Saturation Patrol in 
an effort to catch drunk drivers during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, made up of five deputies, will patrol the cities of Solana Beach, Del 
Mar, Encinitas, Vista, San Marcos, Poway, Lemon Grove and Santee, Sheriff's Lt. 
Jim Hartshorn said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which began Monday night, will be in effect between 7 p.m. and 3 
a.m. until Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second year the Sheriff's Department has used this method to catch 
drunk drivers, Hartshorn said. Last year, the program was used in conjunction 
with sobriety checkpoints to determine which method caught more drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Sheriff's Department found that the Saturation Patrol caught 
more drivers than the checkpoints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Checkpoints reduce the number of accidents but do not produce many arrests, 
Hartshorn said. The reason, according to the Sheriff's Department, is that the 
drunk drivers tend to stay off the roads because they have heard of the 
checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies conducting sobriety checks are required to advertise 
in advance that they will conduct the checkpoints as well as announce their 
location an hour before they open, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the checkpoints must be set up so that drivers have a way of 
bypassing them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who get caught are caught because they are so drunk they don't know 
where they are or because they think they can beat the system," Hartshorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Checkpoints "reduce accidents but they don't produce the number of arrests that 
people think," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Saturation Patrol catches more drunk drivers, Hartshorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested for drunk driving will be arrested, booked and have their 
license suspended for 45 days, Hartshorn said. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to make it as difficult as we possibly can" to let drunk drivers 
back on the road, Hartshorn said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies who make up the Saturation Patrol come from different sheriff's 
substations in the cities that will be patrolled, Hartshorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Those deputies have demonstrated an ability to detect the signs of a drunk 
driver, said Hartshorn. 
</P>
<P>
"They are deputies (who) can catch subtle nuances, such as stopping short at a 
stop," he said. "They can catch particular motions, little things that can seem 
insignificant."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : FATHERS OF SLAIN STUDIO GUARDS SUE NEW 
MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fathers of two Universal Studios guards killed by a man accused in the 
previous murders of three people in Albuquerque have filed suit against the New 
Mexico state Department of Public Safety and Albuquerque police. 
</P>
<P>
The wrongful death lawsuit was filed in state court in Albuquerque on behalf of 
the fathers of Armando Torres and Jeren Beeks. 
</P>
<P>
The two were shot to death by Nathan Trupp at the movie studio in Universal 
City while New Mexico officials were looking for Trupp in connection with three 
murders at an Albuquerque bagel shop. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that the Albuquerque Police Department, the Public Safety 
Department and their officers failed to share information in a timely fashion, 
which would have led to Trupp's arrest before he left Albuquerque. City Atty. 
David Campbell said his office would mount a vigorous defense. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Trupp, 43, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the Universal 
Studios slayings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'WASTEMAKER' PRIZE GIVEN ALLEGED POOR 
PACKAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that Christmas has become nothing more than garbage-giving, several 
environmental groups this week issued "Wastemaker" awards to nine manufacturers 
for over-packaging their products. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items cited as contributing to the nation's garbage crisis were 
Calvin Klein "Obsession" gift sets, Nintendo Trophy Figure with Scorecard and 
Matchbox Super Color Changers. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 180 million tons of garbage generated every year, one-third of that is 
packaging," said Julie Duncan, spokeswoman for the California Public Interest 
Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of environmental organizations issued the quarterly awards in Los 
Angeles, San Diego, Washington and a dozen other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The other six products named were Sears Christmas ornaments, Saranac football 
gloves, Smooshees Smugglers, "Holiday Enchantment" cassette tape set, Drakkar 
Noir cosmetics gift set and Carlton Cards wrap and trim ensemble.

LEASING DEAL NEAR FOR OIL-SPILL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director of the Port of Hueneme and oil industry officials completed 
negotiations Tuesday on leasing 6.6 acres at the port to become the nation's 
first regional center for the cleanup of a major oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we shook hands on an agreement," said Port Director Anthony Taormina, 
who negotiated the terms with the Marine Spill Response Corp. The corporation, 
financed by a consortium of big oil companies, decided to pour $60 million into 
the Port of Hueneme and millions of dollars into four other regional centers to 
improve their oil-cleanup abilities. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the port's commissioners and an oil-industry governing board, a 
92,000-square-foot building and three acres of staging area will be the site of 
the oil industry-financed Regional Response Center for the Pacific Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
The response center would have equipment and crews capable of handling a 
216,000-barrel oil spill, about the size of the spill caused by the Exxon 
Valdez in Alaska last year. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation has negotiated a 20-year lease with an option for another 
10-year lease on the property, Taormina said. He declined to give specifics on 
the agreement. KENNETH R. WEISS

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 6 MONTHS IN TOXIC DUMPING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former president of a toxic-waste treatment firm was sentenced this week to 
six months in prison for illegally transporting 400 drums of hazardous waste 
and dumping them at a defunct mill in a small Nevada town. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon imposed the sentence and a $28,000 fine on 
Michael Robert Speach, who was convicted Sept. 26 of 15 environmental crimes 
stemming from the dumping of the 55-gallon drums in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had sought a two-year prison term, partially as a deterrent against 
toxic-waste dumping. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the crimes, Speach was president ENV Inc. of Rancho Dominguez. 
The company treated electroplating waste for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
One of the materials in the sludge was chromium, which can cause kidney 
problems. Cadmium and other suspected carcinogens also were found at the site.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : DISQUALIFIED TRACK WINNER GETS $500,000 
FROM JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury has awarded $500,000 to an unemployed Carlsbad man who won a 
million-dollar jackpot at Hollywood Park five years ago, only to be 
disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
The jury agreed last week with a lawyer for Rudolfo Sahagun that Hollywood Park 
officials had made a fool of Sahagun when they disqualified him after earlier 
bringing him and his family to the racetrack winner's circle in front of 45,000 
race fans and presenting them a with a ceremonial check. 
</P>
<P>
The money was to have been paid out over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, David Glickman, acknowledged that Sahagun had broken the contest 
rules by submitting more than one entry. Glickman said Sahagun did so because 
he saw others picking extra entry forms up off the floor and entering them, and 
because he did not read the rules on the form.

BILL BOYARSKY: HOW TO WIN BY SIMPLY STAYING QUIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes in politics, you can win by keeping quiet. 
</P>
<P>
That's the story of the surprise approval by Los Angeles County voters last 
month of Proposition C, increasing the sales tax from 6 1/2% to 7%. The 
increase, which goes into effect April 1, is expected to bring in more than 
$400 million a year for commuter rail lines, bus service and highway 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
You may not have been aware that Proposition C was a tax increase until you 
looked at the ballot in the polling place. If so, you were a victim of the 
campaigners' strategy: Campaign managers usually beg for news coverage. Here, 
the game was just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase itself was hatched in the Los Angeles City Hall office of 
Mayor Tom Bradley. Bradley took the proposal to the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, which voted in August to put it on the November 
ballot. It went on the ballot clearly labeled tax increase. But that's just 
about the only time you saw that ugly phrase. 
</P>
<P>
Credit the campaign strategy team of Paul Mandabach and Richard Maullin for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Maullin, a pollster, is the political radar for Neil Peterson, executive 
director of the transportation commission. Peterson hires Maullin to sample 
public opinion before he makes an important move. For instance, Maullin's polls 
showing that the public was worried about security helped persuade Peterson to 
use sheriff's deputies, rather than the Rapid Transit District police, to guard 
the new Long Beach-to-Los Angeles Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
Maullin began in politics with Jerry Brown's campaign for governor in 1974. He 
was a mysterious presence then, lurking the background, avoiding the press, one 
of the conspiratorial young Brownies who felt the best thing to do with 
reporters was mislead them. 
</P>
<P>
Mandabach is comfortable with that approach. He's an advocate of the new "no 
coverage" school of campaign management. No press conferences. No phone calls 
to reporters, cajoling them to write a story. No publicity handouts. 
</P>
<P>
If there had been press conferences, Mandabach explained to me this week, "in 
every story, the reporter would have mentioned it was a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
The long, cluttered ballot helped, as did the absence of any substantial 
organized opposition. Mandabach and Maullin anticipated, correctly, that the 
press wouldn't have the time, the space or the resources to give the 
Proposition C campaign much attention. Instead, they conveyed their campaign 
message through television commercials that didn't mention taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"By voting yes on Proposition C, we'll soon have over 300 miles of passenger 
rail," one ad proclaimed. It then flashed a map showing rail lines extending 
into the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys, traditional havens of 
anti-government spending sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than calling up her old political reporter pals, campaign publicist 
Bobbie Metzger worked up articles for the newsletters of organizations backing 
Proposition C, such as the League of Women Voters, the Sierra Club and the Los 
Angeles County Federation of Labor. Such newsletters are important in today's 
low-turnout elections, when victory often goes to those who get their 
supporters to the polls. That was certainly true with Proposition C, which won 
by just 14,502 votes. 
</P>
<P>
It's expensive campaigning, but business was happy to supply most of the $1.5 
million raised for the effort. Among the donors were the Southern Pacific and 
Santa Fe railroads. They had hundreds of miles of rights of way they wanted to 
sell to the transportation commission for commuter rail lines. And they had 
large landholdings around the rights of way, bound to increase in value because 
of commuter rails. Also contributing were corporations downtown that needed to 
bring workers in from distant suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
The "no coverage" strategy wasn't the only reason for Proposition C's victory. 
A similar measure was approved by a substantial margin in Orange County, 
indicating voters are sick of gridlock. But looking at the closeness of the Los 
Angeles County vote, it's hard to argue that the quiet that enveloped the 
campaign didn't make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
I know this won't be much consolation to you when you start paying the higher 
tax in April. I'm sure you would have liked to have had the information before 
the election. If you had understood the Maullin-Mandabach team, you might have 
voted against Proposition C. 
</P>
<P>
But I couldn't write a column about this before the election. They fooled me, 
too. You see, there were so many other races, so much to write about, all those 
ballot measures. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And nobody from Proposition C ever called me. How was I to know?

SITE SUGGESTED FOR RECYCLING PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oxnard agriculture field is the best location for a $20-million recycling 
center and sewage sludge composting plant, an environmental study released 
Tuesday says. 
</P>
<P>
The field, south of Sturgis Road between Rice Road and Del Norte Boulevard, is 
the best of four sites evaluated for a 30-acre to 50-acre facility to handle up 
to 850 tons of waste a day, said Wayne Bruce, manager of the Ventura Regional 
Sanitation District. 
</P>
<P>
When it is operating in 1993, the plant could recycle waste from the cities of 
Oxnard, Camarillo, Port Hueneme, Santa Paula and Fillmore, Bruce said. But so 
far, no cities have contracted with the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the cities have the attitude that they want to keep their options 
open," Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
The cities are reluctant to commit to the recycling center until they have more 
information, Camarillo City Manager J. William Little said. 
</P>
<P>
"Until they come up with cost figures, neither we nor anyone else can commit," 
Little said. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Sanitation District, a public agency governed by a board of 
elected officials from member cities, is expected to decide whether to buy 
property in February, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
At the center, trucks will dump their loads into a large building where the 
waste will be sorted by hand to remove cardboard, metals, glass, plastic, yard 
waste and other recyclable material. The remainder will be trucked to the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The center will also include an area where sewage sludge is dried out and mixed 
with yard wastes to be used as mulch. JOANNA M. MILLER

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MAN ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN WIFE'S 
MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A municipal court judge in Victorville on Tuesday ordered a La Canada 
Flintridge man to stand trial in the murder of his wife, whose charred body was 
found Sept. 13 in a remote desert area west of Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John B. Gibson ordered Donald Miralle, 46, bound over for trial after a 
two-day preliminary hearing in which prosecutors presented evidence that tread 
marks and footprints found near the body matched tires and tennis shoes owned 
by Miralle. 
</P>
<P>
Tessie Miralle, 49, disappeared after she went to her husband's office in 
Pasadena on Sept. 12. Her body was discovered while it was still burning early 
the next morning. Defense attorneys challenged the identity of the body and 
said all of the evidence linking Don Miralle to the crime is circumstantial.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening statements began Tuesday in the trial of an ex-convict who 
investigators say is responsible for a crime rampage that terrorized East San 
Diego residents in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Lucious, 30, is being tried on 12 felony counts stemming from attacks 
on three residences, including one in which a 64-year-old woman was raped. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Josephine Kiernan detailed for the jury the crimes Lucious 
allegedly committed. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the rape, Lucious is charged with one count of attempted rape in an 
attack on the same woman, one count of assault with the intent to rape, three 
counts of residential robbery with the use of a gun, one count of attempted 
residential robbery, four counts of residential burglary with the use of a gun, 
one count of false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Kiernan said DNA testing will reveal that Lucious was the man who raped a woman 
in her neighbor's house while the neighbor was forced to lie on the floor in 
another room. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious had been freed after serving eight years of a 14-year sentence for 
similar crimes only six weeks before the crime spree in the Oak Park area of 
East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail, and his trial is expected to 
last well into the new year.

DOG TRIGGERS BOMB SCARE AT AIR STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Miramar Naval Air Station entrance was closed and nearby homes were evacuated 
for more than an hour Tuesday when a military police dog signaled its handler 
that a civilian car contained explosives, a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that the dog had a 100% reliability rate for substance detection and 
that the dog's signal is considered unusual, explosive-disposal experts were 
brought in from North Island about 12:45 p.m. to search the car, Chief Petty 
Officer Bobbie Carleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy personnel closed Miramar's north entrance and evacuated eight duplexes 
housing military families during the 80-minute search, which revealed no 
explosive material. 
</P>
<P>
"The sensitivity of these type of detection dogs is very high, so residue from 
an explosive substance on the seat of the car, for example, would have caused 
that dog to alert," Carleton said. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old German shepherd was stationed at the gate as part of a 
periodically conducted random search for drugs, contraband, explosives and 
stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
The car, which belongs to a woman visiting the base, had recently been stolen 
and recovered, Carleton said.

VETERAN HIKER, 75, DIES AFTER FALL FROM MOUNTAIN TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, 75-year-old John Dicmas, a retired hydraulic engineer from Arcadia, 
hiked the mountain trails in Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Tuesday that a misstep during one of those hikes may have led 
to his death. 
</P>
<P>
"The mountains are not always friendly," Dicmas' wife, Mary, said Tuesday. "But 
he enjoyed them for years." 
</P>
<P>
Dicmas died Monday after he apparently stumbled on a mountain trail and fell 
250 feet down a steep slope, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
He was found at the bottom of a rocky slope near the Chantry Flat picnic area 
and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Dicmas, a native of Pomona, left his Arcadia home to go hiking about 10 a.m. 
Monday. When he had not returned by dark, his wife contacted the Sierra Madre 
Police Department, which brought in the Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team. 
</P>
<P>
About 10:30 p.m., a search party combing the Upper Winter Creek Trail, which 
leads to Mt. Wilson, saw Dicmas' yellow cap at the bottom of a slope next to 
the trail, said John Inskeep, operations leader of the search and rescue team. 
They found Dicmas' body near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we piece it together, he fell only about 150 yards from the start of 
the trail," Inskeep said. "He was probably walking on the trail and misstepped. 
He must have begun to tumble. If he had slid, he probably would have survived, 
because there were shrubs and rocks to grab on to." 
</P>
<P>
Although investigators determined that Dicmas' death was accidental, the Los 
Angeles County coroner had not ruled on the cause of death by late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have said the U.S. Forest Service, which administers the national 
forest, has been negligent in not posting signs to indicate hazards. Dozens of 
people are injured every year in accidents in the mountains, ranging from falls 
to exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service representatives have said signs are ineffective and subject to 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Inskeep said the spot where Dicmas fell was not particularly hazardous, 
although it was at a bend in the trail. "I think he was probably looking at 
something else or just not paying attention," Inskeep said. "Maybe he was 
getting something to eat. It looked like he was carrying his hat and some candy 
in his hand."

CITY, DEVELOPER NEAR ACCORD ON NEW PLAN FOR FRYMAN CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: MAYOR BRADLEY'S OFFICE IS GUARDEDLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT LONG-SOUGHT 
PURCHASE IN WHICH 10 ACRES OF CITY PROPERTY WOULD BE PART OF AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley's office expressed guarded optimism Tuesday that agreement is 
near on its new plan to save Fryman Canyon in Studio City from development by 
buying it for an estimated $10.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
That figure includes the value of 10 acres of prime city real estate that would 
be given to the developer as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency, 
Monday rejected one key provision of the plan to buy the 63-acre canyon but 
made a counteroffer to keep alive the often stormy negotiations with the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
The action was the latest development in the monthslong effort by city 
officials and environmental activists to block plans to build 26 luxury homes 
in the woodsy canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, conservancy executive director, said late Monday that the 
compensation package that a city-conservancy-private sector coalition is 
willing to pay for the canyon, located just west of Laurel Canyon and north of 
Mulholland Drive, "is no longer in dispute." 
</P>
<P>
The key sticking point is the timing of payments to developer Fred Sahadi, 
Edmiston and city officials said. Edmiston called this a major issue, but 
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani expressed confidence that it can be bridged. The 
mayor's office is "guardedly optimistic," Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy is willing to contribute $6.75 million toward the purchase 
price. The parks agency wants to defer payment of $2 million for six months 
after the conclusion of the deal, Edmiston and Fabiani said. Sahadi has been 
willing to accept a delayed payment of only $1.5 million, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the $500,000 difference will be a deal-breaker is unclear. Neither 
Sahadi nor his attorney, Neil Papiano, could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The compensation package for Sahadi includes $8.95 million in cash and the 
transfer of title to Sahadi of four city-owned properties valued at $1.2 
million, including a five-acre site in Woodland Hills, a four-acre site in 
Calabasas Highlands and two sites in Pacific Palisades. The city-owned 
property, all unused land belonging to the Department of Water and Power, is in 
the Santa Monica Mountains and suitable for development. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP lands were the latest ingredient added to the negotiations and 
represented a major decision by the city to put more of its own money into the 
deal after acquisition talks had been stalled for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
They may represent a concession by the developer, Fabiani said. "He's gambling 
on a roll of the dice by taking these properties," he said. "If he's right and 
the real estate market rebounds and he doesn't run into any zoning problems, 
they could be worth more. But if he isn't . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said the developer apparently would seek to develop the four parcels. 
Fabiani said the city was not guaranteeing Sahadi that he would get the needed 
zoning or building permits. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made no such representations to him whatsoever," Fabiani said. He also 
said the $1.2-million value he put on the properties was based on a "full-blown 
analysis" by DWP, but he did not know if the land had been formally appraised.

CRANE HITS OVERPASS AND CLOSURE TIES UP FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rush hour traffic was snarled for hours on the Golden State and Simi Valley 
freeways Tuesday because a large earth excavator on a transporter truck hit an 
overpass in Sun Valley, seriously damaging the structure, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was traveling south on the Golden State Freeway at the junction with 
the Hollywood Freeway shortly after 2:30 p.m. when it hit an overpass, knocking 
off pieces of concrete, CHP Officer Howard Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
All but one lane of the southbound Golden State Freeway were closed at the 
junction. 
</P>
<P>
The transition road leading from the northbound Hollywood to the northbound 
Golden State Freeway was closed to keep motorists off the damaged overpass. 
</P>
<P>
Southbound traffic on the Golden State Freeway backed up for about three miles 
and was diverted to the southbound Hollywood Freeway, while motorists on the 
northbound Hollywood freeway were diverted at Sheldon Street to relieve 
congestion, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway was also congested for about a 
mile west of the juncture with the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver, Marty Thurmon, said he was transporting a 75-ton shovel for 
construction excavations from Sacramento to San Juan Capistrano when it slammed 
into the overpass while the truck was traveling about 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Thurmon said he had a Caltrans permit to travel that route, indicating that the 
load was not too tall for the overpasses on it, and added that no signs were 
posted near the overpass specifying height restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said she did not know if Thurmon had been 
issued a permit to carry the load or if signs with height information were 
posted. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had a permit, he would have known what areas to avoid. . . . I don't 
know what information the driver had," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tiritilli said she had no estimate of the cost of the damage.

SALVADORANS' EVICTION FROM CHURCH STIRS DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: MORE THAN 200 WERE REMOVED FROM LA PLACITA AFTER A SECURITY GUARD WAS 
ASSAULTED. SOME PARISHIONERS QUESTION THE MERITS OF A LONGSTANDING POLICY 
OFFERING SANCTUARY TO REFUGEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A weekend fracas at Los Angeles' oldest church that resulted in the eviction of 
more than 200 Salvadorans and the torching of a church member's car has 
invigorated debate over whether the church should serve as a sanctuary for 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadorans were evicted from Our Lady Queen of Angels Church, known as La 
Placita, Saturday night after two of them assaulted an armed security guard. A 
car belonging to a church choir member was set afire in the ensuing squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
La Placita officials said it was the first time they could recall that the 
church turned away refugees. Fewer than 30 spent the night in a church 
basement. 
</P>
<P>
The evictions and vandalism have stirred debate among parishioners over the 
church's future. Some church members believe that the political activism 
espoused at La Placita is being taken advantage of by criminals who prey on 
fellow Salvadoran homeless seeking refuge at the church. 
</P>
<P>
Father Luis Olivares declared the church a sanctuary from U.S. immigration 
authorities. The former pastor used La Placita as a platform to espouse liberal 
causes, including opposition to U.S. involvement in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy, according to some at the church, has set parishioner against 
parishioner. 
</P>
<P>
"The church no longer wants to help Salvadorans," charged parishioner Camilo 
Castillo, a Salvadoran refugee. "They don't understand what's really going on. 
We believe the church should be with the people, the poor -- not with the 
rich." 
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-born parishioner, a longtime worshiper at La Placita who asked that his 
name not be used, retorted: 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need the violence that has occurred here recently. Salvadorans come 
to Los Angeles and they try to get as much (money) as they can for their 
families over there. But their efforts do not help La Placita. My heart says 
that La Placita has always and will always help everybody, not just the 
refugees." 
</P>
<P>
Some accuse the church's new pastor, Father Albert Vazquez, of wanting to 
rescind the church's sanctuary declaration to appease some longtime 
parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
"That's absolutely not true," Vazquez said Tuesday. "We cannot close our eyes 
to the homeless and others." 
</P>
<P>
The incident Saturday night prompted rumors that some Salvadoran activists 
would take over a Mass the next day to make a political statement about La 
Placita. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover did not occur, but the rumor has forced the public discussion of 
La Placita's future. 
</P>
<P>
Some parishioners believe that the continuing problem of violence at the church 
-- two homicides reported near La Placita in the last three years and the 
continual confiscation of weapons from some refugees -- is linked to the 
church's declaration of sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Olivares' intentions were good and honorable," one Latino parishioner 
said. "However, somebody took advantage of it. A bad element." 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran refugee Castillo said the refugees are being used as scapegoats for 
the violence. "Most of the men are good, honest," he said. "They are trying to 
escape violence, not create it." 
</P>
<P>
"I am between a rock and a hard place," said Vazquez, who became pastor in 
July. "I admire him (Olivares). He is a visionary. But the Salvadorans do not 
feel they have the voice that they had before. I am not Luis. I am my own man 
and Luis isn't me." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares, who is awaiting reassignment after being diagnosed as having AIDS, 
could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.

<P>
A Thousand Oaks man has been convicted in Los Angeles federal court of robbing 
two banks, including one in Simi Valley, the FBI announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffery Scott Taylor, 31, pleaded guilty Monday to robbing the Fidelity Federal 
Bank on the 5700 block of Los Angeles Avenue in Simi Valley of $2,895, and a 
Home Federal Bank in La Canada Flintridge of $319. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was indicted in three other recent robberies in Santa Barbara, Pasadena 
and Calabasas, but the government dismissed those charges, following Taylor's 
guilty plea, said Gary G. Auer, head of the Ventura office of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 4 by U.S. District Judge Robert M. 
Takasugi. He faces a possible 20-year maximum prison sentence. MAJA RADEVICH

SOVIET CLAIMS POLICE SCARED HIM INTO CONFESSING TO KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Soviet army deserter on trial for murder testified Tuesday that he told 
police he killed Estonian activist Viivi Piirisild because he was afraid he 
would be beaten as he was by the KGB in his native country. 
</P>
<P>
Tauno Waidla, 23, said he told Los Angeles police detectives what he thought 
they wanted to hear during interviews a month after Piirisild, 52, was 
discovered beaten and stabbed to death in her North Hollywood home in July, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Waidla, who was hailed as a hero when he defected from the Soviet army in 1986, 
is accused of helping to kill Piirisild because she threw him out of her house 
and refused to support him any longer. Waidla lived in the Piirisild house 
doing odd jobs in exchange for room and board for nearly a year before the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
He faces the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Waidla, arrested after Piirisild's death on charges of illegally crossing the 
U.S.-Canadian border, said he repeated the police version of Piirisild's death 
because he thought he would be beaten if he refused. 
</P>
<P>
He testified in San Fernando Superior Court that he was interrogated at least 
three times by the Soviet secret police in his native Estonia for his 
involvement in anti-Soviet demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the interrogations lasted several days and he was "beaten up 
several times and my arm was broken." 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not understand completely what was happening during interviews 
with Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
"They said I'm in trouble and they're going to hang me," he said. "When the KGB 
says something like that, it flashed in my mind that it was going to happen. . 
. I thought they were really going to hang me."

Despite the taped admission, Waidla has denied any part in the death, saying he 
was traveling across the United States when Piirisild was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Waidla and Peter Sakarias, 23, were received with open arms by the Estonian 
communities in Los Angeles and New York after their arrival in the United 
States. But the men outstayed their welcome, living off the generosity of their 
countrymen and becoming combative when support was cut off, according to 
members of the Estonian community. 
</P>
<P>
Sakarias, against whom murder charges are pending, was judged mentally 
incompetent to stand trial in Piirisild's death and was sent to Atascadero 
State Hospital.

GUNMAN KILLED IN HOUSE; 2 OTHERS HELD

A Canoga Park man shot and killed one of three men armed with shotguns who 
forced their way into his house, detectives said Tuesday, and two suspected 
accomplices were later arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified as Minooei Pat Farjad, 19. He was fatally shot 
Monday night by a 30-year-old resident of a house in the 8500 block of 
Fullbright Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the names of the resident or the two men arrested 
Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Officers recovered a shotgun and a car allegedly used in the incident. The two 
suspected gunmen could face charges of murder in addition to attempted armed 
robbery because the crime resulted in a death, Lt. Harvie Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting appeared to be justified, but detectives were still investigating 
what appeared to be a botched residential robbery, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident took place on a quiet street at the house of two men who worked in 
construction and also repaired race cars on the property, police said. About 
10:30 p.m. Monday, three men carrying shotguns confronted a visitor as he 
walked from the house to a mobile home parked in front to retrieve clothing, 
Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen told the visitor that they would kill him if he did not let them 
into the house, and he said he would comply, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
"He made enough noise that he tipped off his friends inside to what was going 
on," Eubank said. "One of them armed himself with a .38-caliber weapon." 
</P>
<P>
As the visitor led the gunmen into the house, he saw his friend standing in the 
hallway with the handgun and dropped to the floor, police said. The resident 
fired six shots, killing Farjad with a single shot to the head, police said, 
and the other assailants fled in a black Mustang without firing a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not say where the two men were arrested or how investigators 
tracked them down. But Eubank said the suspects and the car matched 
descriptions given by witnesses. He said the shooting did not appear to be 
gang-related.

FATHERS OF SLAIN UNIVERSAL STUDIOS GUARDS SUE POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fathers of two Universal Studios guards, who were killed by a man also 
accused of slaying three people at an Albuquerque bagel shop, have filed suit 
against the New Mexico Department of Public Safety and the Albuquerque Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The wrongful death lawsuit was filed in New Mexico state district court last 
week on behalf of Esperio Torres and John Beeks, the fathers of studio guards 
Armando Torres and Jeren Beeks. The guards were shot to death by Nathan Trupp 
while New Mexico officials were looking for Trupp in connection with the bagel 
shop killings. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends Albuquerque police, the Public Safety Department and their 
officers failed to share information in a timely fashion, and that doing so 
would have led to Trupp's arrest before he left Albuquerque. It also said 
Albuquerque police failed to notify other agencies, including the FBI, of 
Trupp's escape from Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
The guards' fathers asked unspecified damages for pain and trauma suffered by 
their sons, as well as compensation for economic loss, medical and funeral 
expenses and the loss of their sons' lives. 
</P>
<P>
Defendants named in the lawsuit are the state and city law enforcement 
agencies; Robert VanderHee, an agent with the state department's Special 
Investigation Division in Albuquerque; Albuquerque Police Sgt. Ruth Lowe and 
former Albuquerque police chief Sam Baca. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp, 43, in May was found innocent of murder by reason of insanity and 
committed to a California hospital for the mentally disordered. Authorities 
said Trupp told them he went to Universal Studios because he wanted to kill 
actor Michael Landon, and that God told him to kill the security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Albuquerque City Atty. David Campbell said his office would vigorously defend 
the Police Department, Lowe and Baca. 
</P>
<P>
"To say that we are responsible for any subsequent acts of a criminal if we do 
not stop that criminal before he flees the jurisdiction has never been the law, 
and would be a devastating precedent for law enforcement," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gardenhire, chief counsel for the Department of Public Safety, said the 
office is reviewing the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"We deny wrongdoing and we will adamantly defend our actions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp was accused of gunning down bagel shop operators Jeanne Wilt, 37; her 
husband, Richard Wilt, 39; and father, Joseph Famiglietta Sr., 63, on Nov. 29, 
1988, and fleeing on foot. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit said that on the afternoon of the killings, VanderHee received a 
phone call from the owner of an Albuquerque gun shop. The suit said the caller 
told VanderHee that a man matching the killer's description had purchased a 
.38-caliber handgun the day before, and gave VanderHee Trupp's name and 
address. 
</P>
<P>
VanderHee called Albuquerque police with the information, but was unable to 
reach Lowe or Sgt. Desi Garcia, according to the lawsuit. He left messages for 
both officers and then went home, the lawsuit said. Albuquerque police officers 
did not get the information until the next day.

'OPERATION SMOKER' NETS POLLUTERS AT SAN YSIDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNICE HIRABAYASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to clean up the noxious air that often envelopes the San Ysidro 
border crossing, drivers of cars that spew too much exhaust were issued 
citations Tuesday as they entered the United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Customs Service inspectors ordered 292 vehicles to pull into an inspection 
lot, where state law enforcement officers waited, said Customs spokeswoman 
Bobbie Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers were singled out because their cars were emitting smoke or because 
the driver didn't have proper identification or vehicle registration. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol and the state Department of Motor Vehicles issued 
more than 160 citations during the crackdown, which was held from 6 a.m. to 
noon, Cassidy said. Sixteen were for excessive exhaust only, and the rest were 
for excessive exhaust and other vehicle violations, including expired 
registration tags and failure to show proof of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Many cars entering the United States from Mexico do not meet U.S. emissions 
standards and are major contributors to the growing air pollution problem in 
San Ysidro, Cassidy said. The pollution is concentrated at the 24-lane San 
Ysidro Port of Entry, where one out of four cars waited more than 25 minutes to 
get through in September. Workers suffered from nausea, headaches, runny eyes 
and noses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Customs inspectors can check a license plate number against a 
computerized database to see if a vehicle has been reported stolen or involved 
in a crime, the database has no information about vehicle code violations, so 
inspectors can't check for outstanding citations, Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
After a vehicle code violation is issued, it is up to the courts and the 
district attorney to deal with the offender. A CHP spokesman said the citations 
for excessive exhaust require a court appearance and proof that the problem has 
been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time that the three agencies got together for "Operation 
Smoker," said Customs spokesman Jim Brown. The first was in October, and more 
sessions are planned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a constant problem," he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW JET CURB SOUGHT AT VAN NUYS AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Van Nuys Airport Advisory Council voted Tuesday to urge Los Angeles city 
officials to bar any new jets from being based at the airport. . 
</P>
<P>
Members of the advisory group said they want the Board of Airport Commissioners 
to enact the recommended moratorium to halt a decade-long trend at the airfield 
of corporate jets displacing piston-engine craft favored by recreational 
fliers. 
</P>
<P>
The council members blamed jets for increasing airport noise and for squeezing 
out many of the weekend fliers who formerly used the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials say that since 1979, the number of jets based at the airport 
rose from 18 to 93 and the number of piston-engine planes dropped from 1,333 to 
771. 
</P>
<P>
Business operators at the airport say they expect the proportion of jets to 
continue to grow because renting and servicing jets is more profitable than 
catering to owners of piston-engine craft.

EU, SUPPORTERS FINED $20,000 FOR REPORTS FILED 2 YEARS LATE

<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission imposed a $20,000 fine Tuesday on 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu and supporters for filing campaign finance 
reports more than two years late. 
</P>
<P>
Eu, who is in charge of the state agency that oversees elections and monitors 
campaign funds, agreed to pay the fine for violating financial disclosure laws 
during her 1986 reelection campaign but said she did not deliberately break the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Eu said she was not aware that a group of supporters in San Francisco, the Bay 
Area Asians to Re-Elect March Fong Eu Committee, failed to file campaign 
finance reports on time. 
</P>
<P>
"When I discovered the deficiencies, I immediately directed that the statements 
be filed," Eu said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has an absolute right to full and timely disclosure of campaign 
contributions and expenditures and I have taken steps to ensure that the 
problems experienced by this committee will not be repeated by any committee 
with which I may be associated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission fined Eu, her San Francisco campaign committee and its 
treasurer, Catherine Lee, for waiting until early 1989 to report $40,000 in 
donations and $37,000 in expenditures for 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Eu (as secretary of state) is responsible for imposing fines against 
committees that fail to file timely campaign statements," the commission said 
in a statement. "As such, she should have been well aware of the importance of 
these requirements and taken steps to ensure that (her committee) complied with 
the requirements." 
</P>
<P>
The fine is the second imposed by the political watchdog agency against Eu this 
year. Last February, the commission imposed an $8,000 fine against the Friends 
of March Fong Eu Committee for campaign reporting violations. 
</P>
<P>
During her recent reelection campaign, Eu was accused by her Republican rival 
of reducing fines for a variety of political figures and businesses as well as 
cutting fines levied against her own campaign committee. Eu did not dispute the 
charge, but she said she routinely reduced fines when violations were 
unintentional.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY ACTS TO EASE AEROSPACE JOB CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved two measures Tuesday aimed 
at easing the blow of defense industry cutbacks on the economy of the San 
Fernando Valley and other defense-reliant communities. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors voted to apply for a $120,000 federal grant to determine why 
contractors are leaving Los Angeles and to consolidate job hunting and 
retraining assistance to the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
They also instructed the county Economic Roundtable to join with the county's 
Aerospace Task Force to study the possible conversion of former defense 
industry plants into centers for civilian science research. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is part of a fund for sudden and severe economic dislocation. The 
county application cites the closure of the Lockheed plant in Burbank, 
elimination of 150 jobs at McDonnell Douglas in Palmdale and extensive layoffs 
at Douglas Aircraft Co. in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
As part of county efforts, Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman recommended that a 
panel of experts from universities, aerospace firms and development agencies 
determine the areas of research in which Los Angeles County is a national or 
regional leader. The information could be used to develop a science park or for 
such ideas as putting former defense industries to work on mass transit 
systems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless surplus research and advanced manufacturing resources are converted to 
civilian applications, competitive strength of the Los Angeles region will 
diminish," Edelman said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TWO GROUPS HONORED FOR PRESERVATION WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two groups involved in preservation of the Santa Monica Mountains have been 
honored by California parks officials for their "outstanding volunteer efforts" 
to protect the state's natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The Mountains Restoration Trust and Santa Monica Mountains chapter of the 
California Native Plant Society were among 37 groups, individuals and 
corporations that received "Take Pride in California" awards at ceremonies in 
Sacramento earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1981, the Malibu-based restoration trust is involved in land 
acquisition and preservation and in public education. It manages the 650-acre 
Cold Creek Canyon Preserve in the Santa Monica Mountains and has acquired 1,272 
acres of mountain land. 
</P>
<P>
The native plant society is made up of amateur and professional botanists 
interested in protection of California's native plants. 
</P>
<P>
MCA/Universal Inc. in Universal City also was honored for efforts to educate 
employees and the general public about the environment through a recycling 
program and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
The annual awards program is co-sponsored by the California Department of Parks 
and Recreation and the American Express Philanthropic Program. The state award 
recipients will also be considered for national "Take Pride in America" awards.

ONE OF 'NEA FOUR' ARTISTS BRINGS MONOLOGUE TO SUSHI; 
</P>
<P>
REJECTION: PERFORMANCE ARTIST SAYS CONTROVERSIAL DENIAL OF FUNDING HAS MADE 
ATMOSPHERE FOR HER WORK "HORRIBLE."

<P>
Holly Hughes does not enjoy the expectations that go along with being branded a 
member of the "NEA Four." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who will present her monologue, "World Without End," at Sushi 
Performance Gallery from Thursday through Dec. 16, has been working in what she 
calls "a horrible, horrible atmosphere" since the summer of 1989 when the 
National Endowment for the Arts Chairman John E. Frohnmayer overruled the 
unanimous vote of a grant-review panel and rejected NEA fellowships for Hughes 
and fellow artists Tim Miller, Karen Finley and John Fleck. 
</P>
<P>
The grounds for the rejection have never been explicitly stated, but the 
implication is that the work of these four artists is offensive. The decision 
was made, according to a Times story in September after Frohnmayer reportedly 
told a meeting of arts activists that the NEA's precarious political situation 
necessitated denial of the grants. 
</P>
<P>
Those rumors of offensiveness have not eliminated audiences, but they have 
changed them. Now people come with the expectation of being shocked. And that's 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Those who go to see "World Without End" with that in mind are likely to be 
disappointed, Hughes said on the phone Tuesday from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the piece can only be seen as shocking to those people who are freaked 
out about thinking and want their art to be their esthetic equivalent of a 
Long-Boy recliner," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The piece is about Hughes' reflections on her mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote it after my mother's death, and it explores my relationship to her and 
both the negative and positive sides of the relationship. It explores how she 
helped me, how she hurt me and what choices she had. 
</P>
<P>
"I also reexamine my relationship to men, both as a category and as 
individuals. I find that, even though I identify myself as a lesbian, my 
feelings run the gamut from incredible anger to sexual attraction, and I wonder 
how I reconcile that with being a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
"In this piece, I don't have the answers. It feels to me like a conversation 
with the audience, an intimate, casual kind of conversation, a trip through the 
wilderness of ambivalence." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a New York-based artist who has been performing since 1983, said the 
NEA controversy has "transformed her from a political artist to a political 
football." 
</P>
<P>
And the reception of her work has suffered as she has come to be viewed as not 
just an artist, but as a symbol for people on either side of the NEA fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Either I have been told that I'm a lesbian, and that's grounds enough for 
rejecting my work. Or people say I'm not lesbian enough, and the work isn't 
shocking enough. 
</P>
<P>
"If only I could go back to the time before this happened. People are seeing me 
now through the lens of this controversy, and it's not good for the work. Every 
artist wants attention. But you want it for someone saying your work is good, 
not for someone seeing your work as trash and a waste of taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing has remained the same since all this happened, the continuing 
support of Sushi founder/director Lynn Schuette, who has presented each member 
of the "NEA Four" over the years. And Hughes appreciates that. 
</P>
<P>
Her first appearance at Sushi was in "Dress Suits to Hire" in 1988, followed by 
a brief run of "World Without End" in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Immediately after I got into hot water with the NEA, she (Schuette) called and 
offered her support to me and said she wanted to represent the work so people 
could see what the government didn't want them to see." 
</P>
<P>
Schuette has also signed Miller for a January run and Finley for June. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite this gesture, the battle with the NEA is beginning to resemble a 
"fight without end" to Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Now on the table is a proposed grant for Hughes from the NEA Inter-Arts program 
called Artists Projects: New Forms. Finley and three other artists were also 
proposed for these grants. But their awards, despite initial approval, were 
sent back to a review panel for reconsideration after questions were raised 
about conflicts of interest among panel members who had originally proposed 
them. The grants were re-recommended by the review panel in November, but 
Frohnmayer has yet to act upon the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not confident," said Hughes. "I believe there is an attempt to blacklist 
artists. And I've made that list." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, too, more than just money is involved, said Hughes. It's 
validation of her work as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"The most damaging thing the NEA did was not to take away a grant. The most 
damaging thing they did was to target us so that you wake up in the morning and 
have to defend your work to people who have never even seen it."

QUARTET PROVES GOOD MATCH FOR THE QUIRKY MEGALOPOLIS

Megalopolis, a tiny dive bar on Fairmont Avenue in East San Diego, a block 
north of El Cajon Boulevard, is a weird place, and a happening place. 
</P>
<P>
Weird, because the local bands that play there Tuesday through Saturday nights 
-- and sometimes Mondays -- are about as far removed from the commercial 
pop-music mainstream as you can get. Hard-core punk. Industrial. Techno-folk 
and acoustic funk. Old sounds and odd sounds, throwbacks and flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
And happening, because since Megalopolis opened a year ago this month, it has 
become a regular hangout for a growing contingent of students from nearby San 
Diego State University who crave this weird stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday nights at the Megalopolis are particularly weird and happening. 
That's when the smART Teens, a quartet led by singer-guitarist David Moye -- an 
SDSU student who also edits Stanza, a weekly arts newspaper published by the 
school newspaper, The Daily Aztec -- perform their bizarre originals and 
tongue-in-cheek versions of some of the rock era's most maudlin hits. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, looking very much like fresh-scrubbed preppies, the smART Teens 
opened with their own "Mocha Joe's Groove in A," with the chorus, "It's a good 
thing" interspersed with lyrics extolling what the band considers good things, 
none of which are printable. 
</P>
<P>
Next came "The Girl From Ipanema," with Moye re-creating the horn parts with 
his voice. What began as a faithful rendition of Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger," 
from the movie "Rocky III," turned into chaos halfway through when Moye told 
the crowd, "That's all I remember," and began ad-libbing the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Other targets included the Looking Glass' "Brandy" and Sammy Davis Jr.'s "The 
Candy Man," two harmless pop ditties that topped the charts in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The band doesn't take itself seriously and has fun on stage. It tries to impart 
that fun to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The lunacy of "Raised by Dogs," another original, was tempered with Moye's 
convincing reading of the lyrics, even during the spoken-word break, when he 
solemnly reflected on the good old days "at the Daisy Hills Puppy Farm, 
frolicking in the mountains with my stepbrother, Spike." 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the smART Teens' version of the Steve Miller Band's "Fly Like an 
Eagle," Moye broke into a Mel Torme scat singing style. Snapping his fingers, 
he implored the crowd to "sing along, or we're going to collect our cover 
charge." 
</P>
<P>
No one sang along, and Moye followed through on his threat. He jumped off the 
stage, grabbed an empty beer pitcher, and proceeded to collect a dollar from 
everyone who was there. 
</P>
<P>
Ah yes -- when the going gets weird, the weird really get going. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for something to do Sunday, you're in luck. You can take your 
pick from three special pop-music events, all worthy of your attention -- and 
your attendance: 
</P>
<P>
* Musicians Who Care, the San Diego-based organization of socially conscious 
musicians, will be throwing an open house party at its new offices at 312 South 
Cedros Ave. in Solana Beach, one block from the Belly Up Tavern. The party 
starts at 2 p.m., with prize giveaways and networking. Then, at 5 p.m., there 
will be a free, two-hour concert by Mondo Acoustica, described in a press 
release as "a jazz-blues-rock-folk acoustic group." 
</P>
<P>
Mondo Acoustica is made up of members of the Wild Truth, a local rock band that 
placed second in this year's annual Rock Wars battle-of-the-bands contest, and 
jazz-folk singer-guitarist Jeanne Wooster, from Monterey. The group made its 
San Diego debut last month at the Avenue of the Arts street fair. 
</P>
<P>
* Then there's the Songwriter's Showcase at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana 
Beach, featuring five talented singer- songwriters associated with the 
burgeoning national back-to-the- roots movement. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are Los Angeles rockabilly king Dave Alvin, formerly with the 
Blasters, and Rosie Flores, who before recording a pair of traditional country 
albums for Warner Bros. Records in the late 1980s fronted popular rock 'n' roll 
bar band Rosie and the Screamers in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the bill will be Lucinda Williams, Tom Russell, and Steve Young, 
all veterans of the thriving roots-rock scenes in Los Angeles and Austin, Tex. 
The show starts at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* And at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa, the San Diego Songwriters Guild will be 
presenting a benefit concert for the Hospice House. 
</P>
<P>
Performing will be three established local club acts: vintage jazz group 
Tobacco Road, rhythm-and-blues band the Falcons, and bluesman Earl Thomas and 
the Blues Ambassadors. The concert starts at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Two venerable San Diego folk singers will once again usher in the 
holiday season with a concert of traditional Yuletide carols. The Sam Hinton 
and Johnny Walker Holiday Concert will take place Saturday night at the Del Mar 
Shores Auditorium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The Stars Come Out for Christmas Volume II," the second annual charity 
compilation album of Christmas tunes sung by big-name pop and country stars, 
has only been out a week. But already, executive producer Steve Vaus is 
soliciting contributions for Volume III. The first to say yes: Madonna. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. for shock comic Sam Kinison's Dec. 26 and 
27 shows at the Bacchanal. At 10 a.m. Saturday, tickets will be available for 
the Neville Brothers' second (10 p.m.) show Jan. 5 at the Spreckels Theatre 
downtown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: the Call with Baba Yaga, tonight at the 
Bacchanal; John Mayall, with Earl Thomas and the Blues Ambassadors, Thursday at 
the Belly Up Tavern; Eek-A- Mouse, Friday at the Soma dance hall downtown; the 
Goo Goo Dolls with the Holy Love Snakes, Saturday at the Casbah in Middletown; 
the Waterboys, Sunday at Symphony Hall downtown; ZZ Top, Monday at the San 
Diego Sports Arena; Iggy Pop with Alice in Chains, Monday at Iguanas in 
Tijuana; and the Crazy 8's, Tuesday at the Belly Up Tavern.

AT THE GALLERIES: VIOLENT VISION OF HUMANITY AS THE VICTIM

Politics are both monstrously medieval and hauntingly high-tech in Diego 
Marcial Rios' powerful show, "Arte Politico: Politics and Art/Art and 
Politics." 
</P>
<P>
Rios' large woodcuts, at Sushi Gallery (852 8th Ave., through Jan. 4), portray 
a society governed by violence and intimidation. Might makes right in this 
world -- intellect and sensitivity have long since been crushed, relegated to 
the weak and powerless. 
</P>
<P>
Rios, who lives in Northern California, charges his images with a sense of 
outrage, but never identifies either the perpetrators or victims of this 
overwhelming violence. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Order," he presents a full-length portrait of a timeless warrior, the 
specter of death itself. A skeleton with blood on its hands, the figure is 
nothing but bones, sheaths, laces and bolts. A puny, pathetic skull sits atop 
this hulking yet insubstantial body, and mounted on the head is a gun. The 
order of the day, suggests Rios, is to shoot first and ask questions later. 
Destruction precedes thought, and may even have replaced it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Rios' vision is a frightening one, extreme and allegorical yet rooted in a 
fundamental truth about American society's hair-trigger mentality, and its 
image as a big, boasting bully. Snakes, flames and jet bombers spew out of a 
human-like face in the image "It's the Peace Keeper," an allusion to the 
euphemistically named missile. And in other images, the Pope puts in an 
appearance as shadowy collaborator with the military. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Arena," Rios shows an immense eagle gnawing at the neck of a 
flower-wielding serpent. The symbolism seems simple, but the struggle is not 
merely between good and evil, for Rios makes the players more ambiguous than 
that. Both creatures seem threatening -- the bird with its hulking, oversized 
presence, the serpent with its razor fangs -- and neither promises peaceful 
conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Energy and eloquence merge dynamically in Rios' prints. Figures loom, dive and 
impose in a realm made bleak by soot and smoke. Death and evil pervade the 
work, and the biggest victim in this stark scenario is humanity itself. 
</P>
<P>
Local artists Ming Mur-Ray and Mary Louise Donovan have teamed up to produce 
their own show through Dec. 21 at a newly vacated La Jolla gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Situated in the Merrill Lynch building at Fay Avenue and Silverado Street, 
Gallery 130 was previously the Rebecca Cabo Gallery and before that Gwydion and 
Paris Green galleries. 
</P>
<P>
"Self," Mur-Ray's series of small oil paintings on steel, possesses a rich, 
disarming presence, despite the evasiveness of its imagery and the quietness of 
its presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Mur-Ray's series of small, rectangular paintings, with tapered bottom corners, 
divulges little but manages to convey a range of emotions. In each painting, 
highlights of a face -- cheeks, nose, chin -- or hand emerge as rust-colored 
patches in a dark, unyielding ground. The face appears pensive in one image, 
pained in another, searching, introspective, anxious and wild in the rest. A 
blindfold appears to mask the eyes in one, while a hand covers them in another. 
</P>
<P>
The immediacy of these images is literal, for the artist makes them by pressing 
her face directly onto the painted steel plates. She then works with the 
impression, painting out areas for greater drama or imprinting the wet paint 
with cloth to animate the texture. Framed in raw steel, the paintings appear 
strangely old, as though ghostly residues of ancient presences, vague imprints 
on burial shrouds, enigmatic and slightly haunting. 
</P>
<P>
The concentrated intensity of Mur-Ray's work could hardly differ more from the 
diffused blandness of Donovan's. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan's assemblages, collectively titled "Changed/Order," mix organic and 
artificial materials, often on clear plexiglass shelves joined by steel bolts. 
When parallels are drawn between the natural and artificial, the work can verge 
on poetry. Several small, wrapped bundles -- of twigs, bamboo and plexiglass 
rods -- have a raw, fetishistic power. A spiraling dried vine couples with 
copper wire in another poignant moment, but more often the bricks, bark, wood, 
metals, plastic foam and dried flowers in Donovan's work merely coexist in 
close proximity, without stimulating much dialogue.

EXPULSION THREATENED FOR JOCKEY VALENZUELA; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: GUILD CONDEMNS SUSPENDED RIDER'S BEHAVIOR BY 22-2 VOTE. CHRB'S 
HANDLING OF THE CASE ALSO IS CRITICIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Jockeys' Guild, which represents most of the riders in the United States, 
voted Tuesday to send a letter to Pat Valenzuela, warning him that he could be 
expelled from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, suspended by California stewards for 60 days a year ago after 
testing positive for cocaine and currently under an indefinite suspension, has 
been seeking reinstatement at Hollywood Park so that he can ride Best Pal in 
the $1-million Hollywood Futurity on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the guild, which was agreed to in Las Vegas at the group's annual 
meeting, will have no official effect on Valenzuela's riding status in 
California, but it sends a message to both the jockey and the Hollywood Park 
stewards that his peers disapprove of his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
After much discussion, the guild directors voted, 22-2, to send Valenzuela a 
warning of expulsion "for conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the 
guild." The notice asked Valenzuela to respond within 15 days if he wants to 
request a hearing. John Giovanni, the former rider who is national manager of 
the guild, also said that if Valenzuela is reinstated in California, the guild 
would have no problems with his membership. 
</P>
<P>
The guild also was critical of the California Horse Racing Board's handling of 
the Valenzuela case. 
</P>
<P>
"(This is) an expression of frustration at the California Horse Racing Board," 
a guild statement said, adding that the racing board failed "to deal with this 
issue expeditiously and efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
In suspending Valenzuela after he called in sick before the $1-million 
California Cup races Nov. 3, the track stewards sent his case to the racing 
board for review, pending receipt of records of a physical and psychological 
examination of the jockey. Last Friday, the racing board said it had not 
received the doctors' reports and sent the case back to the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
Despite missing more than a month of action, Valenzuela has still won 199 races 
this year, and in this week's Daily Racing Form statistics he ranked 10th 
nationally with a purse total of $7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Hollywood Park stewards invited four local Jockeys' Guild 
members -- Chris McCarron, Gary Stevens, Robbie Davis and Kent Desormeaux -- to 
an informational meeting regarding Valenzuela. McCarron, Stevens and two other 
local jockeys -- Eddie Delahoussaye and Laffit Pincay Jr. -- are listed as 
national directors of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
Giovanni said that nine jockeys were expelled last year "for conduct 
detrimental to racing." He added said that 90% of the races in the U.S. are 
ridden by members of the Jockeys' Guild. 
</P>
<P>
"Expelling nine members last year was not unusual," Giovanni said. "We expel 
some almost every year." 
</P>
<P>
Giovanni added that the guild's warning concerned Valenzuela's action with 
racing officials. "We are not saying that Pat's a drug user," Giovanni said, 
"but we feel that he made an agreement to be tested when the stewards have 
asked him, and he's reneged on that. 
</P>
<P>
"Our members are very conscious about the drug problem. Riding horses is 
dangerous enough without having other factors to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Giovanni declined to say which two jockeys voted against sending the notice to 
Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand how they could make an accusation and vote on it without 
giving Pat a hearing," said Sam Silverstein, Valenzuela's attorney. "Part of 
this is because it's an economic situation. Pat rides horses that earn about 
$10 million a year and some of those jocks want his business." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Silverstein's remarks, McCarron said: "Those are his opinions. Pat 
has done some things to hurt the organization and the integrity of racing and 
maybe he shouldn't be a member. As for him being guilty or innocent, I'm like 
everybody else, I'm just waiting to hear about (the stewards') findings." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what influence the Jockeys' Guild's action might have, Pete Pedersen, a 
steward at Hollywood Park, said: "Let's put it this way, we're incredibly 
interested in what they did. Southern California has as good a collection of 
jockeys as there is in the world, and we're going to do what we have to do to 
keep those standards high." 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein has asked the stewards for a hearing today, but Pedersen said that 
none is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean, however, that we couldn't have one," Pedersen said. "We're 
prepared to put one together as quickly as possible. Right now, though, I am 
not in receipt of the (medical and psychiatric) information that we've 
requested."

MIKE DOWNEY: ANGELS NEEDED TO LET GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Devon White, an Angel no more, has gone to that big Skydome in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
White will play for the Toronto Blue Jays next season in that combination 
baseball stadium/amusement park/galleria/office complex/adult motel of theirs, 
the indoor Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
This Skydome, you may recall, is the billion-dollar ballyard where the biggest 
thrills are provided not by the Blue Jays but by the registered guests at the 
connecting hotel who neglect to shut their drapes. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought the Blue Jays no longer played in Exhibition Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, such are the distractions Devon White must face if he is to return to 
the form that won him outfield Gold Gloves two years running. I mean, when 
Willie Mays went back for Vic Wertz's fly ball, all he had to worry about was 
losing the ball in the sun, not losing the ball in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a fun house, the Skydome also is something of a haunted house. 
White's new teammates will include pitcher David Wells, the man who puts his 
fist through windows while sleepwalking, and outfielder Glenallen Hill, the man 
who jumps out of bed and runs into walls trying to escape imaginary spiders. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Toronto provides White an opportunity to start over, to prove 
himself anew, to return to the form of his 1987 rookie season, when White 
appeared to be another Rickey Henderson in the making. 
</P>
<P>
He hit 24 home runs, stole 32 bases, knocked in 87 runs, batted 639 times, 
legged out 38 doubles and triples, gunned down 16 baserunners from the outfield 
and appeared to be created by some manufacturer of new, improved Gary Pettises. 
</P>
<P>
And fast? 
</P>
<P>
Angel White had wings, man. His stride was longer than Secretariat's. He got 
from the batter's box to first base in three steps. You know that character on 
television, the Flash? White made him look like Mike Scioscia. He could turn 
grounders through the box into doubles. Had Devon White been a better bunter, 
he could have turned those into doubles. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so he struck out 135 times that season. At least he was up there swinging. 
White took a cut with that bat of his like that weirdo in Texas with the chain 
saw. When he made contact, he ripped the cover off the ball. He could have 
ripped the cover off a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
But, now he's history. The Angels couldn't wait on him anymore. White never did 
hit any better than .263. Last season, he dipped to .217, and continued to 
commit a speedster's cardinal sin: striking out. Nobody can outrun Strike 3. 
Your legs don't do you any good if all you're doing with them is walking back 
to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels tried patience and then impatience. They sent White to Edmonton, 
temporarily. Didn't work. So now, they have sent him to Ontario, permanently. 
They tried sending him down. Now they're sending him up. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the Angels get Junior Felix, a man about whom we know very little, 
including whether or not there is a Senior Felix, and whether or not the Angels 
might be interested in one of those Ken Griffey deals. 
</P>
<P>
Felix evidently will play center field for the Angels and possibly bat third, 
which could end up giving the batting order a 3-4 punch of Junior-Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
One confusing element of the deal is that the Angels continue to stockpile 
outfielders. In fact, they are turning into Outfielders R Us. Last season, they 
picked up Dave Winfield and Luis Polonia when they already had White, Chili 
Davis, Dante Bichette, Max Venable, Lee Stevens and Brian Downing, which is 
fine if baseball permitted a team to use four or five designated hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Gene and Jackie Autry and their advisers, Chief Executive Officer President 
Chairman of the Board Richard Brown, Executive Assistant Brigadier General 
Manager Mike Port, Special Deputy Associate Vice President Director of Player 
Personnel Dan O'Brien and all the others, are willing to do whatever it takes 
to bring a World Series to Anaheim sometime before one comes to Tokyo or a NASA 
space platform. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hot-stove rumor afoot that the Angels also are interested in signing 
Dave Henderson, who plays -- hold onto your cap -- the outfield. Who knows 
where Henderson would fit in out there with Felix, Winfield, Polonia, Bichette, 
Davis and Senior Felix? 
</P>
<P>
If I might put in my worthless two cents here for a second, I might suggest 
that this club take a second look at Bichette, followed by a third look. Maybe 
it's just dumb old me, but I believe this guy could be a very big star. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the Toronto deal apparently was one Luis Sojo, who will play second 
and bat second. I am happy the Angels are solving their problems at second 
base. Now all they need do is solve their problems at shortstop and third base. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield is a good major leaguer, not a great one. And he is forever 
hurt. He is the kind of guy who would miss two weeks with a broken bat. As for 
Jack Howell, that experiment is over and the time has come to try something 
else. Forget outfielders. Somebody find this team a third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White? He scares you. Any season now, this guy will go out there and 
become Barry Bonds. But the Angels were right to let him go, because fast as he 
was, he was going nowhere fast. And so were they.

PADRES OFFER $11 MILLION TO LEFT-HANDER HIGUERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

ROSEMONT, Ill.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres have made the largest contract offer in franchise history to 
free-agent starting pitcher Teddy Higuera, it was learned Tuesday night. The 
offer is believed to be worth in excess of $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
The offer, according to a source, secretly was made in the past few days. It is 
a three-year guaranteed contract, according to the source, with a one-year 
option that could total as much as $12 million or $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't comment on San Diego's offer," said Jim Bronner, Higuera's agent, "but 
it's significant." 
</P>
<P>
Joe McIlvaine, Padre general manager, would neither confirm or deny the offer, 
only smiling, and saying, "No comment. It's something I can't discuss right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are one of three finalists in the bidding for Higuera, who is 
considered the top left-handed pitcher on the free-agent market. The Milwaukee 
Brewers and an undisclosed team also are in the running. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera, 32, informed several of his teammates during the season that the 
Padres would be his top choice since San Diego is one of the nearest teams to 
his home in Ciudad de Juarez, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"He has told us that (the Padres) are his first choice," Bronner said, "but he 
also has told us he'd like to stay in Milwaukee." 
</P>
<P>
Bronner said that he has meetings scheduled today with two of the three teams, 
and the Brewers believe that Higuera's decision will manifest within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera, who has a career 89-54 record, has won at least 16 games three times 
in his career and is the team's all-time strikeout leader. The risk, however, 
is Higuera's health. He has been limited to 49 starts the past two seasons, 
missing about 21 starts because of arm, back and groin injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He made only 22 starts in 1989, missing the first month of the season while 
recovering from a herniated disc operation, and the last month with a viral 
infection and strained left pectoral muscle. Last season he made 27 starts, 
missing virtually the month of June with a left groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, according to a Padre front-office executive, they have had Higuera 
thoroughly examined by doctors, and are convinced he is completely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres are successful in signing Higuera, it's possible that he could 
earn more than the combined total of the Padre rotation: Bruce Hurst ($1.75 
million), Ed Whitson (1.225 million), Greg Harris ($175,000), Andy Benes 
($130,000). 
</P>
<P>
In another intriguing development, the Padres are engrossed in trade 
discussions with the Kansas City Royals that would bring right fielder Danny 
Tartabull in a package deal in exchange for Padre left fielder Joe Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Gilbert, Tartabull's agent, had a two-hour meeting Monday with Herk 
Robinson, Royal general manager, expressing Tartabull's desire to be traded to 
the Padres. It's the only team, Gilbert said, in which Tartabull will sign a 
long-term contract with before being eligible for free agency at the end of the 
1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine confirmed that the Padres indeed have talked about the possibility of 
acquiring Tartabull, but would not divulge the asking price. Yet, for the first 
time Tuesday, he did reveal that Carter's name has been discussed in possible 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest thing we have to being untouchable right now is Tony Gwynn and 
Bruce Hurst," McIlvaine said. "We would consider trading anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
When reached at his home in Malibu, Tartabull said: "I'd love to be traded to 
San Diego. That's where I always wanted to play. I'm just trying not to get 
myself too excited right now." 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull, 28, long has been an attraction to the Padres. Jack McKeon, who was 
fired two months ago as the Padre general manager, has attempted to trade for 
him the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Although hampered by hamstring and groin injuries the past two years, Tartabull 
is considered one of baseball's top power-hitting outfielders. He hit 60 homers 
and drove in 203 runs during the 1987 and 1988 seasons. But the past two 
seasons, while missing 103 games, he combined for 33 homers and 102 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking," McIlvaine said, "but that's all I can say right now." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "They came up with a name today that tweaked our interest. We'll 
definitely be talking again. It's something that has our interest." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also are discussing a trade with the Baltimore Orioles that would 
send Bip Roberts to the Orioles in exchange for third baseman Craig Worthington 
and possibly reliever Mark Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington, 25, was selected as the American League's Rookie of the Year in 
1989 by The Sporting News, batting .247 with 15 homers and 70 RBIs. Yet, he 
slipped this past season, hitting .226 with eight homers. 
</P>
<P>
"His name came up, he'd be a definite fit," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also had trade discussions Tuesday with six other teams -- the 
Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle 
Mariners and the Mets. They discussed such players as Astro first baseman Glenn 
Davis, Cub shortstop Shawon Dunston and Phillie outfielder Von Hayes, McIlvaine 
confirmed, but it appears unlikely that they would be able to swing a deal with 
any of those teams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Mike Humphreys, one of the Padres' top prospects, was the player to 
be named in Monday's deal with the Yankees, it was learned. The Padres won't 
announce his identity, according to McIlvaine, until the Yankees have an 
opening on their 40-man roster. Humphreys batted .276 with 17 homers and 79 
RBIs for the Padres' double-A team in Wichita, and .238 with two homers and six 
RBIs in 12 games with triple-A Las Vegas. . . . The Padres selected two players 
in the minor league draft Tuesday: John Pawlowski, 27, a pitcher, and Peter 
Kuld, 24, a catcher.

ANOTHER GIANT BUY: RIGHETTI; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: RELIEVER SIGNS FOR $10 MILLION, FOUR YEARS. INDIANS TRADE SNYDER FOR 
ERIC KING IN FOUR-PLAYER DEAL. ANGELS BEGIN PRELIMINARY TALKS FOR RAINES.

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants may have jilted Brett Butler in a negotiating 
difference over money, but they continue to spend it almost with indifference. 
</P>
<P>
Free-agent relief star Dave Righetti became the latest to benefit when he 
agreed to leave the New York Yankees and return to his Bay Area roots for a 
$10-million guarantee over four years. 
</P>
<P>
In another major development, it was learned late Tuesday night that free-agent 
second baseman Bill Doran, the subject of the Dodgers' interest, had agreed to 
re-sign with the Cincinnati Reds for three years and an estimated $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants rejected Butler's bid for a four-year, $15-million contract that 
would have matched those of Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell, but they have also 
committed $33 million during the current free-agent season by signing Bud 
Black, Willie McGee and now Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
Have they overextended financially? 
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis we haven't," club President Al Rosen said. "You have to 
give us a chance to play it all out." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen alluded to the likelihood that he may soon be dumping some major 
salaries, including that of reliever Steve Bedrosian, who is rumored headed to 
the Minnesota Twins. Righetti and Jeff Brantley would then form a left-right 
closing tandem for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Righetti announcement stole the headlines from a trade in which the Chicago 
White Sox acquired outfielder Cory Snyder and minor league infielder Lindsay 
Foster from the Cleveland Indians for pitchers Eric King and former Dodger 
Shawn Hillegas. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction apparently killed a deal in which the White Sox would have 
received Tim Raines from the Montreal Expos for outfielder Ivan Calderon. It 
also might have thrust the Angels into the Raines' picture. 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port confirmed Tuesday night that he had begun 
preliminary talks with the Expos for Raines, who has approved a trade to only 
two American League teams -- the White Sox and Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Port said, however, that it is not a pressing issue likely to prevent him from 
leaving baseball's winter meetings today. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians' decision to swap Snyder, a product of Canyon Country Canyon whose 
offensive production has slid to the point that he hit only 14 home runs and 
drove in 55 runs last year, stemmed, in part, from frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"He simply did not want to take any instruction," Cleveland Manager John 
McNamara said. "He's the type hitter who should be using the whole field, but 
he's always trying to pull it." 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox feel that Walt Hrniak, their noted batting coach, can cure 
Snyder's ills, pointing to the fact that Snyder got off to a strong start last 
season after visiting Hrniak during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg said he will employ Snyder as a swing man at all 
three outfield positions and, in some situations, at first base or third base 
against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
King, who went to Royal High in Simi Valley and was 12-4 this year, will 
continue as a starter with Cleveland, and Hillegas will be used in middle 
relief. McNamara said that rookie Turner Ward is likely to replace Snyder in 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti, who converted 36 of 39 save opportunities in his 10th season with the 
Yankees, has a career total of 224. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen was the Yankee general manager who acquired Righetti from the Texas 
Rangers in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's the Righetti I knew when I first traded for him," Rosen 
said. "He isn't as overpowering now, but there's only one Nolan Ryan. I do 
think he's a better pitcher now." 
</P>
<P>
Agent Bill Goodstein, who had talked with the Angels and Dodgers about 
Righetti, said his desire to return to the San Jose area of his youth was an 
important consideration. He also said that he always seemed to be negotiating 
with a different Yankee executive, as if the confusion familiar under George 
Steinbrenner still exists. 
</P>
<P>
"They always said Lou was a member of the family, but they treated him as if he 
was the mother in law," Goodstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Righetti by phone: "I cried. I cried out of happiness and I cried out of 
sadness of leaving. I'm looking for a new beginning, but I won't forget all the 
people from my Yankee days." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers, said his unwillingness to 
give Righetti or any pitcher more than a three-year contract eventually killed 
their negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Claire confirmed that he has talked with the agent for free-agent relief 
pitcher Juan Agosto and said they may talk again, but he again downgraded the 
possibility of a bid for Butler or a major free-agent investment on top of 
those he has already made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baseball Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, who recently signed free agent Steve Farr as insurance if Dave 
Righetti left, did keep second baseman Steve Sax by signing him to a four-year 
extension for $12.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
In other moves, the Giants traded reserve infielder Ernest Riles to the Oakland 
Athletics for outfield prospect Darren Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
The free-agent spending spree continued with the Boston Red Sox signing pitcher 
Matt Young for three years at $6.35 million; the Milwaukee Brewers signing 
pitcher Edwin Nunez to a two-year, $1.5-million contract, and the Toronto Blue 
Jays re-signing infielder Rance Mulliniks for two years at $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels appear to have found the left-handed reliever they have sought. 
Angel President Richard Brown and Senior Vice President Dan O'Brien said the 
club will make at least one move within a week involving the signing of a 
left-hander; neither would be specific, except to say they're not signing a 
Type A free agent. It's believed the pitcher is either Don Carman, a Type B 
free agent who could be signed without compensation to the Phillies if he's not 
offered arbitration by Friday, or Bill Krueger, who can be signed without 
compensating Milwaukee. . . . Brown indicated that the Angels will consider 
pursuing third baseman Gary Gaetti should Gaetti be granted new-look free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Angels announced the acquisition of outfielder Dave Gallagher 
from the Baltimore Orioles for two minor league pitchers. "There's an outside 
chance of possibly losing Max (Venable), and defensively we need to protect 
ourselves in the outfield," Manager Doug Rader said.

Butts rushed for 159 yards on 26 carries and scored two touchdowns as the 
Chargers defeated the New York Jets 38-17. Butts leads the NFL in rushing with 
1,154 yards and needs 26 more yards to break the San Diego club record of 1,179 
set by Earnest Jackson in 1984.

NEWSWIRE: EAST GERMANS ALLEGEDLY USED NASAL-SPRAY DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts in East Germany developed a performance-enhancing nasal spray before 
the 1988 Olympic Games that had the same effect as anabolic steroids and was 
virtually undetectable, a leading swimmer alleged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Raik Hannemann, who Monday admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs, said 
traces of the drug's use would disappear after three days. 
</P>
<P>
Hannemann and other athletes accused former East German sports officials of 
developing a systematic doping program and of offering hard currency as an 
incentive for taking drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Hannemann, writing in a bylined article for the Berliner Kurier am Abend 
newspaper, said the nasal spray was developed by East German sports doctors.

USD SMOKES DIVISION III POMONA-PITZER, 84-49

Pomona-Pitzer didn't figure to be much of a challenge for the University of San 
Diego men's basketball team, and it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
USD blew out the Sagehens, 84-49, Tuesday in front of 1,075 at the USD Sports 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Toreros' fourth victory in four games this year, their best 
beginning since becoming a Division I member in 1979. It was also their biggest 
margin of victory since beating Cal Lutheran, 82-46, to begin last season. 
</P>
<P>
USD also tied an obscure school record as all 15 available players scored. 
</P>
<P>
USD Coach Hank Egan normally schedules one early game per season against a 
non-Division I opponent for the purposes of working on a specific part of the 
game and getting the reserves some playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Egan chose Pomona-Pitzer, a Division III member of the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, because the Sagehens are coached by 
Charles Katsiaficas, a former assistant to Egan. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reasonably pleased because of all the factors involved," Egan said. 
"That guy coaching at the other end of the bench, his kids looked pretty good, 
and that was important to me, too. (Katsiaficas) is part of the family, too." 
</P>
<P>
Egan was also pleased with the victory, his 98th in seven seasons as the 
Toreros' coach, the defensive effort and that he was able to play a number of 
players in a number of different positions. 
</P>
<P>
Against a quick, swarming USD defense, the smaller Sagehens shot only 31.6% (18 
of 57) from the field. They also made only 11 of 20 (55%) free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking at this as a scrimmage really, to tone up on defense," Torero 
senior guard Pat Holbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, USD made more than 50% of its shots -- 51.5% on 34-of-66 shooting -- 
for the fourth time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Holbert and Reed Watson were the only scorers in double figures, but 13 others 
scored between two and eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona-Pitzer (1-4) was led by William Cover with 13 points and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
USD never trailed in the game and led by as many as 20 in the first half and 39 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Thomas, who made 10 of 10 shots in a 98-81 rout of San Jose State 
Saturday night, made his first three before missing a 10-foot bank with 2:29 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros play next in the Indiana Classic beginning Friday against North 
Carolina-Wilmington.

LESLIE LEADS USC WOMEN PAST SAN DIEGO STATE, 68-54 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Neither coach will likely want to keep this one in her video file, but No. 21 
USC defeated San Diego State, 68-54, in a nonconference women's basketball game 
Tuesday in front of 1,539 in the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 20 minutes set the game back," SDSU Coach Beth Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ugly basketball. It was almost scary it was still a game at halftime. 
We probably played the worst 20 minutes I've seen in years." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU guard Crystal Lee led all scorers with 25. Lisa Leslie, USC's standout 
freshman, had 20 points and a game-high 23 rebounds. USC (3-1) out-rebounded 
the Aztecs, 65-44. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, you may remember, is the player who scored 101 points in a game last 
season for Morningside High in Inglewood. She entered Tuesday's game averaging 
30 points and 20 rebounds a game, which are the same numbers she had in her 
first college game, an 88-77 USC upset of then-No. 12 Texas Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take her long to impress the Aztecs (2-2). She had 12 points and 11 
rebounds in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
USC took a 12-0 lead and held the Aztecs scoreless for nearly five minutes. Lee 
hit a driving shot from the lane with 15:07 remaining in the half to give the 
Aztecs their first bucket. Lee then scored SDSU's next three baskets. 
</P>
<P>
USC led at the half, 30-21, despite shooting only 32.5%. SDSU shot 26.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I thought we played consistently well on defense," USC Coach Marianne 
Stanley said. "I think (SDSU) is going to beat a heck of a lot of people this 
year. I really do."

<P>
THOMAS KEEPING EMOTIONS IN CHECK; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: TALENTED JUNIOR RUNNING BACK SAVING LAST DANCE FOR WHAT HE HOPES WILL 
BE A WALTZ BY QUARTZ HILL TO THE DIVISION I TITLE.

See Erik Thomas run. See Erik Thomas score. See Erik Thomas jog back to the 
sideline, nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
A touchdown by Thomas, the lead mustang in Quartz Hill High's Three Horsemen 
backfield, apparently is no cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Twice last week in a Southern Section Division I semifinal against Mater Dei at 
Orange Coast College, Thomas burst through the middle for 49-yard touchdown 
runs. Twice he placed the ball in the end zone and trotted lightly back to his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
He gained 178 yards in 18 carries in Quartz Hill's 37-7 pasting of Mater Dei. 
He gained 140 in the second half, maintaining a Rebel reign after intermission 
that has been a hallmark of this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect Thomas to get worked up about all the fuss over a junior who 
has gained 1,394 yards and scored 17 touchdowns in only 193 carries. 
</P>
<P>
After all, there is work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't celebrate," Thomas said. "Not yet." 
</P>
<P>
Not yet? Not after the best record (11-2) in school history, a Golden League 
title and a showdown with Loyola at Anaheim Stadium on Friday night for the 
Division I championship? 
</P>
<P>
A berth in the championship game is not enough for Thomas and the Rebels. They 
want to win it. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no pregame rallies for the Rebels. No school assemblies honoring 
the players. Just the way Thomas won't bother with a touchdown dance. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' first touchdown run was impressive considering that the score was 17-7 
at the time. After taking a pitch in the team's power I backfield early in the 
third quarter, Thomas broke through a hole and found a corps of linebackers 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Head down, he bulled into one, shaking him off about 15 yards past 
the line of scrimmage. One safety to beat. With a shift of the feet, Thomas 
blew past him. Touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The second run required less strength but showcased his speed. Thomas has 
clocked 4.3 seconds in the 40-yard dash. After taking a handoff, he ran right 
past Mater Dei's team. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, he's really coming around, isn't he?" Quartz Hill Coach John Albee said. 
"If he has a big game Friday night, he could be up for All-CIF honors." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the Southern Section honors running backs with much more yardage. But 
Thomas has gained nearly 1,400 yards among a trio that has amassed 2,857. 
Thomas shares the ball with fellow running backs David Nelson (917 yards) and 
Selves Smith (546 yards). Each is averaging more than seven yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas does not mind carving up the carries. In fact, the backs like to count 
on one another for big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We admire each other," he said. "We say, 'Go Selves. It's your turn.' Or we 
say, 'All right, David. Bust it. It's your turn.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is one effective mutual admiration society: The trio has rushed for 39 
touchdowns. Next year, Thomas will be the lone remaining star. Smith and 
Nelson, both seniors, are being recruited by Division I colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who has moved out of a group foster home into the home of foster 
parents Leonard and Sarah Thornton, expects to be getting bundles of mail from 
schools himself. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has been spending time in the weight room, bulking up from 182 to 188 
pounds this season. Instead of just blowing by tacklers, he is bowling them 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't let just one guy bring him down," Albee said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor will he let any kind of celebratory dance bog down his post-touchdown jog 
to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
At least not until after Friday night. One can assume that if Quartz Hill 
claims the Division I title, Thomas and his teammates will allow themselves a 
bit of a victory jig.

WELCH TO DISCUSS RETIREMENT WITH CANYON PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canyon High football Coach Harry Welch will meet with Principal Bill White 
later this week to discuss Welch's pending retirement from coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"He and I will talk to make sure that this is what he wants to do," White said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really have a timetable. He just needs some time to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Welch announced his retirement Sept. 6, the day before the Hart-Canyon game, 
citing his desire for a lighter teaching load. Welch said that he no longer was 
willing to teach four English classes and coach football full-time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready (to retire)," Welch, 45, said. "Right now, I have no plans of ever 
coaching again. For me to stay, they would have to make me an offer I couldn't 
refuse, and that's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Welch indicated that he would continue to coach if his schedule was changed to 
mirror that of a student-body director who teaches one class in addition to 
heading extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's season ended last week with a 10-3 loss to Loyola in the Southern 
Section Division I semifinals. Welch posted a 100-19-1 record in nine years and 
took his team to the semifinals eight consecutive years. Canyon won Southern 
Section titles in 1983, 1984 and 1985 and posted a 46-game winning streak.

SIMI VALLEY TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA BARBARA ENDS SANTA CLARA WIN STREAK AT 48 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Barbara High entered the championship game of the Simi Valley basketball 
tournament Tuesday with its sights on the tournament scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
But all the Dons could see during the first half were Santa Clara's aggressive 
Saints, whose defense limited Santa Barbara to five field goals. 
</P>
<P>
After a halftime tongue-lashing, Santa Barbara played near-flawless basketball 
during the third quarter and went on to post a 63-47 win at Simi Valley High. 
The defeat snapped a 48-game Santa Clara winning streak that dated to the 
1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, we were just standing around," Santa Barbara Coach Bob 
Purdy said. "We got a little antsy, and were overplaying." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing a halftime discussion can't cure. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there was a little vocal inspiration," said Matt Purdy, who scored 17 
points and was named the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara responded with a 22-8 run in the third quarter, including 14 
consecutive points in the final three minutes that turned a 34-28 deficit into 
a 42-34 Santa Barbara lead entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked up the intensity and pressured them more," Bob Purdy said. "We 
wanted to speed it up some more." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Santa Barbara (4-0), ranked eighth in the Southern Section Division I, 
wasn't safe until the waning seconds. Santa Clara (3-1) whittled an eight-point 
deficit to two, 57-55, when Chris Cole (21 points) hit two free throws with 39 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Sjvold, who scored 20 points and was an all-tournament selection, hit both 
ends of a one-and-one with 35 seconds left and Santa Clara's Isaiah Mustafa 
answered with a jump shot that pulled Santa Clara within 59-57 with 27 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Erwin Roelofs, who had 12 points, missed the front end of a one-and-one with 14 
seconds left, but Purdy grabbed perhaps the biggest rebound of the game. Robby 
Blakeney and Alexy Drovtcsak were four of four from the line in the final 10 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, ranked No. 1 in Division IV, was only 18 of 47 (38%) from the 
field and 16 of 29 (55%) from the line. 
</P>
<P>
"We just fell apart," Santa Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich said. "Everybody 
started to do their own thing." 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Muir 87, Taft 71 -- Sophomore Jacque Vaughn scored a tournament-best 34 points 
to lead Muir (3-1) to a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Sheahan scored 17 points, Eric Dafney had 14, and Joe Snow 10 for Taft 
(3-2). 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 85, Kennedy 70 -- Jerry Allen scored 28 points to lead Granada 
Hills (4-1) to the consolation title. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Cravens scored 11 of his 17 points in the second half, in which Granada 
Hills scored 52 points. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Johnson scored 13 points and Kenjuan Casey and Athesis Harris each had 12 
for Kennedy (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
Royal 60, Douglas-Juneau 46 -- Kevin Hambly scored 15 points and David Tyner 
added 11 for Royal (3-1) in the fifth-place game.

JAMES FLANIGAN: AT&amp;T SHOULD CONSIDER ITS OWN IN NCR BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's $6-billion takeover proposal to 
computer-maker NCR may be both a good idea and a bad one at the same time, but 
you won't understand it by looking only at the computer business. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the deal, however, there's a story full of insights into world business, 
as well as lessons on what pushes a company or a country's industry to the 
competitive edge and, not incidentally, a few perspectives for investors in 
AT&amp;T, the country's most widely held common stock. 
</P>
<P>
What AT&amp;T is effectively doing in the deal is trying to give its 
unsuccessful computer operation -- a $2-billion revenues business -- a good 
home with NCR, a competently managed computer company with strong sales in 
retail and automated teller terminals, especially overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is that AT&amp;T's computers can join NCR's profit-making lineup and 
AT&amp;T itself -- the parent company that gets almost all its $36 billion in 
revenues from long-distance services and selling telephone equipment -- can 
gain a profitable adjunct to its main business. 
</P>
<P>
It is proposing to pay $90 a share or $6 billion, and may end up paying more 
than $100 a share, or $7 billion, to secure the prize -- which may seem like a 
lot for a sideline business. 
</P>
<P>
But AT&amp;T has its reasons. The company is involved in many parts of the 
computer business, from the Unix operating system, which AT&amp;T invented, to 
the heavy computer focus of Bell Laboratories' research. So it feels that it 
must also make and sell computers. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T also sees that some of its rivals in global competition -- Siemens of 
Germany, Fujitsu and NEC of Japan -- have computer operations, and concludes 
that's not a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
The competition is a high-stakes battle to be telecommunications supplier in a 
world where countries everywhere are modernizing their phone systems, replacing 
mechanical equipment with massive digital switches -- essentially 
supercomputers for phone lines. The jobs are big: Italy, for example, is 
prepared to spend $28 billion over four years. 
</P>
<P>
And AT&amp;T has been winning overseas business for two reasons. One is that 
its digital switches are a step ahead of international competitors because the 
U.S. telephone network modernized earlier than other countries. An interesting 
point is that the system upgraded to give AT&amp;T's competitors -- MCI and 
Sprint -- a fair shake. Now AT&amp;T and U.S. competitiveness is benefiting. 
</P>
<P>
Also, AT&amp;T is operating with some subtlety overseas. It formed a joint 
venture with the Italian state telephone company last year and recently formed 
a similar venture with Spain's national company. In each case it makes an 
investment in the local country, and in each case it gains a major piece of the 
phone modernization business. It has also won phone jobs recently in Taiwan and 
Indonesia, and may soon announce a big job in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, improved phones overseas mean more international calls to the 
United States, and thus more profit for AT&amp;T, the U.S. long-distance 
leader. Small wonder it has been fighting so hard to turn back the challenge of 
MCI and Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
But the company's mastery in telephones eluded it completely in computers. 
Since the 1984 break-up of the old AT&amp;T, computer operations have lost 
roughly $2 billion. This year, when AT&amp;T will earn $2.5 billion in overall 
profit, it will still lose $100 million in computers. 
</P>
<P>
So AT&amp;T faced up to the fact that it couldn't run a computer business and 
began to think of other companies that could. Lately it talked of merging 
computer operations with NCR, the old National Cash Register Co., and now has 
decided to buy it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
The potential benefits are evident. NCR is strong in global markets, getting 
60% of its sales and more than 77% of its profit overseas. As a subsidiary or 
division, NCR could give AT&amp;T competent management to run its computer 
business, freeing the phone giant to concentrate on what it does best. 
</P>
<P>
But the costs seem unnecessarily high. Because NCR management is resisting the 
takeover, AT&amp;T will probably end up paying more than $100 per NCR share -- 
rewarding NCR shareholders handsomely but at the expense of AT&amp;T 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T stock, already down a few points since the takeover bid was announced, 
could slip further because AT&amp;T may still have to take a writeoff on the 
computer equipment it puts into NCR. The new subsidiary won't want to take on 
loss-making products and sully its own record. 
</P>
<P>
"The writeoffs could be in the hundreds of millions," says analyst James McCabe 
of Nomura Securities. But the real danger could come after the takeover, if 
AT&amp;T management interferes with NCR as giant companies always do. Then 
NCR's profits could turn to AT&amp;T-style computer losses. 
</P>
<P>
The question McCabe and other analysts ask is: Why must AT&amp;T buy the whole 
company? They suggest that the phone giant could instead make a major 
investment in NCR or form a joint venture with it. 
</P>
<P>
Such a joint venture wouldn't reward NCR shareholders as handsomely, but it 
would save money for AT&amp;T shareholders. And maybe AT&amp;T management 
should be thinking about that.

FOREIGN COMPANIES HAIL COURT RULING ON UNITARY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British-owned Barclays Bank and other multinational corporations doing business 
in California cheered a state appeals court decision declaring the state's 
method of unitary taxation unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
California officials immediately vowed to appeal the ruling issued late Monday 
by a panel of the 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento. State Controller 
Gray Davis said if the ruling stands, the state could be forced to refund 
between $303 million and $526 million in taxes paid by the multinationals. 
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank sued the state in 1984, claiming California's method of taxing 
foreign-owned firms is unfair and discourages foreign investment. The U.S. 
Department of Justice and the British and Canadian governments agreed with 
Barclays and filed friend of the court briefs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the unitary method, the payroll, sales and property of a foreign-owned 
company is added up by the state Franchise Tax Board. The portion attributed to 
California is then calculated and used for income tax purposes. For example, if 
10% of a global corporation's sales, payroll and property are generated or 
located in California, the state asserts the right to apply its bank and 
corporation tax to 10% of a company's worldwide taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider the ruling a major victory," said Joanne Garvey, an attorney who 
represents Barclays at the San Francisco law firm of Heller, Ehrman, White 
&amp; McAuliffe. "The company is delighted that the court of appeals has 
confirmed the lower court ruling on a three to nothing vote." 
</P>
<P>
She said Barclays may be entitled to a refund of up to $20 million, including 
the original tax and penalties. The bank sold its retail banking operations to 
Wells Fargo in 1987 but maintains a wholesale banking operation in California. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey argued that the U.S. government, not individual states, should be 
responsible for matters of foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court panel agreed. Retired Justice Hugh A. Evans wrote that 
California's system of unitary taxation violates the foreign commerce clause of 
the U.S. Constitution because it prevents the federal government "from speaking 
with one voice" in regulating foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
Several Japanese-owned companies, including Sony and Kyocera International, 
have been heavily involved in fighting California's unitary method of taxation. 
At one time in the mid-1980s, more than 100 lobbyists representing various 
business interests were pushing state lawmakers to abolish the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"California is a big place for Sony to do business," said Koh Shimizu, director 
of corporate communications for Sony in New York. "We have been encouraging 
California to alter the unitary tax to invite foreign investment." Shimizu said 
he does not know how much tax money Sony would recover if the ruling stands. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 of Sony's 10,000 U.S. employees are based in California. He said 
more than 2,000 employees make color television sets, picture tubes, floppy 
disk drives for computers, computer workstations and computer monitors at a 
factory in San Diego. Sony also has operations in Cypress and San Jose. Shimizu 
said Sony opened the San Diego plant in 1972 and has been expanding operations 
in the state ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of companies, led by Kyocera and Sony, have been trying desperately 
to get the state tax authorities and legislators to see our point of view on 
the unitary tax," said Bill Everitt, vice president of communications for 
Kyocera International in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera, which makes ceramic packages for the semiconductor industry, is a 
subsidiary of Kyocera Corp., a $3-billion Japanese firm. It has 1,300 employees 
in California, with offices in San Diego, Laguna Hills and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
About five years ago, the California Legislature modified the tax system to 
permit foreign-owned firms to be taxed as if they were California companies. 
However, extra administrative fees are imposed on companies that elect to pay 
taxes under what is known as the "water's edge" plan -- a program that treats 
foreign companies as if they were based in the state.

<P>
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks plummeted 20.4% in late 
November, reflecting a continued slump in the auto industry and sagging 
consumer confidence, auto makers and analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly hard hit were sales of light trucks, which dropped 28.5% in the 
Nov. 21-30 period compared to the same time last year. Trucks, including 
pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles, aren't as fuel efficient as cars 
and are more vulnerable to rising oil and gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales during the period dropped 15.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 major U.S. auto makers reported selling an average of 29,510 cars and 
trucks a day during the period this year, compared to a daily rate of 37,062 
during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's at a 5.3-million annual rate, which is the weakest 10-day period that I 
can find since October, 1982," said auto analyst David Healy of the investment 
banker Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New York. "It's the first weak period since 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, so it looks as though the big drop in consumer 
confidence and the looming recession are finally having an effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, sales were holding up pretty well," Healy said. "My guess is they 
won't stay that low, but it is kind of a warning shot." 
</P>
<P>
For the month of November, with imports from major overseas auto makers 
included, combined car and truck sales were 4.3% behind last year's pace. Car 
sales fell 1.5% and truck sales were off 9.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three auto makers -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler 
Corp. -- held 68.3% of the market for the month. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the home builders and the automobile industry seem to be well into the 
recession with the rest of the economy just starting," Healy said. "Our 
(economic) guru thinks it's going to be a steep one, but it will be over by 
midyear 1991." 
</P>
<P>
The auto industry, preparing for a softening economy, has cut production 
schedules for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel said last week that he expects that the giant 
auto maker's fourth-quarter earnings will decline significantly from the third 
quarter, when the company earned $109 million excluding a $2.1-billion one-time 
loss for closing plants. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first 11 months of this year, total car and truck sales in the 
United States stood at 13,151,749, down 4.9% from the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's slump began in the third quarter of last year and generally, 
sales rates for 10-day periods have been lower than year-ago periods. 
</P>
<P>
Ford suffered the most of the Big Three in this year's late-November reporting 
period for North American-made cars and light trucks. Auto makers report sales 
of imported vehicles only on a monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's combined sales of North American-made cars and trucks for late November 
were down 30.1% compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
Company sales analyst Joel Pitcoff said part of the downturn stemmed from fewer 
fleet orders from rental car companies, law enforcement agencies, taxi 
companies and big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"But throughout the month, we saw a progressive decline in retail traffic," 
Pitcoff added. 
</P>
<P>
"The accumulated bad economic news and uncertainty finally seems to be taking 
its toll on the retail market," he said. "I think we can expect some fairly 
grim numbers to look at for the industry in the near future. And to top it all 
off, we never do well competing with Santa Claus." 
</P>
<P>
Through November of this year, Ford's cars and trucks were selling at a pace 
7.7% slower than last year. 
</P>
<P>
GM said its combined car and truck sales for late November fell 22.5%. Through 
the first 11 months of the year, sales of GM's North American-made cars and 
light trucks were down 4.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, which has suffered the most in this year's sales downturn, said its 
late-November car and truck sales were off 17.4%. Through November of this 
year, the company's combined car and truck sales were down 13.6% from last 
year.

Macy's Dismisses Concerns Regarding Finances: The chairman of retailing giant 
R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Edward S. Finkelstein, declared in an open letter that 
the company has "ample liquidity" and is not in danger of failing. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was a response to concerns that the company, which owns California's 
Bullock's and I. Magnin stores, might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
protection next year largely because of its $5.6 billion in debt. Finkelstein 
said the company expects to complete a stock offering this month that will 
providing more than $100 million in fresh capital that will be used to reduce 
debt. His letter appeared in the trade newspaper Women's Wear Daily.

Japan's Public Broadcaster Looks Abroad: Following the lead of Japan's giant 
electronics companies, publicly funded Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) will buy 
and finance more programs made overseas, said Keiji Shima, the network's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
NHK, which operates a host of television and radio networks, has set up a 
company to produce and buy shows overseas to expand its programming, Shima told 
reporters. He criticized Japanese-made programs, saying their generally poor 
quality, compared to those produced in Hollywood, compelled the move overseas. 
Separately, Shima said he wants to create a global news network to counter the 
spread of Cable News Network to dozens of countries. Atlanta-based Turner 
Broadcasting System Inc., owns and operates CNN.

NEW SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SALES HIT 8-YEAR LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Sales of new single-family homes dropped 3.5% in October to the lowest level in 
eight years, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. But analysts said that 
the free fall may be bottoming out and that sales should begin rebounding by 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales should be leveling off at this number in the fourth quarter and the 
first quarter of next year," assuming mortgage rates continue to fall and the 
Mideast problem is resolved, said economist David G. Seiders of the National 
Assn. of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Mark H. Obrinsky of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. suggested 
that sales may zigzag for several months, "but assuming no blowup in the Middle 
East . . . I expect to see a more sustained pickup by spring of 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491,000, the Departments of 
Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said in a joint release. That was 
the lowest since 480,000 new homes were sold in October, 1982, a month before 
the 1981-82 recession ended. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, new-home sales were off 15.8% from the same period of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales fell 4% in September and 2% in August. The September figure was revised 
down from 6% in the departments' initial estimate, but the October total was 
worse than the 1.8% drop first reported. 
</P>
<P>
Obrinsky said the main reason for the decline "is great consumer uncertainty 
and generally negative buying sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers, he said, are experiencing rising prices caused by the Persian Gulf 
crisis and increasing unemployment as the economy slows. 
</P>
<P>
"But, really, the big one is the great uncertainty over the Mideast . . . 
concern over war breaking out," Obrinsky added. 
</P>
<P>
At the October sales pace, it would take 8.4 months to exhaust the inventory of 
unsold homes, up from 8.3 months in September. There was a seven-month supply 
of unsold homes in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Assn., said builders 
are cutting back on housing starts to counter the slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
And "once the market recovers, you're going to find relatively few new homes," 
he said. That, in turn, will drive up prices that have been declining recently. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home in October was $121,800, up from $112,900 in 
September but down from $123,000 a year ago. The median means half of the homes 
cost more, half less.

LTV's Pension Liability Upheld: A federal judge affirmed a U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling that ordered LTV Corp. to reassume liability for nearly $3 billion in 
employee pension plans that it stopped funding in 1987. The Dallas steel, 
aerospace and energy concern, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, 
had opposed restoring the plans because it claimed that such a move could 
possibly force the company to liquidate. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet of 
Manhattan rejected the position and granted a request by the federal Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corp. to make LTV take back responsibility for the pension 
plans.

CBS Tries to Revise Baseball Pact: CBS Sports, which may have lost up to $100 
million in the first year of its Major League Baseball pact, has asked baseball 
for some of its money back. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Inc. said last month that it expected losses in 1990's fourth quarter, 
largely because of its $1.06-billion, four-year deal, and now the network 
apparently wants Major League Baseball to help share the load. Published 
reports have also said that if baseball is not willing to give CBS a rebate, 
the network wants more games. CBS showed only 16 regular-season games in its 
first year of the deal, while ESPN, which paid baseball $400 million for four 
years, showed 161.

Stock prices rallied in the final hour of trading Tuesday after a British 
television station reported that Iraq might be willing to negotiate a 
withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The news that suggested that the Gulf crisis could be resolved without an armed 
conflict ignited a market that had sunk gradually for much of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which was down nearly 30 points with 
half an hour left in the session, finished with a gain of 14.11 to close at 
2,579.70. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 907 up, 639 down and 457 
unchanged. Big Board came to 185.82 million shares, up from 177.07 million 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
London-based Sky News reported that Iraq would be willing to withdraw from 
Kuwait in exchange for certain oil fields and a Western promise not to attack. 
</P>
<P>
The report "touched off a wave of enthusiasm that was certainly something to 
behold," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
If the Mideast crisis were resolved peacefully and oil prices returned to a 
level of about $23 to $25 a barrel, "financial markets would regain much of 
what they lost" after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, said Allen Sinai, chief 
economist at Boston Co. "It's potentially very, very bullish." 
</P>
<P>
But the question also remains: Can a sinking U.S. economy be turned around 
quickly at this point, or will recession run its course regardless of the Gulf 
resolution? 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Banking stocks were the most active issues on the Big Board after the Federal 
Reserve loosened bank reserve requirements in an effort boost lending and ease 
the credit crunch. Citicorp jumped 1 1/4 to 14 1/4, BankAmerica surged 1 1/2 to 
24 1/2, Security Pacific rose 1 3/8 to 22 7/8 and Wells Fargo climbed 3 to 55 
1/8. Some financial-related stocks also gained, including Southland homebuilder 
J.M. Peters, up 7/8 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
* NCR rose 2 1/4 to 83 3/4 on speculation that AT&amp;T may be forced to raise 
its $90-a-share offer for the computer maker. AT&amp;T inched up 1/4 to 30 3/8. 
Digital Equipment, a potential AT&amp;T target if the NCR bid fails, rose 1 1/2 
to 56. 
</P>
<P>
Among Southland tech stocks, Trimedyne jumped 3/4 to 3 5/8, Micropolis added 
3/8 to 8 and MacNeal Schwendler rose 3/8 to 10 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Entertainment and media stocks gained. Disney rose 1 1/8 to 102 1/4, McGraw 
Hill added 2 1/8 to 51 1/2 and Cap Cities jumped 8 1/8 to 428 1/8. Caesars 
World, up recently on recurring takeover rumors, leaped 1 5/8 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
* California health-care company FHP Intl. lost 1 to 13 1/4, following a 
consultant's report that suggested the state should drop the HMO firm, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
* Among other losers, Deere fell 1 5/8 to 44 1/2 after the company reported 
disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and projected weak results for its first 
quarter. Kodak eased 1 1/2 to 41 3/8. Prudential-Bache cut its rating on the 
photography giant. 
</P>
<P>
* Toys R Us slipped 1 1/8 to 23 1/4. Two brokerages expressed concerns about 
the company's earnings prospects. 
</P>
<P>
German share prices closed lower, giving back most of the gains recorded Monday 
as the sharp plunge in Tokyo prices brought a modest election rally to a sudden 
halt. The 30-share DAX index fell 16.24 to 1,446.34. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices also finished lower on London's Stock Exchange. The Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 16.4 to 2,146.3. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed sharply lower, with the Nikkei average ending below 
22,000 for the first time since Oct. 1, after heavy selling of the cash indexes 
emerged in thin trading. The 225-share Nikkei closed down 863.38, or 3.8%, at 
21,862.61. But by midday today, the Nikkei had rebounded 246.33 points. 
</P>

CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Jump on Peace Prospects 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices shot up on the report that Iraq offered to withdraw from Kuwait, 
heating up a market already strengthened by a loosening of credit restrictions 
by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Prices eased after the afternoon buying spree but closed up from earlier 
levels. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond closed up 1/2 point, or $5 per 
$1,000 in face amount. That pushed the yield down to 8.32% from 8.36% late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Credit market participants said a spurt of buying occurred just after 3:30 p.m. 
EST when traders heard the Persian Gulf report. 
</P>
<P>
Traders immediately interpreted the report as increasing the potential for a 
peaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict, which would ease the 
inflationary threat of rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
The bond rally came on top of an earlier rise prompted by news that the Fed cut 
its bank reserve requirements for some deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Credit market analysts said traders were encouraged by the Fed's unusual move 
because it could lead to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
unchanged at 7.438% from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Fed's Reserve Rule Change Hurts Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell, pressured by news that the Federal Reserve cut bank reserve 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended at 1.503 German marks, down sharply from Monday's 1.513, and 
at 133.30 Japanese yen, down from Monday's finish of 134.73. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's reserve-cutting move was seen as another indication that the central 
bank wants U.S. interest rates to fall further. That would mean 
dollar-denominated securities could be less attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the yen benefited from rising expectations of a gulf settlement. Japan, 
which is highly dependent on oil imports, has watched the yen slide at every 
hint of a flare up in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the British pound rose against the dollar, reaching $1.929 from 
$1.918 late Monday.

Iraq News Ignored; Energy Futures Up 
</P>
<P>
Prices of energy futures rebounded from steep declines of the past two trading 
sessions, shrugging off reports that the Kuwaitis were willing to enter into 
negotiations with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grains were lower and soybeans higher; precious metals 
gained, and livestock and pork futures were lower. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Brian Tagler of Shearson Lehman Bros. said energy futures were stronger 
on New York's Mercantile Exchange because of a fire in a Saudi Arabian oil 
field and nervousness over an upcoming OPEC meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The market sold off at mid-session on news that the Kuwaiti royal family may be 
willing to hand over two islands in exchange for an Iraqi withdrawal. However, 
the market later recovered from the losses and moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an indication that the market is in a bullish stage," Tagler said. 
</P>
<P>
Light sweet crude settled 95 cents to $1.51 higher, with the contract for 
delivery in January at $30.66 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gold was $1.80 to $2.30 higher, with December at $378.90 an ounce; 
silver was 1.3 to 1.4 cents higher, with December at $4.15 an ounce.

U.S., CANADA, MEXICO PLAN TRADE TALKS

In a prelude to a possible three-nation free-trade agreement, the United 
States, Mexico and Canada will begin talks on transportation issues in 
Washington next week, U.S. officials announced here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The talks are part of efforts to establish a three-nation free-trade zone, said 
John Negroponte, U.S. ambassador to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The countries' representatives to the final session of the international trade 
talks in Belgium this week also will be discussing a three-way agreement, he 
told reporters in a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte said that if three-way talks fail, the United States still will try 
to negotiate a bilateral agreement with Mexico. The United States and Canada 
signed a free-trade agreement two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Truck, bus and rail transport regulations will be discussed in an effort to set 
a timetable for liberalization by the time formal talks on a free-trade 
agreement begin in mid-1991, said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. 
Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be sure that implementation of a (free-trade agreement) would not 
be hindered by transportation issues outside the agreement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner is in Mexico this week to meet with transportation officials and to 
sign an agreement on rules for U.S. charter and tour bus operations in Mexico. 
Previously, U.S. bus companies could not operate here. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office two years ago, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
has begun deregulating the transportation industry. However, impediments for 
foreign companies still exist, such as requirements that freight trailers be 
switched to Mexican-registered cabs and drivers on trips further than 16 miles 
beyond the border. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials agreed with Skinner that improving transportation is 
essential.

STATE FACES TOXIC WASTE LOGJAM, FIRM WARNS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A DISPOSAL COMPANY SAYS CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE AN OVERFLOW OF 
500,000 TONS BY THE YEAR 2000. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A French-owned chemical company seeking permission to burn liquid toxic waste 
in the San Francisco Bay Area has warned that California faces a waste logjam 
of epic proportions in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Even if three waste incinerators now pursuing permits in the state are 
approved, California by the year 2000 would have an overflow of more than 
500,000 tons of liquid hazardous waste for which no legal disposal method would 
be available, according to a report issued Monday by Rhone-Poulenc Basic 
Chemicals Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company is a subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc of Paris, the world's 
eighth-largest chemical company, with about $12 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the chemicals division, based in Shelton, Conn., has been seeking 
federal, state and local permits to operate a liquid hazardous waste 
incinerator at its plant in Martinez, an oil-refining town 30 miles northeast 
of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
That facility is now used to recycle sulfuric acid, which becomes sludge when 
used by refineries to produce higher-octane gasolines. Rhone-Poulenc said 
liquid hazardous waste could be trucked in and burned in the same plant once 
storage and handling equipment was added. 
</P>
<P>
The company has five other similar sulfuric acid facilities nationwide, 
including one in Carson. Two of the plants -- in Houston and Baton Rouge, La. 
-- are allowed to burn liquid hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe (the study) shows that our Martinez facility will provide a vitally 
needed service for the region," said John E. Klepeis, director of 
Rhone-Poulenc's worldwide recycling and recovery services. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rhone-Poulenc's effort has met with stiff resistance from community 
activists, who maintain that the incinerator would expose the town, the seat of 
Contra Costa County, to the risk of toxic spills and would reduce the pressure 
on industries to cut their use of hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, beginning in 2000, the San Francisco Bay Area alone 
will annually generate more than 209,000 tons of liquid toxic waste suitable 
for incineration, even allowing for a 25% reduction from conservation efforts 
and better waste management. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the region would use all of the proposed incinerator's 
142,000-ton capacity, 67,000 tons would be left over, the report noted. Klepeis 
said far greater amounts of waste are generated in Southern California, 
although figures for that area were not broken out. 
</P>
<P>
The study was required by a local committee established to advise the Martinez 
City Council on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Local, state and federal authorities have been grappling for years with the 
problem of how to dispose of liquid toxic waste, which is produced mostly by 
chemical companies, the petroleum industry and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
To date, most such waste has been shipped out of California to incinerators or 
landfills, notably in New Jersey, Utah, Texas, Arizona and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
According to Klepeis, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has 
identified incineration as the best method of treatment and is requiring a 
movement away from using landfills. However, he added, the nation is woefully 
short of facilities for burning such waste. 
</P>
<P>
As of now, Klepeis said, only 800,000 tons of the 280 million tons of hazardous 
waste generated nationwide is burned in the dozen commercial incinerators 
operating throughout the country. Much of the waste is treated by companies at 
their own sites. 
</P>
<P>
Klepeis, who said Rhone-Poulenc has been frustrated by the slow permit process 
in Martinez, said the company is still at least two years away from operating 
the planned incinerator, even if progress is smooth from here on out.

Falletta Gets New Contract: JoAnn Falletta, director of the Long Beach 
Symphony, has signed a new, three-year contract that will raise her salary from 
$70,000 this season to a projected $105,000 in the last year of the contract, 
1993-94, according to general manager Mary Newkirk. The 36-year-old conductor 
has generated sellouts at concerts and has turned around the symphony's gloomy 
days of the mid-1980s, Newkirk said. The conductor and her Long Beach orchestra 
will be featured on CBS' "Sunday Morning" program this Sunday at 8 a.m. BETH

More than 300 people attended the "CHOC &amp; Roll Christmas" benefit concert 
Monday night at the Anaheim Embassy Suites Hotel which, according to event 
coordinator Kenny Karst, raised about $3,000 for Children's Hospital of Orange 
County. The event featured Dem Horn Dogs, a '60s-style R&amp;B revue, plus 
several local performers. "It was an emotional and very rewarding experience 
for all those who participated," Karst said.

No Go for Van Gogh: A Vincent van Gogh painting owned by Elizabeth Taylor 
failed to sell at auction when bidding did not reach the minimum acceptable 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding on "View of the Asylum and Chapel at St. Remy" started at $9.6 million 
and reached $11.14 million, Christie's of London said, but did not achieve the 
undisclosed minimum price. The auction house had expected the painting to fetch 
between $15 million and $19 million. The work depicts the asylum where Van Gogh 
committed himself toward the end of his troubled life. The actress bought it in 
1963 for about $165,000. BETH KLEID

The Laguna Playhouse had to scramble late Tuesday afternoon to find a 
substitute for actress Colleen Dunn, who had to drop out of "Quilters" because 
of a medical emergency. Playhouse artistic director Douglas Rowe said Dunn was 
rushed to Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills at 4:30 a.m. 
Tuesday for an appendectomy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've cast another actress, Cameron Ahia," said Rowe, who noted that there are 
no understudies for any of the seven women in the show. "Most of Colleen's 
lines will be divided among the other actresses." 
</P>
<P>
In a "Quilters" review Tuesday, roles played by Dunn and Carolyn Miller were 
inadvertently reversed. Dunn played the old-maid schoolteacher; Miller, who was 
credited with that role, played the handsome cowboy.

CALARTS PLAYERS HONOR COMPOSERS

While 1990 has taken a frightful toll of American music's most towering 
figures, it has also showered Mel Powell with belated, much-deserved honor. 
</P>
<P>
However, the shadow of yet another death -- that of Aaron Copland on Sunday -- 
haunted the Powell showcase at the Japan America Theatre on Monday night, and 
the management of the Green Umbrella series chose to honor Copland with three 
short works at the top of the program. 
</P>
<P>
First, pianist Bryan Pezzone gently played Copland's touching Piano Blues No. 1 
and the enigmatic "Midsummer Nocturne," with its nostalgic quotes from "Our 
Town." Then cellist Erika Duke offered Powell's own tribute in his spare, 
angular idiom, "Invocation 1988." 
</P>
<P>
It is most ironic that, after years of meticulously polishing his tiny atonal 
gems, Powell should win the Pulitzer Prize this year with a grand gesture for 
symphony orchestra like "Duplicates." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Monday night offering was a spellbinding reminder of the main thrust of 
this genial composer's work. 
</P>
<P>
Powell is fascinated by pinpoints of color, the most delicate shadings, the 
role of silence, the general philosophy of less-is-more. He doesn't waste a 
single motion; a stunning piece like "Settings" for soprano and chamber 
orchestra frames the words in the most delicately crystalline terms. 
</P>
<P>
The performances by members of the New CalArts Twentieth Century Players were 
often scintillating; obviously they have lived with this music long enough to

BUSH EASES STANCE ON CUTS IN FARM SUBSIDIES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE ISSUE HAS STALLED INTERNATIONAL TALKS IN BRUSSELS. THE PRESIDENT'S 
MOVE IS ENDORSED BY HIS HOST IN URUGUAY, THE SECOND STOP ON A SOUTH AMERICAN 
TOUR.

<P>
President Bush on Tuesday relaxed his insistence on deep cuts in agricultural 
subsidies, an issue that has stalled international trade talks under way in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The United States previously has insisted on cuts of 90% in export subsidies 
and 75% in other farm supports. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush, visiting South America, was asked Tuesday whether he would settle for 
something less. "We are not locked on a specific figure," he said. "We are 
locked on the fact that there has to be inclusion of all categories." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal for heavy cuts in subsidies, made at talks on the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 105-nation organization seeking to find 
ways to cut trade barriers and liberalize global trade, had left a large gap 
between Washington's position and a much-less-severe cut of 30% proposed by the 
European Community. 
</P>
<P>
The President's step back from insistence that deep cuts in subsidies to 
farmers and other food producers be part of the trade talks could bring a 
breakthrough in the stymied negotiations in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a signal," one White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. official said it was the first time Bush had suggested he might 
soften his position against farm subsidies. But the official said it is not yet 
clear what percentage cut Bush would accept. 
</P>
<P>
The question goes beyond what assistance governments will give their farmers in 
an effort to keep agriculture profitable by protecting it from low-priced 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Subsidies absorb millions of dollars in taxes and are blamed for helping add to 
prices consumers pay. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was given a vote of confidence in his approach by President Luis Alberto 
Lacalle, his host during an overnight stop in Uruguay, the second country Bush 
is visiting on a five-nation, weeklong tour of South America. 
</P>
<P>
"This agriculture policy has hurt millions of people two ways: through 
subsidies that go into our own markets and compete against the products of the 
agricultural countries and, at the same time, through protectionist barriers 
that don't open the markets of certain very wealthy parts of the world to us, 
the farmers of the world," Lacalle said. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Bush sharply attacked the European proposal in a meeting at 
the White House with the heads of the 12-nation European Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Tuesday to the Uruguayan Congress, Bush said a successful 
conclusion of the trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round because they were 
begun in 1986 in the Uruguayan resort city of Punta del Este, "presents us an 
extraordinary opportunity for unparalleled economic growth for all nations, 
well into the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the final talks this week in Brussels, the President said, "We 
stand firmly with you and other Latin nations in insisting that countries 
sharply reduce the agricultural subsidies that distort world trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The land has historically been at the heart of both our economies, and from 
Montevideo to Montana, our farmers and our ranchers enjoyed shared traditions, 
shared interests and shared concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a message he said was directed at the contentious negotiations, Bush said 
the talks began with a commitment to expanded world trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us finish the round in the same spirit," he said, with a pointed call to 
open "Europe's market to this hemisphere's agricultural products." 
</P>
<P>
Bush met with Lacalle in the Uruguayan president's seventh-floor offices in 
Edificio Libertad (Liberty House), a 5-year-old ultramodern structure that 
resembles, from the outside, a suburban hospital as much as it does a seat of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Against this background, soldiers stand guard, decked out in plumed hats, black 
boots and red-white-and-blue uniforms and carrying gleaming swords. 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, slightly smaller than Oklahoma and home to 3.1 million people, is the 
second-smallest nation in South America. Like many of its neighbors, it has had 
a checkered history of civilian and military governments. 
</P>
<P>
Lacalle, 49, is the second elected president since the military gave up its 
rule in 1984, and the first elected in free voting since 1971. He took office 
March 1. 
</P>
<P>
As his 40-vehicle motorcade moved through Montevideo, Bush was greeted by thick 
crowds, some giving friendly waves, but others holding up a sign saying "Bush 
Pig" and giving him a thumbs-down gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Despite inflation of 80.4% last year, Uruguay has managed to keep up payments 
on its foreign debt, one of the hemisphere's highest on a per-capita basis. 
Lacalle hopes that this behavior will be rewarded by a relaxed debt 
restructuring, and he told reporters recently: "Let me believe that it pays to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, in which 90% of the land is given to crops and raising sheep and 
cattle, depends heavily on neighboring Argentina and Brazil, as well as on U.S. 
and European markets, to buy its agricultural exports. It has much to gain from 
the free-trade policies of Bush's proposed Enterprise for the Americas 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Their similar views favoring reduced agricultural subsidies have made Bush and 
Lacalle natural allies in the closing stages of the Brussels negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Lacalle, like others on the continent, has tried to use free-market principles 
-- favored by Bush -- to bring down Uruguay's budget deficit, which has been 
fueled for years by the most elaborate welfare system in South America. 
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan president is also seeking to change the extensive system of 
public employment, in which one-third of the work force is employed by 
state-run enterprises. This switch to the private sector, according to a State 
Department briefing paper, faces opposition from an overwhelming majority. Bush 
voiced support, in the speech to the Uruguayan Congress, for the efforts to 
restructure the economy.

BRITISH LEADER CONDEMNS RACIST RIFT AMONG TORIES

<P>
British Prime Minister John Major moved quickly Tuesday to quell an 
embarrassing racial outbreak among some Conservatives over the selection of a 
black candidate in their district in the next election. 
</P>
<P>
"Racism has no place in the Conservative Party," Major said during the prime 
minister's question time before the House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
His staunch stand was meant to defuse the sudden row that broke out Monday over 
the selection by Conservatives in Cheltenham, a city in Gloucestershire, of 
John Taylor, a 38-year-old, British-born black lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has been working as a minority policy adviser to the Home Office in 
London and previously was a local city councilor in his hometown of Solihull in 
the West Midlands between Birmingham and Coventry. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party Central Office, in an effort to get more minority 
Britons into Parliament, suggested Taylor to the Cheltenham Tories, who 
selected him as the candidate in their constituency in the next general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
There are no black Tory members of Parliament. And some members of the 
Cheltenham constituency association objected that he is an outsider in a city 
with few blacks. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Cheltenham businessman Bill Galbraith, a cousin of Britain's junior 
Scottish secretary, the Earl of Strathclyde, objected publicly to Taylor as a 
"bloody nigger." 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith, 54, refused to withdraw his remarks Tuesday even though enveloped by 
a storm of protest, saying, "I don't think having (a black) as candidate is 
good for our town." 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith's remarks were condemned by Monica Drinkwater, head of the Cheltenham 
Conservative Assn., who said, "I can only apologize on behalf of the members of 
the Conservative Party in Cheltenham, who would totally dissociate themselves 
and would be ashamed of such remarks." 
</P>
<P>
Norman Tebbit, former Conservative Party chairman, called Galbraith's comments 
-- which found some private support among the town's Tories -- the "rantings of 
a man who holds no position or power within the party" and offered Taylor his 
full support. 
</P>
<P>
Backing up the prime minister's criticism of racism Tuesday, Chris Patten, 
party chairman of the Conservatives, who was appointed by Major last week, said 
he would not want to work in the next campaign with anyone who "shares such 
views." 
</P>
<P>
It is common in Britain for local associations to select candidates for 
Parliament who do not live in the constituencies.

SOVIETS TO BUY $1 BILLION IN FOOD FROM ABROAD; 
</P>
<P>
HUNGER: GORBACHEV HOPES TO RESTOCK SHELVES, SQUELCH THE BLACK MARKET AND QUELL 
FEARS OF WINTER SHORTAGES.

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, disclosing the highlights of an 
emergency plan to get his shortage-plagued country through the winter, said 
Tuesday that more than $1 billion in food must be purchased abroad in the next 
four months to make up for shortfalls in domestic production. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Soviet legislature, Gorbachev said a task force he created 
is working virtually around the clock to devise "urgent measures" to alleviate 
deficits in state-run Soviet grocery stores and ensure a reliable supply 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The work is at its final stage," Gorbachev assured the lawmakers. "Today, or 
tomorrow at the most, a draft program of action will be finished." It will then 
be discussed with the governments of the constituent Soviet republics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, food supplies to the largest cities of the Soviet Union are 
their worst since World War II and the immediate postwar period, and consumers 
have been further depleting the shops through spates of panic buying and 
stockpiling, fueling widespread fears of a possible famine. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly intending to debunk such talk, but acknowledging that the food issue is 
the "most urgent question" now facing the Kremlin leadership, Gorbachev said 
that it is in the power of the government, through urgent measures he will 
recommend, to provide as much grain, eggs, cooking oil and other basic 
foodstuffs per citizen as in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The plan being drawn up includes the following measures to see the country 
through the winter and revitalize its agriculture on a longer-term basis, 
according to Gorbachev: 
</P>
<P>
* To feed the Soviet Union through March, foodstuffs worth a total of 2.1 
billion rubles, or $1.28 billion at the newly introduced official commercial 
exchange rate, must be bought abroad. 
</P>
<P>
* To increase domestic agricultural production, a total of 3 million to 5 
million hectares, or 7.4 million to 12.3 million acres, should be given to city 
dwellers and peasants alike so they can plant gardens. Such small-scale 
holdings, allowed in the Soviet Union even in times of great socialist rigor, 
are the nation's most productive farmland by far. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction and modernization of food processing plants, traditionally one 
of the weakest links in the Soviet food chain, will be stepped up. 
</P>
<P>
* Black marketeers and "speculators" will be tracked down and punished, in part 
through the strict supervision of stores and plants by workers committees 
ordered by Gorbachev last Friday. Raids on 50 Moscow shops found that when they 
close, "a third shift begins," Gorbachev said, meaning that after hours, 
workers are dealing in foodstuffs for their own profit. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the next two or three weeks, we think we can control the situation," 
Gorbachev said of the black market, which by many estimates siphons off half 
the grocery shipments designated for state-run shops and has become a common, 
if expensive, source of supply for Soviet consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Some foreign countries, showing their support for Gorbachev's perestroika 
program for social and economic restructuring, are now shipping food aid to the 
Soviet Union. The United States, which had originally opposed such assistance 
as unnecessary or ineffective, is reviewing its policy. 
</P>
<P>
As his domestic troubles have multiplied, Gorbachev has won long-term, 
low-interest credits from some Western European countries to finance foreign 
food purchases, which he said Tuesday would pay at least part of this winter's 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Either the appropriate contracts have been signed and supplies are under way, 
or the questions have been thoroughly studied," Gorbachev said. But he said 
total needs for 1991, and apparently the cost of food imports for the year as 
well, have not been established. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Supreme Soviet received most of Gorbachev's proposals in silence 
or with an audible buzz of skepticism -- for example, when he spoke of creating 
a Ministry of Agriculture, which would be the latest bureaucratic organ to 
oversee the chronically unproductive collective and state farms. 
</P>
<P>
Some radical approaches were vaguely hinted at. Gorbachev tantalizingly said 
the plan includes measures to alter "land relations" -- but they appeared to 
consist largely of traditional remedies for Soviet agricultural problems. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the more unorthodox Parliament of the Russian Federation on Monday 
approved private ownership of land -- not just gardens, but parcels of farmland 
-- in hopes of fostering an army of peasant entrepreneurs to feed Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev went to the Supreme Soviet to seek approval for his scheme to 
restructure the government, a change that would put him in direct charge of a 
cabinet-style executive branch. Gorbachev is pressing for revision of the 
apparatus of Soviet power at the same time that he is seeking a new, looser 
Soviet federation. 
</P>
<P>
Recent actions by Gorbachev have led progressive and radical lawmakers to fear 
that in the face of economic woes, ethnic crises and virtual deadlock of the 
political system, Gorbachev is backtracking in his reforms or even throwing in 
his lot with the KGB, Soviet army, Communist Party apparatus and other 
conservative institutions. 
</P>
<P>
One prominent progressive, Alexei M. Yemelyanov, denounced Gorbachev's 
governmental reorganization plan in the legislature as a "big step leading to 
the limitation of the power of the Supreme Soviet," since it would minimize 
legislative control over government ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a majority of the lawmakers approved Gorbachev's proposal in 
principle and sent it to the larger Congress of People's Deputies, which alone 
can make the necessary constitutional amendments, for final approval later this 
month.

Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammed Ershad, who seized power in a 1982 coup, 
resigned as 100,000 protesters marched through Dhaka at the start of a general 
strike called to force him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
Ershad announced that he intends to step down immediately. He called a special 
session of Parliament for Saturday to name a vice president who would head a 
caretaker government until elections, although diplomats and political 
observers questioned whether he would actually relinquish power. Ershad 
resigned after all major opposition parties rejected a peace plan he outlined 
Monday. In the past week, more than 70 people have been killed and 500 wounded 
in clashes between security forces and demonstrators opposed to his rule.

THRIFTS: FORMER CHIEF REGULATOR SAYS THE SENATOR MADE AN 'UNUSUAL' NUMBER OF 
PHONE CALLS TO URGE SALE OF LINCOLN. BUT HE INSISTS HE WAS NOT PRESSURED.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) made an "unusual" number of phone calls on behalf 
of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and was "substantially involved" in the ailing 
thrift's affairs, the nation's former top S&amp;L regulator told the Senate 
Ethics Committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But M. Danny Wall, the ex-regulator, insisted that he did not feel intimidated 
or pressured by Cranston's efforts to urge a speedy sale of the beleaguered 
Irvine-based thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel it was out of order," Wall said, referring to contacts by 
Cranston and Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who also called him in the days 
before the government seized Lincoln in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Wall acknowledged, however, that he would have been much more concerned by 
Cranston's intervention if he had been aware that Lincoln owner Charles H. 
Keating Jr. had given $850,000 to Cranston's voter registration drives. Keating 
also donated $60,000 to Cranston's campaign organization and $85,000 to the 
California Democratic Party at Cranston's request. 
</P>
<P>
"Had I known . . . I would have been very disturbed by Sen. Cranston's calls 
regarding Lincoln," Wall said in an affidavit given to the committee and 
discussed at Tuesday's hearing. "In fairness to me, had I known then what I 
know now, I probably would have reacted differently to Sen. Cranston's numerous 
contacts on behalf of Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
Wall's testimony provided new details of Cranston's aggressive efforts on 
behalf of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The California Democrat first contacted Wall in the summer of 1987 to urge that 
regulators finish a financial examination of Lincoln. He renewed the request at 
another meeting in 1988, said Wall, who was chairman of the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
When Lincoln's financial problems worsened, Cranston met with Wall in 1989 and 
called him three more times to urge speedy bank board action on proposals by 
Lincoln's owners to sell the institution. But the regulators rejected all the 
proposals on grounds that the buyer groups were fronts that would allow Keating 
to keep control of Lincoln, according to Wall. 
</P>
<P>
On April 14, 1989, the day the government seized Lincoln, Wall said, Cranston 
told him: "I think the board has made a mistake -- I hope you are right." 
Lincoln's demise will cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $2 billion, making it 
the single biggest failure among hundreds of collapsed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee is investigating whether Cranston, DeConcini and three 
other senators acted improperly by intervening on behalf of Lincoln with 
federal thrift regulators. The senators collected $1.3 million in contributions 
from Keating, who is under indictment for fraud in California and is being sued 
for more than $1 billion by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Wall testified that none of the other senators under investigation by the 
committee -- John McCain (R-Ariz.), John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle 
Jr. (D-Mich.) -- ever called him in connection with Lincoln's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's devotion to Lincoln's problems was notable, said Wall, who had been 
staff director of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, 
which was headed by Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah), when Republicans controlled the 
Senate from 1980 through 1986. He was appointed to the regulatory post by 
former President Ronald Reagan in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that it was unusual for a senator to place so many phone calls to 
me with regard to a single savings and loan institution," Wall said in his 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Garn wouldn't have done it," he said in response to questions from 
committee members. Citing his 13 years as a Senate staff member and then chief 
thrift regulator, Wall said that the "breadth and depth of Sen. Cranston's 
involvement in the affairs of a single institution also was unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Wall said Cranston suggested in his April, 1989, calls that regulators "give 
prompt consideration and approval to any legitimate proposals" for Lincoln's 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini asked for "prompt consideration but did not state that a particular 
proposal (should) be accepted," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and DeConcini have testified that they had hoped a sale could be 
achieved to preserve jobs at Lincoln and at the thrift's Arizona-based parent 
firm, American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said he did not remember specific details of his conversations with 
Cranston and DeConcini but insisted he never felt they were trying to pressure 
him improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Terry Sanford (D-N.C.), one of the six members of the Ethics Committee, 
asked Wall: "Sens. Cranston and DeConcini did not ask you to do anything in an 
improper way . . . and you were not influenced by them?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's correct," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Ethics Committee member, Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), asked a series of 
questions about whether any of the five senators had asked Wall to slow down 
enforcement efforts or to provide special help for Lincoln. To each question, 
Wall replied, "no." 
</P>
<P>
Wall's testimony contrasted with the comments of his predecessor as chief 
thrift regulator, Edwin Gray Jr., who told the committee that he felt 
intimidated during an April, 1987, meeting with four of the senators.

SHUTTLE TELESCOPES BACK IN BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: THE PROBLEM WITH POINTING SYSTEM IS FIXED. INSTRUMENTS ARE NOW ABLE TO 
FIND AND 'LOCK ON' TO TARGETS IN DISTANT SKY.

<P>
Scientists who had been frustrated for two days by control problems with four 
telescopes aboard the space shuttle Columbia won the upper hand late Tuesday 
and began their historic observations of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finally there," Jack Jones, manager of the Astro Observatory mission, 
said after a sensitive system aboard the shuttle that guides the telescopes was 
able to automatically find and "lock on" to targets in the distant sky. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a historic moment," astronomer Jeffrey A. Hoffman, a member of Columbia's 
crew, told Mission Control after the Astro telescopes, for the first time, 
switched automatically from one target to another. That had been an elusive 
goal for crewmen aboard the Columbia, who had been forced to guide the 
telescopes manually, a time-consuming process that often failed. 
</P>
<P>
The successful maneuver was a major turning point in a program that is designed 
to give scientists their first prolonged look at the universe as disclosed by 
light that is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Three of the telescopes 
aboard Columbia study objects in ultraviolet light, and the fourth is an X-ray 
telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Had the pointing system failed, a mission that some scientists have been 
working on for more than a decade would have been in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"I can smile now," mission scientist Ted Gull said late Tuesday. "We have an 
observatory. It's coming alive." 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly the way it seemed for Arthur D. Code, principal investigator on 
the University of Wisconsin's telescope. Code has been trying to study the 
universe in ultraviolet light -- which is emitted by violent, hot objects -- 
for most of his career. But Tuesday, the silver-haired scientist said he had 
acquired more data in a few hours with his orbiting telescope than he had 
during his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
"We were impatient," he said, referring to the frustration that was beginning 
to grip scientists here as they watched irreplaceable time slip away from them. 
</P>
<P>
Several times, engineers and scientists thought they had solved their problems, 
only to have the telescopes drift off target. Some were clearly becoming 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real roller coaster," said astronomer Jeff Clayton of the 
University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Astro was not the only event on the schedule for the crew members of the 
Columbia. They also paused to gaze out the window and take a look at their 
neighbors. The Soviet space station Mir passed about 30 miles over the 
Columbia, and it will do so several times during the mission, a reminder of 
just how crowded space is becoming. 
</P>
<P>
There are five men aboard the Mir, including a Japanese television reporter, 
and seven aboard Columbia, making a record total of 12 persons in space at the 
same time. None of them, however, are women. 
</P>
<P>
The first day of collecting scientific data saw more of a trickle than a flood 
because the problems with the control system limited the use of the telescopes 
for most of the day. Scientists expect to hit high gear today. 
</P>
<P>
The Astro observatory's four telescopes all work in concert, so scientists are 
getting various types of data simultaneously on each target. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the instruments, Goddard Space Flight Center's Ultraviolet Imaging 
Telescope, actually takes pictures, and those will not be processed until after 
the shuttle lands. The other three all produce graphics that tell astronomers 
much about the chemical composition, temperature and even dynamics of distant 
celestial objects. 
</P>
<P>
By putting all that data together, scientists hope to be able to say much about 
such things as the evolution of the universe, the existence of black holes and 
even the nature of invisible matter that many believe makes up more than 90% of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists would like to keep Astro in orbit for months, but the mission will 
end Tuesday, as planned, according to top officials with the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 8:47 p.m. 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia is commanded by Vance D. Brand. The other members of the crew are 
Guy S. Gardner, the pilot, John M. Lounge, Robert A. R. (Bob) Parker, Samuel T. 
Durrance and Ronald A. Parise.

DEATH PROVES AN INDIFFERENT TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GORDON PARKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1948, after a brief stint at Vogue, Gordon Parks landed a staff job at Life 
magazine. His first assignment, a photo-story about gang warfare in Harlem, 
established his reputation as a world-class photojournalist. Here is Part IV of 
a five-part excerpt from his autobiography, "Voices in the Mirror." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most blacks were weighted with the denial of opportunity, but I had been 
fortunate to be able to shove aside those restrictive boundaries. Now what I 
wanted was what so many photographers, black and white, found almost impossible 
to get: a staff job at Life magazine. That publication wasn't exactly 
trumpeting the black man's cause, but it would be a prestigious base for me to 
work from since it was so well known and reached millions of readers throughout 
the world. So one morning I took my portfolio to Wilson Hicks, the magazine's 
picture editor, and asked for a job. Miraculously, he decided to give me a try. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks later explained his decision to me: "There was a scarcity of documentary 
photographers on the staff, and none with fashion experience, and we sorely 
needed someone to cover the Paris collections. It was that simple." 
</P>
<P>
But even later I learned it wasn't that simple. Hicks had to be cajoled into my 
acceptance by two senior editors, John Dille and Sally Kirkland, who ran the 
fashion department. I could serve both their needs. Dille wanted a powerful 
documentary story for an upcoming issue, and she was frantically preparing for 
the French collections. 
</P>
<P>
Eyeing me with skepticism, Hicks had thrown out a question that caught me off 
guard. "Have you something in mind that you'd like to do?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I do," I lied, never expecting things would get so far so quickly. "A 
gang war is taking place up in Harlem, and I'd like to cover it." Then 
hurriedly I concocted a deeper reason. "Such a story might help black kids 
realize the folly in murdering one another." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks wasn't impressed. It would be easier to freeze snowballs in hell, he 
replied dryly. But after a terribly long moment he caved in. "OK, I'll go along 
with that idea, but I can only offer you $500." 
</P>
<P>
"So little?" I was astounded. 
</P>
<P>
Dille cut in quickly. "Take it -- just take it. Everything will work out." 
Reluctantly I agreed to the price. It was an opening. 
</P>
<P>
Once outside Hicks' office, Dille assured me that I would work with an 
unlimited expense account. This made very good sense. It had been a tense 
session, but both Sally and John were contented, and I was secretly ecstatic -- 
yet apprehensive as well. It was indeed a tough assignment, and I was now 
struck with the impossibility of pulling it off. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning I drove up to Harlem in search of a gang leader. It was like 
searching for a bubble in the sea. For a week I drove around up there, with 
Hicks' doubts overlapping my own. Why would any sensible gang leader, having 
just blown away somebody, want his face spread over the pages of Life magazine? 
And why should he take me, a stranger, into his confidence? Doggedly, I kept on 
with the search. 
</P>
<P>
I was at the 125th Street police precinct one morning talking with a detective 
friend, Jimmie Morrow, when luck arrived in the person of a 16-year-old, 
freckled-faced boy with a prizefighter's build and demeanor. The obscenities he 
was hurling at the desk sergeant were strong enough to get his head cracked, 
but the sergeant sat quietly, red-faced. 
</P>
<P>
Amazed, I turned and looked at Jimmie questioningly. He smiled. "That's your 
man if you can talk him into it." 
</P>
<P>
Red Jackson was the Harlem gang leader. Now the crown prince of the Midtowners, 
he was cursing out the desk sergeant for failing to give his gang the 
protection it had been promised -- not from the police, but from a rival gang 
that had killed a Midtowner the day before. 
</P>
<P>
The police, recognizing him as the most powerful leader in the slaughter that 
was taking place, had asked him to pull back and help cool things off. Now, 
having lost one of his gang, he was giving vent to his anger. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks to follow, I found how indifferent death could be in this warring 
place, where honor meant spilling blood over the most trivial thing -- an 
accidental bump on the shoulder, a dispute over a stolen bicycle, an invasion 
of the wrong territory, a girl's innocent wink or a game of stickball. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers, talking death, took blood oaths to die together. Mothers feared a 
knock at the door, afraid it was the police to say that a son was dead. All the 
Midtowners had knife or bullet wounds, and they wore them with bravura. They 
were like badges of courage. Such passionate allegiance, Red explained, had 
good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for protection. You wise up fast here in Harlem. You join up with 
somebody or keep getting your a. . . kicked. They say, 'You belong to a gang, 
cat?' 'No.' 'You got some loot?' 'No. I ain't got none.' Then -- Bop! Bop! Bop! 
'Next time you better have some!' If you've got some the next time, they take 
it and you get bopped anyway. If you're a Midtowner, they think twice before 
starting any (trouble) 'cause they know they'll have to rumble." 
</P>
<P>
The Midtowners were about to settle matters with the Harlem Dukes. One had 
called Red's sister a bitch and had spit on her shoe. She didn't know his name; 
no matter, that was reason enough for a rumble. The point of encounter was on 
Eighth Avenue near 135th Street, less than two blocks from the 135th police 
precinct. 
</P>
<P>
We left the car at 125th Street, met 12 other Midtowners and started walking. 
Red, wearing dark glasses and an old trench coat I had given him, looked every 
bit the leader. The others, packing revolvers, zip guns and chains, moved along 
stealthily. Red had given orders two hours before, and they were ready. A 
police car passed, slowed, then went on. 
</P>
<P>
I was carrying a small camera the Life technicians had rigged up. The infrared 
flash, they told me, would hardly be discernible -- just a small flicker of 
light in the darkness. My feelings were split. Those of the reporter pulsed for 
action. Yet, in human terms, I worried about the possible consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Swiftly and silently, the Midtowners walked into rival territory. Then Red's 
hand shot up, signaling us to stop. He gave a quick nod of his head, and three 
of the most powerful of them slammed their weight against a basement door. My 
nerves were scrambling as we broke into the Dukes' den, taking them by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger Johnson, the rival leader, leaped to his feet, but before he could grab a 
lead pipe, Red knocked him to the floor with a brutal right. The Midtowners 
aimed their weapons, and seven of the Dukes stood motionless as Red put a 
switchblade to Tiger's throat. "Which one of you bastards spit on my sister?" 
</P>
<P>
Tiger's eyes snapped toward a boy crouching beside him, "I'm sorry, man," the 
boy mumbled. 
</P>
<P>
"Get to your feet, punk!" Red ordered. The boy rose slowly with fear in his 
eyes, and fear was bolting through me as well. "Open your shirt, punk!" The boy 
opened the buttons at his chest. When Red placed the point of the blade just 
above his heart I snapped the shutter and froze. "Say it again, punk, and make 
it loud." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, man!" Sweat was rolling down his face and chest. Red flicked the 
blade upward for about a quarter of an inch. The boy moaned as a thin trickle 
of blood came, and I felt like turning away. "You're lucky I don't cut out your 
(expletive) heart and make you eat it!" Inwardly I sighed a sigh of relief. He 
spat on the boy's chest and dropped him with a terrible right. 
</P>
<P>
"Frisk these other punks!" That was done quickly with expertise, then we backed 
out of the place -- with the Midtowners' arsenal swelled by four pistols, five 
knives and six zip guns. Then we were out of the block as swiftly and silently 
as we had come. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Joey, a Midtowners' war lord, was knifed to death by the 
Sabers, another gang. On the third day, Red and Herbie, his chief war 
counselor, went to the funeral home where Joey's body lay. "You had better 
travel light," Red had warned me. "We may have to do some running." I went as 
lightly burdened as possible, wearing a pair of sneakers. Only Red and Herbie 
went in to see the body. The others waited outside to stand guard in case the 
Sabers showed up. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, we were running from an attempted Saber ambush, and people 
were hurrying for shelter as we fled to an empty second-story hide-out to 
escape the Sabers. 
</P>
<P>
Once there, Red knocked out a window, reached for his .38 and prepared to start 
firing. From a dark corner, I photographed him. It was that photograph that 
made him known throughout the world. Further violence was avoided when two 
police cars from the 135th Street precinct careened into the block. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve days later, a Saber was killed, but a Midtowner's stomach was badly 
slashed during that rumble. Since the police would be searching the hospitals, 
two of the Midtowners stitched the gaping wound together with needle and 
thread. 
</P>
<P>
I had seen enough bloodshed to last me a lifetime, and I believed I had the 
story I had come for. Two weeks later, the Red Jackson story was on the stands. 
</P>
<P>
There had been some contention between the editors and myself during the layout 
of the story. They had wanted to show Red on the cover with a smoking gun in 
his hand. I fought against it, even destroyed the negative to be sure it wasn't 
used for such a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
I had tried to lay the horror of gang war before the nation, hoping that 
somehow a way could be found to end it. Perhaps someone paid attention; the 
following year passed with just a few Harlem gang murders. For the time being, 
it seemed that youth's killing of youth was slowly coming to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 40 years later, hard drugs had become the rainbow, and again youthful 
gangs roam city streets killing one another -- protecting their little kingdoms 
of heroin and crack. Gunfire erupts nightly, and unfortunately black teen-agers 
are caught dead-center of the catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
Despair settles in and they try burning it out with alcohol and hard drugs. In 
a short time they fade into mere shadows of themselves, into nothingness, then 
early death. Spun from the loom of such disaster is a remarkably cold 
statistic. The average black male in Harlem is fortunate to live past the age 
of 40. Pausing now to look back, I see myself in the distance -- leaving there 
with a sigh of thankfulness. 
</P>
<P>
Red Jackson's fate was less final than it had seemed when I found him leading 
the Midtowners in Harlem back in 1948. After almost 40 years, a letter came 
assuring me that, for him, time had beneficently wielded its power. With 
learned humility he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Gordon: I saw my picture in Life again the other day, and it brought back 
some bad memories. That story was a big ego trip for me. At 56, I've been 
through the mill, and along the way I've met dozens of ghetto kids who wound up 
the same way I did. Now, with your help, I would like to reach some of them and 
tell them how quickly glory faded from me, and that there's a much better way 
to go. I might wind up saving some of them. Even one would be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to help a few Harlem kids to get an education. That's the key: 
Education! Would you believe that at my age I'm preparing to take the test for 
my High School Equivalency Diploma? I love it! And I'd love to hear from you 
again. Yours truly, Red Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
A door from Red's sordid past has finally opened up, and he had chosen to walk 
through it to a better kind of life. Time had deceived both of us. Now I could 
firmly believe he would make it -- something that I had for so long doubted. 
The letter had been dated Jan. 5, 1987. He had taken a long step from his old 
unhappiness.

YOU SAY YOU WANT SERVICE ?; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY TO GET SERVICE, SAYS 'CUSTOMER 
TERRORIST' PETER GLEN, AND THAT'S TO STAND UP AND DEMAND DECENT TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Glen, the country's self-proclaimed "customer terrorist," is loose in 
Beverly Center. He's lying in wait for an AWOL salesclerk in the holiday 
decorations section of a big department store. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most important department in the store right now and nobody's here!" 
he bellows, noting that this is more evidence of The Great Retailing Suicide of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
But Glen doesn't just huff off. Rather, the author of "It's Not My Department! 
How to Get the Service You Want, Exactly the Way You Want It," waits to see 
just how long it takes to get some help. 
</P>
<P>
He's used to this sort of challenge. Indeed, he gets paid $5,000 a day to 
sample and critique service from the customer's point of view. Then he suggests 
ways to shape things up. A New York-based retailing consultant, he's been at 
this for 25 of his 51 years, working with such clients as Bloomingdale's, 
Esprit and General Foods. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his William Morrow book, Glen has catalogued both the horrors and the 
triumphs of his customer service surveys in such chapters as "A Nation of 
Whiners," "The Rudeness Sweepstakes," "The Meek Will Inherit Nothing," "Keep 
Your Mints Off My Pillow," "Things an Airline Doesn't Want You to Know" and 
"Brain Surgery at Home." In the book, he provides numerous tips for doing 
end-runs around potential disasters, such as booking an alternate flight the 
moment you learn yours has been delayed. (For other tactics, see accompanying 
story on E5). 
</P>
<P>
Today, in the holiday decorations department, the service delay has lasted 
nearly 10 minutes. Finally, the clerk shows up and Glen asks where she's been. 
</P>
<P>
A beatific grin appears on her face. 
</P>
<P>
"Shhhh! Don't tell anybody," she says with a finger pressed to her lips. "I've 
been shopping. There's a $2,000 bedroom suite I want to buy. So I visit it 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
It's never easy when nit-picking Peter Glen comes to call. "He's a consultant 
who doesn't act like a consultant. He doesn't hesitate to point up your 
weaknesses and give you a kick in the seat. He's like that Mennen Skin Bracer 
commercial where the guy slaps his face and says, 'Thanks, I needed that,' " 
reports Kenneth Banks, vice president of marketing and communication for Eckerd 
Drugs, a chain of 1,700 drugstores throughout the Southeast and Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Glen would agree. He volunteers that many people, his clients included, think 
of him as an "opinionated (expletive)." 
</P>
<P>
According to Banks, the folks at Eckerd survived and apparently profited from 
working with Glen, but "it was painful for several people here. A lot of people 
were outraged." 
</P>
<P>
However, Banks found that after his colleagues got past the initial sting of 
Glen's critiques, they saw "a very insightful, sensitive individual who has 
keen feelings for the way people feel and how to motivate them. Four years 
later, our chairman is still quoting Glen." 
</P>
<P>
In most of the stores that Glen visits, the service is just as he predicts. 
Nobody tries to provide him with any more assistance than, "Hi. How are you?" 
At every stop he acts eager to buy, but he has to demand that he be helped. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to miss Glen, who is dressed this day in a peacock blue jacket, 
matching cummerbund, white tuxedo shirt loose at the collar, white pleated 
pants and white sneakers. But this spirited, white-haired elf of a man is 
ignored when he hangs over the counter in an eyeglasses boutique, his body 
posture silently daring a clerk to get off the phone and wait on him. (The 
clerk doesn't budge.) 
</P>
<P>
In a pet store, Glen repeatedly asks why the "patio kittens" are called patio 
kittens -- and not bedroom kittens or kitchen kittens. He rephrases his 
question three times, giving a young woman three opportunities to say, "I'll 
find out." Instead, she keeps saying, "I don't know." When he finally advises 
her to ask someone else, she comes back with an answer that Glen says is so 
good it could generate a sale: "We call them patio kittens because it sounds 
better than mutts." 
</P>
<P>
In another department store, Glen is so miffed by the prolonged lack of 
attention that he creates a scene. He repeatedly yells "Help!" until a clerk 
rushes over. 
</P>
<P>
"I just did not know how long we could stand here without getting your 
attention," Glen explains, indignantly. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I was writing something. It would have been a few minutes," replies the 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you're writing, how can you sell?" Glen demands. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm doing both," says the clerk, anger seeping into his voice. "If I 
saw somebody who needed help, I'd give them help. I didn't know that you needed 
help." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I screamed 'Help! OK?" 
</P>
<P>
"OK," says the salesman. "No problem." 
</P>
<P>
Glen walks away, mocking the clerk. "No problem." Then he adds, "It's a big 
problem. . . . He is completely enraged, offended and he sold nothing." 
</P>
<P>
It's pointed out to Glen that the young man must do something right. He is 
wearing a badge on his jacket proclaiming he was a top salesman of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The author is unimpressed: "It said 1939!" 
</P>
<P>
Glen does find some good service in the Beverly Center. He praises the 
good-humored clerks in a card shop. And in a branch of a well-known athletic 
shoe chain, he notes that the sales clerks are trained to always stand near the 
front of the store and can be fired if they are caught sitting down, chewing 
gum or committing other sins of service. 
</P>
<P>
Glen acknowledges that Beverly Center is reputed to be one of the most 
prosperous retailing meccas in the country. Situated between Beverly Hills and 
Melrose Avenue, it is well known as L.A.'s hippest mall. As for its service, 
Glen allows that it's "not worse than any other place, but it's not as good as 
it could be." 
</P>
<P>
Says Larry Beerman, Beverly Center's general manager, "Given the thesis of his 
book, I'm not surprised that he could come to that conclusion. You can find 
examples of bad service anywhere. . . . Beverly Center is a very successful 
shopping center that didn't get that way by giving out poor service. We're 
continuing to see sales increases over last year." 
</P>
<P>
Why does good service seem to be harder to come by these days? 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody gives a damn. Nothing is anybody's department anymore," Glen contends, 
between bites of swordfish. (Before embarking upon Beverly Center he 
successfully challenges a fancy restaurant across the street to serve lunch in 
20 minutes start to finish. He's delighted and tells the waitress: "We thought 
you'd say, 'It's not in our image to feed you in 20 minutes.' ") 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a 'service economy,' but there is no service," Glen continues. 
"Servers don't serve. And customers put up with it. They don't expect service, 
and they don't get service. It's certainly because clerks are not well-paid and 
because they don't work on commission. Also, management tolerates it. That's a 
very important factor. And it's because people have no pride in their work. But 
the root is that they don't care about themselves . . . . They are allowed not 
to give a damn by management and they are allowed to not give a damn by 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
Glen's solution is for service providers to study the customer, anticipate and 
meet his needs -- and then get out of his face. And he counsels that attitude 
adjustment is free: "You can be sick. You can be in all kinds of trouble. And 
still do your job and have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Even at what many people (authors anyway) consider a loathsome job -- book 
promotion. Before he set out on his first coast-to-coast publicity tour, Glen 
was forewarned it would be an ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about it and decided yes, it will be strenuous to be in a different 
city every day and be clever and witty and charming all the time," he says. 
"Then I realized, I'm going on a tour of this whole country -- as a sort of 
celebrity until proven otherwise. This is what I asked for!" 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Michigan clothing manufacturer, Glen started his career running 
the firm's factory outlet and also worked selling goods to other stores around 
the country. In all his years of retail consulting, he estimates that he's 
reached about a million listeners in talks and seminars. 
</P>
<P>
Until the book. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week I talked to 13 million people (through various media appearances and 
interviews)," he calculates. "I figured out it would take me 120 years to reach 
that many people at my former rate of speed." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Glen offers a chapter he calls "The Worst Service Story I Ever 
Heard." It is the tale of an airline passenger sick with diabetes and cancer, a 
man whose legs had been amputated along with his hips and tail bone. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the man's trip, Glen writes, a cabin attendant was so clumsy 
lifting him into his seat that his pants fell off, exposing him to other 
passengers. The airline lost his prosthetic pillow so he couldn't sit up during 
the flight -- or during the next four days of his trip. As a result, the man 
developed bleeding bedsores. 
</P>
<P>
For three hours after the plane landed, baggage attendants couldn't find the 
man's wheelchair, which had been mistakenly abandoned in an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
On the man's return flight, his plane was delayed for 6 1/2 hours. He and two 
family members traveling with him were finally booked onto another flight and 
advised that all the special arrangements they'd made would be honored if 
they'd just hand a computer printout to the gate agents. But, because the plane 
was booked solid, the family's bulkhead seat assignments were not honored and 
the man was left teetering on a cart on the plane while the rest of the 
passengers boarded. 
</P>
<P>
When the man's daughter protested this treatment, she was told, "If he's that 
sick, he should be in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
What can be done to ensure that such scenes don't happen again? 
</P>
<P>
Says Glen, "Managers should give individual responsibility (to employees). They 
should reward individual action. They should promote individual pride. They 
should discipline individual sloppiness." 
</P>
<P>
Glen's own Worst Beverly Center Service Story comes, of course, where he can 
least afford it. He strolls into one of the mall's two bookstores and asks for 
his own book by title. 
</P>
<P>
The first person he talks with tells him, essentially, that his inquiry doesn't 
fall in her department. She recommends that he see the person at the 
information counter. 
</P>
<P>
The information counter attendant finds the title on microfiche and says it 
should be with the marketing books. It's not there, nor is it in the "New 
Releases" section. 
</P>
<P>
"It could also be jammed deep in the business section," Glen advises, telling 
her that he knows that the book is supposed to be in every branch of the 
bookstore chain this week, selling at 25% discount and displayed with other 
"New Releases." 
</P>
<P>
He is invited to come back and check again in a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't. I live in New York," he replies. 
</P>
<P>
Dejected, he leaves the store. But on the way out, Glen's publicist discovers 
the book, buried in a display at the entrance to the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it! They don't know what's in their (store)." Now Glen wants 
to see the manager. "This is an outrage," he says, describing what happened. 
"Your employees do not know where anything is." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we're having a book signing right now," the manager apologizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that an excuse? 'We're having a book signing right now'?" 
</P>
<P>
The manager tries a different approach: "This must have just come in." 
</P>
<P>
"So what?" yells Glen. "Why would they tell me, after checking the microfiche, 
that it's with the sales and marketing books, which is a lie. Why wouldn't the 
clerks or even the managers look at the front of the store from time to time?" 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if they would lie to you," says the manager. "It's not like we're 
trying to trick anybody." 
</P>
<P>
"Just thought I'd mention it," replies Glen. 
</P>
<P>
But isn't there a nicer way to get things done? A more diplomatic way to get 
the same results, something less on the order of Bart Simpson and more like 
Bill Cosby? Doesn't Glen ever think back and say, "Gee, if I'd done this a 
little differently . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he says, acknowledging that it is possible and preferable to get things 
done without being a pain. But he contends that, if you have to, it's better to 
be irritating than to swallow the insult of lousy customer service. 
</P>
<P>
"It is astonishing how people won't fight," he observes. "They'll just do 
anything rather than fight, including giving up their souls and their property 
and their seats and their rights. . . . And that has a lot to do with the real 
epic tragedy of service in this country, which is a country that doesn't work, 
a budget that can't be balanced and banks that don't work and telescopes that 
can't see and bombs that cost $170 million each and land 150 miles west of 
their targets. 
</P>
<P>
"We (expletive) up everything. How about the graffiti that says, 'If you are 
over 18 and you can read this, you must be Japanese?' " 
</P>
<P>
Instead of settling for mediocrity, Glen wants people to start fighting back, 
even if they make a few enemies in the process. He claims it's healthier for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you as a customer get an insult and you swallow it instead of 
spitting it out, you get another ulcer," he warns. "The most ulcerated people 
in America are the ones who are the nicest. They're the ones who put up with 
the most. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wrong. I don't think you should be nasty and give other people 
ulcers. I think you just demand your rights." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glen's Tips for Service 
</P>
<P>
GETTING YOUR DOCTOR TO SEE YOU ON TIME: "You go to your doctor and you say, 
'Dr. Fox, I am the customer and I hate waiting. You always make me wait. How 
can we solve this? I can be your first patient of the day. . . . I will 
calculate the average amount of time that you make me wait and I will always 
come that many minutes late to my appointment, or I will charge you for my 
waiting time. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
"If that doesn't work, tell the doctor that you are going to change doctors, 
and ask him how much he values your business. He may tell you that he has a 
waiting list a mile long. Then you must decide if it's important enough to 
change doctors." 
</P>
<P>
GETTING A REFUND: "When you go to a store to get a refund, or when you have to 
call an insurance company because you think your bills are all wrong, prepare 
for battle. . . . Arm yourself with everything: correspondence, receipts, even 
tape recordings if you've got them. If you prepare as if you were going to 
defend your life to a jury, with facts, passion and determination, you might 
cut your waiting time in half. Let them know the faster and more efficiently 
they do it, the sooner it will be over." 
</P>
<P>
GETTING INSTANT SERVICE: "Just go into a store, and when you find that you 
can't get help, just stand there and scream the word (help) as loud as you can. 
You will see people come running who haven't moved in years. . . . Screaming 
help at the top of your lungs . . . confronts the situation, calls a halt to 
routine and starts alarms ringing everywhere. You get attention, suddenly and 
completely. . . . They will sing to you, if that's what you want, or anything 
else you want, as long as you don't do that again." 
</P>

DREAMING OF A GREEN CHRISTMAS; 
</P>
<P>
VANILLA ICE SALES POINT THE WAY TOWARD A SOLID SEASON FOR RECORD INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's going to be a Vanilla Christmas for the record industry. 
</P>
<P>
Vanilla Ice -- the first white solo star in the predominantly black rap-music 
world -- is heating up the cash registers, leading the way in what is looking 
to be a healthy season for the music business, even as other retailers are 
complaining about consumer caution resulting from uncertainty about the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years we have been kind of a recession-proof industry," said Mario 
DeFillipo, senior vice president in charge of purchasing for the Michigan-based 
Handleman Co., which services the music departments of more than 5,000 stores 
such as K mart in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Like many retail industries, the music business -- which generated a record 
$6.5 billion in U.S. sales in 1989 -- generally counts on the holidays for 
about 25% of its take. This year sales appear to be right on track to meet, if 
not beat, last year's, both for the season and the whole year. Figures compiled 
by the Recording Industry Assn. of America show music sales in the first half 
of 1990 at $3.5 billion, up 15% from 1989's $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that some businesses are experiencing severe down-trends," 
DeFillipo said. "But that doesn't seem to be the case in our industry. The 
encouraging part of it is there is a very broad assortment of (music styles) 
out there selling extremely well." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Lee, director of music purchasing for Los Angeles-based Wherehouse 
Entertainment's 284-store chain, noted initial customer hesitancy right after 
Thanksgiving, traditionally the start of the Christmas buying season. But Lee 
said that business has already begun to pick up and that he expects a strong 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a later Christmas than usual, but that was 
predictable," he said. "And the sale items had a higher increase of business 
than usual, which leads me to think that the customers are looking for a 
bargain more than before." 
</P>
<P>
But Lee and his counterparts at the other music chains and distributors 
surveyed report strong sales in both youth and adult demographics. And despite 
the bargain-hunting, many of the lavish, higher-ticket boxed sets that have 
proliferated this year are doing well, notably career anthologies of Led 
Zeppelin, Frank Sinatra and Elton John. 
</P>
<P>
But everywhere the top story is the same: Ice. 
</P>
<P>
"By far our No. 1 is Vanilla Ice -- it's in a class by itself," said Lee. "The 
second is not even close." 
</P>
<P>
Vanilla Ice's debut "To the Extreme" is the runaway top seller, with U.S. sales 
of more than 4 million copies in less than three months. Among those clustered 
behind it are 1990's biggest hit, fellow pop-rapper M.C. Hammer's "Please 
Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em," the smooth pop-soul of newcomer Mariah Carey, proven 
hit Whitney Houston and the Brazilian-influenced hybrid of Paul Simon's "Rhythm 
of the Saints." 
</P>
<P>
"Rap is hottest," said Dick Odette, vice president of purchasing for 
Minneapolis-based Music-land, which operates 780 Music-land and Sam Goody's 
stores. "Country is doing quite well, too. Basically it's two guys -- Garth 
Brooks and Clint Black." 
</P>
<P>
The strength of country music nationwide may be the surprise of the year. In 
addition to dominating the country world, Brooks and Black are both in the Top 
20 on the pop charts, where country acts are rarely found. K.T. Oslin's new 
"Love in a Small Town" album is also off to a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
After several years as the leading sales genre, hard rock is having an off 
year, with few releases among the top sellers. Only AC/DC, Warrant, Poison and 
the Led Zeppelin boxed set are showing strongly now. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot of metal in there anymore," Odette said. "There really 
hasn't been a lot in it all year, for some reason. The rap genre's eaten into 
it, apparently." 
</P>
<P>
John Kundrat, senior buyer of Santa Ana's Abbey Road, a wholesaler that 
services more than 1,000 independent record stores worldwide, said that the 
weakness in the hard-rock market is just "a matter of timing." 
</P>
<P>
"A month or two from now Cinderella and Scorpions could be up near the top," he 
said, referring to two just-released albums. 
</P>
<P>
But the lack of big-selling hard-rock entries has not dimmed the industry's 
Christmas lights so far. Music retail confidence was bolstered by a strong 
November as many of the current best-sellers first hit the stores. On that 
surge, stores ordered heavily for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"Our November was up about 25% from last year's," Kundrat said. "I would think 
our clients are concerned about the economy. You can't help it. But there's 
been a lot of good new releases and that made November a good month." 
</P>
<P>
One thing this season hasn't produced are big bombs. Without many new superstar 
releases -- no Michael Jacksons or Bruce Springsteens, though Madonna's 
"Immaculate Collection" greatest-hits package is doing very well -- 
expectations for most new product are relatively modest. 
</P>
<P>
The only big name that may be doing a little less than expected is Debbie 
Gibson, whose new "Anything Is Possible" is off to a so-so start, moving to No. 
50 on Billboard's pop album chart in its second week. Whitney Houston's "I'm 
Your Baby Tonight," on the other hand, debuted at No. 22 two weeks ago and is 
No. 3 this week. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to have to be more awareness of the Gibson album," said 
Wherehouse's Lee. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise hit right now may well be "Reflections of Passion," an 
album by New Age artist Yanni. The album has been out for nine months, but just 
this week cracked the Billboard Top 100. Lee said that the album was the 12th 
biggest seller at Wherehouse stores during the week of Thanksgiving. But the 
jump was not due to Christmas shoppers' needing soothing sounds, but to 
old-fashioned media exposure and star power. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lee, "He was on Oprah and all the other talk shows with his girlfriend -- 
Linda Evans."

AN UNCOMMON MARKET FOR U.S. ENTERTAINMENT; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE: EUROPE BUYS HOLLYWOOD'S GOODS TO THE TUNE OF $1 BILLION ANNUALLY, BUT 
SOME EUROPEANS ARE PUSHING FOR IMPORT LIMITS TO CURTAIL WHAT THEY SEE AS A 
THREAT TO TRADITIONAL VALUES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American looking for a taste of home need only turn to the entertainment 
listings in the local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood movies ranging from "The Little Mermaid" to "Total Recall" are 
playing, dubbed or subtitled, on 19 of the 27 screens at the Kinepolis, 
Europe's largest multiplex. A typical evening's television fare includes 
current U.S. prime-time favorites, steamy American soap operas and 
long-ago-canceled sitcoms from the studios of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Europe's growing purchases of movies and television programs account for almost 
$1 billion in sales annually for the big Hollywood studios and independent 
producers, and have become an important means of shoring up their bottom lines. 
</P>
<P>
But European leaders say they fear that such a steady diet of "Falcon Crest" 
and "Mr. Ed" threatens to undermine culture and traditions built over 
centuries. Already, some countries have moved to impose their own quotas, and 
the European Community's 12 member countries in October adopted a resolution 
recommending limits on the amount of U.S. programming that may be shown on 
European television stations once the Continent becomes a single market at the 
end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We are entitled to ensure that our culture somehow will be preserved," said 
Nico Wegter, spokesman for EC Trade Minister Frans Andriessen. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, dismisses 
such arguments about culture as "a disguise. Everybody in the business knows 
they are talking about commerce." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is on the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) agenda here 
this week, as negotiators from 107 countries meet in the final days of an 
ambitious four-year round of talks aimed at revamping the entire worldwide 
trading system. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans have insisted that anything relating to culture be excluded from 
the final agreement, which would leave them free to go their own way in 
limiting foreign films and TV shows with less fear of retaliation. The United 
States thus far has said it will oppose such an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti has been here, lobbying furiously to make sure that the agreement makes 
it clear that quotas on entertainment and other cultural products such as books 
are not allowed under the final agreement, if there is one. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when other American businesses have lost ground against foreign 
competition, this country's unquestioned domination of the worldwide 
entertainment market is "a most precious American trade jewel" that provides a 
$3-billion trade surplus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Valenti said, he has gotten no indication that the Europeans may be 
flexible on the issue: "What I'm saying is going over the gentlemen's heads, 
and what they are saying is going over mine." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills has offered "total support," Valenti 
added. However, recent experience suggests that the cultural quotas issue is 
one that the United States may be willing to bargain on in the final hours of 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
One source recalls that when the United States struck a free-trade agreement 
with Canada a few years ago, Secretary of State James A. Baker III telephoned 
Valenti at home at midnight and said: "I'm sorry, Jack. We had to throw you 
overboard." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the United States agreed that it was permissible for Canada to 
impose trade quotas it deemed necessary to protect its culture. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to assure that this does not happen again, Valenti has enlisted the aid 
of 34 senators, who have written to Hills warning that they would view a trade 
agreement as "seriously flawed" if it allows the Europeans to limit their 
imports of foreign culture. Thus, they suggest that congressional approval of 
the trade agreement could hinge in part on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
The EC directive approved in October asks that broadcasters reserve at least 
half of their transmission time for European shows. That directive is 
non-binding, and does not cover time devoted to news, sports, game shows and 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Andriessen insists that the 50% target would actually allow an increase in U.S. 
programming, because current levels overall amount to only 40%. 
</P>
<P>
But that figure masks wide variation within Europe. Local producers are 
responsible for 80% of French programming, and the 50% target could open that 
market up to many U.S. producers. Many other European countries already accept 
more than half of their programming from overseas, however, and the new EC 
position could pressure them to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. entertainment industry officials also warn that the 50% target could be 
the first step toward mandatory limits. France, for example, has argued for 
mandatory quotas of 60% European-produced programming. If that standard went 
into effect, one 1988 study suggested that well over half of European stations 
would have to reduce their U.S. programming. 
</P>
<P>
European countries have moved to restrict the showing of U.S. movies in their 
theaters as well. Italy, for example, requires its theaters to show Italian 
films at least 100 days a year, and is planning to increase the quota to 120 
days, Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
He and other officials have noted that it is difficult to determine how exactly 
to interpret the quotas. How, for example, would a country account for a movie 
made by a U.S. production company, with an Italian crew, from a British 
screenplay, with French actors? 
</P>
<P>
However they are used in practice, Valenti said, "the quotas are there. They 
are as visible as a boil on your nose -- and twice as painful."

PANEL URGES L.A. TO BUY THEATRE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A Community Redevelopment Agency committee recommended Monday that the city 
purchasethe Los Angeles Theatre Center "in the most cost-efficient manner." 
</P>
<P>
The city agency has spent more than $20 million constructing and operating the 
downtown facility at 514 S. Spring St. and has an option to buy it from the 
private investment trust that holds the title. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's board will meet Thursday to consider the committee report, which 
also advocated that the board allot money for the theater's next property tax 
payment, due Monday, and its continuing facility operating expenses through 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Notably missing from the board's recommendations was any mention of a $388,031 
bond payment on the building, due Dec. 15. The agency previously has made the 
bond payments for the facility's owners. The City Council recently approved the 
Dec. 15 payment, but the agency's board decided to withhold the money until 
hearing a report on the theater center's future from a commission appointed by 
Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
That commission's conclusions have not yet been officially released, but they 
reportedly propose that the city spend $4.6 million to retire the bonds and 
acquire the building. 
</P>
<P>
If the bonds go into default because of failure to make the Dec. 15 payment, 
the city would "absolutely" be in a better bargaining position in its bid to 
buy the building, said agency chairman Jim Wood, who also heads the agency's 
theater center committee.

MILLI VANILLI GRAMMY WILL GO UNAWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There will be no 1989 Grammy for best new artist. 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences' board of trustees has 
voted to leave the Grammy -- which was stripped from Milli Vanilli frontmen Rob 
Pilatus and Fab Morvan -- unawarded rather than give it to the act that 
received the second-highest vote total. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole Grammy process is not like a group of runners in a 100-yard dash or 
something that clearly has a second- or third-place finisher," academy 
president Michael Greene said Tuesday from New York, where he was attending a 
"Grammy Legends" concert. "Our feeling was (that) if we had taken Milli Vanilli 
out of the mix and let our voters vote on the next four, the result probably 
would have been different in terms of who would have come up second." 
</P>
<P>
The other acts nominated for the award last year were Neneh Cherry, Indigo 
Girls, Soul II Soul and Tone Loc. Greene said that even if the award were given 
to one of them, "that award would always be flawed or carry an asterisk." 
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, the academy trustees confirmed Greene's statement last 
week that votes for Milli Vanilli in three 1990 categories for which the group 
is listed on the ballot will not be counted. Milli Vanilli is listed in the 
best album, best record and best pop performance by a group or duo categories. 
But Milli Vanilli's "Blame It on the Rain" will remain eligible in the best 
song voting. 
</P>
<P>
"Our voters in that category are always urged to vote for the song, not the 
performer," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
If "Blame It on the Rain" wins, the Grammy will go to songwriter Diane Warren, 
not to Milli Vanilli. STEVE HOCHMAN

WILD &amp; CRAZY: Comedian Steve Martin, quoted in the current Buzz magazine on 
his new movie "L.A. Story": "Certainly I'm no expert on L.A. I actually grew up 
in Orange County (Garden Grove), which I think of as a different animal than 
L.A. When I came up to Los Angeles in the late '60s, it was quite a shock. . . 
. You know, you'd see some guy riding a bicycle with a pyramid on his head."

GOTCHA! Bob Johnson, retiring after 13 years as El Toro High School's football 
coach (C1), may be remembered best for making 1987's most spectacular catch. . 
. . That fall, Johnson sneaked away from football practice and up to an RV 
parked nearby, swung open the door and found one of his former players 
videotaping El Toro's plays. . . . It turned out the tapes were going to the 
coach at archenemy Capistrano Valley High School, and that cost that coach his 
job. Tom Hamilton and Cathy Curtis

HIGH MARKS: Of 58 areas rated in the nation, Orange County's major hotels rank 
eighth, according to a survey being released today (D5). . . . Eugene H. Zagat 
Jr., who's publishing the second edition of his "Zagat United States Travel 
Survey," says the county's hotels rank so high because they offer such outdoor 
amenities as tennis courts, golf courses and gardens. They also rate high in 
cost: 10th nationally. Top rated: The Ritz-Carlton. Tom Hamilton and Cathy

FAMILIES' BAD BLOOD: 2 LEFT DEAD IN 9 DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: MURDER SUSPECT'S WIFE FEUDED WITH NURSE DONNA CONNATY, AND ONCE SUED HER 
OVER A DOG BITE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of the man suspected of murdering Buena Park nurse Donna J. Connaty 
and killing her husband nine days later in a shoot-out feuded with her over the 
last year and once sued her for $2,000 over a dog bite, according to police and 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the animosity surfaced Tuesday as detectives continued their 
investigation into whether Neill F. Matzen bludgeoned Connaty to death at her 
home on Nov. 24 after being driven there by his wife, Cynthia R. Matzen. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't care for each other," said Buena Park Police Detective Gaylen 
(Buck) Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
Neill Matzen was arrested Monday after he killed Connaty's husband at a trailer 
park in Santa Ana. Police are continuing to question Cynthia Matzen, who has 
admitted that she drove her husband to the Connatys' house the morning of Donna 
Connaty's murder and picked him up a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Police also revealed Tuesday that it was Cynthia Matzen's statements to 
detectives that led them to a lead pipe they believe was the murder weapon -- 
and to her husband's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's shoot-out began when Richard P. Connaty walked into the Matzens' 
mobile home in Santa Ana, said "You killed my wife!" and fired a single shot 
from a .380 semiautomatic handgun into Neill Matzen's left arm. He then ran 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
Matzen picked up his .357 magnum, walked outside and fired two shots at 
Connaty, hitting him once squarely in the chest. Connaty died a few hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Matzen, 36, a tow truck driver for Country City Towing Inc. in Westminster, 
remained in the jail ward at Western Medical Center-Anaheim on Tuesday. Murder 
charges in the death of Donna Connaty are expected to be filed today, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police said they do not expect to file charges against Matzen for 
killing Richard Connaty because it appeared to be a case of self-defense. But 
after the shoot-out, Buena Park police interviewed Cynthia Matzen and trailer 
park neighbor Carlos James -- with whom Connaty stayed Sunday night -- and 
obtained enough evidence to arrest Neill Matzen on suspicion of murdering Donna 
Connaty. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Matzen, a 28-year-old nursing student, told police they would find the 
lead pipe allegedly used to kill Donna Connaty underneath the Connatys' home, 
Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
"She provided that information," Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
While Cynthia Matzen has not been directly connected to Donna Connaty's murder, 
it was she who drove her husband to the Connaty home the Saturday morning she 
was killed -- ostensibly to drop him off for a weekend trip to the desert with 
Richard Connaty -- and then picked him up a few hours later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Connaty had left the night before for the desert with his three 
children and Matzen's daughter -- a fact that Neill Matzen knew, Connaty told 
police. Yet Matzen left a note on the front door of the Connatys' house that 
morning, asking "Rick, where are you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Rick expressed concern over why Matzen would go to his house," said Buchanan, 
who interviewed both men last Saturday. But Connaty never suggested that he 
thought Matzen, a friend with whom he rode motorcycles and dune buggies in the 
desert, had murdered his wife -- until Monday's fatal shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
"He never mentioned it to us," Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Matzen's note was a cover-up for his real intention that 
day: to kill Donna Connaty. They say that he went there early on Nov. 24, 
waited for Connaty to return from her shift at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, 
and then beat her on the head when she walked in. 
</P>
<P>
Then, police said, Matzen had his wife pick him up, and the couple drove to the 
desert together later that day, joining Richard Connaty and the four children 
in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Police also allege that Matzen stole three saving account passbooks -- for 
deposits totaling about $1,500 -- from the Connaty home. The passbooks were 
found in Matzen's mobile home after the shoot-out Monday. No money had been 
withdrawn, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said police re-interviewed Cynthia Matzen on Tuesday about Donna 
Connaty's murder and will continue to try to determine whether she was simply 
an unwitting chauffeur for her husband or an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to pin down a few details," Buchanan said. "She made some statements 
. . . that we have to confirm." 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Matzen was unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they have not ruled out the possibility that Richard Connaty 
was involved in his wife's murder. Donna Connaty had complained in court 
documents that her husband was a violent, abusive man, and the Connatys were in 
the midst of contentious divorce proceedings when she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Connaty's parents and sister angrily dismissed that possibility and 
said the couple were trying to reconcile their differences. 
</P>
<P>
"The last month or so they were on good terms," said Shirley York, Richard 
Connaty's sister. "On days they were not working, they would do things together 
as a family." 
</P>
<P>
"How could Richard be a suspect?" said Ramsay Connaty, the dead man's father. 
"He'd have to leave the small fry out there in the desert alone for at least 
five hours. He would not hire Neill to do this, no way. They were not that 
close, and there's no indication that Neill had been paid any money." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Buchanan, however, said Donna Connaty's family disputed claims that 
reconciliation was at hand. "Her family said just the opposite," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Connaty's family nor police would speculate about a possible motive in 
the Donna Connaty killing. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan confirmed reports that the Matzens are in severe financial trouble and 
were about to be evicted from the Coach Royal Mobile Home Park on South 
Sullivan Street. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in debt up to their eyebrows," Buchanan said. "They were just waiting 
for the marshals to come." 
</P>
<P>
And both police and Richard Connaty's relatives agreed that the Matzens and 
Donna Connaty were not on good terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Donna did not like the Matzens, and she used to say that she did not want Rick 
taking the kids over there," Shirley York said. "She had heard that Neill had 
beaten Cindy and had pulled a gun on her." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, York said, when the Connatys were in the throes of divorce 
proceedings, Neill Matzen went to St. Joseph Hospital and demanded to see Donna 
Connaty. He wanted to tell her that her husband was about to commit suicide, 
York said. 
</P>
<P>
After Donna Connaty refused to see him, York said, Matzen took her 1978 Honda 
on a joy ride for about an hour. Orange police could not confirm the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Cynthia Matzen filed a suit in Municipal Court in Santa Ana 
asking for $2,000 in damages after Donna Connaty gave her a dog that bit her 
3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew the dog bit kids," Matzen wrote in an angry letter to the court 
after she lost her case. "Also the dog was still not fully housebroke and he 
still chewed on anything and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Court records showed that a second lawsuit was filed against Donna Connaty 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
That suit, also filed in small claims court, was filed by Carlos James, the 
Matzens' next-door neighbor and a friend of Richard Connaty. James claimed that 
Donna Connaty sold a Marcy home gym that belonged to him, and he received a 
judgment of $1,630.42 from the court. 
</P>
<P>
The court papers in James' lawsuit were served on Connaty one night in a 
Denny's restaurant parking lot by Neill Matzen.

DEPOT DEBUT; 
</P>
<P>
SAN JUAN RENOVATION PROJECT HAILED AS SUCCESS 
</P>

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the San Juan train depot opened in 1897, it brought a flood of tourists 
lured by newspaper advertisements promising romantic nights in San Juan by the 
Sea and healing from the mystical waters of San Juan Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 100 years later the name of the town has changed, but city fathers are 
hoping that the old national landmark still holds the same magic -- and will 
bring more tourists and economic prosperity to the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
After an 11-month closure for renovation, the depot reopened this week, and 
city leaders, Amtrak commuters and preservationists were calling the project a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the depot's Spanish colonial revival architecture, the depot's main 
attraction is a spruced-up restaurant -- and a place for the hundreds of Amtrak 
commuters to rest comfortably for the not always-on-time commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh! It's wonderful," exclaimed Linda Forest, a San Clemente resident who 
commutes to her job as a bank manager in Los Angeles. Forest is among the 500 
commuters who daily board north and southbound trains out of San Juan and will 
now have a place to rest as they wait on their trains. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all so grouchy on our way up there. A cup of coffee would go a long 
way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The depot's front yard has been converted into a patio for restaurant seating, 
and an atrium -- a few feet away from the tracks -- has been added on the north 
side of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak passengers who now wait for their trains on a new redwood deck shaded by 
towering jacaranda trees also have a view of the quaint Los Rios historical 
district -- probably the oldest residential community in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Reed Farr, owner of Capistrano Depot travel, which sells Amtrak tickets, said 
passengers were elated about the new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very convenient, and it makes commuting to Los Angeles a much more viable 
option," said Dana Point audiologist John Coleman, who works at the House Ear 
Clinic in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so glad. Now we won't have to stand out in the rain to wait for the 
train." 
</P>
<P>
The city bought the depot for $900,000 in 1987 from two brothers. It later 
awarded a seven-year lease to Pete Henderson, managing owner of the new Rio 
Grande Bar and Grill. Henderson and two other partners operate a similar 
business at the Rio Grande Depot in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said he had made a special effort to maintain the depot's "historical 
appeal." Stones for the patio were brought in from Guadalajara, Mexico, and the 
old fittings have been left in place. Diners in the old baggage room can see 
old suitcases stored on shelves above their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"We've mortgaged the farm on this one," Henderson said, noting that the 
renovation cost $400,000. "We hope we can satisfy everyone -- tourists, 
commuters and the local folks." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Lawrence F. Buchheim, who was having lunch in the restaurant 
with Councilman-elect Gil Jones, said the council was pleased with the project. 
</P>
<P>
"This brings back some childhood memories," said Buchheim, who grew up in San 
Juan. "We're glad with the way things have worked out. You can still feel the 
old charm and character I remembered feeling when I was a boy." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 317,056 people used the train station. Cassandra Walker, manager of 
the city's Redevelopment Agency, said a significant number of the tourists who 
journey from across the country to see the historic San Juan Mission and other 
adobe buildings come by train. 
</P>
<P>
The depot has always been an important part of the community's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Gibson, who has written three books on San Juan Capistrano, said the 
depot is one of the oldest such train stops in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"When the trains first came in the late 1880s, the natives were terrified," 
Gibson said. "For them, it was a big smoke-belching steel monster. But it 
opened a whole new market for tourism. People would come to go to the beach, 
and others would hire buggies to take them to the hot springs. And farmers 
began selling their produce on a wide scale." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a few other projects in the city, the depot's restoration has met with 
approval from the community's preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the historic parts have been retained or enhanced," said Mark Clancey, 
president of a local preservation group that opposed the neighboring Franciscan 
Plaza, which includes a multi-screen movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
Tom and Shirley Schnell said they had traveled from South Dakota to visit the 
depot and other sites. 
</P>
<P>
"I visited the San Juan Mission a year ago," said 72-year-old Tom Schnell. "I 
didn't know this existed, so I wanted to see it too. I'm glad I came . . . 
because you can see and feel the history here."

OUT OF ARSONIST'S ASHES; 
</P>
<P>
AS REBUILDING MOVES TOWARD END, SCHOOL RECALLS A DAY OF FIRE

Kathy Barnett remembers reading a Christmas story to her first-grade children, 
who were just settling down from lunch one year ago, when she noticed an odd 
smell coming from the next room. "I thought to myself, 'Gee, something smells 
like burnt popcorn,' " said Barnett, who went outside to discover flames 
shooting from the roof. "When I opened the door I realized we weren't having 
popcorn, we were having a fire." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett quickly moved to get her students out, then watched in horror as 
firefighters battled to save the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned. My first reaction was why is this building on fire." 
</P>
<P>
It was a year ago this week that an arsonist set fire to a portion of Arthur F. 
Corey Elementary School, causing more than $500,000 in damage to six classrooms 
and the school's library. About 125 students and adults had to be evacuated as 
the blaze swiftly moved from a storage room to classrooms, destroying 
everything in its path. None of the children were injured but Dick Martin, who 
was principal at the time, sustained moderate burns when he ran back into the 
building to check the restrooms for students. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Barnett and other teachers whose rooms were destroyed have 
settled into makeshift classrooms while construction crews work nearby to 
restore the burned building. An interim library has been set up for the 
children and even former Principal Martin, the man considered a hero for his 
efforts, had to be reminded that a year had passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes, it was a year ago," said Martin, who has since taken over the top job 
at James A. Whitaker Elementary School. "Every once in a while I do think about 
it. . . . You still think, 'What if.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the fire, the district set in motion an elaborate plan to get the 
school up and running. Portable classrooms were brought in eight days later and 
school personnel worked overtime to be ready for the students when they 
returned from Christmas vacation. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the next day, some teachers and students worked to salvage as much 
as possible while the rest of the school settled into business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
While the school recuperated, fire officials searched for whoever set the fire. 
After the school fire, several palm trees in the area were torched by youths 
calling themselves the "Pyros," officials said. However, a connection could 
never be made. 
</P>
<P>
"Arson is one of the hardest crimes to solve," Buena Park Fire Marshal Don 
Tully said. "Unless someone actually sees someone with a match in their hand it 
is very hard to prove." 
</P>
<P>
Reluctantly, the investigators have stopped looking for the arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any leads," Tully said. "The case is suspended. We are not 
actively working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, talk is of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the new room is going to be great," said second-grade teacher Ron 
Severin, who manages to squeeze fifth-and sixth-grade choir practice into his 
tight, temporary quarters, piano and all. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few months, construction crews have been working to restore the 
building. A new roof, interior walls and wiring are being added along with 
carpeting and tile. The district had initially planned to have the classrooms 
open by last September, but the new estimate is this March, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 books are waiting to be stocked in the new library, along with 
television sets, movie projectors and other audiovisual equipment. "Everything 
is just stored waiting for someplace to go," said Jerry Horton, the new 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everything could be replaced, even the pupils' sense of security. With 
an air of adventure, they excitedly recount exactly where they were during the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I remember," said second-grader Amber Miller. "We were in the classroom 
and Miss Wilson came in and said (to another teacher), 'There is a f-i-r-e.' I 
started to cry because all my friends were still in there." 
</P>
<P>
Only a few things will be missing when the classrooms are dedicated, Horton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The saddest part is that all the trophies that the school won are all gone. 
You can't replace them." LYNDA NATALI

Don R. Griffin, a 17-year veteran of the City Council, was chosen this week as 
the city's next mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, the owner of an architectural firm, has been involved in public 
service for more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
He served as a member of the Buena Park Library District for eight years before 
joining the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I have a pretty good idea what to expect," said Griffin who has 
served as mayor five times. "Having been through different eras, it helps bring 
a clearer focus to decisions." 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong term is mostly ceremonial. Responsibilities include conducting 
meetings and representing the city at outside functions. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping down is former Mayor Donald L. Bone, who dealt with several critical 
issues during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"Don has had a very successful year," Griffin said. "He has done an outstanding 
job," Bone helped to prevent malathion-carrying helicopters from being based 
permanently at neighboring Fullerton Municipal Airport. He also instituted 
Vision 2010, a plan to get residents involved in planning Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Also this week, newly elected Councilman Arthur Brown was sworn in. Brown, a 
retired deputy sheriff, filled the vacancy left by Councilman Kenneth B. Jones, 
who did not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune was chosen to serve as mayor pro tem. LYNDA

EATERY TRIES TO TRACK STOLEN RHINO HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, who stole the rhino head? 
</P>
<P>
It may be a long shot, but Brian Ephraim, manager of the Rib Trader restaurant 
on Coast Highway, is hoping a bounty hunter will help him find the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Ephraim has offered a $200 reward for the return of a fake rhinoceros head 
stolen from the restaurant bar on one particularly raucous Saturday night 
nearly a month ago. To aid in his search, the restaurant staff is wearing black 
armbands and Ephraim is distributing T-shirts emblazoned with the question: 
"Who Took the Rhino?" 
</P>
<P>
"Two hundred dollars seemed like enough to lure the head out of hiding. The 
head cost us about $500," Ephraim said. "Actually, all we want is our rhino 
head back. It can't mean as much to anyone as it does to our restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
At the Rib Trader, a restaurant with a hunting safari theme, the life-size 
caricature of a rhino fit in nicely with the other assorted replicas of hunting 
trophies, including fish, alligators, crocodiles, sharks and a bust of a 
gorilla. But a "wanted" poster offering the reward now adorns the corner of the 
Jungle Bar the rhino once occupied. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, during the course of the evening, the rhino head was taken off the 
wall and people were kind of tossing it around the room," Ephraim said. "We 
took it away and put it in the back of the restaurant for safekeeping, but when 
we closed for the night, it was gone." 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, an unidentified telephone caller tried to collect the 
ransom, Ephraim said. A voice on the other end of the line instructed him to 
take $200 in $1 bills in a paper bag to a telephone booth near the pier in Dana 
Point Harbor, which Ephraim did. 
</P>
<P>
He was also instructed not to say anything to anyone or the head would wind up 
in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure enough, the phone (in the booth) rang and the guy told me to take the 
money to another harbor restaurant and tell the bartender to donate it to 
Greenpeace," Ephraim said. "He said they would know what I was talking about. 
But the people there didn't know anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
It was when he got the phone call that Ephraim finally called the police and 
filed a report, two weeks after the head was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got the phone call, I figured it was getting out of hand," Ephraim 
said. "I really didn't know what to expect when I got to the pier." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Gus Delatorre of the Sheriff's Department said the case of the missing 
rhino head is officially on the books. "It's still being investigated by our 
detective bureau," Delatorre said. "We will follow any leads we get." LEN HALL

DRUG RANCH TRIAL CLEARED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A JUDGE RULES THAT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND LOWER COURTS AGREED TO 
EXTRADITE DANIEL JAMES FOWLIE ON ALL 26 FELONY CHARGES STEMMING FROM AN ORANGE 
COUNTY CASE.

<P>
Daniel James Fowlie, who is accused of running a vast marijuana operation from 
an Orange County ranch, can be prosecuted on nine felony charges defense 
attorneys contended were never part of his extradition from Mexico, a federal 
judge decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a seven-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler ruled that 
official documents and court testimony show that the Mexican government and 
lower courts agreed to extradite Fowlie to the United States on all 26 felony 
charges returned by a federal grand jury in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Stotler noted that Fowlie's appeals to Mexico's appellate courts to halt his 
extradition failed and that those courts never restricted what charges Fowlie 
could be prosecuted for in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
". . . Protection from extradition exists only to the extent that the 
surrendering country wishes," Stotler wrote. "Moreover, the extradited party 
may be tried for a crime other than that for which he was surrendered if the 
asylum country consents." 
</P>
<P>
During hearings last week before Stotler, defense attorney David G. Haigh 
argued that Fowlie should not be prosecuted on charges of operating a continual 
criminal enterprise and illegal money transfers because the counts had no 
equivalent in Mexican law, a criterion for extradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not had a chance to read the text, so I am uncertain whether an appeal 
is appropriate or not," Haigh said Tuesday in response to Stotler's order. "I 
will make up my mind on what to do within the next two or three days." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Elana S. Artson, the prosecutor, contended that the 
Mexican government had agreed to extradite Fowlie on all counts and that 
Fowlie's only remedy was in Mexican courts if he disagreed with his extradition 
order. 
</P>
<P>
During Artson's questioning of Hernandez, the former judge testified that he 
had been hired as an expert witness through one of Fowlie's Mexican attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he has never handled a complete extradition case involving the 
United States, Hernandez told the court that he has been a consultant in four 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities suspect that Fowlie, 57, operated one of the largest marijuana 
smuggling operations in the United States in 1982-86, using warehouses and 
ranches in Orange and Riverside counties.

COMMUTE A BIT SLOW? BLAME FOUR SIGALERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the morning commute took a bit longer than usual Tuesday, there was good 
reason: four SigAlerts that tied up traffic the length and breadth of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual that we have this many SigAlerts in one day," Highway Patrol 
Officer Linda Burrus said. "It pretty much screwed up all the freeways." 
</P>
<P>
The SigAlerts, issued during unusually disruptive traffic accidents, began at 
6:15 a.m. on the Riverside Freeway and continued on other freeways for much of 
the day, Burrus said. Luckily, she added, the rash of traffic accidents 
resulted in only three minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The most troublesome accident occurred on the southbound San Diego Freeway at 
the El Toro Y when the load on a tractor-trailer shifted and about 150 bags of 
redwood compost fell onto the freeway, clogging all but a portion of the slow 
lane, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
The spilled load caused the driver of a 1984 Datsun to swerve to the right, hit 
an asphalt curb and tumble off the freeway. The driver of the Datsun suffered 
only minor injuries, but the accident backed traffic up for miles. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the worst place to have an accident," Burrus said. "There is just no 
place to get off the freeway." The SigAlert was canceled at 8:52 a.m., and the 
driver of the tractor-trailer was cited for spilling the load. 
</P>
<P>
Just before 6 a.m., a fuel tank on a truck going east onto the Riverside 
Freeway from the northbound Santa Ana Freeway ruptured, spilling about 175 
gallons of diesel onto the road, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was able to pull the rig to the side of the road as it reached the 
Gilbert Street overpass. But 20 minutes later, as traffic began backing up, a 
car skidded on the slick road surface, causing a chain reaction that involved 
six cars, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was tied up on the Riverside and Santa Ana freeways. There was only one 
minor injury involved in that SigAlert, which was also canceled at 8:52 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Then at 10:40 a.m., a woman allegedly making an unsafe lane change on the 
transition road from the southbound Orange Freeway to the eastbound Garden 
Grove Freeway rear-ended the motorcycle of a CHP officer, prompting the third 
SigAlert of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said the officer was pulling into the lane after making a traffic stop. 
At the same time, the woman driver, reportedly going about 70 m.p.h., was 
maneuvering around another car and failed to notice the officer, hitting the 
rear of his motorcycle and throwing him off, Burrus said. He was taken to 
Tustin Health Center for treatment of scrapes and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
That accident brought traffic to a crawl on both freeways for more than an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth SigAlert occurred at 12:10 p.m. on the westbound Riverside Freeway 
just east of Harbor Boulevard, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
In that accident, a Volvo in the slow lane made an unsafe lane change to the 
left and struck a Mercedes driving alongside it. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes went out of control and crossed three lanes of traffic before 
slamming into the rear of a big rig. The impact punctured the truck's fuel 
tank, spilling more than a hundred gallons of diesel, Burrus said.

LAGUNA PROPOSAL TO CURB HOMELESS DELAYED

<P>
Protests by citizens concerned about the constitutional rights of the homeless 
forced a divided City Council to postpone action Tuesday on an ordinance that 
would prevent transients from sleeping on private property. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-2 vote, the council sent the proposed ordinance to its Human Affairs 
Committee for review. 
</P>
<P>
Among those voting for further review was Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who 
called the homelessness issue "a complex social problem that cannot be solved 
by a simple law." 
</P>
<P>
Gentry suggested before the council meeting that cities in the area join 
together to find a regional solution, including the establishment of shelters 
to house people who do not meet criteria set at privately run shelters. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the ordinance simply places in the municipal 
code what had been the city's practice under an existing state law and mirrors 
a city code that bans sleeping on public property. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, we have had a procedure where property owners can advise us in 
writing that they wish us to cite an individual for trespassing on their 
property. But for some reason, the district attorney is now reluctant to 
prosecute under state law," Frank said, adding that the procedural problem 
could be corrected with the new ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Without the ordinance, Police Chief Neil Purcell said, his department's "hands 
are tied and there's nothing we can do" to remove transients who return to 
private property after repeated warnings to leave. 
</P>
<P>
But Gentry said that issuing citations and sending transients to jail, just to 
have them out on the streets again, is not going to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's against the law to sleep on private property and it's against the law 
to sleep on public property, where does one sleep?" Gentry asked. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Lida Lenney added: "When you have to sleep, you have to sleep no 
matter where you are." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Neil G. Fitzpatrick and Councilwoman Martha Collison supported the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want someone sleeping in my back yard and I think that's what we are 
dealing with," Collison said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to take $35,000 from its Open Space Fund to help 
establish the Laguna Canyon Foundation, a nonprofit group that would be 
responsible for raising money to meet the city's $78-million obligation to buy 
land in Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co., which owns the 2,150-acre canyon site and has given the city 
five years to purchase the land, is expected to contribute an equal amount. 
Three environmental groups will also donate. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Tuesday, Fitzpatrick was chosen to be the city's mayor for the 
next year.

IRAQ HOSTAGE-VISIT ISSUE CAPTIVATES 7TH-GRADERS

<P>
Danielle Schroeder's uncle is stationed in the Persian Gulf, but she wouldn't 
go to visit him even if she could because she doesn't trust Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
A friend, Meagan Liss, said she would pack her bags and leave on a moment's 
notice to visit a loved one held in Iraq, regardless of the possible 
consequences. But Jane Chai agrees with Danielle -- she would not go to the 
Middle East, although for a different reason. Jane thinks the U.S. government 
is making a big mistake in allowing Americans to visit Iraq under any 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle, Megan and Jane may be just 12 years old, but they and their 
seventh-grade classmates at Helen Stacey Intermediate School in Huntington 
Beach have firm opinions about Saddam Hussein and his overture to the West to 
let friends and relatives visit hostages in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
It's a trap, the students concluded. But if Americans must go, they said, they 
should weigh the risks carefully. 
</P>
<P>
As a writing assignment for their language arts class, the students were asked 
to respond to a Nov. 19 Times editorial that asked: "Are Hostage Families Right 
to Go Visit Iraq?" 
</P>
<P>
Danielle doesn't think so. She believes Hussein has a diabolical plan up his 
sleeve to strengthen his advantage in the crisis. "Saddam Hussein is trying to 
get more American citizen hostages," she wrote. And even if her uncle were a 
hostage, Danielle said, she would not take Hussein up on his offer. 
</P>
<P>
But Danielle's friend, Kelly Shaw, 12, argued in her essay that families 
"should go . . . not for themselves, but for the prisoners. . . . I wouldn't 
care if they took me hostage, just as long as I'm with that person who's 
captive." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Chai, who sits next to Kelly in class, said in her letter to The Times 
that the United States is being careless with the lives of its citizens by not 
enforcing the federal Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from 
interfering in foreign policy. "There are already over 3,776 hostages in Iraq," 
Chai, a gifted student like her other classmates, wrote. "How can the 
government let more of our citizens get sucked into this obvious scam?" 
</P>
<P>
When their teacher, Geri Ogle, assigned the essays, she said she wanted to give 
them the experience of writing to an audience. However, their responses showed 
that the crisis means more to them than just mere extra-credit points, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary for them because they're getting to an age where they know this may 
affect them one day," Ogle said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students, who range in age from 11 to 13, penned their opinions 
within an hour. But long after their assignment was completed and turned in, 
the students said they continued to discuss the pros and cons of possible 
visits to hostages among themselves and with their families. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had relatives there, I don't think they would want for me to go there," 
12-year-old Allison Pettis said in a classroom interview Tuesday. She added 
that if she were a hostage, "I probably would be lonely, but I wouldn't want to 
endanger (anyone's life)." 
</P>
<P>
One point to consider, said Matt Bustamante, 12, is that war in the Middle East 
could be imminent now that the United Nations Security Council has given 
Hussein an ultimatum to withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15 or face military 
action. Both the hostages and their families would be caught in the cross-fire, 
Matt pointed out, so perhaps the best possible action is for the families to 
send presents, pictures or home videos, since they can't be together for 
Christmas.

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS AREN'T EXPERTS IN THE FINE ART OF DEALING 
</P>

I heard the Angels traded Devon White. Who'd they get?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Felix." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jose?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Junior." 
</P>
<P>
 "Noboa? Not him again." 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Junior Felix. He's an outfielder. They also got a second baseman from 
Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sojo." 
</P>
<P>
 "Soho? I thought you said he's from Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did." 
</P>
<P>
 "So who's from Soho?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody. Sojo's from Toronto. So's Felix. The Angels are getting both of them, 
plus a player to be named later." 
</P>
<P>
 "Later? I can't even name the players they got now." 
</P>
<P>
They say that he who hesitates is lost, but that isn't always the case. In 
Anaheim, we know that he who hesitates doesn't trade Devon White for Joe 
Carter, doesn't trade Devon White for Ellis Burks, but does wind up shipping 
Devon White to Canada for the 1990 version of Who's On First? 
</P>
<P>
Is that all there is? Is that all the Angels can buy for the center fielder who 
collects Gold Gloves like birthdays, the rookie flash of '87 who hit 17 home 
runs in his first half-season, the white-hot blur of potential the Angels 
considered untouchable as recently as 1988? 
</P>
<P>
It is when you forget half of the cardinal rule that governs the jock market: 
</P>
<P>
Sell high, buy low. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Port knows how to buy low. He has based an entire career on it: Lance 
Parrish for a minor league pitcher, Bert Blyleven for minor league surplus, 
Luis Polonia for a broken-down Claudell Washington. Port dresses like a banker 
but shops for some of his best players at the Salvation Army. He is Mr. Pic 'N' 
Save. 
</P>
<P>
Selling high is the more difficult proposition, because it entails taking risks 
and trusting your instincts. Anyone can spot a bargain. The key to baseball 
trading success, as Branch Rickey once observed, is knowing when to trade a 
player a year early rather than a year too late. 
</P>
<P>
Port still has this part backward. He sits on young players and waits, and 
waits, and waits -- until Gary Pettis is more liability than commodity; until 
Mike Witt is mopping up no-hitters, not starting them; and until Devon White 
bats .217, gets sent to the minors and can't bring home more than a center 
fielder the Angels hope can play center field and a second baseman the Angels 
hope can play second base. 
</P>
<P>
Port waits because he operates by committee -- it takes time to round up your 
manager, your assistant general manager, your minor league director, your 
scouting director, your scouts and your palm reader for staff meetings every 
time an offer's on the table -- and because he has always been impressed by 
what he calls "scouting-in-reverse." Scouting-in-reverse is actually no 
different than trusting the other guy more than yourself, except it sounds 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, scouting-in-reverse goes something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Other Team's GM: "So, what will it take to get Jack Howell?" 
</P>
<P>
 Port, thinking to himself: "Hmmm. They really like Howell, so he must be good. 
We better keep him." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the Angels owned what they considered an excellent cache of 
young talent -- Pettis, Witt, White, Howell, Wally Joyner, Dick Schofield, Mark 
McLemore. The Angels heard offers. Scouting-in-reverse had Port convinced he 
was operating the '27 Yankees, not the '87 Angels. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the plums withered on the vine. Pettis proved, once and for all, 
that he couldn't hit and was traded for a washed-up Dan Petry. Witt, a Cy Young 
also-ran in 1986, slinked to the rear of the bullpen before Port dealt him for 
a 38-year-old Dave Winfield. McLemore became the player to be named later for 
Ron Tingley. Howell, like White, spent time in Edmonton last season and now 
carries the damaged-goods tag as well. 
</P>
<P>
This time last year, Cleveland offered the Angels an extraordinary Joe named 
Carter for a package of White and Johnny Ray. The Angels said no. Midway 
through last season, Boston was talking another package -- White and Kirk 
McCaskill for All-Star center fielder Burks. Again, the Angels backed off. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the Angels entered another off-season hoping to dump Ray to the 
first taker, hoping to cash in White for anything approaching value and hoping 
McCaskill can come back after a second arm operation. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of trading White has always involved an element of danger, and still 
does. There's always a chance White might figure out the strike zone someday 
and become the next Ruben Sierra. That chance is much slimmer now, which 
explains the slimmer return, but the holes in White's game were spotted years 
ago. The Angels knew them before the rest of baseball did. Port could have 
pulled a fast one by trading the fast one for a real windfall. 
</P>
<P>
But, no, he opted for slow. By the time he was ready to deal, Port was no 
longer dealing from strength. He ended up trading White to Canada, where the 
exchange rate isn't what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
In Felix, the Angels get a young outfielder who had a great first half as a 
rookie -- .283, eight home runs, 41 runs batted in -- and then managed one home 
run and five RBIs the rest of the way. Sound familiar? Last season, Felix's 
second, he batted .263 with 15 home runs and 65 RBIs -- not that much different 
than Dante Bichette (.255, 15, 53), the man Doug Rader refuses to play in 
center field or any field. Felix also struck out 99 times. Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
Sojo is 24, has good range and is considered a prospect at second base. But 
once, so was McLemore. Sojo hit .296 in Class AAA but only .225 in 33 games 
with Toronto. Rader says he wants to bat Sojo second behind Polonia -- Luis, 
Luis -- which could be the first time the top of the Angel lineup caused anyone 
to break into song. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing about this trade, the Angels say, is youth. Felix and Sojo are 
on the short side of 25. Their potentials have yet to be realized -- or, for 
that matter, squandered. 
</P>
<P>
Just wait, the Angels say. 
</P>
<P>
We've heard that one before.

EL TORO'S JOHNSON RESIGNS TO FOLLOW HIS SONS' CAREERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Johnson, one of the most successful football coaches in the Southern 
Section the past 13 years, announced his resignation Tuesday at El Toro High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's teams compiled a 119-45 record and won six league and three Southern 
Section titles. El Toro also qualified for the playoffs 13 straight years, the 
longest current streak in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said his desire to support and watch his sons, Bret and Rob, throughout 
their college careers was the reason for his decision to resign. Bret is a 
junior quarterback at Michigan State, having transferred from UCLA after losing 
his starting job this season; Rob, a senior at El Toro, is a highly recruited 
quarterback who has not yet made a college commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not burned out, and there's nothing I enjoy more than coaching kids," said 
Johnson, 45. "But I've followed both of my sons' athletic careers since they 
were youngsters and I want to watch them play college football. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be coaching at Muirlands and La Paz (Mission Viejo High) while 
Bret is playing in South Bend, Ind. I've always been there for my kids, so it's 
time to put my profession on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to coach again. I'm not done coaching. I'm going to take a back seat 
for a while," said Johnson, who said he'll likely consider coaching again once 
his sons finish college. "I'm a guy who doesn't look down the road that much, 
but maybe in a year or so I'll think I need to get back. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of me that wants to go into college football. We've done quite a 
bit in the high school area -- but I wouldn't say I wouldn't go back to that 
either." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was hired at El Toro in 1978 after being an assistant coach at Los 
Amigos. He immediately built the program into one of the strongest in the 
county. El Toro was the tri-champion of the Sea View League in Johnson's third 
season and the school won the league title three straight years from 1980-82. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro won its first postseason championship, defeating Fullerton, 35-19, for 
the Central Conference title in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's Southern Conference championship team finished 14-0 in 1986 and is 
considered one of the best in county history. The team featured Johnson's son, 
Bret, who was named the county's back of the year as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"This team deserves to be ranked with anyone you want to talk about," Bob 
Johnson said after the title game. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro repeated as Southern Conference champion in 1987, finishing 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's only losses in 1987 came while Bret was recovering from knee surgery. 
Despite the injury, Bret repeated as the county's back of the year. 
</P>
<P>
After an off-year in 1988, El Toro returned to a postseason championship game 
in 1989 with son Rob playing wide receiver. The Chargers lost to Paramount, 
26-20, in the Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
Rob moved to quarterback this season and led El Toro to a second-place finish 
in the South Coast League. But once again, Paramount beat El Toro in the 
playoffs, 19-8, in the semifinals of the Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trade the last 13 years for anything," Johnson said. "I've enjoyed 
the challenge of being the No. 1 team in the county and the relationship I had 
with the staff and players at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff here was responsible for our success. We always maintained some of 
the best high school coaches in the county, and the program's success will 
continue long after I'm gone. 
</P>
<P>
"These are important times in my sons' lives, and (Johnson's wife) Debbie and I 
made a decision to support our sons. We'll be traveling, tailgating and 
enjoying the games as fans for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson will continue to teach physical education at El Toro. Don Martin, El 
Toro principal, said he didn't anticipate opening the coaching position until 
after the holiday break. 
</P>
<P>
"We have plenty of time until spring ball begins," Martin said.

Charlie Brande, former Corona del Mar High School girls' and boys' volleyball 
coach, has agreed not to coach in the Southern Section for the 1990-91 school 
year, but is free to return the following season, Southern Section Commissioner 
Stan Thomas said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brande and Thomas met for 90 minutes Tuesday to discuss alleged violations of 
Southern Section rules by the coach. 
</P>
<P>
Brande was suspended in August in the wake of an investigation into his 
coaching of club team players with high school eligibility remaining. Corona 
del Mar went on to win the Southern Section 5-A and State Division I titles. 
</P>
<P>
Brande said Tuesday he is unsure if he will return to coaching at the high 
school level. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a possibility I could return to Corona del Mar or any other high 
school," Brande said, "or it might be time to move on to coaching a college 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Brande and Thomas also discussed "gray areas" in the eligibility guidelines for 
club coaches who also coach high school teams. Brande, chairman of the ethics 
committee for the U.S Volleyball Assn., said he will distribute clarifications 
of the rules to the club coaches. 
</P>
<P>

AST RESEARCH OPENS 2 OFFICES IN THE FAR EAST

Personal computer maker AST Research Inc. has established sales offices in 
Singapore and Taiwan as part of an effort to boost sales in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"The opening of AST's Singapore and Taiwan offices reflects the company's 
commitment to the Pacific Rim's personal computer marketplace and its continued 
global strategy to gain worldwide market share," said Tom Yuen, AST's chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
"AST's local proximity will allow it to keep pace with the region's rapidly 
growing computer industry." 
</P>
<P>
International sales made up 38% of AST's $136.3 million in sales during the 
first quarter ended Sept. 28. That was up from 30% for the same period a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The offices will provide distributors and dealers with educational, technical, 
marketing and sales support. They will work closely with local dealers and 
distributors to develop pricing and distribution strategies specifically for 
the region, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
"The new offices allow AST to respond quickly to developments in the local 
marketplace," Yuen said. "As the industry grows, it becomes even more important 
to provide distribution channels and end users with high-quality products and 
support." 
</P>
<P>
In October, the company announced the appointment of the first three Japanese 
firms to distribute a personal computer designed to compete with the NEC 
Corp.'s dominant line of personal computers in the Japanese marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
AST will sell its full line of products in Singapore and Taiwan, including 
personal computers, enhancement products and data communications gear. The 
company now has limited sales in Singapore and Taiwan.

Comarco's Contracts: But another local company has had somewhat better luck 
landing defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Comarco Inc., an Anaheim engineering and computer services company, has been 
awarded four contracts worth more than $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts are with four different government customers and vary in length 
from 10 months to five years, Comarco President Don M. Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest of the contracts is a $5-million award to provide computer software 
support to the U.S. Army. The other contracts involve various services for the 
U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force and National Airport in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The company also reported that its earnings for the third quarter ended Oct. 21 
rose 53% to $458,000 from $299,000 a year earlier. Sales dropped 11% to $16.4 
million from $18.5 million.

Selling Gradco Shares: About two months after being ousted as chairman of 
Gradco Systems Inc., Keith B. Stewart is selling off a chunk of his stock in 
the Irvine office equipment company. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who lost control of Gradco in a proxy contest last October, plans to 
sell 41,098 shares of the company's stock, according to a filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. In September, Stewart owned 725,098 of 
Gradco's 7.6 million common shares, or about 9.5% of the firm. Martin Tash, 
chairman of New York-based Plenum Publishing, gained control of Gradco's board 
in a proxy fight and took over as chairman of the company after Stewart 
resigned.

TOUGH-TALKING ANTI-GANG MAGAZINE HITS STREETS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY SERVICE: BARRIO WARRIORS TARGETS LATINOS AND OTHERS, URGING THEM TO 
STAY OUT OF GANGS AND STAY IN SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The front cover of Barrio Warriors is the first hint that you won't find light 
reading in this new community-written magazine. 
</P>
<P>
It portrays eight young men, all staring unflinchingly into the camera. Some 
are carrying rifles, the others schoolbooks, and at the bottom, the words: 
"Weapons of Wisdom Over Weapons of Death." 
</P>
<P>
This stark theme runs through the entire 52-page Barrio Warriors, a privately 
supported, nearly advertising-free publication now making its debut in Orange 
and Los Angeles counties. The magazine is aimed at school-age Latinos and is 
being distributed largely by members of the college and high school student 
organization, MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan). 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a special magazine with a very special, personal message," said 
publisher Gus Frias, 33, who has long been active in crime-prevention education 
projects in both counties. 
</P>
<P>
The overall message of "Barrio Warriors" is a classic one for ethnic-minority 
activists: raising self-esteem and ethnic community pride, setting sights 
squarely on college and a career. 
</P>
<P>
In this, Frias has mixed more down-to-earth goals: steering young people away 
from potential crime, deglamorizing gang involvement and pointing out what he 
calls the self-destructive nature of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Frias characterizes the quarterly magazine project as a "strictly grass-roots" 
volunteer effort involving short commentaries, poems and essays written by 
Latino educators, professionals and community activists throughout the state. 
The project has been launched with $20,000 in private donations; the 
first-issue run is 10,000 copies, Frias said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the regular per-copy price is $5, Frias said most of the debut issue 
will be given away to ensure "maximum outreach" to the magazine's prime 
audience. He expects that while later issues will also be given away or sold at 
sharply reduced prices to many barrio youths, the magazine will become 
"self-supporting" as various organizations buy it in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing for this magazine is really crucial," said Frias, noting that gang 
membership has increased to an estimated 100,000 in Los Angeles County and 
10,000 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that young people join gangs for many of the same reasons they join 
other groups. They seek identity, respect, belonging and support," said Frias, 
who since 1987 has managed a drug- and crime-prevention program under the 
Orange County Department of Education (the magazine is not connected to his 
county job, he said). 
</P>
<P>
The attraction of gangs, he said, is often reinforced by the "glamorizing 
images" depicted on television and rock videos. This shows up in the 
fast-growing number of "gang emulators" -- youth groups or "wannabes" who are 
not involved in criminal activities but who have adopted gang-like dress and 
other customs. The danger is that many such groups may "escalate" into criminal 
behavior, Frias cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, Frias said the need for more preventive educational projects 
aimed at the high-school-age population is more urgent than ever. 
</P>
<P>
This is where a magazine like "Barrio Warriors" comes in, Frias said -- "a 
no-nonsense, straight-talking" format that underscores the dehumanizing, 
unheroic aspects of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The style is pure staccato: short bursts of highly intense, ethnically proud 
language that speaks directly to the barrio-raised readers. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine portrays gang members as belonging to a lethal phenomenon -- 
"hate, drugs, weapons, prison and self-destruction," as one commentator 
described it. 
</P>
<P>
There is an essay, "Please God, I'm Only 13," depicting a boy, shot to death in 
a gang clash, speaking from the grave. 
</P>
<P>
And the poem "Run Homeboy, Run," penned by Frias, opens with this warning: 
</P>
<P>
Don't let the (gang) madness catch up to you, 
</P>
<P>
 Run homeboy, run! 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let death get a hold of you, 
</P>
<P>
 Run homeboy, run! 
</P>
<P>
The magazine is written only in English, which Frias said was done 
intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aiming at the youths -- almost all of them born and raised here," he 
said. "Even so, one purpose is to provide another publication to reinforce 
using and reading English, not Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
Using a magazine format in the anti-gang campaign is another way to reach the 
"high-risk" street youths. "We're not supplanting the other methods, we're only 
supplementing them," Frias said. "We see our magazine as a small window opening 
to the reality of the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
He maintains that there is no other magazine like Barrio Warriors -- devoted 
solely to the gang issue and written and packaged in a street youth-oriented 
manner. "All you have out there for the guys to read are 'low-rider' (car) 
magazines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking the same (street) language, but with an entirely different 
purpose," he said. "We're using some of the same kind of (low-rider) pictures 
and barrio group photos, but we're also presenting a message that we hope will 
change people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we don't expect the guys to read it right out there on the streets," 
Frias added. "We're hoping they will take it home with them, mull it over, let 
it sink in." 
</P>
<P>
In Barrio Warriors, the gang-connected dark side is profusely illustrated. 
There are charts displaying the mounting gang-related homicide rate and 
depictions of funerals and grieving families. There is a photograph of a 
slaying victim in his casket. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure what's going to catch the attention of these guys are pictures, and 
more pictures, with people and families they can identify with -- and maybe 
even feel a sense of the grief and tragedy of these senseless deaths," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the dramatic counterpoint, Barrio Warriors also presents an unmistakably 
hopeful side: sketches of Latino achievers in education, business, government 
and community service and other career fields. 
</P>
<P>
They range from the Mexico-born Ramon Martinez, who became a student activist 
with MEChA and other groups while at Cal State Fullerton, to Los Angeles 
teacher Jaime Escalante, the hero of the movie "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
"What we're telling (readers) is that they do have a choice -- and a very clear 
one," Frias said. "They can find those same things -- identity and group 
belonging -- and much more away from the gang environment. They can become true 
leaders in their community." 
</P>
<P>
It is a far-from-impossible dream, as Barrio Warriors likes to relate it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the role models (in the magazine) have been to hell and back," Frias 
said. "But they survived. They changed. They made it -- in college and in 
careers." 
</P>
<P>
The second issue, due out in February, is already in the works, Frias said, 
with articles that will also discuss role models for African-Americans and for 
Asian immigrants. He said he is confident that enough private underwriting will 
be found for future issues. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Frias sees the magazine project as signifying a momentous transition 
in images for many ethnic-minority children. It will be the theme of the 
front-cover portrait for the next issue of Barrio Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to show this bunch of young school kids," Frias said. "They are 
all standing in front of a school bus. And they are all wearing something 
special. Ivy League sweatshirts!" 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to gauge the impact of the new magazine, which is just now 
making the rounds of the neighborhoods and other areas, Frias noted. 
</P>
<P>
But Barrio Warriors has won praise from adult activists who have seen the first 
issue, such as Dorothy Castillo, a Santa Ana-based job counselor who has worked 
closely with street youths and student dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a lot more young people are getting the message -- that (gang 
life) is dangerous," Castillo said. "This magazine shows that it isn't just two 
or three persons who have put it together and made it educationally and in 
jobs. The role models are many -- and hard to ignore." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent attempt to get on-the-spot reactions, Frias distributed free copies 
to several Anaheim gang members, who said their group has been involved in 
shooting incidents with rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
As the youths stood around a neighborhood street corner, scanning the magazine, 
most of them seemed engrossed by the contents but remained noncommittal about 
the publication. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting, OK?" said Philip, 18, who asked that his full name not be 
used. "It gives you a lot to think about." 
</P>
<P>
Alex, 18, said he agreed with the emphasis on education. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, a lot of us dropped out, but some of us have gone back (to continuation 
high school). We know we need that diploma to get the jobs," said Alex, who 
hopes to land a job with one of the federally supported job programs. 
</P>
<P>
Paul, 18, glanced at the magazine and then said: "You can't stay out here (with 
gangs) forever. You have to do something else with your life, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Then Paul, who said he served eight months in prison for shooting at members of 
a rival gang (no one was hit), added: "But you can't wait too long. You can't 
wait until you're 6 feet under -- when you're no good to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, he stared at the pallbearer funeral scene on the magazine's back 
cover. "I didn't want to put (my parents) through something like this. I didn't 
want to have them grieve like this."

LARAWAY'S

<P>
When Lenore Laraway moved with her husband to Balboa Island 23 years ago, she 
wanted to open a shop full of little things that couldn't be found anywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
She opened Laraway's on Marine Avenue, a shop that sells ribbons, buttons, 
beads and needlework supplies. The cozy boutique is now internationally known, 
with customers throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
A British woman dropped by recently with photographs of her Brittany spaniels. 
She wanted the dogs depicted in a needlepoint cover for her fireplace screen. 
"It turned out lovely," said Laraway, who coordinates with local artists to 
offer custom needle and beadwork. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to own a country estate to enjoy a visit to Laraway's. 
They'll teach you how to make a unique and elegant necklace for less than $30, 
using antique beads from all over the world. Or, for $3.95, you can buy a real 
leaf dipped in silver. Put it on a chain and you've created an elegant necklace 
for less than $10. 
</P>
<P>
There are beads made of malachite, boxwood and cinnabar. The amber beads, made 
from tree resin, are at least 1,000 years old. Laraway's also has antique 
trading beads, even some that were used on the Lewis and Clark expedition. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a story behind all of the beads. And we do considerable research to 
find out about them," said Bunny Crosson, who works in the shop. "They're all 
very meaningful and unique." 
</P>
<P>
Some are mysterious. A delicate fortuneteller bead is made from yak bone. "It's 
from India," Crosson said. 
</P>
<P>
But the beads are only part of the story. Laraway's also sells lace, ribbon and 
trim imported from Latin America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Laraway recently helped a customer find embroidered trim among her inventory to 
match a tapestry purchased near Chartres Cathedral in France. Laraway's, it 
seems, has the right embellishment or finishing touch for nearly everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone came in recently asking for starfish-shaped beads," Laraway said. "I 
searched around in the back room and sure enough, I had some." 
</P>
<P>
The appliques are interesting, too. Many of them are antiques, including the 
star saved from a general's jacket after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
For Christmas, there are needlepoint stockings and ornaments. You can buy them 
already stitched or finish them yourself. Laraway and Crosson will show you 
how. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Closed Sunday and Monday 
</P>
<P>
Address: 313 Marine Ave. Balboa Island 
</P>
<P>
Telephone: (714) 675-4491 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous: Laraway's offers custom needlework and beadwork. Or if you'd 
rather be the artist and create it yourself, group and private instruction in 
needlework and jewelry making is available. JANICE L. JONES

ANN CONWAY: SCR WARMS UP FOR A CHRISTMAS TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Audience members laughed, cried and applauded until their hands ached at South 
Coast Repertory on Sunday. The occasion was the dress rehearsal of the 
theater's 11th annual production of "A Christmas Carol," Charles Dickens' tale 
about the transformation of the miser's miser (Hal Landon Jr.) into a grateful 
and giving sort of chap. 
</P>
<P>
"I cry every year," said SCR's director of development, Louise Cummings, after 
the show. "I sit there with tears streaming down my face the minute I think 
Tiny Tim might die." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Michaelson, who portrays the Spirit of Christmas Present, said playing his 
part is the perfect prelude to Christmas. "Nothing puts me in the spirit more," 
said the jolly fellow who sweeps around the stage in evergreen-velvet robes and 
a wreath of holly in his hair. 
</P>
<P>
But if those in Sunday night's audience -- composed of SCR staff, technicians 
and board of trustees -- thought they were moved by the play, they should see 
it again closer to Christmas, said Howard Shangraw (who plays Scrooge's nephew 
in the production). "The closer you get to the Big Day, the hotter the whole 
scene gets. It's magic." 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Wendy and Dan Wheeler, vice president of Security Pacific -- 
underwriters and honorary producers of this season's production. The play will 
run from Thursday to Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about getting into the spirit: Tickets are still available for what is 
certain to be the most touching concert of Orange County's holiday season. The 
Boys Choir of Harlem will perform at the Orange County Performing Arts Center's 
17th annual Christmas Candlelight Concert at the Hyatt Regency Irvine on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Choir director Walter Turnbull promises one hour of Christmas carols, 
spirituals, Mozart, and, are you ready? Duke Ellington! 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give an overall view of the kind of music we perform," said 
Turnbull, who founded the choir in 1968. Selections will range from Mozart's 
"Magnificat" to Ellington's "It Don't Mean a Thing (If You Ain't Got That 
Swing)." 
</P>
<P>
"The songs we perform are all in the spirit of education," said Turnbull, 
speaking of his choirboys and his audiences. "I try to help kids, who might not 
have had the opportunity, to experience music and understand their own 
heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the 150 choir members (30 will sing on Sunday) are from 
single-parent homes, Turnbull said. "They are from very poor families. In fact, 
if they weren't doing this they could very well be doing nothing -- be on the 
streets. This opportunity saves their lives -- keeps them busy and gives them a 
goal." Ciel Woodman is event chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic Charities: Bishops Norman McFarland and Michael Driscoll were among 
guests at an underwriting party at Deeann and Al Baldwin's Emerald Bay home on 
Sunday. Their goal? Helping to inspire guests to ante up underwriting funds to 
stage the Feb. 8 Mardi Gras ball sponsored by Catholic Charities of Orange 
County. Guests, who included arts activists Janice and Roger Johnson, enjoyed a 
wine reception and a video about the efforts of Catholic Charities before 
settling down to dinner catered by Pennington (the crepes Grand Marnier were so 
delicious that Al Baldwin went back for seconds). Among the programs supported 
by Catholic Charities are assistance for the elderly, lodging for the homeless, 
respite care for families with developmentally disabled children and helping 
the unemployed find work. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwins will be crowned king and queen at the fourth annual affair. (Past 
monarchs were Mary and Peter Muth, Art and Gaye Birtcher, and Gordon and Gale 
Lee.) 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity to aid an agency that reaches beyond the Catholic 
community," Driscoll said. Helen Hawkins, a member of the Catholic Charities 
board, is gala chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas at the Ritz: Some (heavenly) things never change. Elegant holiday 
decor dripped from the walls and ceiling of the fashionable Ritz restaurant in 
Newport Beach on Saturday (the way it always does when the Fashionables, 
supporters of Chapman College in Orange, stage their holiday brunch). The 
chairwoman and Fashionables president -- Sandra Beigel and Mary Lou Hornsby, 
respectively -- stood with Christmas carolers outside the posh restaurant, 
greeting guests (the way they always do). And the mouthwatering menu -- soup en 
croute, poached Norwegian salmon and raspberry creme brulee -- was to die for 
(the way it always is). Why change a good thing? "Sometimes we think we might," 
said Hornsby, sitting at a table with her husband, Scott, and Chapman President 
Allen Koenig. "Then we don't." Nora and Charles Hester were honorary chairmen. 
Also on the scene: Ritz owner Hans Prager and his wife, Charlene. 
</P>
<P>
Don't miss: Don't miss the elegant exhibit of Tiffany &amp; Co. silver on 
display at the Decorative Arts Study Center in San Juan Capistrano. Word's out 
that it's tres divine. (Tiffany will also create the decor at Sunday's 
Christmas Candlelight Concert). . . . Feel like being someone's best buddy 
during the holidays? Then zip on down to Zeppa at Newport Center Fashion Island

Beverly Perez became administrator of the Halcyon/Anaheim Interfaith Shelter 
just a few months ago, but already she has seen people become self-supporting 
after leaving the shelter with a nest egg and a sense of direction. 
</P>
<P>
Her biggest worry is how to meet the needs of the homeless when the nonprofit 
shelter, which depends on private donations and city grants, is constantly 
threatened with cash flow problems. 
</P>
<P>
Donations usually increase near the holidays, when toys for the children are 
always plentiful, she says. But the needs continue after the holiday spirit 
wanes, she stresses. Among the shelter's most pressing needs are: 
</P>
<P>
* Entertainers to provide holiday programs for the children. 
</P>
<P>
* Children's clothing and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
* Furniture and food. 
</P>
<P>
* Volunteers to tutor children in English and math. 
</P>
<P>
* Donations of money or labor to renovate the apartment building, which has 
severe plumbing and roofing problems. 
</P>
<P>
To find out how you can help, call Perez at (714) 774-8502. SHERRY ANGEL

Local judges -- An article Sunday incorrectly reported that all of the 11 local 
judges appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian are white and that nine of them are 
former prosecutors. In fact, Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III is black, and 
the number of ex-prosecutors is eight. Superior Court Judge Kenneth R. Yegan, a 
former deputy public defender, was incorrectly identified as an ex-deputy 
district attorney.

DRIVE-BY SHOOTING FATAL IN VALLEY

<P>
A 20-year-old man was fatally shot in a drive-by shooting that occurred in an 
area of Sepulveda that was barricaded last year because of high crime, Los 
Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the suspects sped away from the Monday evening shooting through 
the one street entrance to the 12-square-block Columbus Avenue neighborhood 
that remains open to autos. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ray Anaya and his cousin, both of Sylmar, were going to visit a friend 
and were walking east on Rayen Street near Columbus Avenue when the shooting 
occurred about 5:30 p.m., Lt. L. A. Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1-to-2-year-old, light brown car was heading north on Columbus Avenue and 
momentarily stopped at Rayen. Durrer said four people were in the car and, as 
it turned west on to Rayen, someone yelled from the car at the cousins and two 
shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Anaya was struck once in the upper body. His cousin, whose name was not 
released, was uninjured. Anaya was taken to Panorama City Community Hospital 
where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
The car sped west and left the neighborhood on Rayen, police said. 
Investigators declined to reveal what was yelled at the victims, but the words 
and the style of shooting have led them to conclude that the slaying was 
gang-related. However, Durrer said investigators know of no gang activity 
involving Anaya. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood where the shooting took place has had four street entrances 
barricaded by police since Nov. 7, 1989, in an attempt to curb drug and gang 
crime. The only entrance and exit that remained open was Rayen Street at 
Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Durrer said the Monday night shooting is the first slaying in the neighborhood 
since the barricades were put in place. 
</P>
<P>
"The barricades had been putting a lid on crimes of violence in that 
neighborhood," he said.

IRAQ ACCEPTS BUSH'S OFFER TO HOLD TALKS

Iraq has accepted President Bush's offer to hold talks on the Persian Gulf 
crisis, the State Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi government has accepted President Bush's Dec. 1 proposal to hold 
meetings between the U.S. government and the Iraqi government," State 
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are engaged with them on dates and arrangements for the two meetings," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had proposed that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein send his foreign 
minister, Tarik Aziz, to Washington. Then, Bush said, Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III would go to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires today, Bush said any talks would be 
mandated by U.N. Security Council resolutions that have been adopted since the 
crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
"That means no concession of territory. That means freedom of innocent people 
that are held against their will. . . . And that means the eventual security 
and stability of the gulf, although that's not specified by the resolution," 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
His comments came before the State Department announced that Iraq had accepted 
the offer to hold talks. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Wilson, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, was called in by the Iraqi Foreign 
Ministry to be told of Iraq's acceptance of the offer, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's unexpected overture followed mounting complaints in Congress that the 
Administration was rushing into war with Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait 
without giving diplomacy enough time for the pursuit of a peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Bush pledged that the Administration would not waver from the 
resolution approved last Thursday by the U.N. Security Council threatening a 
forceful eviction of Iraqi troops if they did not withdraw by Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in making the offer to swap envoys, said Baker would not waver from the 
three demands. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to get that across is one-on-one, Baker looking him in the eye," 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The President and Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem held talks today on 
economic and political issues two days after a bloody Argentine army uprising 
that killed 13 soldiers and civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, on the third leg of a weeklong Latin American goodwill tour that began in 
Brazil on Monday, planned to use the daylong visit to promote his scheme to 
create a vast free trade zone throughout the Western Hemisphere.

BAKER TALKS TOUGH ON IRAQ; 
</P>
<P>
THREATENS IT WITH QUICK, HUGE ATTACK

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today the United States will strike 
"suddenly, massively and decisively" if military force is needed to get Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before Congress, Baker staked out a hard line against Hussein. He 
said his planned trip to Baghdad this month is not an opening for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not to be a meeting of negotiation over the terms of the U.N. 
resolutions," Baker said, adding that he would stick with the international 
demands for complete and immediate Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Baker stopped short of saying the United States would launch an attack to 
liberate Kuwait after Jan. 15, the deadline established last week by the U.N. 
Security Council. But he left no doubt about the White House's resolve to 
remove Hussein quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"If it (force) must be used, it will be used suddenly, massively and 
decisively," he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the Capitol, CIA Director William H. Webster echoed Baker, 
saying there are no indications that the sanctions are forcing Hussein to 
rethink his policy on Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Our judgment has been, and continues to be, that there is no assurance or 
guarantee that economic hardships will compel Saddam to change his policies or 
lead to internal unrest that would threaten his regime," Webster told the House 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Baker underscored comments made last Friday by President Bush, who said he 
would not allow U.S. soldiers to become involved in another protracted, 
divisive war such as Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that "it would be very helpful" if Congress would support the type 
of resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressional underscoring of the message that we are trying to send could 
significantly reduce the chance of war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that holding off a military clash with Iraq would hurt the United States 
and help Hussein kill Kuwait, Baker said the U.N.-imposed economic squeeze "has 
had little, if any, effect on (Hussein's) inclination to withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
However, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and several other senators challenged 
Baker, saying the Administration is giving up on sanctions prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
He told Baker: "You've placed us on a course to war." 
</P>
<P>
Baker sought to rebut arguments made by members of Congress, some former U.S. 
military commanders and former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara that 
sanctions should be given more time to disrupt the Iraqi economy and compel 
Hussein to pull out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting not only gives Saddam time to break the sanctions, but it imposes 
costs on us," Baker said. "As we wait, Saddam will continue torturing Kuwait, 
killing it as a nation. . . . He will continue to fortify Kuwait, to build 
chemical and biological weapons and to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. 
</P>
<P>
"As we wait, he expects other issues to deflect our attention, weaken our 
resolve and dissolve the international coalition. And as we wait, the burden of 
Saddam's crime weighs heavier on the world. That is why we must make credible 
our preparations to use force."

BRITISH HOSTAGE DIES IN IRAQ, APPARENTLY FROM HEART ATTACK

A 57-year-old British man held by Iraq at a strategic site has died in 
captivity, apparently from a heart attack, a British Embassy official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman in London identified the dead man as Donald Major. 
</P>
<P>
His hometown was not immediately known. The embassy official said Major died 
Tuesday at the undisclosed strategic site where he was being held hostage. 
</P>
<P>
"This confirms the underlying need for Iraq to respond to our appeals for the 
immediate release of all hostages," said the Foreign Office spokesman, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified colleague released by Iraq informed the embassy of the death 
and said the man appeared to die of a heart attack, said the embassy official, 
who also spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the man was the first British hostage known to have died in 
captivity. Three other Britons died of natural causes while in hiding in Kuwait 
and two were killed in a car accident in October while trying to drive from 
Kuwait to the Iraq port of Basra.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has widened his lead over dark-horse challenger 
Stanislaw Tyminski four days before the final presidential vote, according to 
an independent poll published today. 
</P>
<P>
In another boost for Walesa, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met with the 
Solidarity leader today in Gdansk and wished him "victory and success" in the 
runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
"I have certain political experience, and I feel that I have talked today with 
the man who will win," Cheney, a former congressman, told Walesa in the 
presence of reporters at the end of their 40-minute meeting at Solidarity 
headquarters in Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish you victory and success in this difficult task," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the poll, 61% of those questioned supported Walesa and 20% backed Tyminski. 
The remaining 19% were undecided, according to the survey conducted by the 
private polling service Demoskop and commissioned by the government-owned 
newspaper Rzeczpospolita. 
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll conducted a week ago by state television put Walesa's support 
at 58% and Tyminski's at 30%. 
</P>
<P>
The poll published today was based on a survey of 988 people across the nation 
and conducted on Tuesday. No margin for error was given. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Tyminski campaign officials denied a claim made in a report on Polish 
television that he had beaten his wife and refused to give food and medicine to 
his children in Canada last year. 
</P>
<P>
The charge was made in a taped interview broadcast late Tuesday by a woman 
identified only as Clara Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"The information has nothing in common with the truth," said campaign 
spokeswoman Agnieska Majewska. 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski acknowledged an acquaintance with the Foxes but said it was only 
slight.

A study found that 91% of nonsmokers were regularly exposed to high levels of 
cigarette smoke, suggesting that the Environmental Protection Agency has 
underestimated the risk of passive smoking, a researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Cummings of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y., 
also said childhood exposure to parents' cigarette smoke could be a greater 
risk than an adult nonsmoker's exposure to a spouse's or colleague's smoke. 
</P>
<P>
If that is correct, lung cancer could be about to increase among nonsmokers of 
the "baby boom" generation, a result of their parents' widespread adoption of 
smoking after World War II, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
He presented his findings Tuesday at a meeting of an EPA panel considering the 
merits of the agency's draft passive smoking study, which concludes that 
cigarette smoke is a known cause of cancer in nonsmokers.

<P>
American workers' productivity increased only slightly in the third quarter of 
1990, rising at an annual rate of 0.2%, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's report also showed that the number of hours worked fell 
0.2% in the July-September period, the first such decline in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts consider a decrease in hours worked a sign that the nation's 
economic slowdown has been forcing businesses to make do with fewer employees. 
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department said that orders to U.S. factories 
jumped 2.8% in October, driven by transportation orders and rising energy 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.2% third-quarter increase in non-farm productivity -- defined as output 
per hour of work -- was under the 0.3% rise in the second quarter of 1990 but 
better than the 1.3% plunge in productivity during the first quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The mediocre increases of the last two quarters and the big decline of the 
first three months of the year mean that productivity has fallen at an annual 
rate of 0.2% thus far in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce more during each hour 
of work, is considered vital to boosting the nation's standard of living 
without inflation. 
</P>
<P>
During all of 1989, productivity fell 0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Before the decline of 1989, productivity growth had averaged about 1.4% a year 
for the last several years, better than the 1.2% average of the 1970s but far 
worse than the 3.3% annual gain posted in the two decades after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In the factory report, the Commerce Department said orders for both durable and 
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $250.7 billion after a revised 
0.2% decline the previous month. The revision showed September orders even 
weaker than the 0.1% gain initially reported. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest increase since a 4% gain last April. 
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing industry plans for 
production. A decrease may forecast a slump in that sector and future layoffs.

Honda Motor Co. Ltd., whose cars have become a hit with U.S. consumers, is 
getting worried about its weak sales in Japan, industry analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in Japan in November totaled 32,960 vehicles, down a sharp 27.9% from a 
year earlier and marking the second straight monthly fall. Meanwhile, U.S. 
sales continued to grow strongly, with the Accord remaining the single 
top-selling model for the second year. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to increase its sales force and the number of its repair 
shops in Japan to counteract its decline, he said.

PANEL FEARS 'MAJOR COMPUTER DISASTER'

Modern thieves can steal more with a computer than with a gun, and America's 
"luck" in avoiding a major computer disaster way soon run out unless security 
is tightened, an expert panel warned today. 
</P>
<P>
A National Research Council committee concluded the United States has grown to 
rely on computers for everything from banking to health care without ensuring 
that such information is secure from accident or deliberate attack. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, failures of computer system security, safety and reliability 
appear to be increasing in number and severity, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the examples cited were: the much-publicized 1988 incident in which a 
reproducing computer program, called a worm, snarled as many as 6,000 computer 
systems; a nearly successful attempt to use thousands of phony automatic teller 
machine cards with identification numbers pirated from a computer, and a bid to 
defraud the Pennsylvania Lottery of $15.2 million by using a data base of 
unclaimed ticket numbers to produce a fake winning ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Poor quality control also can make computer systems untrustworthy, the panel 
said. It cited an error in computer software controlling a radiation therapy 
machine that resulted in at least three patient deaths, and the scrambling of 
patient records at one hospital by a rogue program, or virus, that was 
accidentally introduced into its computer system. 
</P>
<P>
"To date, we have been remarkably lucky. . . . As far as we can tell, there has 
been no successful systematic attempt to subvert any of our critical computing 
systems. Unfortunately, there is reason to believe that our luck will soon run 
out," the 16-member panel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The modern thief can steal more with a computer than with a gun. Tomorrow's 
terrorist may be able to do more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Finding that no existing public or private organization is "positioned 
adequately to address the nation's needs" in computer security, the experts 
called for creation of an Information Security Foundation funded by member 
subscriptions and fees for security evaluation and other services. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the two agencies traditionally assigned with overseeing technology 
-- the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security 
Agency -- appears prepared to tackle such a task, the panel said in its 
303-page report entitled "Computers at Risk." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "the market does not work well enough to raise the security of 
computer systems at a rate fast enough to match the apparent growth in threats 
to systems," said the panel, headed by David Clark of Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology in Cambridge.

re Agassi still faces sanctions from the International Tennis Federation for 
pulling out of the Grand Slam Cup, an ITF official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi originally signed to play in next week's $6-million tournament in 
Munich, then pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
Last week he reluctantly agreed to play again, fearing he would be barred from 
one or more of the grand slam competitions next year and might face a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Then he withdrew again Tuesday because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
ITF official Bill Babcock told Reuters the federation had received Agassi's 
medical report and would now ask first reserve Brad Gilbert of the United 
States to take his place in the elite 16-player tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the ITF had not dropped discussions on what penalties to impose on 
Agassi for his earlier conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"No decision will be made now until after the Grand Slam Cup," Babcock added. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, runner-up in the U.S. Open and French Open this year, has torn 
cartilage in his chest, suffered during last weekend's Davis Cup victory over 
Australia. He will be out of action for three to six weeks.

The San Diego Padres sent Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar to the Toronto Blue 
Jays today for Fred McGriff and Tony Fernandez in the first big trade of the 
winter meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays and Padres broke up a flurry of free agent signings with the 
announcement. At last season's winter meetings, the Padres acquired Carter from 
Cleveland and he hit 24 home runs and had 115 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar batted .287 for the Padres with six homers and 60 RBIs. McGriff, the 
Blue Jays' first baseman, hit 35 homers and drove in 108 runs in 1990 and 
Fernandez hit .276 with four homers and 66 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Braves made their second major move of the winter meetings when 
they signed free agent first baseman Sid Bream of Pittsburgh to a three-year 
contract, while Houston slugger Franklin Stubbs signed a three-year contract 
with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Twins, in search of a reliever, acquired Steve Bedrosian from the 
San Francisco Giants for minor league pitcher Johnny Ard and a player to be 
named later. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Braves signed third baseman Terry Pendleton to a four-year deal 
for $10.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Today they added more sock with Bream, 30, who batted .270 with 15 homers and 
67 RBIs for the NL East champion Pirates last season. In seven big-league 
seasons, Bream has a .263 average with 60 home runs and 307 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs, 30, hit .261 with 71 RBIs and 19 stolen bases for the Astros in the 
best of his big-league seasons, all spent in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Manager Tom Trebelhorn said Stubbs, a first baseman for most of his 
career, will play right field for Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs is a .236 lifetime hitter. He hit 23 homers for the Dodgers in 1986 and 
was traded to Houston before the start of last season. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the Giants signed reliever Dave Righetti to a four-year 
contract for $10 million and started talks with the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian, 33, was 9-9 last season with 17 saves for the Giants. In nine 
seasons with Atlanta, Philadelphia and the Giants, the right-hander has 178 
saves. As a member of the Phillies in 1987, he won the Cy Young Award when he 
saved 40 games in 65 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
In other moves: 
</P>
<P>
Detroit -- The Tigers dipped into the Japanese League again when they signed 
free agent infielder Tony Bernazard to a one-year contract today. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Tigers signed Cecil Fielder out of Japan and he ended up leading 
the major leagues with 51 homers and 132 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Bernazard, 34, played in the Japanese League for the last three seasons. A 
switch-hitter, he has a career average of .262 with 75 home runs and 391 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto -- Free agent Pat Tabler, baseball's best bases-loaded hitter, signed a 
two-year contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. He is a career .500 hitter in 
bases-loaded situations.

Baseball owners today gave their labor negotiators approval to make a collusion 
settlement with the players. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, we can consider the collusion agreement concluded," said Chuck 
O'Connor, general counsel of the Players Relations Committee. "We don't have a 
definite document yet -- there is still some language to work out -- but we 
have points of agreement." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said the agreement will be sent to the Players Assn. and a vote is 
expected at the union's winter meeting in Orlando, Fla., on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved, as expected, the owners will pay $280 million in 
collusion damages and 16 players will again become free agents. Among the 
players involved are Gary Gaetti and Dave Smith.

Demolition work began this week at the Kingdome to tear down the stadium's left 
field wall in order to add 12 feet in left field for Seattle Mariners games in 
the 1991 baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
The project is costing King County $902,324. 
</P>
<P>
Workers began demolishing the concrete wall after Sunday's NFL game between the 
Seattle Seahawks and the Houston Oilers, Kingdome spokeswoman Carol Keaton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The remodeling project, done at the Mariners' request, is expected to increase 
the distance from home plate to the left field wall from 324 feet to 336 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Keaton said workers began cutting and fitting a new AstroTurf 
surface for baseball this week. The new surface will be in place when the 
Mariners open their 15th season in April.

Guns 'N Roses singer Axl Rose and his next-door neighbor agreed to avoid each 
other to chill a simmering feud marked by the rocker's arrest on an assault 
complaint, Rose's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, 28, and Gabriella Kantor, 37, entered an agreement stating that "she 
stays away from him and he stays away from her," attorney Jeff E. Scott said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was filed with Santa Monica Superior Court on Nov. 29, Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Rose at his West Hollywood 
apartment on Oct. 30 following a dispute with Kantor, who said the musician was 
blaring his music. 
</P>
<P>
Rose spent several hours in jail before posting $5,000 bail. Prosecutors 
declined to file charges, citing a lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Kantor claimed Rose confronted her outside his 12th-floor apartment, threw her 
keys off a balcony and hit her on the head with a wine bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Rose denied striking Kantor and suggested she hurt herself by repeatedly 
pounding on his apartment door. 
</P>
<P>
Both Rose and Kantor have obtained temporary restraining orders against each 
other.

Prince Charles, who's still recovering from a broken right arm, said today he's 
wary of shaking hands with Americans, especially Texans. 
</P>
<P>
He told a patient at a West London clinic that his arm, badly broken in a June 
polo accident, continues to heal. 
</P>
<P>
"But he said don't shake hands with anyone from America -- especially Texans -- 
because they shake your hand too hard," said Mabel Newson, 79, who met the heir 
to the British throne at St. Dunstan's Community Leg Ulcer Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The prince's arm was broken in two places above the elbow when he fell off his 
horse during a polo match. The arm did not heal properly, and the 42-year-old 
son of Queen Elizabeth II had surgery in September.

Until then, the entertainer, born Nathan Birnbaum on Jan. 20, 1896, isn't 
exactly sitting around counting his birthday candles. 
</P>
<P>
He appears several times a year at Caesars resorts in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, 
Nev., and Atlantic City and has just released his eighth book, "All My Best 
Friends." 
</P>
<P>
He'll be taping a television special next month to mark his birthday, and a 
fourth "Oh, God!" movie is being written for him. 
</P>
<P>
The new Burns book includes anecdotes about Eddie Cantor when he was a singing 
waiter in a Coney Island saloon; Milton Berle as a boy in a shoe ad, and the 
Marx Brothers when they were a musical act.

A man involved in a minor traffic accident was struck and killed on the San 
Diego Freeway this morning as he tried to run across the highway after 
reporting the mishap on an emergency call box, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lmanyeo Darnell Scott, 23, of Corona was hit by another car as he attempted to 
cross the car-pool lane on the freeway near the Costa Mesa Freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
Scott ran across northbound lanes, jumped the center divider and then crossed 
southbound lanes to reach the call box. Police said Scott was told that a 
police car would pick him up at the call box and was directed not to cross back 
over the 10 lanes of the highway on foot, but he apparently ignored the advice. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car that collided with Scott was injured slightly and was not 
cited.
