S.D. RANKS HIGHEST IN NEW INMATES WITH DRUGS IN THEIR SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Men and women booked into San Diego jails tested positive for multiple drugs 
more often than in any other city surveyed, a recent National Institute of 
Justice study showed. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of two or more drugs was detected in the urine of 48% of the males 
and 54% of the females booked into San Diego jails during a three-month period, 
the study showed. Ranking second were Washington's new inmates, with 36% of the 
men and 46% of the women testing positive for two or more drugs, the survey 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has to do with the availability of drugs," said Susan Pennell, 
director of the criminal research unit of the San Diego Assn. of Governments. 
"We've got amphetamines here, we've got cocaine here. It's all very easy to 
get. In other areas, it may not be as available." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 161 men who agreed to be tested between January and March, 1989, about 
85% tested positive for at least one drug. Drugs were found in the urine of 83% 
of the 104 women tested over a similar period. Almost all of the inmates agreed 
to be tested when asked. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine and amphetamines were the drugs of choice among San Diego's new female 
inmate population, while cocaine and marijuana were the men's first choices. 
But consistent with previous studies, both men and women booked into San 
Diego's jails had amphetamines in their urine far more frequently than inmates 
in any other city surveyed. Thirty-five percent of San Diego's male arrestees 
and 45% of its female arrestees tested positive for amphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the men and 75% of the women also admitted to injecting 
amphetamines at some time, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers and drug enforcement officials attribute the high incidence of 
amphetamine use among San Diego's new inmate population to the region's 
proximity to rural areas, where drug labs are easily hidden, and to speed 
manufacturers who have created a market for the drug. (As a result of recent 
crackdowns on illegal drug labs in San Diego, many manufacturers are believed 
to have moved to San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.) 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you get a hula hoop fad in New England and not in Texas?" asked Eric 
Wish, an adviser with the National Institute of Justice's drug use forecasting 
program. "Because someone there pushed it." 
</P>
<P>
Although women make up only about 15% of San Diego's new arrestees, their drug 
use is particularly troubling to county drug prevention officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug use among female offenders is as serious, and in some cases more serious, 
than male offenders," Pennell said. "By nature of their proportion in the 
system, they sometimes get forgotten. But women drug abusers have a significant 
impact on other groups -- like babies." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Morton, assistant director of drug abuse services for the San Diego 
County Department of Health Services, said there has been a focus on treatment 
programs for women, particularly pregnant women. But, she added, the need for 
drug treatment for both sexes far outpaces the number of available beds. Last 
year, no more than 140 county-funded beds were available, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The high percentage of both men and women testing positive for amphetamines 
"really points up the need for more treatment programs," Morton said. "These 
are people who are voluntarily being tested. It shows not only are there lots 
of people out there using drugs, but that a lot of them are reaching out for 
help." 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly urine tests, funded by the National Institute of Justice through 
the San Diego Assn. of Governments, are voluntary and have no effect on a newly 
booked inmate's judicial proceedings. The program, which tests urine samples 
for 10 drugs and has been used to collect data since 1987, costs about $50,000 
a year to administer in San Diego.

DESIGN FOR ESCONDIDO ARTS CENTER WILL BE UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed design of Escondido's $55-million Center for the Arts, a 
stucco-and-glass collection of buildings connected by courtyards and arcades, 
will be unveiled, discussed and perhaps approved at a 6:30 p.m. public workshop 
today at Escondido City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The complex, approved in concept by Escondido voters in 1984, will feature a 
1,550-seat performing arts theater, a 400-seat community theater, a 
25,000-square-foot conference and meeting center, and a three-gallery fine arts 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The complex will be built on Escondido Boulevard, just northwest of the new 
City Hall and on 12 acres now used for softball games and other recreation at 
the city's historic Grape Day Park. Construction is expected to begin next 
November, and completion is expected by the spring of 1993. The project is 
being financed with community redevelopment funds; today's design approval 
would come from the City Council sitting as the Community Development 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Renzo Zecchetto, the project designer for the architectural firm of Moore Ruble 
Yudell of Santa Monica, says the arts complex will reflect contemporary 
California-Spanish architecture. The public entrance will be a courtyard off 
Escondido Boulevard. Around the courtyard will be the entrances into the larger 
Lyric Theater, the smaller community theater and the meeting center. 
</P>
<P>
Connecting all four major buildings in a campus-like setting will be 16 
courtyards and a series of promenades intended to serve as a flowing connection 
between the complex and the adjoining city park, Zecchetto said. 
</P>
<P>
Adjoining parking lots will accommodate 900 cars. 
</P>
<P>
The three-balcony Lyric Theater is expected to be able to host all but the 
largest of the touring Broadway productions, as well as symphonies, opera and 
dance productions. The theater is the single most expensive component of the 
complex, at nearly $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
The theater's stage will have a sprung hardwood floor, an amenity sought by 
dancers and one that is not even offered at San Diego's Civic Theatre unless 
specially built for a particular performance, said Diane Annala, executive 
director of the arts center and former executive director of the San Diego 
Foundation for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller community theater -- to replace a small facility now used by the 
community playhouse, which is in the upstairs room of an Escondido shopping 
center and which relies on folding chairs -- will play host to improvisational 
theater, lectures, fashion shows, chamber music performances and civic programs 
and pageants. One of the most distinctive features of the $7.8-million theater 
will be balcony seating, uncommon for facilities of this size. 
</P>
<P>
The fine arts center will provide not only galleries for the display of 
paintings, sculpture, photographs and hand-crafted art works, but also studios 
and workshops for classes. The conference-meeting center will be the city's 
largest and will be able to accommodate banquets of 800 people.

Call it Miracle on 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
Those often unappreciated bureaucrats in City Hall will have their own 
Christmas tree and menorah, after all. 
</P>
<P>
And St. Nick didn't even have to lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' motion for the rotunda display was approved 
Tuesday after reassurances that the tree and menorah -- as long as the latter 
is unlit -- are considered secular symbols and thus appropriate for a 
government building. 
</P>
<P>
Only Monday, the Department of General Services told The Times that there would 
be no such display for another reason: Council policy holds that decorations in 
the rotunda must relate to municipal functions. 
</P>
<P>
But a Flores aide brushed that policy aside as "open to interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
When the subject came up last year, the council voted to place a "decorated" 
tree -- which bore an uncanny resemblance to a Christmas tree -- and an unlit 
menorah in the crowded Main Street lobby of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The members briefly considered placing the display on the south lawn. But 
Councilman Nate Holden warned there could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some people who are not all together," he pointed out. "They can 
unscrew some of those bulbs." 
</P>
<P>
"We can post armed guards," Council President John Ferraro quipped. 
</P>
<P>
These days, council sessions are broadcast on cable television, so there was no 
such colorful banter in the chamber Tuesday. In fact, Flores' motion passed 
without a single word of debate. 
</P>
<P>
When bad ratings and good intentions clash in the world of television, you know 
the result. 
</P>
<P>
"Homeroom," an ABC comedy, was canceled Tuesday after finishing 80th in the 
latest Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Councilman Mike Woos' office will present a commendation today to 
the stars of the show, which Woo has praised for presenting positive images of 
the inner city and of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
Next to roadways, one of the most lively arenas of automotive battle is the 
parking lot, where darting cars vie for treasured openings between the white 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
The other night in Newhall, however, no one challenged the long vehicle that 
pulled into a supermarket lot -- possibly because it was a hearse with a 
license plate that proclaimed, LAST RID, and script on the side that said, 
"Death Cruiser." 
</P>
<P>
Some people just love their work. 
</P>
<P>
It's not exactly a case of having your cake and eating it too. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-by-6-foot chocolate replica of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, constructed 
by five Bonaventure Hotel chefs to salute the Music Center's 25th anniversary, 
will be admired -- but not eaten -- during today's ceremonies. (Guests will 
dine instead on carrot cake.) 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate edifice will merely sit on display in the Music Center Plaza. A 
real test for chocoholics, considering that it contains 250 pounds of the dark 
and white varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Then what will happen to the cake? 
</P>
<P>
A Bonaventure spokeswoman said it might be given to a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
But donations evidently aren't such simple matters anymore. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the hotel would want to obtain a liability waiver for what would 
be day-old fare.

STOUFFER WINS LAST HARBOR ISLAND HOTEL SITE; 
</P>
<P>
PORT DISTRICT: A SAN DIEGO FIRM WAS PICKED TO DEVELOP A LUXURY, 430-ROOM HOTEL 
AT A COVETED SPOT ACROSS HARBOR DRIVE FROM LINDBERGH FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By the narrowest of margins, the Board of Port Commissioners on Tuesday 
selected a local development firm over three others to build a luxury Stouffer 
hotel on the last hotel site on picturesque Harbor Island. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Boulder Creek Co., a subsidiary of San Diego-based R. B. 
McComic Inc., was made in the first round of an unusual paper vote. 
Commissioners, who heard no arguments for or against any of the proposals, 
marked ballots, which were tabulated by a Port District clerk. 
</P>
<P>
The suspense may not have been the stuff of an Academy Award presentation, but 
that was of little solace to the large and fidgety gathering of dark-suited 
developers. When the votes of the seven-member commission were counted, four 
were for Boulder Creek and three were for Harbortel, a partnership that wanted 
to build a Ritz-Carlton hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Voting for the Stouffer project were commissioners Bill Rick, Milford Portwood, 
Delton Reopelle and Ray Burk. Those in favor of Ritz-Carlton were Dan Larsen, 
Louis Wolfsheimer and Robert Penner. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing no votes were separate proposals for an Inter-Continental and Westin 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very pleased to have won. I'm frankly surprised it came so 
quickly on the first vote," said R. Barry McComic, chairman of R.B. McComic, 
who, along with Gary S. Copson, own Boulder Creek Co. "We felt we had the best 
design for the property." 
</P>
<P>
If negotiations go smoothly, the 430-room hotel would break ground in August, 
1991, and open for business the following August, a construction timetable 
officials for the development firms say is very tight. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was little discussion of the proposals Tuesday, the 
commissioners spent several hours last week listening to detailed presentations 
from each developer and hotel operator. During the week, the San Diego Unified 
Port District staff analyzed the proposals. The port report said that "any of 
the four proposals should result in an excellent hotel development," but 
concluded that the Ritz-Carlton was the best choice. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that, although McComic and Copson have extensive 
experience building residential projects, "their direct hotel development 
experience is limited." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Port District staff noted the unusual design of the hotel and its 
extensive use of recreational facilities, such as three swimming pools, a 
children's tide pool, spa, health club, two tennis courts, a 42,000-gallon 
saltwater aquarium, a waterfall, fountains and reflecting pools, as items that 
set it apart. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel includes a 15-story tower of about 372 rooms and separate casitas 
(luxury suites). The top of the tower, limited to 160 feet in height by the 
Federal Aviation Administration, will house a restaurant with a 300-degree view 
of downtown, the bay and Balboa Park. The building's facade will be of 
sandstone and marble. 
</P>
<P>
The architect of the Stouffer project, Joseph Martinez of Martinez-Wong 
Associates, also is based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District places construction value of the project at $77.4 million, 
while the developers place overall value at $89 million. 
</P>
<P>
For years, developers have coveted the east Harbor Island site, between the 
Lockheed Ocean Laboratory and Sunroad Resort Marina. The site is now used as a 
parking lot for rental cars. 
</P>
<P>
The property, across Harbor Drive from Lindbergh Field and surrounded by 
hotels, restaurants and marinas, is one of the Port District's premier 
waterfront locations. The agency decided last May to solicit hotel proposals. 
</P>
<P>
What it wanted was a resort-oriented, first-class hotel of up to 500 rooms on 8 
1/2 acres, an acre of which would be devoted to landscaped open space. 
</P>
<P>
As well as imposing design and development criteria, the Port District set 
financial guidelines, including a $400,000 non-refundable payment for the 
development option; a 50-year lease that would pay the district $400,000 the 
first year; $800,000 annually in years 2 through 10, and $1.2 million from the 
11th through the 20th years, rather than percentages of the hotel's business.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thieves in Oceanside looted a car while a body was in the back seat, police 
said Tuesday. The body was that of Tom Van Do, 23, a Cal Poly Pomona student 
who had been missing since Nov. 28. Do had been shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Do's body was found after officers answered complaints from residents in the 
400 block of Bush Street that a car hadn't been moved in two weeks. But, before 
officers could check the car, they had a priority call. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later residents were alerted when the car's alarm went off. They 
saw Do's body, partly hidden under a pile of clothing in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
When police returned they found the car's rear license plate and radio had been 
taken. Both had been present when police saw the car earlier. Police speculated 
that thieves may have disturbed the clothing that concealed Do when they looted 
the car.

Former fugitive Charles Russ was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on charges that 
he murdered his wife and bilked his mother-in-law out of her life's savings. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Joe Littlejohn ordered a Dec. 19 Superior Court hearing to 
schedule a trial for Russ. 
</P>
<P>
Russ, 39, is accused of killing his artist wife, Pamela Russ, 33, whose 
battered body was found Feb. 1, 1987, on North Torrey Pines Road, apparently 
run over by her own Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony from insurance agents, Russ purchased $600,000 worth of 
life insurance policies for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Russ had been a fugitive since July, 1987. He was arrested in Florida in August 
by a police officer who recognized him from the "America's Most Wanted" TV 
program.

USIU PRESIDENT SAYS $15-MILLION LOAN TO EASE DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United States International University has received a commitment for a 
$15-million loan that would complete a "major step" in the financially troubled 
university's debt restructuring, USIU President William C. Rust said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rust, in a prepared release, said the loan will "result in the repayment of all 
monetary encumbrances secured by the university's San Diego campus." The 
long-term loan was arranged by Federal Home Loans Corp., a private company, and 
involves a "consortium of lending source," said Rust. The university did not 
identify the individual lenders. 
</P>
<P>
USIU's planned financial restructuring includes "selling some of the 
University's assets," according to Rust. One of USIU's major non-university 
assets is a majority share of a corporation that owns San Diego-based WUSI-TV 
(Channel 51). 
</P>
<P>
Word of the loan commitment came as USIU was responding to an accrediting 
organization that recently threatened to revoke USIU's accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Oakland-based Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges, which accredits 
senior colleges and universities in California and Hawaii, uncovered "serious 
financial problems," inadequate staffing and low morale. 
</P>
<P>
In July, USIU Provost Joseph Merante dismissed the association's bleak report 
as "a value judgment." Merante contended that USIU was suffering from a 
short-term cash-flow problem. He said serious financial deficiencies mentioned 
in the report were the result of a "difference of opinion" on whether USIU 
should sell some of its assets to alleviate seasonal cash-flow problems.

SWEATSHOPS IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In our small town in the East, there were over 20 unionized clothing factories 
from World War I to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s and '60s, clothing factories made up of primarily Chinese 
immigrants started sweatshops in the section of Little Italy. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1970s, all these (unionized) factories were closed up because our 
union manufacturers were having the work done in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Our union paid us no heed, and hundreds of other unionized factories went out 
of business. The mediator whose office was in the union building ignored our 
association's grievances, and 95% of the clothing factories in New York, New 
Jersey and Pennsylvania had to close down. The New York Times would not print 
our letters -- we could not get any answers, so we were forced out. We were 
paying monthly dues to our association and a fee to the union. 
</P>
<P>
Were the manufacturers paying off our association? You tell me. But hundreds of 
us contractors had to close our doors. Nobody would listen to us and so we went 
out of business and our operators went on the unemployment list.

With the best minds in Washington continually failing to come up with a 
workable plan to reduce the deficit you'd think the problem was a difficult 
one. Look again! The answer is so simple it's staring George Washington in the 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Let Uncle Sam sell advertising space on the backs of our paper currency. Just 
think, little billboards in our wallets. Imagine the price McDonalds would pay 
to advertise a Big Mac on a greenback! And how much do you think Mrs. Paul 
would fork over to place "In Cod We Trust" on the back of a fin? How about a 
little ad on the back of a single that says, "If this bill's for US, this Bud's 
for YOU." Or an Alpha Beta ad that reads, "One dollar off with this coupon!" 
Five'll get you ten Madison Avenue will have the deficit cleared up in no time.

All these years the West was worried over the "domino theory" and here it turns 
out that the Soviets should have worried about it more.

HOUSING FEE COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to The Times for providing space to Bill Boyarsky to comment on the 
inner workings of Los Angeles city government. He's a terrific writer and I 
usually enjoy his column. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a recent column was inaccurate. In "How a Law Gets Written by 
Lobbyists" (Metro, Nov. 22), Boyarsky wrote, "Two smart attorneys" (a 
developer's attorney and myself) were responsible for drafting the proposed Los 
Angeles ordinance requiring commercial developers to pay a $5 a square foot 
affordable housing linkage fee. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take two attorneys of any particular intelligence to compromise 
between $2.50 and $7.50 at $5. The only reason developers agreed to the $5 
compromise was due to pressure of tenants, community organizers and nonprofit 
housing providers requiring payment of a housing linkage fee. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the linkage fee originated in December, 1988, in "Housing Los 
Angeles: Affordable Housing for the Future," the report of the city's Blue 
Ribbon Committee for Affordable Housing. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 9 months, more than 30 persons from both the public and private 
sector, including aides from City Council offices, various city departments and 
the city attorney's office, have served on a city task force to study linkage 
fees in Los Angeles. Several hotly contested hearings were held on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Nonprofit housing providers, community activists, and others consistently 
pressed the City Council to require commercial developers to pay their fair 
share for the loss of affordable housing consequent to development. It is these 
dedicated persons who participated in hearings, and/or served on the committee 
and task force who are responsible for this long overdue legislation.

SWEATSHOPS IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your exposure of the degrading exploitation of garment workers in Orange County 
performs an urgent public service and the work of your staff writer Sonni Efron 
is an achievement in the best traditions of journalism (Part A, Nov. 26-28). 
This should, hopefully, stimulate a new movement for reform. 
</P>
<P>
But your editorial ("Clean Up the Sweatshops," Nov. 29) falls short of offering 
any drastic new remedies commensurate with the gravity of the conditions in the 
industry. Your call for publicly exposing manufacturers is a slender reed, 
indeed, to depend upon. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Advisory Committee on Garment Manufacturing (appointed by 
the labor commissioner pursuant to a provision of the 1981 Garment 
Manufacturing Act) and as its elected chairman from 1982 through 1985, I had 
the opportunity for close observation of the workings of the garment trade. 
Several meetings of the committee jointly offered important legislation. 
</P>
<P>
It is a low-capitalization, labor-intensive industry. A few machines, a place 
to work, a few employees requiring only the scantiest training or home workers 
willing to rent machines, a manufacturer willing to give you work -- and you're 
in business as a contractor (or further down the line as a subcontractor). 
Contractors come and go, they change locations or names or nominal ownerships. 
</P>
<P>
In a business that is a highly competitive to begin with, this situation lends 
itself to the most cutthroat forms of competition -- with the prime 
manufacturer squeezing the terms to ever lower levels. Labor law violations and 
debasement of workers prevail. 
</P>
<P>
You are right in calling for a beefing up of enforcement personnel, maintaining 
the bar against homework at the state and federal levels, and implementing the 
hot cargo laws. But these are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
A further ingredient is essential: New state legislation is needed, making the 
prime manufacturer jointly liable with his contractors for the latter's 
violation of the labor code. This would fix responsibility squarely where it 
belongs. 
</P>
<P>
The prime movers (retailers, manufacturers, jobbers as the case may be) cannot 
escape the obligation to scrutinize the operations of those whom they contract 
with to do their work. And they cannot plead ignorance of the situation in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the advisory committee who represented contractors concurred 
in the effort to get joint liability legislation introduced in the state 
Legislature. They recognized that such a measure would not only protect 
workers, but also shield contractors, who wish to observe the law, against 
cutthroat competition. 
</P>
<P>
A joint liability law -- and unionization of the workers -- would go a long way 
toward bringing stability to the industry and decent working conditions to the 
workers.

Hottest ticket in Orange County in years is the sold-out Ram-49er game Monday 
night at Anaheim Stadium. Brokers are asking as much as $400 for choice 
locations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, plenty of seats remain in all price categories for the Raider-Cardinal 
game Sunday at the Coliseum. Ticket-holders are advised to keep their stubs. It 
could be the last Raider game played in Los Angeles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a couple of other seniors, promoter Bob Arum and Mirage Hotel owner Steve 
Wynn, should fight on the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran card. Arum is unhappy 
about not being able to run the show alone and says Wynn is "trying to reinvent 
the wheel.". . . .

Nobody works a fight better than Richard Steele, the former light-heavyweight 
from Los Angeles who has been named to referee the main event Thursday night. .

Junior Seau broke into tears when he received the USC most-valuable-player

</P>
<P>
When he was given the team's defensive-player-of-the-year award earlier in the

<P>
Oklahoma State simply caught Memphis State a little short. 
</P>
<P>
With Memphis State missing its top two centers, the Cowboys found plenty of 
scoring room inside and trounced the 16th-ranked Tigers, 93-66, Tuesday night 
at Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this could happen," Memphis State Coach Larry Finch said. "We lost our 
two big men and had to go with three first-year players." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Mundt broke his hand in practice last week and his replacement, Tim 
Duncan, got sick Monday and couldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
That left the Tigers (3-1) with 6-7 Ben Spiva, who didn't score, and freshman 
Montrell Nash, who had two points in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of them could stop Byron Houston, who scored 24 points and had 12 
rebounds, or Royce Jeffries, who added 20 points for Oklahoma State (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech 76, No. 21 Alabama 75 -- Freshman Rod Wheeler made a three-point 
shot with 2:23 left to put the Hokies ahead to stay in an upset of the Crimson 
Tide at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler made three free throws and Bimbo Coles, who scored 34 points, had two 
in the final seconds as Virginia Tech (2-1) held on. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Cheatum had 21 points and 15 rebounds for Alabama (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
No. 19 North Carolina State 67, No. 15 St. John's 58 -- Rodney Monroe and Chris 
Corchiani scored 22 points each and the Wolfpack used a six-point play to beat 
the Redmen at Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's (5-2) built a 50-44 lead on Boo Harvey's three-point shot with 11:37 
left. He became a key figure in the six-point play when he fouled Tom Gugliotta 
of the Wolfpack (5-1) 26 seconds later. Harvey slammed the ball on the floor 
and was assesed a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State's Mickey Hinnant made one of two free throws, but 
officials ruled the wrong shooter attempted the free throws. Gugliotta made 
both free throws and Corchiani followed by making both free throws for the 
technical. The Wolfpack kept the ball and Corchiani made a jumper to tie the 
game with 10:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
Corchiani's three-point play with eight minutes left broke a 52-52 tie, and St. 
John's managed just eight points in the final 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Illinois 74, No. 25 Florida 69 -- Marcus Liberty scored 21 points and 
Kendall Gill added 19 as the Illini got past the Gators at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini (3-0), winning for the 26th time in the last 27 games in which Gill 
has played, scored the first five points of the second half to pull away from a 
34-34 halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne Schintzius scored 19 points for Florida (1-1), but missed two free 
throws in the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 Arkansas 90, Mississippi 76 -- Todd Day scored 15 of his 18 points in 
the second half and the Razorbacks rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit 
to overcome the Rebels at Pine Bluff, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss (0-4) put on a spurt late in the first half and led, 44-35, at 
halftime. Tim Jumper and John Matthews scored 18 points each for the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Huery scored 14 of his 21 points and Lee Mayberry had 11 of his 16 in the 
second half for Arkansas (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 Indiana 81, Notre Dame 72 -- Freshman Calbert Cheaney scored 20 points 
and the Hoosiers (4-0) beat the Fighting Irish at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Daimon Sweet had 16 points for Notre Dame (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Alabama Birmingham 79, Oregon 69 -- Andy Kennedy scored 22 points as the 
Blazers defeated the Ducks at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Ogg had 15 points and 13 rebounds for UAB (3-1). Richard Lucas scored 19 
points for Oregon (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young 65, Arizona State 64 -- Marty Haws scored 20 points and Andy 
Toolson added 17 as the Cougars held off the Sun Devils at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (5-1) had a 65-57 lead, but Arizona State (0-3) scored the last 
seven points on Matt Anderson's three-point shot with 1:54 left, Alex Austin's 
jumper 30 seconds later and Emilio Kovacic's jumper with 52 seconds left.

STREAKY PEPPERDINE GETS PAST TENNESSEE CHATTANOOGA, 96-82

<P>
Pepperdine, playing tough but streaky defense and scoring in spurts, defeated 
Tennessee Chattanooga, 96-82, in a nonconference game Tuesday night before 
1,721 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves forced spates of Tennessee Chattanooga turnovers and did much of 
their scoring after Moccasin mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
But they did so inconsistently and had trouble shaking the visitors, despite 
leading by as many as 13 points in the first half and 22 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lewis scored 23 points on 11-of-16 shooting to lead four other Pepperdine 
players who scored in double figures. Dexter Howard made nine of 10 shots from 
the field and finished with 21 points, Doug Christie had 15 points and eight 
assists, Geoff Lear had 14 points and a game-high 10 rebounds and Craig Davis 
14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine guard Shann Ferch had a game-high 13 assists and seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Kirce of Tennessee Chattanooga (4-1) scored a game-high 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said that his team's hot-and-cold spells "drive me 
nuts." 
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is sustain our defense and play hard and intelligently 
because it generates our offense," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine is 2-2.

DEFENSE CUTS FORCE 140 LAYOFFS AT TRW'S SAN DIEGO DIVISION

<P>
Beginning early next year, 140 employees at TRW's San Diego-based Military 
Electronics &amp; Avionics Division will be laid off because of a drop in 
defense electronics contracts, according to a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 15% of the 950 employees at the division's Carmel Mountain facility and 
10% of the unit's total staff of 1,400 will be affected by the layoff, TRW 
spokesman Tim Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
He said about 60 local employees received notice of the planned layoff Friday, 
and the rest will receive official notice between Jan. 1 and April 30. No 
layoffs are planned at any of the division's other offices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan attributed the layoffs "to the cyclical nature of the procurement process 
rather than the defense cutbacks that everyone is focusing on." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of critical programs in the demonstration and validation 
phase, and those are winding down in 1989. In 1990, we plan to compete 
vigorously for those full-scale development contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we have to cycle down pending the award of full-scale 
production contracts, he said."

Carl Karcher Enterprises: The parent of Carl's Jr. restaurants said 
third-quarter earnings declined 3.8% to $4.1 million. Revenue totaled $121.6 
million, up 14.1% from the same period a year ago. The Anaheim company blamed 
the lower earnings in part on an expansion program and higher competitive

PEOPLE: CARTER TO LEAVE GREAT AMERICAN BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas F. Carter, who as senior vice president and chief lending officer at 
Great American Bank led a committee that significantly whittled down the 
savings and loan's portfolio of non-performing assets, announced his 
resignation from the S&amp;L effective at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 49, said he is leaving the job he has held since December, 1987, to 
pursue "entrepreneurial opportunities" although he said he has not yet decided 
what line of work he will follow. He will be replaced by F. Raymond Silliman, 
executive vice president and a Great American executive since 1984. Both Carter 
and Great American insisted that Carter's decision to resign was his alone. 
</P>
<P>
When Carter returned to Great American in 1987 -- he had previously worked for 
the S&amp;L from 1964 to 1981 -- after a six-year stint as a real estate 
developer, there was speculation that the San Diego native was in line to 
become the S&amp;L's chief executive. But Carter said Tuesday that he decided 
over the last month that helping manage a mammoth S&amp;L with $16.4 billion in 
assets was not his cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
When Carter rejoined Great American in December, 1987, Great American's bad 
loans totaled $495 million, or 3.27% of assets, a relatively high percentage. 
About half of those loans were in Arizona, where overbuilding and falling land 
values led to problems for several S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was named to head a team charged specifically with reduce the bad 
assets. After nearly two years of massive write-downs and foreclosure sales, he 
helped Great American reduce its non-performing loans to $321 million, or 1.95% 
of assets, as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Carter said Great American's bad loans should be reduced further, 
to about $260 million by the of this year, but that the reduction will be 
accomplished without the massive loan loss provisions taken by Great American 
in recent quarters. During the quarter ending Dec. 31, Great American will sell 
up to $40 million worth of foreclosed properties and bring current up to $50 
million in now-delinquent loans, he said. CHRIS KRAUL

LAMB'S 'FESTIVAL OF CHRISTMAS' TIES SEASON'S SENTIMENTS IN A BOW;

<P>
"Festival of Christmas," the Lamb's Players Theatre's annual hit (many 
performances sell out before opening night), seems impervious to reviews and 
that, perhaps, is as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Kerry Cederberg Meads, who writes each "Festival of Christmas," 
recognized that she was probably never going to write as definitive a Christmas 
story as "A Christmas Carol," so she settled for writing minor riffs on how the 
spirit of the season can touch a heart for the better. 
</P>
<P>
The time and place may change, from Renaissance England to the American Midwest 
to -- in the current production -- turn-of-the-century New Jersey. But what 
results is always a familiar grab bag of warm, fuzzy feelings, studded with 
carols beautifully sung by Lamb's talented ensemble and topped with a big bow 
of a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike "A Christmas Carol," which courts the ecumenical, Meads' "A Festival of 
Christmas" is very much for believers who wish to be reminded -- often in the 
course of the show -- that Christmas is, first and last, the celebration of the 
birth of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
Meads' latest story, her seventh in 12 years, tells of a brief, life-changing 
journey through the land of the Faerie. The central character is a woman who 
lost a child at birth the Christmas before, and turned a cold heart to her 
husband's 5-year-old daughter from his first marriage. It is based, in part, on 
"The Gifts of the Child Christ" by Scottish storyteller George MacDonald, and 
the play as a whole is a valentine to MacDonald and his storytelling, rich in 
fantasy, myth and morals. 
</P>
<P>
The action begins in late 19th-Century New Jersey where MacDonald (Robert 
Smyth) has been asked to dinner along with Belinda Lippencott (Deborah Gilmour 
Smyth), the woman who has lost the child, and her husband, Thomas (Mike 
Buckley). 
</P>
<P>
Belinda wants nothing to do with MacDonald or his talk of children and fairies. 
But, when she waits, alone, for her husband to make excuses so they can flee to 
another party, she begins to read one of MacDonald's books. As the lights dim 
she finds herself moved suddenly to a strange land where shadows walk like 
people, leading her to goblins and a wise woman, a King and Queen and 
ultimately, a shadow play of her own life. 
</P>
<P>
For Gilmour Smyth to make this work is no mean trick; she rightly understands 
that she has not just entered Faerie land, but the world of her own 
unconscious. She lets us see her subtly reduce in age from an imperious, 
world-weary adult in her 30s to a petulant 12-year-old and then mature, again, 
in a more wholesome way. 
</P>
<P>
If the turnaround smacks of sitcom formula in its completeness, that's more in 
the writing than in the performance. It's particularly troubling in the closing 
passage as Smyth makes a hairpin turn from mourning her child to rejoicing in 
her rediscovery of the 5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Some necessary tears and an appreciation of the crucial role time plays in 
healing get overlooked in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Smyth, who keeps the direction fluid and affecting, plays MacDonald like 
a warm, witty and wise Jiminy Cricket, literally over Gilmour Smyth's shoulder. 
In the dream sequence, he narrates part of the story and advises her 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Beaubeaux is enchanting as the maid in the opening scene who becomes the 
blind old guide in the fantasy. Leigh Scarritt is deeply moving as the young 
child, Sophie, and is eloquent as the fleeting Shadow. Buckley as Thomas 
Lippencott, David Heath and Pat Thayer as friends at the dinner, all offer fine 
support. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few disappointments is Mike Buckley's set design -- a simple sitting 
room, which has but one inspired moment, although that one is a doozy: a sudden 
smoky drop through the floor to a goblin's lair. For the rest, as long as we 
are going to have Faerie and goblin costumes (the effective clothes were by 
Margaret Neuhoff Vida and masks by Nathan Peirson), could we not have a sprig 
of greenery or twinkling lights, or from sound designer Mary Kidd, a hooting 
owl that might suggest an enchanted forest? 
</P>
<P>
Kidd's musical direction more than makes up for the lack of sound design; the 
carol arrangements may have reached a new poetic height. 
</P>
<P>
This "Festival" ends on the feeling that it gives patrons exactly what they've 
come to enjoy over the past 12 years and that, more than anything, is probably 
why, for many ticket buyers, "A Festival" remains a Christmas experience that 
they subscribe to year after year. 
</P>
<P>
This play wouldn't fly at any time of the year. It goes down like warm bread 
pudding on a chilly day. The nutritional value may not be great, but it's 
wonderful while you're eating it around a brightly bedecked table with family 
and friends. Afterward, you may struggle to justify ingesting all those 
low-protein calories, but that would be missing the point. The body needs 
treats as well as sustenance, and, if you can't have one time of year to 
indulge, then what, all moralizing aside, is Christmas really for? 
</P>
<P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: FAME PROVES TOUGHER THAN 
CRITICAL ACCLAIM FOR TWILLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
Dwight Twilley, appearing Saturday night at Rio's in Loma Portal, is one of the 
great unsung heroes of rock 'n' roll. For the last decade and a half, the 
talented singer-songwriter from Tulsa, Okla., has consistently earned critical 
accolades for his enticing fusion of Elvis Presley rockabilly with Beatles pop. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his commercial successes have been few and far between, because of a series 
of close encounters of the worst kind with record companies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a funny situation," Twilley said last Friday over lunch at a restaurant 
in Ocean Beach. "There's a lot of things you can't really predict, things that 
come up and get in the way, and I guess I've just had more problems than most 
people." 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the Dwight Twilley Band signed with Shelter Records. Their first 
single, "I'm On Fire," was an immediate hit, spending two months in the 
national Top 40. The San Francisco Chronicle called it "the best debut single 
by an American rock band ever." 
</P>
<P>
But because of Shelter's shaky condition, there was no album to capitalize on 
the single's success for more than a year, and by the time "Sincerely" finally 
came out, the momentum had been lost and album sales were dismal. 
</P>
<P>
After Shelter folded in 1977, the band signed with Arista Records, which 
released its critically acclaimed follow-up album, "Twilley Don't Mind." 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, however, Shelter was reactivated and wanted Twilley back; 
the ensuing legal battle between Shelter and Arista not only stifled promotion 
of his 1979 solo debut, "Twilley," but prevented the release of any new 
product. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was resolved in 1982 and Twilley promptly resurfaced on a new 
label, EMI America, which issued his next two albums, "Scuba Divers" and 1984's 
"Jungle." The latter album yielded the Top 40 hit "Girls." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, however, the momentum was lost. Twilley's EMI representative left 
the label and, on the advice of management, he switched over to Private Eye 
Records, distributed by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
His 1986 Private Eye debut, "Wild Dogs," was produced by Grammy winner Val 
Garay and predicted to be a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
But a few days before the album's release, FBI footage of Private Eye president 
Joe Isgro meeting with known mob figures appeared on national television, 
kicking off a major industry payola scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"The record company disappeared overnight," Twilley said, "and no one even knew 
the album came out." 
</P>
<P>
Twilley has been without a record contract for three years, but then again, he 
hasn't really been trying. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, I would have gone right back into the studio, but after my last 
experience (with Private Eye), it was sort of like stop, wait a minute, let's 
go back to the basics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So instead of going after a new label, I put together a new band, just like I 
had when I did my first two albums, and it takes a long time to get the right 
kind of chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can press a magic button and make two people sing in 
harmony, but if you give them a couple of years together, eventually something 
starts to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to some unsolicited, but most welcome, national exposure, sales of "The 
Stars Come Out for Christmas," a locally produced compilation album of 
Christmas songs by big-name pop artists, got off to an extraordinarily good 
start last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Within 48 hours, producer Steve Vaus said, more than 1,000 copies of the 
cassette-only album -- a benefit for the Children's Hospital and Health Center 
-- had already been sold, far exceeding his initial expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that it will sell out," Vaus said. "The only 
question is, how soon?" 
</P>
<P>
The primary reason for the success is that several songs on the album, 
including Kenny Loggins' rendition of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," 
have been picked up by the Satellite Music Network (SMN), a national syndicate 
subscribed to by more than 500 adult-contemporary and country radio stations 
throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks ago, there was an item about the project in a column in the Chicago 
Tribune," Vaus said. "The program director for SMN happened to read it and he 
immediately called me up, asking for a copy and promising to promo it. 
</P>
<P>
"They put it on Friday morning about 8:30 and all 10 of our phone lines lit up 
instantly and stayed lit for three or four hours, with us taking order after 
order. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten orders from every state in the union, just on the telephone -- 
and that doesn't account for everything else." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything else" means the 14 local Imperial Savings branch offices and 50 
Taco Bell restaurants where San Diegans can pick up the $7.95 album in person 
rather than ordering it by phone (the mail-order number is 1-800-HIT SONG). 
</P>
<P>
If all 25,000 copies of "The Stars Come Out For Christmas" are sold by 
Christmas, Vaus said, Children's Hospital stands to reap as much as $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Of the album's 18 Christmas songs by 17 different artists, six were recorded 
during October and November right here in San Diego, at Vaus' The Studio in 
Kearny Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The local takes: "The First Noel" by Karla Bonoff, "Mary's Boy Child" by the 
Little River Band, "Away in a Manger" by Kim Carnes, "Do You Hear What I Hear?" 
by the Commodores, "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" by Kenny Loggins, 
and "Christmas Needs Love to Be Christmas" by Juice Newton. 
</P>
<P>
The others are previously recorded tracks sent in by such heavyweights as 
Stevie Nicks ("Silent Night"), Loretta Lynn ("Shadrach, the Black Reindeer"), 
and Natalie Cole ("The Christmas Song"). 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: The Nov. 22 "Human Rights Now!" concert at the Firehouse 
Teen-Senior Center in La Jolla raised $500 for Amnesty International's high 
school outreach program. The three-hour benefit concert, which featured San 
Diego bands Bad Radio, Burning Bridges, and Club of Rome, was sponsored by the 
local Musicians Who Care association. . . . By the end of this month, the Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach will have a third parking lot, providing 35 more 
spaces. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Opening for the Cult, Dec. 29, at the San Diego Sports Arena: heavy metal 
upstarts Bonham, led by Jason Bonham, whose late father, John, was Led 
Zeppelin's drummer. . . . Exactly 29 years ago this week, Rosie and the 
Originals became the first San Diego band to crack Billboard's Hot 100 singles 
chart with "Angel Baby". . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: the Primitives, Thursday at the 
Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Mary's Danish and 13th Step, also Thursday, at the 
Belly Up Tavern; Jethro Tull and It Bites, Friday at the Sports Arena; Camper 
Van Beethoven, Saturday at San Diego State University's Montezuma Hall; the 
Call, also Saturday, at the Bacchanal; Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson, Monday at 
the Bacchanal; and Squeeze and Animal Logic, Tuesday at Symphony Hall downtown.

New Comedy Lineup: MTV Networks, which owns cable TV's Nickelodeon and a new 
all-comedy channel scheduled to start April 1, said Tuesday it has bought 
rights to 15 former network shows, including the acclaimed "Mary Tyler Moore 
Show," "The Lucy Show" and "Love, American Style." Thirteen of the shows are 
situation comedies going to MTV's "Ha! The TV Comedy Network" channel. Eight of 
the comedies and one comedy miniseries, the six-part "Fresno," were made by 
Moore's production company, MTM, which also made the CBS' drama series, "The 
White Shadow." That series will air on Nickelodeon. But Moore's old series and 
repeats of MTM's "The Bob Newhart Show" won't air on 'Ha!" until 1992 because 
those shows still are in syndication to television stations, an MTV spokesman 
said. SHAUNA SNOW

Walesa's Life to Go on Film: Warner Bros. and Mount Co. will go to Poland to 
document the life of Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on the big screen. 
"In these times of extraordinary social and political change in Eastern Europe, 
we all recognize that it began with Lech Walesa and Solidarity in Poland," said 
Mark Canton, Warner Bros. executive vice president, in announcing plans for the 
film. No one has yet been asked to play Walesa, studio publicity agent Michael 
Singer said. But Hollywood experts have said they believed Michael Douglas and 
Robert Wagner would be in the running for the starring role in the film, which 
will go into production next year. The world charity premiere of the motion 
picture, which is scheduled to begin production in 1990, will benefit 
Solidarity's Social Fund. SHAUNA SNOW

GILLESPIE CURTAILS ZIP CODE PRICING ON CAR INSURANCE; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 103: THE COMMISSIONER SAYS COSTS WILL BE LOWERED FOR URBAN DRIVERS, 
PARTICULARLY IN LOS ANGELES. YOUNG MEN AND SINGLE PERSONS COULD ALSO BENEFIT.

Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie on Tuesday struck down the use of sex 
and marital status in setting auto insurance rates in California, curtailed 
insurers' use of neighborhood-based pricing and said she will impose a cap 
pegged to the consumer price index on annual premium rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing wide-ranging emergency regulations after a month of hearings, 
Gillespie said she believes the effect will be some decrease in auto insurance 
rates for many urban residents, particularly in Los Angeles, and a limited 
increase for rural and suburban residents. Young men and single persons could 
also benefit from lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said she could give no exact figures. It will be up to each insurance 
company to submit a new rate structure within 90 days for her approval. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's announcements were the latest of many steps to implement 
Proposition 103, the landmark insurance initiative passed narrowly by voters 
last year and fought strenuously by the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be resolved is the key question of whether companies will be forced to 
give the 20% rate rollbacks mandated by the initiative. At her news conference 
here, Gillespie again expressed doubt that the 20% reductions will ever prove 
feasible for most companies. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said Tuesday that she intends that the regulations will become 
permanent in March. She predicted that her actions will be challenged in court 
by the insurers, and said she will go into court herself on Dec. 18 for a legal 
decision upholding what she has done. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reaction from insurers Tuesday was cautiously negative. A spokesman for 
one trade association, the Alliance of American Insurers, said he felt that 
some companies will sue to prevent the regulations from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers seemed particularly concerned by the limit on annual rate 
increases for all drivers except those with poor safety records. The cap would 
limit increases to the rate of inflation as reflected in the previous year's 
consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
The cap could hold allowable price increases in 1990 to under 5%, after the 
six-month freeze Gillespie imposed Oct. 2 on all auto rate increases is lifted. 
So far in 1989, consumer prices nationwide have risen at an annual rate of 
4.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the state's two largest auto insurance sellers, State Farm 
and Farmers, said it was too early to say exactly what response their companies 
will have to the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction Tuesday from consumer groups was more positive, although some said 
that Gillespie had not gone far enough to mandate an equalization of rates 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Like most court and administrative decisions in the long struggle to implement 
Proposition 103, Gillespie's actions Tuesday were complex and subject to 
qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
Many Factors Involved 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said, for instance, that she was "outlawing the use of simple 
territory or ZIP code" pricing -- in other words, neighborhood pricing. But she 
quickly added that under her new regulations companies could use as many as 
nine different factors -- such as a locality's population density, vehicle 
traffic density, accident frequency or litigation rates -- to substitute for 
ZIP code pricing. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said insurers would have to give the most weight to a driver's safety 
record, followed by miles driven and years of driving experience, as 
Proposition 103 mandates. But the other factors, when added up, could still 
have a great impact on a policyholder's rate. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the new system of pricing would still result in a considerably 
higher rate for an urban driver than for a rural or suburban one, as is 
currently the case, although the differences probably would narrow somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Gillespie was quick to add that insurers might find substitute 
factors in setting rates to compensate for the elimination of sex and marital 
status in pricing auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that because men often drive more miles annually than women, 
insurance companies' new rating plans might continue to charge men more than 
most women. In addition to Proposition 103, Gillespie cited the Unruh Civil 
Rights Act against discrimination as a basis for her decision to outlaw sex and 
marital factors. 
</P>
<P>
Even the rate increase ceiling announced by Gillespie is subject to 
qualification in the regulations. If an insurer can demonstrate to the 
commissioner that its new rates would be confiscatory, falling below what would 
constitute a fair rate of return, then the company could charge a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
Reid McClaran, an attorney for Gillespie, said Tuesday that this does not 
provide a very big escape hatch. He characterized it more as a necessary legal 
defense mechanism for the emergency regulations. James Wheaton, an attorney for 
the Voter Revolt organization, the sponsors of Proposition 103, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the tortuous history of Proposition 103 has demonstrated that when a 
loophole is opened, many companies rush to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said she will go before Superior Court Judge Miriam A. Vogel in Los 
Angeles on Dec. 18 to seek a ruling upholding the pricing system the 
commissioner laid down in the emergency regulations issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
She said she will tell the judge that the state Supreme Court protected the 
insurers with the fair rate of return standard when it upheld Proposition 103 
with some changes last May 3, and that now is the time to protect consumers 
with a rate ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel, however, has frequently questioned such broad-based rate limits. 
Wheaton, the Voter Revolt attorney, said Tuesday that he is trying to get a 
Sacramento court to remove all Proposition 103 implementation matters from 
Vogel's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
In another part of her regulations Tuesday, Gillespie also ordered all insurers 
to take steps -- through advertising, placement of agents and setting up of 
toll-free 800 numbers -- to implement the provision of Proposition 103 that 
requires them to accept any "good driver" who desires a policy. A good driver 
is defined as one with no more than a single minor traffic violation in a 
three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
This action was meant to counteract the frequently used policy of companies to 
try to sell only in low accident-risk areas. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, a Republican, who announced Monday that she will not run for state 
commissioner next year when the post becomes elective, again charged that 
Proposition 103 was a poorly drafted measure and said its rate rollback 
provision was "defective and promised more than the proponents could deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, she has set a series of rollback hearings to determine which, if 
any, companies will be ordered to rebate part of the premiums collected this 
year. Such orders, if made, would be subject to legal appeal, as is virtually 
everything Gillespie does. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 supporters, led by the measure's author, Harvey Rosenfield, and 
his chosen candidate for insurance commissioner, Conway Collis, said Tuesday 
that Gillespie has taken a step forward with her regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers 'Suspicious'

But as Collis, a Democratic member of the State Board of Equalization, put it, 
"consumers will remain suspicious until they see how it works out." Both 
Rosenfield and Collis expressed gratification that the commissioner had used 
some of their ideas disclosed in a proposed regulation last week. 
</P>
<P>
Television commentator Bill Press, another Democratic candidate, said he found 
"less than meets the eye" in Gillespie's regulations. "I think it's half a loaf 
at best," he said. "What she is doing is replacing one form of redlining 
discrimination with another." He said he agreed with yet another Democratic 
candidate, former Common Cause director Walter Zelman, that Gillespie ought to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gnaizda, a lawyer representing a coalition of minority and low income 
groups, said he felt that Gillespie had made a start but had not resolved the 
issue of the affordability of insurance in urban areas.

LIFE STYLE OF MORMONS CUTS RISK OF DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study of nearly 10,000 active Mormons in California credits clean living -- 
no tobacco, regular exercise and a good night's sleep -- with some of the 
largest reductions in risk of death from cancer and cardiovascular disease ever 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The study, by an epidemiologist at the UCLA School of Public Health, found that 
middle-aged high priests adhering to those habits had only 34% the normal 
cancer death rate for their age group and only 14% the normal death rate from 
heart and blood vessel disease. Mormon high priests are certain long-term, 
devout Mormons who have risen to the highest rank of the church's lay 
priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
Their wives, too, enjoyed comparable health advantages. Their rate of death 
from cancer was little more than half that of white women in general, and their 
rate of death from cardiovascular disease was one-third of the normal rate. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want to minimize their mortality rate and maximize their longevity, 
this is certainly one way of doing it," James E. Enstrom, the researcher, said 
in an interview. "I'm not a Mormon, and I don't recommend that people have to 
become Mormons to do this." His findings were published today in the Journal of 
the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Religiously active Mormons abstain from tobacco, alcohol and caffeine under 
guidelines written down in their Doctrine and Covenants. Mormon doctrine also 
emphasizes family life, education, a well-balanced diet and good health 
practices in general. 
</P>
<P>
The priests studied by Enstrom may also have benefited from their participation 
in so-called social networks, such as their marriages and the church. Past 
research has linked social networks to longevity, quite apart from other health 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a social support factor at work there," George K. Jarvis, a 
University of Alberta, Canada, sociologist, said in a telephone interview. " . 
. . There is ample research that if we participate in groups that are 
meaningful to us, we benefit in health." 
</P>
<P>
To see whether his rather dramatic findings could be reproduced in the general 
population, Enstrom also analyzed a comparable group of white, nonsmoking, 
church-going men and women in Alameda County from all religions. He found 
similar health gains. 
</P>
<P>
"These results demonstrate substantial progress in prevention of cancer and 
other diseases in one well-defined population, and they suggest a life style 
that could result in a major reduction in cancer mortality, as well as 
mortality in general," Enstrom wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis, who has published a detailed review of much of the controversial past 
research on the effects of religion on rates of illness and death, described 
Enstrom's findings as remarkable for the magnitude of the health benefit he 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great when anybody finds anything that could lead to extension of 
an active and happy life," Jarvis said. "If there are some aspects of life 
among Mormons, or any other group, that people might want to adopt, everybody 
is happy to find this out." 
</P>
<P>
Enstrom, a researcher in the UCLA School of Public Health who began studying 
Mormons in the early 1970s, based his findings on responses to detailed 
questionnaires about life style, diet and medical history mailed out in late 
1979 to Mormon high priests and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
Enstrom received responses from 5,231 priests and 4,613 wives between the ages 
of 25 and 99. He then matched those responses to records kept by the church of 
all Mormon high priests in California who died between 1980 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were most dramatic among priests and wives under 65. 
</P>
<P>
In that group, those who did not smoke, exercised regularly and got seven to 
eight hours of sleep each night had approximately 34% the expected rate of 
death from cancer. Their rate of death from cardiovascular disease was about 
14% of what is expected, and their overall death rate about 22%. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Enstrom cited a hypothetical, 25-year-old high priest with those 
health habits. He would have a life expectancy of 85 and only a 5% chance of 
dying before 65. The average 25-year-old white man in the United States has a 
life expectancy of 74. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a 25-year-old wife of a high priest who also adhered to those habits 
would have a life expectancy of 86 and only a 7% chance of dying by 65. The 
average 25-year-old white woman has a life expectancy of 80. 
</P>
<P>
The women with good health habits had only about 55% the rate of cancer 
mortality and 34% the rate of cardiovascular disease mortality expected among 
middle-aged white females, Enstrom found. Their overall mortality rate was 
about 47% that of the expected rate.

ELEGANT HOMES HIDE PLUNDER IN EAST GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
WANDLITZ, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Massive iron gates seal off the luxurious quarters here where senior officials 
of the East German government and Communist Party have made their homes for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the gates and a concrete wall, amid stands of birch, pine and spruce, 
are the elegant homes of the now-discredited leaders, including deposed 
President Erich Honecker, who on Tuesday was placed under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, the old leaders are being angrily condemned for living 
in a grand manner while much of the populace scraped by. And they are accused 
of much worse: of plundering public accounts and socking away their illicit 
fortunes in foreign banks, of engaging in profitable but illegal export 
schemes, of building lavish retreats with public money. 
</P>
<P>
Since the party's grip on East Germany began to unravel in October, previously 
unimagined luxury has been disclosed. New reports of scandalous activity 
surface almost daily, and they have had a powerful impact on ordinary East 
Germans. For, under state socialism, everyone was supposed to have lived more 
or less on the same scale. 
</P>
<P>
It is the flagrant style of living that has enraged East Germans. Some 
examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Officials living in the Wandlitz compound, just north of Berlin, were 
provided with large houses equipped with cable television and access to stores 
filled with Western goods priced at about a seventh of what they would cost on 
the open market. Among these officials are Honecker and former economics chief 
Guenter Mittag. Until recently, Honecker's successor, Egon Krenz, lived there, 
as did Guenter Schabowski, a senior member of the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sumptuous hunting lodges were maintained at state expense near 
Neubrandenburg for Honecker and Mittag. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former Prime Minister Willi Stoph had weekend retreats at Mecklenburg and 
-- more upsetting to many -- in the forest preserve at Schorfheide, where 
hundreds of square miles were set aside for the hunting of deer, boar and 
birds. Millions of marks were said to have been allocated for the upkeep of 
these retreats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elaborate houses reportedly were built with state funds at Oranienburg for 
relatives of Politburo members, including Mittag's daughters. Building 
materials included Canadian hardwoods, and luxury features included inlaid 
baths. 
</P>
<P>
In the forest, an area was set aside for the private use of Harry Tisch, the 
former state labor boss, with a "hunting castle" and a staff of 35 rangers. 
</P>
<P>
On Vilm, an island in the Baltic Sea, the party maintained 11 residences with 
marble baths, convection heating, saunas and tennis courts. The island was 
declared a military zone in order to ensure privacy, while not far away, the 
fishing harbor of Lauterbach was decaying due to neglect. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, former head of the department that 
regulates foreign currency holdings, had various state-owned residences 
including a showy home in Leipzig that was used only during the semiannual 
trade fair. And Guenther Kleiber, a former first deputy prime minister, has 
been accused of building a "supply facility" for a government ministry that 
turned out to be a house with a sauna for his son. 
</P>
<P>
One report in Berlin said residents of the Wandlitz compound have been selling 
their stocks of luxury goods for hard currency, presumably to build a nest egg 
against the possibility of having to flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports that have just come to light, Honecker and Mittag were on 
the payroll of a building society, as honorary members, and each received 
20,000 marks a year -- almost $10,000 at the official exchange rate. Honecker 
was ousted from his top post Oct. 18 and also has been expelled from the 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The East German news agency ADN said that all former members of the Politburo 
"who after Oct. 19 were no longer members of the Politburo and who are still in 
Wandlitz" were under house arrest. Deputy chief prosecutor Harri Haarland 
called the house arrests an act of "national self-defense" resulting from "the 
will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
The chief prosecutor, Guenter Wendland, and one of his top deputies resigned 
under fire after severe criticism of their failure to investigate widespread 
corruption among current and former Communist officials. 
</P>
<P>
Their resignations were followed by those of the entire leadership of the 
despised security police, known as Stasi, who quit because of their own 
inability to act against corruption, the official ADN news agency said late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Goebel, assistant director of the Art and Antiques Museum in East 
Berlin, told authorities that a firm controlled by Schalck-Golodkowski has been 
forcing the museum to give up art objects for export in exchange for hard 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
Goebel said the company gave the museum works that could not be exported 
because they are part of the national heritage in exchange for similar objects 
that had not yet been so designated by official art historians. 
</P>
<P>
He said agents representing the Schalck-Golodkowski firm put pressure on 
private citizens to sell artworks at far below the market price. The owners, he 
said, were told that they had not paid a required tax on their possessions and 
would either have to surrender them or go to prison for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Schalck-Golodkowski was also said to have been involved with IMES, an arms 
firm, which had a depot near the Baltic port of Rostock filled with weapons and 
ammunition for export. People of the area were not notified that dangerous 
materials were stored virtually on their doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
Schalck-Golodkowski has left the country within the past few days. Some believe 
he was helped by other officials in order to prevent him from implicating them 
in his operations. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, was detained on suspicion of "criminal extortion." 
Vogel, a confidant of Honecker, has been involved in a number of spectacular 
East-West prisoner swaps. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigating officials, Schalck-Golodkowski appears to have had a 
hand in foreign trading operations worth billions of marks, most of which has 
not been properly accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Even sports has not been spared. The Berlin soccer team Dynamo has been accused 
of winning its many championships in the East German league by means of fixed 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamo's president, Erich Mielke, was until recently a member of the Politburo 
in charge of state security. His team won the national championship in 10 of 
the last 12 years but failed regularly to do well against foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Spitner, head of the East German Soccer Assn., has pointed out that 
Dynamo's domestic victories often came in overtime, after questionable 
penalties had been assessed against the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
A recent search of the sports association offices turned up 291,000 marks 
(almost $150,000) in currency in various desks. There was no accounting for the 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Corruption also reached into the rural areas. In the village of Rottleberode, 
in the Harz Mountains, former Mayor Edeltraut Tielo was brought before an ad 
hoc court, stripped of her title and charged with personal enrichment at public 
expense. She is now taunted and threatened in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Such situations are said to be commonplace in much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction has been fierce. The daily Berliner Zeitung, which formerly 
supported the regime, said in an editorial: "We -- and that means all honest 
Communist Party members and the entire people -- say, 'This swamp must finally 
be drained, no matter how much mud has to be dredged out.' " 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper of the National Democratic Party commented that "millions of 
people in this country feel that they have been seduced and victimized in a way 
that reminds them of 1945 (the year World War II ended)." 
</P>
<P>
A journalist said privately: "These reports of corruption have moved us to the 
edge of the abyss." 
</P>
<P>
The average East German is also shocked. A university graduate student 
complained: "The question of corruption means the dissolution of the Communist 
Party. It's the blue-collar workers and people like nurses who are very, very 
upset about stories of corruption. We are seeing reality as it is." 
</P>
<P>
A worker at a building site in East Berlin said: "It's disgusting the way (the 
party leaders) live -- and meanwhile they were preaching to us to work harder 
for socialism." 
</P>
<P>
A low-level government official: "I have to wait up to 15 years for a car or an 
apartment, and now I see what they had. Nobody is going to vote for a party 
with people like that in it." 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Goebel's wife told a reporter: "My husband has been in the 
party for nearly 30 years, and I for 20 years. Things are coming out that 
nobody dreamed of. We are very disillusioned people." 
</P>
<P>
In the town of Wandlitz, adjacent to the elite housing compound, Mayor Reinhard 
Haennerling takes pains to let visitors know that the town "has nothing to do 
with the 'settlement.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone," he told a visitor, "is angry about the way they lived here. I 
condemn it." 
</P>
<P>
Haennerling, who displayed a party pin in his lapel, slapped his desk and 
declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting calls every day from around the country telling me to do something 
about the situation. But this Communist bosses' settlement is not even in my 
city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"These settlement people never even came to our town -- just drove through. 
This is a very bad thing for the party. Many people here are leaving it. I 
still wear my party pin, but many other members no longer do. This corruption 
has left me personally very disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the party have to come absolutely clean. Everything must now be made 
public. The citizens don't believe in us any more. In an election now, we 
wouldn't win."

AMERICAN PACIFIST PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN SALVADOR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jennifer Jean Casolo, the first American ever formally accused of aiding the 
leftist Salvadoran guerrillas, pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges of terrorism 
and possession of war weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after 10 days in a cold jail cell, the tiny, 
irrepressible pacifist said she is determined to test a justice system in which 
she has little faith. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to put our innocence before the courts," she shouted from the back 
seat of a police pickup truck that had driven her to a military court 
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I have faith in any system to find me innocent, but I believe my 
innocence will shine through," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo, a 28-year-old church worker from Thomaston, Conn., was arrested with 
two Salvadorans staying at her home when it was raided by the National Police 
the night of Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The police said they dug up more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades and 
explosives from her back patio during the raid, which came amid an urban 
guerrilla offensive by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they found arms in my house," Casolo said. "We don't know where they 
came from. They showed me the arms, but I don't know if they really found them 
in my house." 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Romero Hernandez, a slight, elderly judge in a rumpled brown suit, 
read the charges during a four-hour, 50-minute closed hearing in his small, 
concrete-block office in San Salvador's tribunal complex. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo sat facing him across a desk. Her Salvadoran lawyer, Salvador Ibarra, 
stood behind her. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy consular officer and three American church officials who 
traveled here last week to visit her waited in the judge's outer chambers. 
</P>
<P>
During a long interrogation, she gave her own recollection of the night of her 
arrest but declined to answer many of the judge's questions on the grounds that 
she had not been allowed to consult her attorney in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The judge has 72 hours to decide whether the charges merit a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo had worked here for five years for Christian Education Seminars, a 
Texas-based ecumenical religious group that organized visits for U.S. Congress 
members, church workers and other prominent Americans to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Because her tours offered interviews across the political spectrum, fellow 
religious workers said they suspected that Casolo was framed in an effort to 
discredit all church people and foreigners critical of the U.S.-backed 
right-wing government. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo arrived at the courtroom without handcuffs, seated between two female 
prisoners in the police truck. One was Guadalupe Lopez, a Roman Catholic church 
activist arrested with her. 
</P>
<P>
In front of them was a larger army truck with a score of manacled male 
prisoners, including Jose Federico Vasquez, the other person seized in her 
house. 
</P>
<P>
A hefty policewoman with a G-3 rifle and her face covered with a black bandanna 
led Casolo, who is barely 5 feet tall, by the elbow into the judge's chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo had been held until the hearing in a cell at National Police 
headquarters, with as many as five other women. Afterward she was transferred 
to Ilopango Women's Prison, a place she had taken visiting delegations and 
interviewed prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'll be on the other side," she said, looking serene and clutching a 
Bible as she left court. 
</P>
<P>
To reporters, Casolo described long, difficult interrogations by her captors, 
who forced her to sleep, shivering, on a cardboard slab on the concrete floor, 
and to wear the same clothes five days in a row. She said that she and Lopez 
eventually came to terms with their jailers by "speaking of God" with them at 
every possible moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really tough," she said. "I felt that the police were really trying to 
get at the heart of me. But I discovered a strength around me. I just felt that 
I could share love with those who had me captive. And I think they shared love 
back with me. It was an absolutely life-changing experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't trying to convert them but just sharing the spirit of God," she 
explained. "We said to them, 'Look, God is in you and God is in those who are 
being interrogated.' " 
</P>
<P>
The few people allowed to visit Casolo in jail so far have confirmed her 
evangelical role there. They said she was in good spirits and has shared food 
they brought for her with fellow inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark, Casolo's American legal adviser, was 
present Saturday when she baptized a male prisoner at the prisoner's request. 
The day before, he watched her comforting a woman who appeared to have been 
tortured. 
</P>
<P>
"She is under great strain, but her primary concern is for others," Clark said. 
"I was a bit overwhelmed by the character and quality of her clear insight into 
what she's about and what her task is in Christian ministry." 
</P>
<P>
Casolo's legal situation is far murkier. 
</P>
<P>
Asked after the hearing where her case stood, she said: "I think there are a 
lot of papers involved in this and that my person is the least." 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador has been under a state of siege since a week before her arrest, and 
new, tougher criminal legislation is in the works. The charges against her 
normally carry a penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment, but the judge has said 
the new laws might apply retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
"There is confusion over what law will be applied," Ibarra said after 
consulting a range of legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who arrived here last week at the behest of Casolo's family and church 
organization, cannot legally represent her in court. He hired Ibarra to 
accompany her at Tuesday's hearing and at later stages of the process, if she 
accepts him. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra is a celebrated defense attorney in a legal system dominated by fear of 
the armed forces. As attorney for the Lutheran Church's legal aid office, he 
showed up at National Guard headquarters last month to ask about 12 Lutheran 
missionaries seized in a raid on a church. He was arrested on the spot and held 
nine days without charge. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Ibarra was arrested and tortured after resigning his defense of a 
national guardsman on trial for the 1980 murders of four American churchwomen. 
He said he quit because guard officers were covering up evidence that the 
killers acted on superior orders. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo has shaped her own legal fate by refusing to accept the idea of a quick 
hearing and expulsion from El Salvador. She has also told Clark that she is 
reluctant to accept a Salvadoran lawyer out of fear that the case might 
jeopardize his safety. 
</P>
<P>
"As a lawyer, I would just say to Casolo, 'Let's go home, if we can,' Clark 
said. "But she won't do that. She's very small but she does her own thinking. 
It may sound funny, but she loves the people. She doesn't want to go home. Her 
heart is here." 
</P>
<P>
Paraphrasing the Bible, Casolo explained why she could never cut a deal to go 
free and leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reading this morning about when Paul the apostle was in jail and they 
beat him. . . . He was praying and singing at night, which is what we did every 
night, and so the jailkeeper let him come to his house. The next day the king 
said, 'Let them go, I believe in their god.' And Paul said, 'You beat us and 
you humiliated us and now you want to let us go quietly. No, let us go 
publicly.' " 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy has taken a similar position in favor of a trial. Ambassador 
William Walker is said to be reluctant to intervene to seek her release on the 
ground that it would undermine his efforts to build faith in the judicial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo's defenders are angry that some U.S. officials have prejudged her in 
public and private remarks indicating they believe she is guilty. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, Casolo said she believes she is being treated "better than 
any other prisoner" because "the whole United States government is behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about her prospects for a fair trial, she said: 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think? Talk to all the prisoners. Are any of us going to get a 
fair trial? Where did they get the evidence against us? How did they get the 
evidence against us?"

S &amp; L, PARENT FIRM REPORTEDLY GAVE STATE GOP $95,000

Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and its parent company contributed $95,000 in "soft 
money" to the California Republican Party during the last election, even as the 
Irvine thrift was piling up $2 billion in federally insured losses, according 
to a study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The contributions constituted an act of political bipartisanship by the parent 
firm, American Continental Corp., which previously had contributed $85,000 to 
the California Democratic Party in 1986 at the request of Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
Soft money is a term used to describe contributions to state and local 
political activities, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, 
that are not subject to the contribution limits contained in federal election 
law. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the money was contributed to the state GOP, American Continental 
Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. was battling with state and federal officials 
for permission to continue the risky investment practices that eventually led 
to Lincoln's collapse. The administrations in both Washington and Sacramento 
are Republican. 
</P>
<P>
An Arizona Republican, Keating has stated that he expected his political 
contributions to win him influence with government policy-makers. At least 
three members of Congress have returned Keating's donations since Lincoln was 
seized by the federal government last April. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's contributions to the California GOP were disclosed in a new survey of 
soft-money donations in nine states by the Center for Responsive Politics. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Responsive Politics found that the California GOP took in $5.8 
million and the state Democratic Party received $4.4 million in 1988 -- making 
them the two biggest single recipients of soft money in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that soft money contributions have become a back-door way for 
corporations and unions to continue giving to federal campaigns after their 
political action committees have already donated the maximum amounts permitted 
under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known precisely how much soft money was raised in 1988. But the 
national Republican and Democratic parties estimated that they distributed more 
than $40 million in soft money and the center found evidence of at least $28 
million spent in nine key states in the presidential contest between George 
Bush and Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
While federal election laws prohibit individuals and corporate political action 
committees from making contributions in excess of $2,000, the center found that 
more than 100 corporations and individuals made soft-money donations in nine 
key states. In California, seven people contributed at least $100,000 each, and 
82 gave $20,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Among the big contributors to the California GOP were Marvin Davis of Los 
Angeles, head of an oil, communications and investment firm, who gave $110,000; 
Atlantic Richfield, $139,500, and the William Lyon Co., an Orange County 
builder in Newport Beach, $127,500. 
</P>
<P>
"As this study shows, Keating isn't the only businessman in America wielding 
influence through political contributions," said center director Ellen Miller. 
"This study shows scores of other major givers -- the Keatings of tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, American Continental contributed $90,000 in soft money 
to the state GOP in the 1988 election cycle, all but $10,000 of it in the final 
days before the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln made a separate $5,000 donation in May, 1987, about the time that 
federal regulators in San Francisco were recommending that the high-flying 
thrift be seized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the study, which was based on state records, may underestimate the 
actual amount of soft money that Keating and his affiliated companies 
contributed to California Republican causes in the 1988 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
In recent testimony before a California Assembly committee hearing, Karl 
Samuelian, Gov. George Deukmejian's fund-raiser, testified that Keating gave 
$100,000 to the party's Team 100 fund in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian said the contributions included $75,000 by American Continental to 
the California GOP, $20,000 to a fund known as the Presidential Trust and 
$5,000 made at a so-called Victory '88 fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
State records do not disclose whether these funds came directly from corporate 
revenues or from individual donations made by employees of Keating's companies. 
Although federal law prohibits direct corporate contributions to candidates, 
critics have alleged that Keating paid "bonuses" to his employees from 
corporate funds with the expectation they would pass the money along to 
candidates for federal office. 
</P>
<P>
A similar study of 1986 election cycle giving by the center uncovered the 
$85,000 contribution that Cranston solicited from Keating for the California 
Democratic Party. In addition, the senator persuaded Keating to give about 
$35,000 to his 1986 reelection campaign and $850,000 to voter registration 
groups supported by Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the New York Times reported today that federal law 
enforcement authorities are investigating the voter registration groups to 
determine whether employees were instructed to register more Democrats than 
Republicans. Employees for one of the groups have alleged that such 
instructions were issued, a charge denied by the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported that the FBI is interested in the voter 
registration groups because of the large amounts of money flowing to them from 
major donors, including Keating and his associates. The newspaper quoted 
anonymous officials as saying that California banking regulators sent documents 
to the FBI last July involving three groups. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, it was announced that the Forum Institute, one of the 
Cranston-supported groups that received hundreds of thousands of dollars from 
Keating, will suspend operations Jan. 1. Cruz Reynoso, a former California 
Supreme Court justice and member of the institute's board, said recent 
publicity had made it difficult for the group to raise money.

KOREANS FIND AID ON HOT LINE;

SOCIAL SERVICES: FROM HELP TO HELPERS, A COUPLE ASSISTS IMMIGRANTS IN COPING 
WITH LIFE IN AMERICA.

Sung Lee feared that his wife would leave him for another man when she stepped 
out of his shadow and started taking co-ed classes to become a real estate 
agent, in defiance of the traditional role of Korean women. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing the 47-year-old Korean-American restaurateur did was call his 
accountant in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't financial advice he sought. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's accountant is Mahn Youn Jo. With the aid of his wife, Oak, Jo operates a 
free hot line counseling and information service to help many of the estimated 
50,000 members of the Korean community in the San Fernando Valley adjust to 
life in their adopted homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The couple have answered phone calls day and night since 1985 from more than 
5,000 distraught Korean immigrants, helping them find jobs and solve marital 
and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said his marriage has improved steadily since Jo repeatedly advised him in 
June that "this is not Korea." 
</P>
<P>
"He said to me, 'Your wife has her own personality, her own career, and it 
doesn't mean she is going to have an affair,' " said Lee, a Santa Clarita 
resident who immigrated here in the early 1970s and owns a coffee shop in 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
At Jo's suggestion, Lee began taking his wife out more often, and the 
additional time together has strengthened their 22-year marriage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee even dyed his gray hair brown and wears suits most of the time because Jo 
told him it would increase his self-confidence and sex appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I look so good now, my wife is the jealous one," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jos' hot line service -- listed in a Korean telephone directory as the 
Korean Community Service Center -- fills a gap in the services available to 
Korean immigrants, especially those who do not speak English, community leaders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean Senior Citizens Center in San Fernando is the only other private, 
nonprofit agency in the Valley for Korean-speakers, although pastors at 45 
Korean churches provide counseling for their congregations. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 U.S. Census reported that 60,000 people of Korean origin resided in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles officials and Korean leaders say the census did not take into 
account the many Korean illegal aliens living in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no place for them to turn" in the Valley, said Bong Kim, executive 
director of the Korean Youth Center in Los Angeles, a nonprofit agency that 
serves Koreans throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
The hot line service appeals to Koreans not only because advice and referrals 
are offered in their native tongue but because callers may remain anonymous if 
they wish, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
Most Koreans have been taught to "keep problems to yourself and save face," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But John Song, a Korean-speaking social worker for the county Department of 
Public Social Services, warned that taking advice from untrained people can be 
risky. He said he was not familiar with the Jos' background or telephone hot 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Mahn Youn Jo, 50, and Oak Jo, 48, are members of Gloria Baptist Church in 
Montrose, where Oak Jo has taken classes in parenting and other subjects and 
her husband has completed a three-year seminary program. 
</P>
<P>
The church's pastor, the Rev. Seong Soo Kim, praised their commitment to 
community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
The Jos do not impose their religious beliefs on callers, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple said their personal experiences as parents, longtime marriage 
partners and immigrants -- not their religious beliefs -- have contributed the 
most to preparing them to give advice to others. 
</P>
<P>
"In Korea, grandparents and relatives always watch you to make sure you're OK," 
said Oak Jo, who is a lab technician at the Veterans Administration Hospital in 
Sepulveda. "Here, people do not have as many relatives to take care of them, so 
we help them enjoy the benefits of living in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The Jos immigrated here in 1976 from Seoul, where Mahn Youn Jo was a business 
analyst for the Korean Development Bank. 
</P>
<P>
They first settled near his sister in St. Louis and opened a gift shop, and 
later moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The hot line began in 1985 as a service offered by the newly formed Valley 
Korean Chamber of Commerce, said Sung H. Kim, the organization's former 
treasurer and owner of an insurance company in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
"The top priority of the founders was to help Korean citizens in the Valley, 
not to promote business," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
But the chamber was dissolved about a year later because owners of small 
businesses in the Valley did not want to pay annual dues of about $100, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe we need services like the hot line," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
Jo, a short man with a cherubic face, said he has continued to operate the 
service from phone lines in his home and office largely because of his late 
mother's influence. 
</P>
<P>
A gentle woman who virtually converted the family home into a soup kitchen, she 
was widowed when Communists fighting for control of Korea killed her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Reared by his mother and grandmother, Jo said he was torn between wanting to 
help people and becoming a successful businessman. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview in his office in Van Nuys, it appeared that he had 
managed to realize both dreams.

CRANSTON ALTERS DEFENSE IN LINCOLN SAVINGS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: AFTER HIS STATEMENTS WERE PUBLICLY CHALLENGED BY A FEDERAL OFFICIAL AT 
A HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As the story behind the $2-billion collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan has 
continued to unfold, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) has altered a key element of 
his original defense against charges that he intervened improperly on behalf of 
the Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, when Cranston was asked to explain why he intervened with 
federal regulators in 1987 on behalf of the savings and loan, he said that he 
had asked the government to take "prompt corrective action" against Lincoln 
owner Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'Do something or leave him alone. If there's anything criminal, indict 
him,' " Cranston declared at a press conference last May. 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston no longer makes that assertion when he speaks in defense of his 
actions in the Keating affair. Instead, he now contends that he simply asked 
Edwin J. Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, why the 
investigation of Lincoln was taking so long. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's story changed after Gray, in testimony before the the House Banking, 
Finance and Urban Affairs Committee earlier this month, publicly challenged the 
senator's original explanation. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that Cranston has waivered in his recollection of 
matters involving Keating. Nor is it the first time that Cranston and Gray have 
clashed over what happened in April, 1987, when Cranston and four other 
senators met with the bank board chief to discuss Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Cranston and Gray -- California political adversaries since 1966, when 
Cranston criticized Gray's boss, then-GOP gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan 
-- appear to be engaged in an escalating war of words involving every aspect of 
the Lincoln scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in an interview about Gray's charge that his original statements were 
"untruthful," Cranston replied that he never intended for anyone to think that 
he had advocated Keating's indictment in the April 2 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say I said that in that meeting," the senator said in an interview. 
"I said it upon other occasions." 
</P>
<P>
But neither Cranston nor his aides could identify exactly when the senator 
advocated the possible indictment of Keating. 
</P>
<P>
"You are not going to get a very satisfactory answer on that," said Cranston's 
press secretary, Murray Flander. "He recalls that he said it at some time, but 
he doesn't remember when." 
</P>
<P>
The involvement of Cranston and the four other senators has been cited as a 
possible factor in a decision by bank board officials to reject a 
recommendation to seize Lincoln in 1987. When the government finally assumed 
control of Lincoln last April, the ultimate cost to taxpayers had grown to an 
estimated $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Gray and other critics contend that the senators' action in the Lincoln case 
was improper because the five previously had solicited campaign contributions 
and other donations totaling $1.3 million from Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gray has said that when he met with the senators on April 2, 1987, 
they were asking for special treatment for Lincoln, which at the time was under 
investigation by the bank board. 
</P>
<P>
The other four senators are Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), 
John H. Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
In response, Cranston has said that his actions on behalf of Lincoln were no 
different than the inquiries that he regularly makes at many federal agencies 
regarding complaints from his constituents. During 20 years in the Senate, 
Cranston said, he has intervened with the bureaucracy on behalf of thousands of 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has also insisted that his actions had no impact on the bank board's 
investigation of Lincoln. He has noted that both Gray and his successor, M. 
Danny Wall, have testified that they were not swayed by the contacts that they 
received from the senators. 
</P>
<P>
Gray has been quick to assert that there are discrepancies in Cranston's 
explanations. After Gray began telling his side of the story last May, 
according to the former bank board chairman, "the knee-jerk reaction by the 
senators was simply to deny what I have said." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston is by no means the only senator whose account of his role in the 
controversial case has changed over time. Riegle, who originally cast himself 
as a bit player in the drama, since has acknowledged that Gray met with the 
senators in April, 1987, at his suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning last May, Cranston frequently said that his primary concern in 1987 
was that the bank board investigation of Lincoln was taking too long. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that he had sought special treatment for Keating. He repeatedly 
emphasized that he had told Gray and other bank board officials that he did not 
care whether Keating was indicted for criminal activity but only wanted the 
inquiry to be concluded before it hurt the reputation of the Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
As Cranston put it last August: "There was nothing improper in any of my 
contacts with Charles Keating, nor was there anything improper in my joining 
with other senators to ask the FHLBB to take prompt corrective action, 
including seeking criminal action against Keating, if grounds existed." 
</P>
<P>
But in Gray's testimony before the House committee Nov. 14, the former 
regulator denounced as "untruthful" that statement and similar ones by the 
California senator. 
</P>
<P>
"Cranston did not ask that we take 'prompt, corrective action' nor did he ask 
that we take 'criminal action against Keating' under any circumstances," Gray 
told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Gray also said in an interview that Cranston made no such statement during a 
subsequent meeting on April 9, 1987, between the five senators and top federal 
regulators from San Francisco, who were responsible for the Lincoln inquiry. A 
transcript of the second meeting shows that Cranston, who attended the meeting 
only briefly, said: "I just want to say I share the concerns of the other 
senators on this subject." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Gray emphasized that these were the only two meetings that 
Cranston has acknowledged having with federal regulators on the Lincoln matter 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Gray disputed Cranston's earlier statement, the senator no longer 
has stated that he urged the indictment of Keating when he is asked about it in 
public forums. Instead, he has quoted Gray as saying that he talked very little 
in the April 2 meeting and "only asked some questions about the duration of the 
examination." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Cranston also denied Gray's charge that DeConcini had tried to 
negotiate with the bank board on Keating's behalf during the first meeting on 
April 2. Gray has stated that DeConcini pledged Lincoln would make more home 
mortgage loans if the bank board withdrew a regulation restricting other 
investments. DeConcini has denied it. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until Cranston recently read the transcript of the April 9 meeting 
-- in which DeConcini raised the same subject -- that he began to doubt his 
original recollection of the first meeting. The California senator said that 
"there may well have been some discussion of the regulation" by DeConcini on 
April 2.

SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFER TO BUY CORY'S HOME NEAR AIRPORT HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Ken Cory, the former state controller and assemblyman from Southern California 
who spent 22 often-controversial years in the Capitol, is at the center of a 
new flap over Sacramento County's tentative decision to buy his riverfront 
home, which sits two miles from the end of a Metropolitan Airport runway. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $717,250 purchase has touched off a storm of populist protest, 
much of it fueled by a radio talk show host who says the deal would bail out 
Cory and his wife from their own bad judgment. 
</P>
<P>
If the county buys Cory's house, the airport director warns, the purchase will 
set a precedent that might require local taxpayers to pay $50 million to buy as 
many as 93 other homes that also are within the airport noise zone. 
</P>
<P>
But Cory, who retired as controller in 1986 and is now an investment banker, 
insisted that he is only trying to get the fair deal that Sacramento County 
promised homeowners near the airport in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need this grief," Cory told the Board of Supervisors. "But there is a 
point at which I cannot afford to take it and lump it any longer. Our home is 
uninhabitable at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Cory's wife, Carole, said the deal would be the only "morally right" way for 
the county to handle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"My family exists with vibrations creating cracks, falling plaster, falling 
tree limbs and window cracks," she told the board. "We live with an oily 
residue on our pool surface, the smell of fuel, the heat of exhaust and decibel 
levels that are dangerous to the eardrum. Our dogs howl and run into the 
bushes, and we shake our fists and sometimes cry." 
</P>
<P>
The roar of jets reaches 65 to 70 decibels as they take off over the Corys' 
home, a sprawling ranch-style house on the bank of the Sacramento River. About 
73 flights leave daily, and roughly 40% of those use the runway near Cory's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
On some days, the planes also go over the Corys' home for landing approaches, 
flying so low that a neighbor said she cannot read the names on the sides of 
the planes because she can only see the jets' bellies. 
</P>
<P>
The runway opened in 1987 but has been in the airport master plan since 1976, 
according to Rob Leonard, deputy director of airports for the county. Carole 
Cory bought the 4,500-square-foot house in 1979 and converted it to joint 
ownership with Cory when the couple married in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Assessed at $325,000 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price is not known publicly, but the property was assessed at 
$325,000 just after Carole Cory bought the house, indicating that probably was 
what she paid. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed buyout has riled Bernie Ward, who hosts a daily talk show on radio 
station KFBK in Sacramento. During his show last Friday, Ward called county 
Supervisor Jim Streng and spent the next two hours fielding calls from 
listeners irate at the proposed purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"People are outraged," Ward said. "The Corys bought this house after the 
general plan for the airport had already been finished. They knew what they 
were getting into, and they bought the house anyway. Why should we bail them 
out now?" 
</P>
<P>
Ward and his callers also criticized the county for offering the Corys $717,250 
for the home, which was appraised at $685,000. Cory acknowledged having the 
house on the market for two years for $595,000 without getting a serious offer. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said the issue has generated more heat than any other recent controversy, 
even the much-discussed plan by city and county officials to offer Los Angeles 
Raiders owner Al Davis $50 million in taxpayer funds to move his team here. 
</P>
<P>
Streng, who voted tentatively in favor of the Cory purchase, said in an 
interview that he is not sure how he will vote Dec. 19 when the matter comes up 
for final review. Streng said his office received 68 negative calls the first 
day after Ward's talk show and not a single call supporting the purchase. He 
said the involvement of Cory has made the public more cynical about the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some logic in saying we should not be buying houses from people who 
bought knowing there was an airport there that was going to expand," he said. 
"It is not a lot different from people who buy next to a freeway or a busy 
roadway that gets widened."

Streng said he got calls from people who live next to an Air Force base, a 
suspected crack house and a recently widened Sacramento expressway. "They all 
said, 'Why don't you buy my house?' " Streng said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cory and a neighbor -- real estate broker Kathy Zikes, who has owned her 
home since 1972 and has sold a lot of property in the area -- contend that 
county officials promised in 1976 to buy the homes if they could not be sold on 
the open market. 
</P>
<P>
And County Executive Brian Richter pointed out that the county has already 
snapped up thousands of acres near the airport to avoid noise conflicts, 
including vacant lots surrounding the Cory home. All the land between Cory's 
house and the airport is county-owned farmland. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were not in a negotiating mood and said forget it, they would go to 
court and say this house, with this riverfront, anywhere else in Sacramento 
would sell for $700,000," Richter said. "He can't sell it for $500,000. The 
conclusion is that the noise has depressed the house's value."

BUSH AIDES DENY U.S. SPLIT OVER SOVIETS; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN POLICY: VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE CREATES A STIR BY CALLING MOSCOW'S 
GOVERNMENT 'TOTALITARIAN.'

<P>
One day after an upbeat President Bush called for "new thinking" in the West's 
approach to the Soviet Union, his senior aides insisted Tuesday that Vice 
President Dan Quayle's skeptical remarks about Soviet foreign policy do not 
reflect a split within the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Washington Post, Quayle said Monday that the Soviet 
Union still has a "totalitarian government" seeking to "create instability in 
areas like Central America." In another interview Tuesday, he tempered those 
remarks by saying that he should have called the Soviet Union authoritarian 
rather than totalitarian. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the vice president's initial, sharply critical comments, Brent 
Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said that Quayle's remarks 
reflected a difference in tone from the President's conclusions, rather than a 
difference in substance. 
</P>
<P>
"The vice president had his own perspective on the situation," Scowcroft told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
However, it appeared that Quayle's comments represented a distinctly 
harder-line view inside the Administration and that the White House was 
carefully using them to blunt potential attacks from Republican right wingers 
on its Soviet policy moves. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, however, maintained in the subsequent interview -- with editors and 
reporters of Knight-Ridder newspapers -- that he and Bush are not following a 
"good-guy, bad-guy strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, meanwhile, reported to the Cabinet on Tuesday afternoon on the summit 
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He was given a standing ovation 
when he entered the Cabinet Room. 
</P>
<P>
But, among those with a reputation for taking a hard line on U.S.-Soviet ties, 
former arms control negotiator Paul H. Nitze decried what was described as the 
"euphoria" stemming from the summit and the relaxation of Soviet domination in 
the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to be looking at this from a standpoint of realism," he told 
reporters at a breakfast interview. Nitze directed his criticism at Bush's 
summit effort to speed up three sets of negotiations intended to trim the 
superpowers' arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons, conventional armaments and 
chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the President showed a lack of understanding of how these negotiations 
are going by setting these deadlines," Nitze said. "Maybe he intends to put the 
pressure of meeting these deadlines on Mr. Gorbachev, and he doesn't consider 
himself bound by that. But . . . I think the pressure will be on (Bush) to make 
agreements fast in order to (meet) these deadlines. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. officials reviewed the gains of the summit, they acknowledged that in 
certain areas -- most notably Afghanistan -- it produced no sign of progress. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft said that the two sides remain apart on the resolution of the Afghan 
war, nearly a year after Moscow began withdrawing its forces. He said that the 
differences focused on the future role of Afghanistan's Soviet-backed leader, 
President Najibullah, while negotiations to end the fighting take place between 
the government and the U.S.-backed guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that Bush was not uncomfortable with the vice 
president's remarks, although they would seem to take some of the luster off 
the President's achievements at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's "No. 1 priority is to be a loyal and effective vice president to this 
President, and he is extremely comfortable with what he said," said David 
Beckwith, Quayle's press secretary, suggesting that the vice president's 
comments reflected a carefully thought-out view backed by Bush.

SOVIETS REJECT PLAN FOR GERMAN REUNIFICATION

<P>
The Soviet Union on Tuesday rejected West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plan 
for German reunification, sharply criticizing it as an attempt to dictate to 
East Germany and warning that efforts to press the issue could destabilize all 
of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, backed by President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev and other top Kremlin leaders, made clear that Moscow strongly 
objects to Kohl's 10-point plan for gradual, step-by-step unity as trying to 
determine the outcome of the political, economic and social reforms now under 
way in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the visiting West German foreign minister, 
the Soviet leadership issued its strongest and most formal warning yet to the 
West not to intervene, even indirectly, in the tumultuous changes taking place 
throughout much of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Noting both Moscow's commitment to political self-determination and its 
strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Shevardnadze bluntly told Genscher that 
Bonn's reunification proposals, however phrased and oriented toward the distant 
future, already constituted interference in East Germany's internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet side considers it unacceptable to dictate to the sovereign state of 
the German Democratic Republic on how it should develop its relations with the 
other German state," Shevardnadze told Genscher, according to an account of 
their conversation from the official Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of the German Democratic Republic has taken the road of broad 
reforms, profound renewal and democratization of the country's public and 
political life," the Soviet foreign minister continued. "A huge amount of 
constructive work lies ahead, and it will require time. 
</P>
<P>
"In this period, every side should preserve restraint and wisdom and should 
avoid interfering in the internal affairs of the German Democratic Republic, 
either by words or actions." 
</P>
<P>
Any attempt by the West to accelerate the changes, Shevardnadze warned, would 
have "unpredictable consequences," endangering the reforms under way there and 
elsewhere in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is undoubtedly more concerned about East Germany, its key ally 
in Eastern Europe, than over developments in other socialist countries in the 
region. But Shevardnadze's outspoken and sometimes quite tough comments were 
intended, according to informed Soviet sources, as a broader warning to the 
West about trying to direct or influence the political, economic and social 
reforms now under way in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Kohl plan, presented last week to the West German Parliament and then to a 
meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders on Monday, envisages 
step-by-step cooperation between East and West Germany through the creation of 
joint institutions. The eventual result could be a federation of the two states 
within a united Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher said that Kohl has no timetable and favors an evolutionary process, 
but he repeated Bonn's undiminished hope of a reunited Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, Genscher said he had sought to reassure 
Gorbachev, Shevardnadze and other Soviet officials on Bonn's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never left any doubt that we are aware of our special responsibility 
for stability in Europe," Genscher commented. "Our national fate is embedded in 
the fate of Europe. That means there is not going to be a separate 'German 
cause.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reunification would require the active consent of both German states, he said, 
and would have to come as part of a broader East-West rapprochement and a 
general easing of tensions there. 
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances will we take advantage of the difficulties arising 
inevitably from this situation in Eastern Europe," Genscher said, pledging that 
Bonn will not push its vision for the future of Europe but will not relent in 
its propagation either.

East German and West German authorities announced Tuesday that visas will no 
longer be needed for West Germans to visit the Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules mean that for the first time in 25 years, West Germans will be 
able to go freely to East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Additional transit routes across the inner-German border were also approved at 
a meeting in East Berlin between East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow and 
Bonn's special emissary, Rudolf Seiters. The West Germans suggested that a fund 
be set up for East Germans to exchange their currency at a special rate -- 
rather than lining up for "welcome money" when they visit West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters said that West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will meet with Modrow in 
Dresden on Dec. 19, a day after a special session of the Communist Party 
congress is expected to institute sweeping changes in East Germany's 
leadership.

CZECH REGION FORMS COALITION CABINET; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: NINE OF THE 17 MEMBERS NAMED IN THE INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND ARE NOT 
COMMUNISTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The biggest of Czechoslovakia's two administrative regions Tuesday announced 
the country's first non-Communist governing body in more than 40 years as 
negotiations intensified to form a new Cabinet at the national level. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition group Civic Forum welcomed the regional Czech Lands government's 
new Cabinet, nine of whose 17 members are non-Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The Czech Lands, which include Bohemia, Moravia and the capital, Prague, 
constitute roughly two-thirds of the country's population and its industrial 
heartland. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider it a step in the right direction," Civic Forum spokesman Jiri 
Diestbier said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Civic Forum had specifically endorsed eight members of the new 
government, including the Communist minister of culture, Milan Lucas, who is 
head of drama at the National Theater. 
</P>
<P>
However, Diestbier added that the makeup still did not "accurately reflect the 
balance of political sentiments in society" and echoed calls for adding still 
more non-Communists and taking the sensitive Interior Ministry out of Communist 
hands. The police come under that ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The country's other region, Slovakia, remains under Communist control. 
</P>
<P>
Both regional and national-level Cabinets are seen as interim governments 
responsible mainly for preparing Czechoslovakia's first free elections since 
the 1940s. The opposition demanded that the elections be held before next July. 
</P>
<P>
While diplomats cautioned against viewing the Czech formula as a direct model 
for a national Cabinet, they said the new balance represents a significant 
change by the Communists since they announced their first attempt at a national 
government last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
News last Sunday that only five of 21 national Cabinet jobs went to 
non-Communists in the new government brought renewed mass demonstrations, a 
deadline of next Sunday for a new government and the threat of a general strike 
Monday if the deadline is not met. 
</P>
<P>
Talks on a new Cabinet resumed almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a government team headed by Communist Prime Minister Ladislav 
Adamec met for several hours in Prague with a Civic Forum delegation that 
included its most prominent figure, playwright Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
The recently appointed head of Czechoslovak television, Miroslav Pavel, who 
participated in the negotiations, described them as "very complicated." 
</P>
<P>
Students maintained a vigil Tuesday outside the main government office block in 
Prague. They held signs and called for the resignation of the 
Communist-dominated Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum has asked for a caretaker government made up mainly of 
professionals and technocrats, while the Communists are attempting to retain 
control despite the groundswell of opposition to their continued rule. 
</P>
<P>
However, those involved in the talks said that simply finding qualified 
non-Communists has become a major problem. As in other Communist countries, 
party membership has been a virtual prerequisite for advancement. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition has also been handicapped in nominating people for key jobs 
because its leaders have been isolated from the mainstream of society for two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
An opposition negotiator said that during talks Monday, Deputy Prime Minister 
Bohumil Urban complained about the difficulties of finding people outside the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"They simply don't know the names," the negotiator said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about competent people in the small Peoples and Socialist parties, 
which were allowed to survive as minor parties during the period of 
unchallenged Communist rule, Urban reportedly said, "You know what we did to 
them in the last 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
After initially refusing to provide names for possible government positions, 
Civic Forum has proposed some individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The predicament in part reflects the sheer speed of political change in 
Czechoslovakia, which in less than three weeks has moved from communism to the 
present search for a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, few in the party hierarchy saw either the need or the interest in 
contacts outside their privileged circle, while opposition leaders were 
isolated at the other end of the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-line Communist regime was swept from office by mass protests last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a special parliamentary commission officially blamed the disgraced 
former party secretary, Milos Jakes, and former Prague party boss Miroslav 
Stepan for the incident that triggered those protests -- vicious police 
violence against a peaceful student protest in the capital on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak news agency CTK quoted the commission as declaring that the 
two "carry direct political responsibility for the events of Nov. 17. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Both men were dropped from the Communist Party's ruling Politburo under intense 
pressure from protesters. Now the commission has recommended that they be 
stripped of their Parliament seats. 
</P>
<P>
Six senior police officers have also been dismissed, CTK said. 
</P>
<P>
The ramifications of recent events have begun to take their toll on the party 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Since Nov. 17, more than 20,000 of the party's 1.7 million members have 
resigned their membership, including 10% of the Prague party, according to 
party Central Committee spokesman Jozef Hora. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the National Assembly voted to abolish the party's leading role in 
society. The impact of that action is already visible. 
</P>
<P>
Party leader Karel Urbanek's meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
in Moscow was displayed only in the party newspaper Rude Pravo.

TESTIMONY DUE TODAY IN CHICAGO PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A GRAND JURY IS STUDYING POSSIBLE MOB TIES OF FIRST WARD POLITICIANS AND 
JUDGES. INQUIRY IS ONE OF MOST EXTENSIVE OF CITY'S POWER BROKERS.

<P>
The first public officials will go before a federal grand jury today in an 
unfolding Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service investigation of 
possible organized crime links to judges and politicians in Chicago's downtown 
First Ward, where much of the city's reputation for crime, commerce and 
corruption is rooted. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation appears to represent one of the government's deepest 
penetrations into the well-guarded political back rooms of some of Chicago's 
legendary power brokers. Bribery in the fixing of court and zoning cases, 
extortion and tax fraud are among the crimes reportedly being probed. 
</P>
<P>
"This could very well be the biggest thing we'll see to come down the pike in 
regard to the First Ward and organized crime," said John J. Jemilo, executive 
director of the Chicago Crime Commission and former Chicago deputy police 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
One of Chicago's 50 City Council districts, the First Ward is host to diverse 
institutions ranging from City Hall and the Sears Tower to Chinatown and 
Soldier Field, home turf of the Chicago Bears. The Loop business district is in 
the First Ward and so too is the financial district. Prohibition era gangster 
Al Capone had his headquarters in the ward, which was once a center for 
gambling houses and brothels. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception is that there is a tie between some politicians and organized 
crime members," said Jemilo, "and the perception is even more so when one talks 
about the First Ward." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the Justice Department's elaborate undercover investigations of 
corruption in government and the commodities industry here, this probe is 
populated by colorful characters and cloaked with intrigue. There are double 
agents, hidden cameras and concealed microphones. 
</P>
<P>
Among those subpoenaed to appear today are Fred Roti, an affable Peter Lorre 
look-alike who represents the First Ward on the City Council, and Pat Marcy, an 
insurance agency owner and chief aide to Democratic Committee member and ward 
boss John D'Arco. The grand jury's first round of subpoenas also asked for 
records of cases heard by at least five judges and two former judges. 
</P>
<P>
D'Arco, a one-time vegetable vendor, is the former First Ward city councilman 
who abruptly retired from the City Council 27 years ago after an unfortunate 
encounter with an FBI agent. D'Arco was in a restaurant with the late Chicago 
mob boss Sam Giancana when the agent walked by, stuck out his hand and said, 
"Good afternoon to you, John," raising the impression that D'Arco might be a 
government contact. According to author Ovid Demaris, D'Arco, unable to control 
a politician's instincts, reached out and shook the agent's hand. He checked 
into a hospital the next day, reportedly for his own safety, and quit the City 
Council the next week. 
</P>
<P>
The current councilman, Roti, is the son of Bruno (The Bomber) Roti, who 
columnist Mike Royko reports was the leader of the so-called "Black Hand" 
organization. Royko describes the group as "sort of a collection agency. Either 
they collected or you blew up." 
</P>
<P>
Marcy, a downtown political power for decades although he has not held public 
office, is generally believed to be the person in charge of the First Ward. He 
changed his name from Pasqualino Marchone after he served a prison term for 
robbery in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the initial evidence was gathered by lawyer Robert Cooley, who for 
three years simultaneously worked openly for First Ward politicians and 
surreptitiously for the federal government's Organized Crime Strike Force. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley, described as a fast talking gambler with an uncanny ability to win 
difficult court cases, is the son of a repeatedly decorated Chicago policeman 
and the brother of a Roman Catholic priest. For years he reportedly carried out 
a variety of tasks for local politicians before turning government informant 
and agreeing to wear a hidden tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
He reportedly told his family of his role in the case on Thanksgiving and 
vanished last week as word of the spreading investigation became public. The 
Chicago Tribune Tuesday reported that Cooley called friends this week to tell 
them they would never see him again and to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
The first hint that a major investigation was under way came last July, when a 
restaurant worker accidentally discovered a video camera hidden in the hollow 
back of a booth in Counsellors Row across the street from City Hall. The hidden 
camera was aimed at booth one, routinely reserved for First Ward politicians 
and their friends. Wires from the camera and from hidden microphones were 
traced to office space upstairs of the restaurant. The FBI retrieved the 
camera, claiming it was government equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley reportedly supplied the government with sufficient information to allow 
them to get court approval for the surreptitious video taping and recording.

NASA managers, facing a tight schedule, Tuesday cleared the space shuttle 
Columbia for a Dec. 18 night liftoff on a 10-day flight to launch one satellite 
and return another to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced the official launch 
target at the conclusion of a two-day flight readiness review to assess the 
status of work at launch pad 39-A to prepare the craft for its ninth flight. 
</P>
<P>
Liftoff of the eighth post-Challenger shuttle mission, the sixth of 1989, is 
scheduled for 4:29 p.m. PST, with landing set for Dec. 28 at Edwards Air Force 
Base, Calif. It will be the first American manned spaceflight spanning the 
Christmas holidays since a Skylab mission in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's flight also will mark the first from pad 39-A since before the 
Challenger disaster and the first from mobile launch platform No. 3, a firing 
stand originally built for the Apollo moon program and modified for use by the 
shuttle program.

COURT-APPOINTED OVERSEER SEEKS TO OUST 10 VETERAN OFFICERS OF TEAMSTERS UNION

<P>
A court-appointed investigator is seeking to remove 10 veteran Teamster Union 
officers across the country, largely on grounds that they have been convicted 
of receiving kickbacks or have been linked to organized crime figures, 
according to federal court records. 
</P>
<P>
The action by attorney Charles M. Carberry, a former federal prosecutor, was 
disclosed in papers filed with a Manhattan federal judge who had appointed 
Carberry and two others earlier this year to oversee activities of the 
Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
The move is the most far-reaching to be taken by any of the union overseers so 
far and appears to serve notice of their intention to remove what the judge has 
called "the hideous cloud of corruption" that has hung over the nation's 
largest trade union. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carberry has made no public announcement of the charges, officers at 
Teamster Union headquarters in Washington said that they had been informed of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The Teamster officers refused to comment except to note that, under terms of a 
court agreement, any accused member has 30 days to prepare a defense before 
receiving a closed hearing on the charges before Frederick B. Lacey, a 
court-appointed administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The court agreement, signed by Teamster lawyers last March to settle a 
long-standing federal racketeering suit against the union, specifies that Lacey 
-- based on the hearing -- may order removal of any officer for "just cause." 
That is a much lighter burden of proof than the standard of "beyond a 
reasonable doubt" that applies in ordinary criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 Teamster officers being charged are from New York, Chicago, Cleveland, 
Miami and Pittsburgh and include two members of the union's national executive 
board -- Ted R. Cozza and Harold Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with Teamster affairs said that others are expected to be 
charged by Carberry in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Carberry, who prosecuted Wall Street financiers Dennis B. Levine and Ivan F. 
Boesky when he was with the Justice Department, "is just as determined in his 
new post to clean up the Teamsters Union," according to a close associate. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein, who appointed Carberry and Lacey, has 
expressed his determination to make the oversight system work, despite Teamster 
animosity. Edelstein named a third attorney, Michael Holland of Chicago, to 
oversee the first direct elections of Teamster officers, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Cozza, of Pittsburgh, was cited by Carberry for "conducting yourself in a 
manner to bring reproach" on the union by "knowingly associating" for 20 years 
"with members of organized crime families of La Cosa Nostra" in Pennsylvania, 
including John S. LaRocca, Gabriel (Kelly) Mannarino and Michael Genovese. 
Cozza long has denied any association with criminal elements. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, of Cleveland, was cited for his conviction in federal court last 
January on charges of conspiracy and embezzlement in a payroll-padding scheme. 
The longtime associate of Jackie Presser, the late Teamster president, has been 
fighting to keep his high union post in spite of his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Hughes, a former Presser bodyguard who was convicted with Friedman, was 
similarly cited by Carberry. Hughes has held the title of international 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
Charles L. (Chuckie) O'Brien, who was close to former Teamster President James 
R. Hoffa, was charged with conduct that could bring reproach on the union for 
illegally accepting an automobile as a gift from a Teamster employer, a charge 
on which he was convicted in 1976. O'Brien was also cited for a loan fraud 
conviction in 1978 and for allegedly associating with mobsters Carlos Marcello 
and the late Anthony Provenzano. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, whom Hoffa raised from childhood, is an international representative 
of the Teamsters Southern conference in Miami. He denied accusations several 
years ago that he had helped lead Hoffa to his presumed murder by mob figures 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Two New York Teamster officers, Cirino (Charles) Salerno and Edward J. 
Martinez, also were charged. Salerno was accused of receiving kickbacks from 
firms that employed members of his Local 272 and with consorting with leaders 
of the Vito Genovese crime family in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was accused of bad conduct because he was convicted of misusing $9,000 
from the treasury of Local 808, of which he was an officer. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were also filed against four Chicago Teamster officers, including 
Joseph (Joey) Glimco Sr., an alleged mobster involved with the union since the 
1950s. Glimco was cited as an actual member of the Mafia and for convictions 
for receiving labor kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Union officers Dominic Senese, James Vincent Cozzo and Joseph Talerico were 
similarly accused of associating with Chicago mobsters Joey Aiuppa, Joey 
Lombardo and Jackie Cerone. 
</P>
<P>
Aiuppa, Lombardo and Cerone were among six alleged mob leaders convicted of 
conspiracy in 1986 in a plot to skim gambling proceeds from Las Vegas casinos 
in which they had invested by using loans from the Teamsters Central States 
pension fund.

The protest group Greenpeace on Tuesday accused the Navy of "maliciousness" in 
ramming its flagship as it protested the test launch of a Trident 2 missile. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a message for the Navy," Greenpeace USA Executive Director Peter 
Bahouth told a news conference. "We are going to take legal action. They are 
going to have to pay us damages." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to give details or say how much the group might seek in damages for 
the alleged incident Monday in the Atlantic Ocean 50 miles off the Florida 
coast just before the submarine Tennessee fired the $26.5-million missile. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, which acknowledged Monday that it had "shouldered" the protest ship 
away from the test site, denied Tuesday that its submarine support ships Grasp 
and Kittiwake rammed the 887-ton ship Greenpeace. The service said that it 
respected the group's right to protest but that it also had a right under 
international law to protect itself on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the "Navy reserves and will exercise its 
right to protect its vessels. . . ."

<P>
TAXATION: AS LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE MEASURE MOUNT, LEGISLATORS APPEAR 
UNCERTAIN ON HOW TO PROCEED IF IT IS DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

<P>
With the property tax-cutting measure Proposition 13 facing more legal 
challenges now than at any time in its 11-year history, legislators appear to 
be far from certain how to proceed if it is ruled unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
During a four-hour hearing Tuesday on the mounting legal challenges to the 
landmark measure, members of the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee agreed 
that the proposition seems to be flawed. But they also agreed that no one has 
an answer to the vexing problem of how to tax property equitably in California. 
</P>
<P>
And no one, at least in the Legislature, is ready to talk about repealing it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is simply not a constituency out there to change Proposition 13," said 
Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley), the committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Klehs and other lawmakers believe the problem of coming up with a new property 
tax system will be dumped in the lap of the Legislature if one of the current 
legal challenges to Proposition 13 is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the biggest flaw experts see in Proposition 13 is that residential 
and commercial properties sitting side by side can be taxed at widely varying 
rates, with newer property owners frequently paying a tax that is five times or 
more the amount their neighbors are paying. 
</P>
<P>
The problem stems from provisions of Proposition 13 that freeze the 1% property 
tax assessments to the base year of 1975-76 unless property changes hands. Once 
property is sold, it is reassessed and taxed on the basis of the new purchase 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Basis of Suits 
</P>
<P>
One of the lawsuits was filed by a San Diego investment firm, Northwest 
Financial Co., challenging a tax based on the $730,000 purchase price it paid 
for a La Jolla home in 1987. The suit claims that Proposition 13 is 
discriminatory because the tax is based on a value roughly four times higher 
than the one assessed against the previous owners. 
</P>
<P>
Another suit involves a Los Angeles County woman, Stephanie Nordlinger, who 
bought a home in Baldwin Hills and says she is paying a tax five times more 
than neighbors who own comparable property. 
</P>
<P>
Still another suit was filed by R.H. Macy and Co., which claims it was put at a 
competitive disadvantage when its stores in California were reassessed 
following a change in corporate ownership. An attorney for the department store 
chain told the committee that a Macy's store in Contra Costa County is paying a 
property tax bill that is 250% higher than those paid by competing department 
stores in the same Concord shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
On top of the legal challenges, there is a political challenge developing in 
the form of a "split roll" property tax initiative that would boost the taxes 
on business and commercial properties and provide some breaks for homeowners. 
Petition signatures have been submitted to the secretary of state's office, but 
the measure has not yet qualified for a place on next year's ballot. But the 
consensus of the tax committee members and those who testified was that the 
"split roll" initiative will do little to solve the equity problem. 
</P>
<P>
Klehs said the ideal solution would be for owners of equally valued property to 
pay the same tax so that the burden of financing government is spread evenly to 
all taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of political and legal problems, most experts agree that the solution 
ultimately will have to be one that provides tax breaks to new homeowners 
without raising the taxes of homeowners who haven't moved since 1975 -- roughly 
40% of all taxpayers, according to a Board of Equalization estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Goldberg, a spokesman for the California Tax Reform Assn., suggested a 1% 
or 2% transfer tax on long-term property owners when they ultimately sell their 
property. He said the transfer tax would be something akin to "a deferred 
property tax." 
</P>
<P>
That proposal was immediately challenged by Ernest Dynda, president of the 
United Organizations of Taxpayers Inc., the original sponsor of Proposition 13. 
He said that would hurt elderly homeowners who count on the value of their 
homes for retirement income. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Abascal, an attorney for the California Rural Legal Assistance Fund, 
suggested a property tax based on the income of the taxpayer, rather than the 
value of the home or business. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Majority Leader Thomas M. Hannigan (D-Fairfield) criticized the 
proposal, saying it would centralize taxing authority in Sacramento and 
"ignores the issue of local control." Hannigan has drafted a proposed 
constitutional amendment that would require property to be reassessed 
periodically, such as once every three years. This would boost the taxes of 
longtime homeowners who now don't face a reassessment unless they buy a new 
home. But Hannigan conceded it had little chance of passage, saying he 
"introduced it in part to create some discussion" among lawmakers.

JUDICIAL COUNCIL ACTS TO CLEAR OBSTACLES TO OPEN HEARINGS ON JUDGES' MISCONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Judicial Council has moved to clear the legal obstacles that have 
blocked implementation of a constitutional amendment allowing public hearings 
into charges of misconduct against California judges. 
</P>
<P>
The council, the rule-making arm of the judiciary, adopted new guidelines 
authorizing open proceedings before the state Judicial Performance Commission, 
the watchdog agency that investigates complaints involving the state's 1,460 
jurists. 
</P>
<P>
Jack E. Frankel, chief counsel of the commission, on Tuesday welcomed the 
adoption of the rules, saying they appeared to satisfy procedural objections 
that have prevented public hearings from being held under the amendment. "We 
didn't think the rules were needed, but as long as questions were raised, they 
will put the issue to rest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, passed by the Legislature and then approved by the voters in 
November, 1988, as Proposition 92, permitted the commission to make public its 
heretofore-confidential proceedings for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
But last summer, when the commission first sought to hold open hearings in the 
case of Orange County Municipal Judge Calvin P. Schmidt, the judge filed suit, 
contending that the Judicial Council must adopt procedural rules implementing 
the amendment before proceedings could be held publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The commission argued that the amendment was self-implementing and rules were 
not necessary -- but an Orange County judge agreed with Schmidt and barred open 
hearings. The commission appealed, saying that preventing open hearings despite 
passage of the amendment would undermine public confidence in the judiciary. 
But both a state Court of Appeal and the state Supreme Court refused to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after closed hearings, the commission issued a public statement 
reprimanding Schmidt for giving preferential treatment in a case involving a 
friend's stepdaughter and making improper campaign contributions. The judge was 
cleared of charges that he had performed a legal favor for a prostitute in 
return for sex. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Judicial Council, meeting last weekend in San Diego, approved a 
series of rules to take effect in January that spell out procedures for 
implementing the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The rules call for the commission to hold public hearings at the request of the 
judge unless it finds "good cause" for closed proceedings. In other cases, the 
commission may order public hearings without the judge's consent when the case 
involves moral turpitude, dishonesty or corruption and open proceedings would 
be "in the pursuit of public confidence and in the interests of justice."

TAXES: THE INVESTIGATION SEEKS TO DETERMINE IF THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS 
WIFE SHOULD BE ASSESSED FOR VARIOUS ITEMS, PARTICULARLY DRESSES FOR THE FORMER

<P>
The Internal Revenue Service has been examining whether former President Ronald 
Reagan and his wife, Nancy, owe back taxes on gifts -- including dresses for 
Mrs. Reagan -- that they received while they were in the White House, according 
to sources familiar with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, which began early this year, has been conducted by the IRS's 
Los Angeles field office because the Reagans were determined to be California 
taxpayers even while living in the White House, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the IRS's information comes from M. Chris Blazakis, a free-lance 
journalist who previously worked for the designer Galanos, who lent dresses to 
Mrs. Reagan. Blazakis said that during the past year he has shared "detailed 
information with the IRS," which he said has launched a "comprehensive 
examination" of "far-reaching" issues involving the Reagans' possible tax 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
Blazakis is now writing a critical book about the Reagans. He said he was 
coming forward with the allegations to ensure that they are properly handled by 
federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans' tax lawyer, Los Angeles attorney Roy Miller, said he could not 
comment on a matter involving a client. The Reagans' spokesman, Mark Weinberg, 
said he knew nothing about an IRS inquiry and could not reach the Reagans for 
comment. A spokeswoman for the IRS also declined comment, citing privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Brett, a spokeswoman for the National Archives, said IRS agents recently 
examined Reagan White House photographs at the archives and made some copies. 
She said this was done with the former President's permission. 
</P>
<P>
Documents seen by the Washington Post indicate that some IRS officials are 
treating the allegations seriously, have spent considerable amounts of time on 
the inquiry and have obtained permission from the Reagans to examine their tax 
records. The Post was shown these documents on condition that they not be 
further identified. Such cases are often resolved without court action in 
negotiated settlements with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Blazakis is a former executive vice president of Galanos Originals, a 
California firm headed by designer James Galanos. Time magazine quoted Blazakis 
as a source for its October, 1988, report that Nancy Reagan had borrowed dozens 
of expensive gowns from famous designers, along with jewelry and other 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
The White House acknowledged at the time that the Reagans had not reported the 
gowns as loans on financial disclosure forms under the Ethics in Government 
Act, as Nancy Reagan had promised she would do in 1982, or declared their value 
as income on federal tax returns from 1982 through 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Several tax experts interviewed by the Post last year said the dresses, some of 
which were worth $20,000, should be regarded as interest-free loans, and 
therefore taxable income, to Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said last year that there was "no 
illegality" because the White House counsel's office had determined that there 
were no tax consequences from the transactions. Therefore, Fitzwater said, the 
Reagans did not need to amend their tax returns or financial disclosure 
statements.

President Bush signed legislation Tuesday designating 733,400 acres of 
protected wilderness in Nevada and opening 2.4 million more acres to multiple 
use under the management of the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
The measure creates 13 new wilderness areas in Nevada and adds to one other 
existing area. That would put 2% of the state's land under wilderness 
protection, preventing development and such uses as timber harvesting, mineral 
exploration or intrusion by campers in vehicles.

LANCASTER SCHOOLS PUT TAX INCREASE ON APRIL BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in the fast-growing Lancaster School District will be asked to approve a 
property tax increase on the April ballot to fund $47 million in new and 
renovated school facilities, the district's Board of Trustees decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board's 5-0 vote came after a district survey showed that the needed 
two-thirds of voters might be willing to support it. 
</P>
<P>
The measure proposes an average tax increase of about $50 a year for 30 years 
for the typical home in the district, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly have a selling job ahead of us now," said Edward Goodwin, interim 
superintendent of the 10,700-student district. He acknowledged that persuading 
residents to vote for the tax hike probably will be more difficult than 
gathering expressions of support for it in the district's public opinion poll. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have pleaded money shortages and say they have nowhere to 
turn but to the voters. The 13-school district has spiraling enrollments and 
demand for classrooms, but the state has no money available for new school 
construction, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the measure for the April 10 ballot as Measure A. Acquiring 
four new school sites would be the top priority for use of the funds raised, 
followed by building four new schools -- two on those sites and two on land the 
district already owns -- and various improvements to existing schools. 
</P>
<P>
The district also released the results of the telephone survey it sponsored 
last month, asking about 400 of the district's 35,000 registered voters how big 
a tax hike for schools they would be willing to support. 
</P>
<P>
To pass, the ballot measure needs a two-thirds, or 66.6% mandate. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin said 73.3% of those surveyed said they would be "more likely" to 
support a measure that would cost them no more than $55 a year. The district 
did not get two-thirds support for any higher amount in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
The levy would be assessed against all taxable land in the district, at an 
average rate of about 5 cents per $100 of assessed valuation. The $50 annual 
tax increase is the 30-year average for the owner of a home assessed at 
$100,000. The actual increase would be smaller at first, climb to a peak of 
about $100 a year by the mid-1990s and then decline.

MOBILE HOME TENANTS REGAIN RENT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday passed urgency legislation aimed at 
heading off potentially large rent increases for some mobile home tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The council acted after several tenants at Los Olivos Mobile Home Park in 
Sylmar told council members Friday they feared the increases because a recent 
state Court of Appeal ruling removed them from the protection of the city's 
rent control law. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they were unaware of the ruling until notified by the 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled in September that because of ambiguous language in the city's 
1979 rent control law, the ordinance does not apply to mobile homes installed 
after Oct. 1, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance, which goes into effect immediately, clarifies the ambiguity 
and reinstates the coverage retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court, on a suit filed by Los Olivos, ruled that the law applies 
to mobile homes installed before 1978 and to all apartments built before 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments built and mobile homes installed since 1986 are not covered by city 
rent control, which limits increases to rises in the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office did not notify the council because it is appealing 
the ruling to the state Supreme Court, said Deputy City Atty. Gwendolyn 
Poindexter. 
</P>

She noted that a trial court had upheld the city's position on mobile homes 
installed between 1978 and 1986, but that the appellate court ruled 3 to 0 in 
favor of Los Olivos' position that those mobile homes were not covered. 
</P>
<P>
Farris Robertson, a Los Olivos resident who led the delegation to the council 
last week, said some tenants at the park are "mostly elderly people and some 
are terrified of management. They are worried sick about being forced out by 
huge increases." 
</P>
<P>
Before the council action, Robert L. Weiss, an attorney for Los Olivos, said 
the court ruling would not have wide impact. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he and attorneys for the city had identified only 533 spaces built 
after 1978, out of 6,800 in the city.

MOLOTOV COCKTAIL BURNS TEEN-AGER IN GANG ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old gang member was listed in fair condition Tuesday after his shirt 
was set ablaze by an exploding Molotov cocktail thrown from a passing car, 
Burbank police said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was talking on a pay phone at Buena Vista Street and Victory 
Boulevard about 9:30 p.m. Monday when a car with several rival gang members 
pulled up next to him, Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
An argument followed and a passenger leaned out and hurled a Molotov cocktail 
at the victim that exploded in flames, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of the victim who was inside a nearby convenience store smothered the 
flames with a jacket, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth suffered first- and second-degree burns on his face, upper chest and 
back, said a spokeswoman for Sherman Oaks Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The youth admitted to police that he was a gang member, and that the men in the 
car were members of a rival gang, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made, he said.

CARTER READY TO SIGN PACT WITH PADRES;

TRADE: $3-MILLION, 3-YEAR DEAL IS YET TO BE FINALIZED, BUT INDIANS' SLUGGER 
REPORTEDLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PACKAGE.

Center fielder Joe Carter will sign a three-year contract today with the 
Padres, sources said, that will finalize the Cleveland Indians' trade with the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have agreed to send catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., left fielder Chris 
James and minor-league third baseman Carlos Baerga to the Indians for Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carter and the Padres have yet to finalize terms of the contract, 
which is expected to be in the $3-million-a-year range, each side agreed to a 
three-year contract that will keep Carter in a Padre uniform through the 1992 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty excited about the trade," said Kansas City Royals second baseman 
Frank White, who visited Tuesday with Carter. "He said the Padres wanted to 
sign him to a four-year deal, but he wanted three years. Really, he's excited 
about everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The only bad thing about the trade, he said, was where the Padres spend their 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"He hates Yuma." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, even paradise has its flaws. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have a 7 p.m. (PST) deadline today to sign Carter. If they fail, the 
deal would be restructured, or possibly terminated. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see that happening, I'm very optimistic we'll get this thing done," 
said Jack McKeon, vice president baseball operations. "There's just a lot of 
details that need to be discussed, and that takes time. If we can get the 
dollar figure and contract provisions taken takes care of, I'm sure we'll get 
it done. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say I'm very confident."

DAVIS TELLS TEAM IT'S A 5-YEAR DEAL OR HE IS HISTORY;

Free-agent pitcher Mark Davis vowed Tuesday to leave the Padres and sign with 
another team if he is not soon presented with a guaranteed five-year contract, 
according to his agents. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very, very patient with San Diego," said agent Randy Hendricks, "but 
now my patience has run out. And so has Mark's. We've given them every chance, 
and they refuse to take the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"If they think I'm bluffing, watch us. Watch what happens. He'll be out of 
there so fast it'll make their heads spin. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have a five-year guaranteed contract offer from one team, and we'll 
get others. The Padres have to make a five-year offer and they'd be wise to 
make it in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's very adamant about a five-year contract, just as I am." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have a standing four-year, $12 million offer to Davis, and refuse to 
budge. Padre owner Joan Kroc insists that it will be her last offer, and will 
not give anyone a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then they can say good-bye to Mark then," Hendricks said. "He'll be 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been more than fair during this whole thing. Our patience in this entire 
thing shows his affinity for San Diego. We've given them every possible chance. 
And if they don't sign him, they only have themselves to blame." 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, vice president/baseball operations, said: "Well, we think we've 
been more than fair with Mark. We've made a very generous offer. Now it's up to 
Mark to decide if he wants to play for us. If he doesn't, we'll go another 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have already made a two-year, $2.5 million offer to free-agent 
left-handed reliever Craig Lefferts of the San Francisco Giants, and McKeon 
said that negotiations will continue. The Padres still want Lefferts even if 
they can retain Davis, but understandably, their interest in him will intensify 
if Davis departs. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 29, meanwhile has received five-year offers from at least three 
different teams -- the New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies and Kansas City 
Royals -- but the New York Yankees are believed to be the only team which has 
guaranteed all five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of creative offers," Hendricks said. "The only thing I can say 
about them is that we have different criteria with each of the teams, and may 
have different prices for some of the teams. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one team out there that if they make us the offer we're looking for, 
Mark's theirs. We'll march right up to the podium and announce it. 
</P>
<P>
"And when he's standing up there holding another uniform, all we can say is 
that we gave them (the Padres) every chance." 
</P>
<P>
There were no further negotiations or talks between Hendricks and McKeon on 
Tuesday, but to break the stalemate, Randy Hendricks had an innovative idea 
that he passed to Kroc. 
</P>
<P>
"She was saying how she's opposed to giving five-year contracts because they've 
been burned in the past with them," Hendricks said. "So I told her, 'Ok, why 
don't we make it six years then." 
</P>
<P>
The last five-year contracts provided to players in the Padre organization 
occurred in 1983 with Steve Garvey and 1984 with Goose Gossage. Neither player 
completed their contracts, but of course, each were past their prime when they 
signed with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her that just happened to guys with names who started with 'G,' 
"Hendricks said. "She's got to be open-minded to guys whose names start with 
'D.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I found out that at least she has a good sense of humor. She 
laughed pretty good about that one." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks hopes she can retain that same sense of humor if Davis just so 
happens to sign with another team.

SDSU VS. USD: BIG GAME, SMALL FOLLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As rivalries go tonight's basketball game between San Diego State and the 
University of San Diego will not be confused with the ones being played this 
week on the East Coast in the nationally televised match up of Atlantic Coast 
and Big East conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU and USD are not Top 20 powers preparing to put a national ranking and 
postseason hopes on the line; they are a pair of 2-3 teams trying to establish 
some credibility. 
</P>
<P>
But in a city where the average college basketball game draws a couple of 
thousand spectators, this game at 7:35 p.m. at the San Diego Sports Arena might 
be as good as it gets: The two leading programs in the city playing for the 
Mayor's Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the fact that the mayor has never attended the game to present the 
trophy might say something about the significance of the event in the overall 
scheme of the city. Nevertheless, the respective coaches were sounding this 
week as if the game did have some special meaning, even if it took the coaxing 
of questions from the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this game is important to us," USD Coach Hank Egan said. "We take it 
very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
And from SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg: "It's important for us; it's important for 
basketball in this city." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason the game might be missing some of the electricity of other 
inner-city rivalries is that almost all the players are from somewhere else. 
None of the projected starters and only five players from the teams combined 
are from San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
And while the coaches and players work to muster some enthusiasm for the game, 
the city has not wildly embraced the game. SDSU officials are predicting a 
crowd of between 3,500-4,000 in the 13,741-capacity Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The game resumes a series that had been contested almost annually since it 
began in 1962-63. The teams did not meet last season because they could not 
agree on an alternate date after their originally agreed upon date at the 
Sports Arena was taken by the Moscow Circus. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the Aztecs had dominated the series, which began in 1962-63, 
winning 15 of the 23 games. But the Toreros had won the past three in a row 
before last year's break. 
</P>
<P>
Just because the Aztecs and Toreros are back together on the court, that does 
not mean all will be settled among the city's college basketball teams this 
year. There is a third party involved: U.S. International. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls, the city's third major-college program, will play SDSU for a sixth 
consecutive season but will not meet USD. For the second consecutive season, 
there is the possibility that no clear-cut champion will emerge from among the 
city's major-college teams. 
</P>
<P>
USD and USIU were unable to reach an agreement to continue the four-year-old 
series. The sticking point was USIU's request that for the first time some of 
the games be played on its home court at Golden Hall and that USD agree to use 
some referees of USIU's choosing. 
</P>
<P>
With the USD-USIU series dead for now, tonight's game likely will have to serve 
as an unofficial city championship. For a city still trying to create a college 
basketball tradition, that will have to do for now. 
</P>
<P>
Game Notes 
</P>
<P>
The game is part of a double-header that will begin at 5:15 p.m. with a game 
between the San Diego State and University of San Diego women's teams. SDSU has 
won all 17 games in the series. . . The men's game will open the season's 
coverage of SDSU basketball on KFMB radio.

CLIPPERS SHOW LAKERS THEY ARE FOR REAL; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: ONE-TIME NEIGHBORHOOD PUSHOVERS FIGHT BACK BEFORE LOSING, 111-103, TO 
DEFENDING WESTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
These infrequent, neighborly get-togethers between the Lakers and Clippers had 
been getting pretty stale and predictable, especially when the teams played at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
What was needed Tuesday night was a little incentive and intrigue. Don Casey, 
the creative Clipper coach, provided the incentive by giving his team the 
written commandment that "Thou Shalt Beat the Lakers at The Forum," referring 
to the Lakers' 23-game, eight-year home winning streak over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
And the intrigue, it turned out, was whether the Lakers could maintain their 
dominance without injured guard Byron Scott, who missed the second half because 
of a sprained left wrist, and with very little motivation to hold a 13-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, predictability won out once more. The Lakers, though 
forced to work much harder than in seasons past, pulled out a 111-103 victory 
over the Clippers before a season-low Forum crowd of 16,035. 
</P>
<P>
This much was clear, though: The Laker-Clipper rivalry, heretofore one of only 
proximity, has entered a competitive phase. 
</P>
<P>
"They are 100-percent improved," Magic Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a lot of firepower now." 
</P>
<P>
But as long as Johnson and James Worthy are around, the Clippers' victory 
drought in Inglewood probably will continue when the teams play again at the 
Forum in March. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, playing primarily forward in the second half because of Scott's 
absence, scored a season-high 34 points and had 10 assists, including two 
baskets and a free throw in the final two minutes. Worthy added 18 points, 
including a free throw and basket that gave the Lakers a five-point lead with 
44 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the inspired Clippers had to scramble for quick points and quick 
fouls. They chose to foul Laker forward A.C. Green, a 72% free-throw shooter. 
Green, who won two games last season with late free throws, sank six 
consecutive free throws in a 15-second span to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a nice young team," Laker Coach Pat Riley said of the Clippers. "You 
got to forget about the past with them. A couple of years ago, you give them 
one right cross, and that would be it." 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, the Clippers endured a potential first-half knockout blow 
and almost delivered one of their own to the Lakers in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Ron Harper with 26 points and Ken Norman, who added 22 despite playing 
with tendinitis in his right knee, the Clippers overcame a 13-point halftime 
deficit and held a three-point lead with 5:18 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But the 13-3 Lakers, a good veteran team, pulled away from the 5-10 Clippers, 
an improved young team, by going with their marquee players when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers failed to convert on several critical possessions in the frantic 
final minute. Danny Manning, who had 16 points in his fourth game back, missed 
a free throw with 1:06 to play that would have pulled the Clippers to within 
two points. Manning missed another with 26 seconds left, then Harper committed 
back-to-back turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Free-throws haunted the Clippers all night. They made 15 of 28 attempts, and 
also had 25 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed we could (win) on their home court," said Norman, who made nine of 
14 shots. "We make our foul shots, we win." 
</P>
<P>
Casey also was pleased with the Clippers' play, if not with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids made a hell of a comeback," he said. "This is a stage they are going 
through. There wasn't much else we could've done, except knock down a couple 
more shots." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' third-quarter funk, a recurring problem, was only partly due to 
Scott's absence. Scott was out the entire second half after suffering a 
sprained left wrist 1 minute 50 seconds after the opening tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
Scott scored 11 first-half points, but the wrist stiffened at halftime, and 
Scott was sent to Centinela Hospital Medical Center for X-rays that showed no 
fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Without Scott, the Lakers became primarily a half-court offensive team. In 
Riley's words, the Lakers "came out flat as a drum" in the third quarter. They 
made 25% of their shots, their lowest total for a quarter this season. 
</P>
<P>
Their 13-point halftime lead did not last long. A 16-2 run in the first 4:06 of 
the third quarter enabled the Clippers to take a 59-58 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After sustaining that initial Clipper blow, the Lakers recovered. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, they reclaimed the lead and even built it to as many as 
three points. But by the end of a third quarter, during which the Clippers made 
61% of their shots to the Lakers' 25%, the Clippers used the scoring of Norman 
and Harper to take a 73-71 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've followed the Lakers for the last 10 years, you know we're notorious 
for our (poor) third-quarter starts," Michael Cooper said. "We always come out 
slow for some reason." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were part of the reason. The Lakers acknowledge that. But Johnson 
and others say the Laker offense can become stagnant without Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to go without Byron, and they were doubling me and James," 
Johnson said. "We were just sloppy in the third quarter. We went to a 
three-guard attack with me at (small forward)." That lineup worked in the 
fourth quarter. Cooper, who started the second half in Scott's place, sank two 
three-point shots in a span of 1:08. And Johnson finally broke free by posting 
low and then driving to the basket. Add six consecutive free throws by Green, 
and another Laker victory over the Clippers was secured. 
</P>
<P>
But the Clippers, if nothing else, issued a warning that they will no longer go 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"Like Coach (Casey) said, this was the toughest we've played this team in this 
building since he's been here," Harper said. "That's got to tell you something. 
This team is on the verge of really making something happen." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Openly, at least, the Lakers did not react strongly to Don Casey's statement 
that his team must beat the Lakers at the Forum. A newspaper clipping of the 
goal was underlined on a bulletin board. "I guess you have to set some goals," 
Michael Cooper said before the game. "Why not set ones you feel are easy to 
get? I mean, anyone can beat anyone in this league. Boston used to have a thing 
against us, and we ended that." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said forward Orlando Woolridge, now participating in 
practice after Oct. 17 arthroscopic surgery to remove bone fragments from his 
right knee, is about two weeks away from being activated. Riley, however, said 
Woolridge will accompany the Lakers on an upcoming eight-game Eastern trip, so 
he can work out with the team. "I still think 'O' is far away from a 
conditioning aspect," Riley said. "He needs another week or 10 days of 
practice. Plus, he still has a little discomfort. Until I see enough from him 
in practice, we won't rush him." Riley said one reason Woolridge will not be 
rushed is that he is satisfied with an effective substitution rotation that 
includes center Vlade Divac, Michael Cooper at forward and point guard Larry 
Drew. "It's going to put a squeeze on some minutes when 'O' comes back," Riley 
said. "Guys are settled. But we need (Woolridge) because he creates things 
offensively when he gets the ball. We needed that the other night against 
Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
Drew, who last played in the NBA for the Clippers during the 1987-88 season, on 
playing against his former team: "Just another game. I mean, so many guys are 
gone since I played there. I think only three are left -- Ben (Benoit 
Benjamin), Joe Wolf and Ken Norman." 
</P>
<P>
It also was a homecoming of sorts for David Rivers, the Clippers' reserve point 
guard, who played sparingly for the Lakers last season as a rookie. . . . The 
last time the teams played, last April 15, the Clippers beat the Lakers, 
119-107, at the Sports Arena. Benjamin scored 24 points and grabbed 11 
rebounds.

MUIR EXONERATED IN ELIGIBILITY DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: PLAYOFF FOE THOUSAND OAKS CONTINUES TO RAISE DOUBTS OVER PLAYERS' 
STANDING BASED ON LATE ACADEMIC REPORTS.

<P>
Suspicions by Thousand Oaks High officials that Muir's football team wrongfully 
used certain players in its Southern Section playoff game Friday are unfounded, 
according to Southern Section and Pasadena Unified School District officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although seven members of Muir's team were ruled ineligible as a result of 
grade reports received by Muir officials last Wednesday, school district policy 
stipulates that no player had to be dropped from the team until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The grading situation was further muddled when the district computer system 
failed to produce grades until more than a week later than usual. Had the 
grades been released on time, those seven players could not have played against 
Thousand Oaks. Muir won the Division II semifinal game, 9-3, in overtime, and 
will play Santa Barbara in the final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip, Lance Erie, Thousand Oaks' principal, voiced concerns about 
the possible use of ineligible players to Southern Section official Bill Clark 
on Monday and Muir Principal Alvin Fortune on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we can rely on is the integrity of the school," Erie said. "And 
I'm not going to question the integrity of a school unless someone steps 
forward with some information." 
</P>
<P>
However, when Erie learned that Muir knew of the players' standing two days 
before the game, he said he would contact the Southern Section office today to 
discuss "the interpretation and application of that rule." Because of delays 
caused by computer difficulties, the players should have been immediately ruled 
ineligible, according to Erie. "My sense of it," he said, "is that you don't 
wait any longer." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Bernthal, Muir's athletic director, maintains that the computer failure 
was district-wide, also affecting Blair, Pasadena and Marshall Fundamental 
highs, a contention supported by district officials. Bernthal added that he 
also would have waited the extra four days had football players been awaiting 
reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
Because of several recent run-ins with the Southern Section, including one in 
the 1987 season that caused the Mustangs to forfeit eight games because of 
ineligible players, Muir has earned a reputation for not policing incidents 
such as these, Bernthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section bylaws state that if a grading period ends and grades cannot 
be distributed because of computer difficulties, a grade check cannot be made 
just for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards said that he felt hoodwinked by the loss and 
the subsequent discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision by the letter of some rule and maybe not the intent," he 
said. "Knowing what I know, I feel our team has been cheated."

RESEDA TO PROTEST PROPOSED SWITCH TO 4-A LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Reseda High will protest a recommendation by the City Section's realignment 
committee that would force the Regents to switch conferences with Canoga Park 
for the two-year releaguing cycle beginning next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member realignment committee recommended the change after dismissing an 
appeal by Reseda on Monday night. The committee also recommended a switch 
involving Westchester of the Coastal Conference and Narbonne of the Southern 
Pacific Conference. The recommendations will be forwarded to the 
Interscholastic Athletics Committee, which will meet Monday. Westchester also 
plans to protest. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda would be moved from the Valley Pac-8 Conference, a 3-A Division 
conference in most sports, to the Northwest Valley Conference, primarily a 4-A 
conference. Joel Schaeffer, the school's football coach, angrily objected to 
the proposed move, vowing to take his fight as high as the school board. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to sit by and let this happen," he said. "I don't know why we 
have to be pinpointed to be the sacrificial lamb." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer argued that either Grant or Birmingham of the Valley Pac-8 Conference 
would be better suited for the move, citing enrollment and overall strength of 
athletics programs. Reseda, with 2,202 students, has a smaller student 
population than Grant (3,199) and Birmingham (3,169). All are four-year 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
But City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness said that strength of program is the 
only criterion used for realignment. Enrollment differences are insignificant, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was based on an assessment of the overall programs," he said. 
"Why does anyone move up? Because they are successful. It's just Reseda's time 
to move up."

LOCKER SHOCKER; 
</P>
<P>
GROWING NUMBER OF SCHOOLS ELIMINATE THE METAL BOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
They're a rite of passage, a symbol of adolescence. But school lockers are now 
becoming history in a small but slowly growing number of Southern California 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Three Long Beach middle schools are the latest to lock lockers for good and 
force students to, ever so grudgingly, schlep their books to and from home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too hard to carry all your books. Let me show you my history book," said 
Jefferson Middle School student Jason Knowles, displaying a thick text. "Now, 
picture eight of these," continued the eighth-grader, whose 75-pound frame 
carries a heavy backpack daily. 
</P>
<P>
What's a school without lockers? 
</P>
<P>
To administrators and teachers, it's a quieter, safer, less troublesome place. 
Kids get to class on time because they're not schmoozing by their lockers. 
Hallways are no longer filled with the loud chorus of clanging metal doors. 
School staff is freed from having to fix the lockers. And for some students, 
there is one less place to stash drugs or weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called locker problems," said Diana Pichierri, principal of Desert 
Springs Middle School, a new school in the Palm Springs Unified School District 
that was built without lockers. "The lock is jammed, or somebody vandalized it, 
or nasty things are written on them, or 
'I-gave-my-combination-to-my-best-friend-and-I-hate-her-today-and-look-what-she's-done.' 
I can guarantee (getting rid of them) saves some gray hair." 
</P>
<P>
But to most teen-agers, a school without lockers is like a school without pep 
rallies. On a practical level, carrying a backpack filled with textbooks, note 
pads, gym clothes and other equipment is, well, heavy. And besides, lockers 
signified a kid's arrival in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would feel more grown up, older," said Dustin York, one of the 
many disappointed newcomers to Jefferson Middle School looking forward to 
getting a first locker. "But this is like an elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
Principals at Jefferson, Franklin and Lindbergh middle schools in the Long 
Beach Unified School District, on the other hand, have nothing but kudos for 
the experiment, which may expand to the other 11 middle schools in the district 
but has not yet been considered for the high schools. In other districts, the 
concept has already taken hold in both junior and senior high schools from 
Pasadena to San Bernardino to San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"My hallways are cleaner. My custodian has time to do custodial things. My kids 
have (more) time in the classroom. It's been a positive thing," said Linda 
Moore, principal at Franklin Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pasadena Unified School District, most students don't have lockers in 
either middle schools or senior high schools, said Michael Klentschy, assistant 
superintendent for instruction. As in the other districts, Pasadena school 
officials assign lockers to students with special problems, such as medical 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Bernardino City Unified School District, lockers in both middle 
schools and high schools were removed in recent years to cut down on 
maintenance costs, said Harold Boring, the district superintendent for 
administrative services. It saves the district about $200,000 a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, South Gate Junior High School is 
exploring the idea, according to Verna Stroud, the school improvements 
coordinator. Elsewhere in the district, however, workers are fixing broken 
lockers. Last year, the Los Angeles school board allocated $400,000 to repair 
lockers, said Julie Crum, the district's assistant maintenance director. 
</P>
<P>
While the advantages are many in getting rid of lockers -- or shutting them off 
by placing long metal bars through them, as officials did in the three Long 
Beach middle schools -- the main drawback is that children sometimes must carry 
heavy book packs. 
</P>
<P>
To check just how much they were carrying, San Bernardino school officials 
gathered the textbooks and weighed them. The average load was about 12 pounds, 
unless students were carrying all of their books with them, which raised the 
weight to 26 or 27 pounds, according to Boring. 
</P>
<P>
Khalilah Slaughter and Anitrica Howze are cousins, petite 11-year-olds who 
share the same classes at Jefferson Middle School. They place all their books 
in one large gym bag, which they take turns carrying. They complained of a need 
for personal storage space beyond their physical education lockers, which are 
small and out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students say their biggest beef is that it is burdensome to lug 
their texts from home to school and back each day. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits, however, have paid off, said Principal Candace Toft of La Mesa 
Middle School in San Diego County. "We just don't find the things that we used 
to. We're not finding the drugs and the weapons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Myrna Fujimoto, the principal at Jefferson Middle School, said one gun was 
found hidden in a locker last year. "That was enough to convince me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, principals at the three Long Beach schools say drugs and 
weapons have not been a serious problem at their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
And while youngsters such as Jefferson seventh-grader Jairo Olivos will clamor 
for lockers ardently -- "We want our rights! We want lockers!" -- officials say 
the metal boxes are neither a right nor, some argue, a venerable teen-age 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditions change daily," Pichierri said. "I would rather think of it as a fad 
that has lost its excitement."

REMAPPING PLAN COULD DISPLACE SCHABARUM; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HE WOULD BE PUT INTO A PREDOMINANTLY LATINO DISTRICT UNDER A PROPOSAL 
THAT SUPERVISORS ARE PRIVATELY STUDYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A redistricting plan that would force Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum to run in a new, predominantly Latino district is privately being 
reviewed by the Board of Supervisors as a possible settlement to a federal 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would radically change the political representation for hundreds of 
thousands of county residents. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first realignment of district boundaries prepared by the county's 
political consultant since supervisors last week voted to explore a settlement 
of a federal redistricting lawsuit. The trial has been postponed indefinitely 
to allow settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department and two civil rights groups last year filed suit 
accusing the all-white board of drawing its districts in such a way as to 
weaken the political clout of the county's 2 million Latinos. The suit contends 
that the board split up Latino neighborhoods among three districts in violation 
of the federal Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides met privately in U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's 
chambers Tuesday, but afterward refused comment on the status of negotiations. 
Diane Palmiotti, a spokeswoman for the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, said the new county map was not distributed or referred to at 
the meeting. Another meeting was set for next week. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum said he had not seen the newly proposed redistricting plan and would 
not comment on it. He said he has not decided whether to seek reelection in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if being placed in a Latino majority district poses political problems, 
Schabarum said, "Not if you do your job . . . being a Hispanic such as I am 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
A Schabarum aide said the supervisor's grandfather was a German miner who 
married a Mexican woman. Schabarum was born in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Schabarum would keep some of his political base in the San 
Gabriel Valley, helping his chances of holding onto his seat, if he decides to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
The map presented to supervisors this week was drawn by Joe Shumate, a 
political consultant hired by the county. 
</P>
<P>
According to a memo sent to the supervisors by County Counsel DeWitt Clinton, 
the map represents an "updated analysis" of a plan "previously furnished and 
reviewed by several board offices." 
</P>
<P>
Shumate said the map is new and not a simple revision of a map he prepared for 
the supervisors when he was hired as a consultant in 1981. Shumate said he 
would not comment further on the new map under orders from the county's 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the majority of the board might go for it," said Mas Fukai, chief 
deputy to Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, pointing out that the plan provides 
political security for a majority of board members. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton's memo said the map was prepared at the request of Supervisors Deane 
Dana and Ed Edelman to facilitate discussions "which could lead to a potential 
compromise" in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Dana's willingness to work with his ideological opposite Edelman is a strong 
sign that a settlement might be in the offing. Only three votes are required 
for approval of a settlement. Dana already has broken ranks with his 
conservative colleagues in supporting settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
Dana and Edelman refused to comment on the new map. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Silver, an aide to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said the board is "at a very 
preliminary stage. We will be looking at several different configurations" of 
new district boundaries before the process is completed. 
</P>
<P>
But one source close to the negotiations said the supervisors do not have long 
to develop a plan. 
</P>
<P>
One board source said Clinton told the supervisors that they have only another 
week or two to submit a plan to the judge, or the Justice Department will drop 
efforts to negotiate a settlement and proceed with the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan now being circulated among supervisors, Schabarum would be 
placed in a predominantly Latino district extending from East Los Angeles to 
growing immigrant neighborhoods in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the sacrificial lamb," said one Latino political adviser familiar with 
the redistricting fight. "Schabarum is the one who is expendable to both sides" 
of the board, he said, pointing out that Schabarum's combative ways have cost 
him support even among his conservative colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
A MALDEF spokeswoman declined to offer an opinion on Schabarum's claim to be of 
Latino descent. "The issue is that Hispanics have good representation, and we 
would not see Schabarum as someone representative of the Hispanic community," 
the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Edelman, though losing East Los Angeles from his existing 
3rd District, would retain his Westside political base while picking up Malibu 
and a bigger part of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich and Dana would still represent conservative-voting districts. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's heavily black South-Central Los Angeles district would be largely 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
All the supervisors, except for Schabarum, will be "pretty safe," said Silver, 
adding that the plan makes Antonovich "even safer." Antonovich's 5th District 
would become even more heavily Republican under the latest Shumate map. 
</P>
<P>
"For purposes of comparison," Clinton also provided supervisors with an 
alternative redistricting plan prepared by the Justice Department. That plan, 
made public last month, would carve out a new, predominantly Latino district by 
moving Edelman's district east of the Harbor Freeway, costing the supervisor 
his Westside base of political support. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit against the county is similar to one filed by the Justice 
Department against Los Angeles in 1985. In order to settle that lawsuit, the 
City Council redrew its district lines to create a new Latino district, and two 
Latinos presently serve on the 15-member council.

31 PLUCKED FROM BURNING BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen trapped workers were plucked from the roof by a helicopter and 15 more 
were hauled down fire ladders propped against upper-floor windows as flames 
swept through the sixth floor of a nine-story building in the downtown Los 
Angeles garment district Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 people were injured, most of them suffering smoke inhalation as the 
blaze isolated scores of workers on the top three floors of the 76-year-old 
structure at 754 S. Los Angeles St. 
</P>
<P>
"One man was on his stomach on a windowsill, just two stories below the roof . 
. . screaming for help in Spanish," said Renee Cohen, co-owner of a clothing 
store across the street. "We screamed back, 'Hold on! Hang on! Don't jump!' " 
</P>
<P>
The first of more than 20 Los Angeles fire units rolled up as the man clung to 
the sill. Moments later, he was pulled to safety on a fire ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the building was not equipped with a sprinkler system or 
fire alarms. Under current law, the owners have until 1992 to install such 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
An employee of one of the approximately 10 garment firms in the structure said 
he tried to use one of the building's fire hoses, but it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was not immediately determined, but workers at the Elite 
Fashion Co., which occupies the entire sixth floor, said the blaze apparently 
started in a small room where the firm stored rayon material used in the 
manufacture of imitation mink coats. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said that most of the sixth floor was charred and that the two 
floors above also suffered fire damage. There was smoke damage on the upper 
floors. There was no immediate estimate of monetary losses. 
</P>
<P>
On the seventh floor, Edgar Mijangos, 26, heard the screams of those fleeing 
the rapidly spreading flames below. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard them breaking windows," he said. "Then I went to a window, and I saw 
them below me, gasping for air. They were screaming 'Auxilio! (Help!). They 
couldn't breathe because the smoke was so hot." 
</P>
<P>
With the smoke spreading rapidly through the upper floors, workers fled as best 
they could. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Delgado, 36, was one of those who decided it was better to head up -- to 
the roof -- than risk a dash down an interior stairwell or exterior fire escape 
past the flames that were rapidly engulfing much of the sixth floor. 
</P>
<P>
But after climbing stairways and fire escapes to the roof, he said, he and the 
others atop the building soon found themselves enveloped in a rising cloud of 
increasingly hot smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado said their first thought was to try to reach another building, a 
tantalizing 15 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to put a ladder and a board across," he said. "But the people (on 
the other building) wouldn't let us. They told us to stay calm, because the 
firemen were coming." 
</P>
<P>
"I was yelling, 'Get us out of here! Get us out of here!' " said Ana Jimenez, 
29, who is five months pregnant. "I asked God, 'Please, send someone to save 
us. Now!' " 
</P>
<P>
The people on the roof said that after what seemed like an eternity -- but was 
actually only a few minutes -- a helicopter approached the building. 
</P>
<P>
Hovering just above the roof because officials were uncertain how much weight 
the structure could bear, the Fire Department's big "Huey" transport helicopter 
picked up seven people there and flew them to the heliport atop the Piper 
Technical Center, just east of Union Station. It took one more trip to evacuate 
the other nine on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
John Tang, owner of a sewing shop on the seventh floor, said that rather than 
head for the roof, some of his employees grabbed bolts of cloth to tie together 
into a makeshift rope for an escape attempt down the side of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't do that!" Tang said he shouted. "It's too dangerous!" 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the material wouldn't support them," he explained later. "I told them 
to go down the stairs, but the smoke was too thick, and I told them to come 
back. Then I shut the door, shut off all the power and told the workers to get 
material wetted and cover their faces." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Tang said, he and some of his employees escaped by crawling to open 
windows where firefighters had placed long extension ladders, while others made 
their way down fire escapes. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which broke out about 11:30 a.m., burned for an hour before it was 
brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Fire Chief Jim Young said that about 40 people were treated at the 
scene and at the Piper Center for smoke inhalation and minor burns, cuts and 
bruises. Eighteen of the 40 were taken to hospitals for observation, but none 
were reported in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
Under ordinances adopted in July, 1988, after the destructive high-rise fire at 
the downtown First Interstate Bank building two months earlier, sprinklers and 
fire alarms are required in all buildings over 75 feet tall, regardless of when 
they were built. 
</P>
<P>
However, the RK Building Co., owner of the structure that caught fire on 
Tuesday, was not cited for the lack of sprinklers and alarms until last 
September. Under the ordinances, the firm has one year to obtain a permit for 
installation of the systems from the city Department of Building and Safety. RK 
Building would then have two more years to install the systems. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Fire Chief Tony Ennis said the building's fire safety inspection file 
was "a fairly thick one," with several violations recorded over the years, 
although the owner was apparently working with fire inspectors to correct some 
of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
An inspection in August, 1988, showed that the building had eight different 
types of violations, including windows leading to fire escapes that did not 
work properly, fire hoses lacking the correct nozzles and a lack of emergency 
exit signs. 
</P>

Ennis said a follow-up inspection two months later showed there had been 
"partial compliance" with some of the complaints. He said he will look into why 
there had not been another follow-up inspection this year to determine if the 
other problems were corrected.

FIRE HEIGHTENS CONCERN ABOUT BUILDINGS' SAFETY 
</P>

As flames and smoke poured from the grimy nine-story RK Building on Tuesday, 
Maria Mazariejo watched in horror from across South Los Angeles Street as a 
woman in the burning building came close to jumping out of a window. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was saved by firefighters, but Mazariejo, a clothing inspector who 
works on the 10th floor of another garment district building, said she and 
co-workers were left shaken by how close they were to witnessing a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, they saw themselves in that woman's place and feared the 
same could happen to them one day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to talk to the owner about our business next week," Mazariejo 
said. "We're going to tell him we want more protection." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the hundreds of sewing factories and clothing shops that pack the 20 
square blocks of the garment district, fear of a disastrous fire always lingers 
in the back of people's minds, workers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
They speak of buildings without sprinkler systems, adequate escape routes or, 
as in the case of the RK Building, without fire alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Garment workers who fled the nine-story building said that amid the screams and 
cries for help, they never heard an alarm. Fire officials said there was none. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you mad," said Selina Ko, who works on the ninth floor of the 
building. "We heard nothing, no alarm, not a thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at those buildings," said Renee Cohen, who owns a shop across the 
street from the RK Building. "They look like hell. For fire, nobody should feel 
comfortable in one of them." 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the RK Building is no different from many of others in the 
garment district that workers contend could be dangerous in a fire. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see here is pretty typical of the kinds of problems we commonly see 
throughout the city in commercial buildings like this," said Assistant Fire 
Chief Tony Ennis. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gershon, owner of a building across the street, said he believes most 
owners are conscientious about maintaining their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"These buildings are worth too much money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalind Alfieri, who manages a building at 9th and Main streets, said owners 
are constantly upgrading their buildings, but that it takes time and money to 
bring them up to modern safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Fire Department recently notified the owners of her building that 
they will have to submit plans for a fire protection system in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to enclose the stairwells, elevator doors, install a sprinkler system, 
new lighting system and electrified exit signs," she said. "It's a 
multimillion-dollar operation." 
</P>
<P>
Those are measures that some wish had been taken at the RK Building years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If you work here, you know how really dangerous it is," said Chris Jong, 
manager of a sewing factory on the seventh and eighth floors of the RK 
Building. "I talked with employees about starting work again. If you look at 
their faces, you can see they are not coming back. They are really scared."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAPD, SHERIFF AND CHP AIDING MADD PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Los Angeles area law enforcement agencies joined with Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving to encourage area restaurants to participate in a designated 
driver program, Sandy Freeman, president of MADD's Los Angeles chapter told a 
press conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the California Highway Patrol, Los Angeles Police Department and 
the Sheriff's Department have been querying restaurant owners about whether 
they will join the program, Freeman said. Participating owners have agreed to 
ask patron groups if they will designate one person in their party to refrain 
from drinking to help ensure that the others have a safe ride home. As part of 
the program, the designated driver is given free non-alcoholic drinks, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of promotion by MADD, about 125 restaurants in the county are 
participating or have agreed to join the program, Freeman said.

BILL BOYARSKY: TV AND THE SQUEAKY WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Have you seen the Los Angeles City Council on television? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. It's a pretty dull show. The subject matter is usually arcane. 
You don't see Bob Farrell talking on the telephone at the side of the room or 
Zev Yaroslavsky, over by the press area, trying to charm the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
There are no shots of the lobbyists in the audience, no text on the screen to 
identify the land developers, dump operators and other businesses they 
represent. Or to show their campaign contributions to council members. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do the cameras give you the drama behind the drama. You may see the outrage 
level slowly rise as a homeowner testifies before the council, but you don't 
see what's making the homeowner so mad. It's the inattentiveness of the 
council, Joel Wachs signing papers or Richard Alatorre reading the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
But with all the flaws, the fact that the council meetings are televised is 
important. In a society increasingly apathetic about politics, power is going 
to the squeaky wheels. And the people who watch televised legislative meetings 
are definitely wheels that squeak. 
</P>
<P>
The first politician of note to discover that was a once-obscure Georgia 
political science professor, Newt Gingrich, who was elected to Congress in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, Gingrich and a small group of fellow Republican conservatives 
decided to deliver their message on C-Span, the cable television network that 
carries House sessions gavel to gavel. Their efforts were derided by those who 
said that nobody watched C-Span. Tip O'Neill, then the Democratic speaker, 
tried to quash them by having the cameras pan the House during their speeches 
at the end of the session, showing the empty chamber. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter. What was important was the message Gingrich and the others 
were delivering -- and the audience watching it. 
</P>
<P>
The audience is surprisingly big. A 1987 C-Span survey showed that 32 million 
homes in the nation received the service. People in almost 11 million of those 
homes actually watched C-Span. Most watched about 9 hours a month. But a 
certain breed, a newcomer to the American political landscape known as a C-Span 
Junkie, viewed the network 20 hours a month or more. 
</P>
<P>
Most important for Gingrich was the nature of the audience. They were 
interested in politics. They were more likely than non-C-Span viewers to vote, 
to contribute to political campaigns and to complain to public officials. In 
1988, 78% of C-Span viewers voted, compared to 50% for the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are about 120 California communities where meetings of city 
councils and boards of supervisors are televised, using channels set aside by 
cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks is one example. In this suburban Ventura County community along 
the fast-growing Ventura Freeway corridor, council meetings have been televised 
since 1987. "We've become television personalities," said Mayor Alex Fiore. "At 
the market, people come up and say, 'Alex, I saw you on television.' " 
</P>
<P>
The city's annual Conejo Valley Attitude Survey, a questionnaire mailed to 
9,000 homes, indicated that Fiore's anecdotal evidence really means something. 
Of the 3,334 households that replied, 42% said they occasionally watched 
council meetings and 5% said they always watched. 
</P>
<P>
Some think the next step should be to televise the state Legislature. A group 
headed by Professor Tracy Westen of the USC Annenberg School of Communications 
has proposed a California Channel to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
All this is bound to change the way people think of their elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
City council members have been one-dimensional figures, names in the newspapers 
or brief images on local television news programs. When I say Ernani Bernardi, 
you may know the name, and that he's a Los Angeles city councilman. But you 
have no sense of the man. Bernardi, who has been on the council longer than 
anyone else, understands that. That's why he hosts a weekly television show 
with reporters on the cable system in his San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
The show makes him more than a name in the papers. He's wise old Ernie 
Bernardi, guiding the reporters' discussions, cutting them off when they get 
boring. Like Mayor Alex Fiore of Thousand Oaks or once-obscure Newt Gingrich of 
Georgia, Ernie Bernardi is a television personality. 
</P>
<P>
Final note: Don't be put off by the dullness of city council sessions. What's 
important is that city councils are now accessible to many persons with cable 
TV. Most city councils meet at night. Los Angeles sessions begin at 10 a.m. 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Friday -- with sessions replayed on Channel 35 at 6 
p.m. You, too, can be a squeaky wheel.

90 PROTEST MALATHION SPRAYING AS SCIENTISTS MEET ON NEW STRATEGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 90 people protested near downtown Los Angeles Tuesday against government 
efforts to kill the Mediterranean fruit fly with aerial spraying as top 
scientists convened a three-day meeting in El Monte to revamp the eradication 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials also reported the discovery of a male Medfly in the city 
of Bell, three miles outside the boundary of a 25-square-mile sector 
encompassing Downey and South Gate, that is to be sprayed with malathion 
Thursday night. No spraying has been ordered for the new area. 
</P>
<P>
The new fly discovery came as officials were preparing for three consecutive 
nights of spraying to combat the worst Medfly infestation in Southern 
California history. On Tuesday, helicopters prepared to douse a 16-mile section 
of Los Angeles that includes Eagle Rock, Elysian Park and Mt. Washington. 
Today, spraying is planned in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
A group of residents and environmentalists held a noontime rally at 
Commonwealth Avenue and 6th Street, lashing out against the use of pesticides 
rather than relying on biological controls, such as the release of sterile 
flies, to eradicate the pest. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the state's top scientific advisory board were briefed 
privately on technical details of the eradication program by government 
agricultural officials in El Monte, and they also toured several of the Medfly 
quarantine zones. The scientists are grappling with new strategies on how to 
halt the spread of the crop-destroying pest and will announce their 
recommendations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County will conduct aerial spraying of malathion tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Area: 9 square miles encompassing parts of Monrovia, Arcadia, Temple City and 
El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Time: 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Precautions: Stay indoors; keep animals indoors; wash animal dishes and toys 
left outside; cover cars; keep doors and windows closed. 
</P>
<P>
Information: Toll-free numbers for the Agricultural Commissioner: (800) 
356-2894; (800) 225-1346. STEPHANIE CHAVEZ

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN JURORS DELIVER SECOND SEALED 
VERDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the McMartin preschool molestation case turned in a second verdict 
Tuesday and rejected a suggestion that they cancel their Christmas vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was sealed in an envelope and placed with another verdict delivered 
last week. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said on Monday 
that he would not read any of the verdicts before jurors leave Dec. 15 for 
their Christmas break. He gave them the option of working through the planned 
two-week holiday, but they chose not to. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors are considering 65 separate charges against Raymond Buckey, 31, and 
his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, who are accused of molesting children at 
their family-owned preschool in Manhattan Beach. They have been deliberating 
for a month and have submitted only two verdicts. However, it was unclear how 
many counts the jurors addressed so far, since one envelop could deal with more 
than one count.

SWEEP NETS HALF-TON OF COCAINE AND 7 SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly half a ton of cocaine, with a street value of $130 million, was seized 
and seven people were arrested in a widespread operation reaching from the San 
Joaquin Valley to Culver City, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block told a press conference in San Dimas 
that the San Gabriel Valley Narcotics Enforcement Team arrested six men and a 
woman in the sweep, which also yielded 2.2 pounds of heroin and $100,000 in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think this is going to cut down the amount of dope around here, it 
won't," Block said. "There's just too much coming in." 
</P>
<P>
The operation began Monday evening with the arrest of Mary Carmen Altamirano, 
34, on Interstate 5 north of Bakersfield, according to authorities. 
Investigators said they found 218 pounds of cocaine in the van she was driving. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Narcotics Enforcement Team -- composed of sheriff's deputies and 
officers from 11 San Gabriel Valley police departments -- served search 
warrants in the Los Angeles area and in Bakersfield early Tuesday morning and 
arrested the others. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they discovered another 726 pounds of cocaine in Culver City and 
arrested three suspects there, identified as Jesus Arnolfo Astroga, 42; Raul 
Galvan Arevalo, 23, and Cesar Beltran Ramos, 20. 
</P>
<P>
Two others, Jesus Borboa Valdez, 30, and Moises Asparga Valensuela, were 
arrested in Los Angeles, where the heroin was found, according to 
investigators, and another man, Carlos Napoleon Molina, 22, was arrested in 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were booked on charges of possessing narcotics for sale and were 
ordered held on $2 million bail each.

ACCUSED SLAYER OF ACTRESS IS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert John Bardo, accused killer of actress Rebecca Schaeffer, was ordered 
Tuesday to stand trial for her slaying after several witnesses testified at a 
preliminary hearing that they saw him flee her Fairfax District apartment after 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge David M. Horwitz set arraignment for Bardo, 19, for Dec. 
11. The judge also upheld a special-circumstances charge -- lying in wait -- 
that would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty if Bardo is found guilty 
on the first-degree murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer, best known as the co-star of the television series "My Sister Sam," 
was shot once in the chest July 18 as she stood in the doorway of her 
residence. She died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Bardo was arrested in Tucson a day later. He was taken into custody after 
police found him darting in and out of traffic, apparently in a suicide 
attempt. Police said he later led them to a bloody shirt and copy of J. D. 
Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye." 
</P>
<P>
In a hotly contested move, two Los Angeles police officers brought Bardo from 
Arizona to Los Angeles in mid-August. Although the defense called the 
extradition illegal, an appeals court judge upheld the action. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's order Tuesday followed nearly 5 1/2 hours of testimony by 10 
prosecution witnesses, most of whom said they either heard the fatal gunshot or 
saw Bardo near Schaeffer's apartment before or immediately after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the phone near the window when I heard a scream," said Francois 
Lesourd, a witness who lived across the street. "I walked to the kitchen window 
and to the living room window, and I saw (Bardo) running out from the door 
across the street." 
</P>
<P>
Lesourd said Bardo, whom witnesses described as wearing flip-flop shoes, was 
running "funny" in an effort to keep his shoes on his feet. At least six other 
witnesses testified that they saw Bardo leave the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark also called as a witness the 
manager of a detective agency that Bardo allegedly hired to find Schaeffer's 
address. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wanted to send her a gift," said Anthony Zinkus, the manager. "He 
said (Schaeffer) might be somewhere in the L.A. area and that she had 
connections with the television business. He showed me a black-and-white, 
8-by-10 photo." 
</P>
<P>
Zinkus' agency later obtained the address from the Department of Motor 
Vehicles, a move that recently prompted legislators to tighten regulations 
regarding the release of DMV information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, Lynne Marta, said she heard the shooting as she stood in an 
apartment down the hall from Schaeffer's. 
</P>
<P>
"The door shook, the wall shook," said Marta, whose apartment was only a few 
feet away from where Schaeffer was slain. "The cat went up into the air. I fell 
to my knees and crawled into the bedroom. Then, I heard Rebecca's first 
scream." 
</P>
<P>
Marta said she called 911 after she heard the gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
"She was still screaming while I was talking to 911," said Marta. "By the time 
I got to the door, she was wailing. I opened the small hatch in my door. There 
was a smell I'll never forget: the smell of gunfire. It was quiet except for 
light moaning."

POLITICS: WITH HIS APPOINTEES AND FRIENDS AT THE CENTER OF THE LINCOLN S&amp;L 
SCANDAL, DEUKMEJIAN CAN'T WASH HIS HANDS OF THE AFFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the dust settled from the Oct. 17 earthquake, Gov. George Deukmejian 
appointed a blue-ribbon commission to look into the seismic safety of 
California's freeways. Most of the deaths caused by the quake had occurred when 
a section of Interstate 880 in Oakland collapsed on rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A political-financial disaster of comparable proportions surrounds the collapse 
of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. An estimated 23,000 Californians lost hundreds 
of millions of dollars that they had unwittingly "invested" in junk bonds 
issued by Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds were marketed because state regulators had determined that they were 
backed by a financially sound organization. What those regulators did was 
analogous to what state highway engineers did when they determined that I-880 
could withstand a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the I-880 situation, at worst, was a matter of miscalculation. No one 
has alleged that anyone knowingly erred. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Lincoln matter, just the opposite has become apparent. During the 
months that have elapsed since Lincoln was seized by federal authorities, it's 
become clear that huge amounts of political influence were brought to bear by 
Lincoln, American Continental and their owner, Charles Keating Jr., to stave 
off a close examination of questionable financial practices. And Deukmejian's 
appointees and friends are at the center of the scandal, to wit: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two state corporations commissioners, Franklin Tom and Christine Bender, 
approved sale of the junk bonds even though suspicions about the financial 
integrity of Lincoln and American Continental already were being voiced by 
lower-level regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tom and Bender had moved into their regulatory jobs from positions in a law 
firm headed by Deukmejian's friend, political adviser and chief political 
fund-raiser, Karl Samuelian, who recommended them for the appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Samuelian was hired by Keating to lobby for approval of the bond sales, and 
he and Tom personally pressed Bender for a favorable ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As Samuelian joined Keating's vast team of advocates, he began collecting 
tens of thousands of dollars -- some estimates approach $200,000 -- in campaign 
contributions for Deukmejian from Keating and associated firms and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deukmejian's savings and loan commissioner at the time, Larry Taggart, 
approved Keating's acquisition of Lincoln. During his last weeks in office in 
1984, Taggart allowed Keating to move $800 million in Lincoln's assets into 
questionable investments, just three days before a federal rule barring such 
investments took effect. He later acknowledged that "I suppose I did that to 
beat the deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Taggart acted, he already had agreed to become an executive of a 
troubled San Diego investment firm called TCS Financial, headed by Tom Stickel, 
the man who introduced Keating to Samuelian. Within weeks of Taggart's action 
allowing Keating to transfer the money, American Continental pumped nearly $3 
million into TCS, saving it from foundering. 
</P>
<P>
The picture that has emerged from journalistic digging and legislative hearings 
in Washington and Sacramento is that of a regulatory system run amok, more 
concerned with helping Keating prop up his financial empire than with 
protecting the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has maintained a detached attitude toward the affair, insisting that 
he played no role in what occurred. That really isn't the point. 
</P>
<P>
What is the point is that people he appointed to protect the public from 
unscrupulous financial dealings didn't do their jobs and, from all appearances, 
failed because of personal, political or financial connections to those they 
were supposed to be regulating. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian says he never went through Deukmejian to serve the interests of 
Keating or any other legal client. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't the point, either. When Samuelian represents a client before a 
Deukmejian appointee -- and, in this case, one who had worked for him as well 
-- he doesn't have to be explicit. People in such positions aren't stupid. They 
know who Karl Samuelian is and what kind of political clout he represents. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian may be concerned about public confidence in the highway system. He 
should be equally concerned about public confidence in the political system.

KEATING DONATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to the article (Nov. 23) detailing the donations by Charles Keating 
to various politicians: It seems incredible that Sen. Cranston and this group 
of recipients can stand there and look the taxpayers in the eye and say, "This 
money belongs to me, not the depositor or the bond holder." 
</P>
<P>
As I surmise the situation, the recipients of Mr. Keating's largess, have 
received stolen property, and it should be returned immediately.

IT'S BEEN A SWEET RIDE THROUGH THE DECADE; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: NOBODY KNOWS IF THIS IS SUGAR RAY LEONARD'S LAST FIGHT, BUT EVERYONE 
AGREES THE SPORT HAS BEEN HIS IN THE 1980S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The question has been asked all week: Will Sugar Ray Leonard, who with Roberto 
Duran kick-started this decade with its first megafight, Leonard-Duran I, 
finish the 1980s by winning Leonard-Duran III, then retire? 
</P>
<P>
"If I do, I won't call a press conference to announce it," he said, teasing 
reporters Tuesday. "I'll probably just fade away into the sunset." 
</P>
<P>
"But how will we know if you've retired?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If 10 years go by and you haven't seen me fight, I've probably retired," he 
said. "Besides, if I announced it, you wouldn't believe me anyway, right?" 
</P>
<P>
He's right. Boxing folks tend to smirk during Leonard's retirement speeches. 
There have been a few. 
</P>
<P>
If he does retire, or even if he doesn't, no one can argue the point that in 
this decade, boxing has been his. He has made more money and been involved in 
more memorable engagements than any fighter of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The three Leonard-Duran fights alone will have rewarded the participants with 
about $60 million. Then there were two rich battles with Tommy Hearns and, in 
1987, the keystone achievement of his career, the upset victory over Marvelous 
Marvin Hagler. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, according to his lawyer, Mike Trainer, will top $100 million in career 
earnings with this fight, by way of suggesting that it's a nice number on which 
to bow out. But Leonard seems to bristle a bit at what he calls "people trying 
to psychoanalyze me." 
</P>
<P>
He said: "Don't try to figure out what makes me tick. That's a mistake. You 
don't need to figure out what motivates me at this stage of my career. I'll 
tell you: Competition motivates me. Roberto Duran thinks he can beat me. That 
motivates me. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing this (boxing) for a long time and it gets to be too much. . . 
. People trying to figure me out and me having to defend boxing and my 
opponents." 
</P>
<P>
If Leonard wins Thursday night and decides to quit, much will be made of the 
decision, made several months ago by Leonard and Trainer, to cut down the Sugar 
Ray Leonard entourage. 
</P>
<P>
The Leonard traveling squad for this fight, Trainer said, was reduced from 20 
to seven, leaving some unhappy campers behind in Washington. Among those 
failing to make the cut were two of Leonard's brothers and a trainer, Dave 
Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
The sole trainer now and the only one who will talk to Leonard in his corner 
Thursday night is Pepe Correa, who has been with Leonard for years but was 
never the No. 1 trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest part was telling my two older brothers, Roger and Kenny, that 
this is so important to me that I didn't want anyone around," Leonard said. "So 
when the rest of the staff questioned my decision, I said, 'If I dismiss my 
brothers, what do you mean to me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Traveling light, to Leonard, meant fewer distractions, and silence instead of 
showtime commotion. Leonard has trained in the past in casino hotel ballrooms 
and arenas, and always seemed to enjoy working out before hundreds of 
spectators who cheered his world-class jump-rope drills. 
</P>
<P>
Before his draw with Hearns last June, Leonard filled Caesars Pavilion, with 
2,500 seats, for one workout. Only Muhammad Ali, Arum said at the time, had 
filled an arena for a Las Vegas workout. 
</P>
<P>
This time, there have been no crowds, no cheers. Not even music. One of 
Correa's first orders: No boom boxes during workouts. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, until he agreed to work out publicly in a Mirage Hotel ballroom in the 
final days before the fight, has worked out at Arum's new gym in a Las Vegas 
industrial park. Media people were admitted, but no one else. 
</P>
<P>
The squad cut left some soreheads back home, among them Harold Bell, a 
Washington radio sports commentator who often rips Leonard on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who helped Ray when he was just starting out have been treated 
very badly by him," he said. "What happened to Janks (Morton) and Dave 
(Jacobs), that's just recent stuff. Ray has been doing that to people for 
years. I was once close to Ray, but when I saw how he treated people, I 
walked." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer said: "Harold Bell is a guy who got turned down when he once asked Ray 
for a job, and he's been unhappy about it ever since," Trainer said. "He also 
knocks Ray because Ray doesn't happen to contribute to Harold's favorite 
charities." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer said the cutback was agreed upon after Leonard reviewed the video of 
his disappointing draw with Hearns last June, a fight in which Leonard was down 
twice and seemed at times to have balance problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The major change was having one trainer, not two, and Ray settling on Pepe," 
he said. "The second major change was no public training in Las Vegas. Ray felt 
that at 33, maybe he needed a little more concentration in his preparation. He 
loves signing autographs and giving away T-shirts at workouts, but this time he 
decided he didn't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
In his news conference, Sugar Ray talked about the scaled-down Team Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided three guys can't carry a duffel bag," he said. "For the Hearns 
fight, I found myself worrying if people had enough assignments." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his performance, Leonard just shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy proved he's a better fighter than everyone thought," he said. "And I had 
a bad night, and maybe there are a lot of reasons for that. But one bad night 
doesn't necessarily mean my career's over. Remember, Tommy's a very tough guy 
to fight." 
</P>
<P>
Duran's people whisper that they believe Leonard has been favored by Nevada 
judges in past fights here, and they cite the draw with Hearns and the decision 
over Hagler. Some still believe Leonard lost both fights. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said he is growing weary of defending himself, his opponents and 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in no-win situations since the Hagler fight," he said. "They said 
Donny LaLonde was a built-up white fighter with a manufactured title. They said 
Tommy was washed up. Hagler was too old. It seems like I always have to defend 
something. In the second Duran fight, people wanted to almost perform medical 
research on Duran, to find out why he quit, instead of saying, hey, maybe Ray 
had something to do with making him quit." 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken Correa said Leonard will come into the ring exceptionally fit. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been as pleased with a fighter's preparation as I am with Ray for 
this fight," he said. "There is no man on earth who can outbox this man when 
he's right, and this man is right. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we went into training, we broke down everything in boxing that made Ray 
great, and we put it all back together." 
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday morning, Leonard weighed himself. He was 160 pounds. Both he and 
Duran are contracted to weigh 162 or less. 
</P>
<P>
"I called Pepe and told him I was 160, and he told me not to run. I liked that. 
It was nice to go back to bed. It was cold outside this morning."

COMANECI TELLS OF ROMANCE WITH RESCUER; 
</P>
<P>
NADIA: ROMANIAN GYMNAST SAYS THEY WILL RESIDE IN FLORIDA, ADDING THAT SHE HAS 
NO INTEREST IN A SPORTS CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former gymnast Nadia Comaneci and the married roofer who arranged her defection 
from Romania revealed their romance Tuesday, but they repeatedly shunned 
questions about their immediate personal plans. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci made it clear, however, that she has no desire to become involved with 
gymnastics in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing bewildered by the more than 100 journalists at a news conference in 
Hollywood, Fla., Comaneci, 28, and Romanian immigrant Konstantin Panait, 34, 
said that they plan to live in South Florida while they work out their 
relationship and other details, such as work permits and U.S. citizenship for 
the gymnast. She has been granted refugee status by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing jeans and a gray sweater, Comaneci said that she first considered 
defecting after retiring from competition in 1984. But she added that personal 
travel restrictions -- not the recent East Bloc reforms -- motivated her 
decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
She and Panait, posing arm in arm for photographers, said that they hoped to 
"settle down together." But they would not disclose whether they would share a 
home before he obtains a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know all my secrets," said Comaneci, who arrived in Miami Monday 
night after having spent several days in seclusion with Panait in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Panait is a self-employed roofer who came to the United States from Romania in 
the early '80s. He has been living with his wife in Hallandale, Fla., about 10 
miles north of Miami. They have four young children. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she knew that Panait was married when they met two years ago at a 
party in Bucharest, Comaneci said, "Yes, so what?" 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci and Panait said that they plan to visit his wife, Maria. When told 
that the house was surrounded by reporters and photographers and that his wife 
was upset by the attention, he said, "She has been hurt, but (this romance) was 
the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Tabloid newspapers reportedly offered Panait's wife $1,000 to $3,000 to tell 
her story and reported that she was angered by reports linking her husband 
romantically with Comaneci. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry my husband ever helped Nadia escape because it is giving me a lot 
of trouble," she said. "I know what's true. I'm going to hold my head up high 
through all of this. I'm going to stick it out." 
</P>
<P>
One report said that she learned her husband had helped Comaneci escape when a 
friend called to say that Panait was on television with Comaneci. But an 
earlier report quoted her as saying that her husband had told her when he left 
Florida that he might bring Comaneci back with him. 
</P>
<P>
She said that her husband had been visiting his parents in Bucharest. Friends 
of Panait's family said that Comaneci's mother and Panait's mother were close 
friends in Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci, who was 14 when she scored seven perfect 10s at the 1976 Summer 
Olympics in Montreal, said that she had been approached about making a film of 
her life and had agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to make a movie about my story," she said, adding that she also plans 
to star in the film. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that gymnastics does not figure in her immediate plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do other things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that she does not plan to contact Bela Karolyi, her former coach, 
who defected from Romania in 1981 and now trains gymnasts in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no business with my former coach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Karolyi, who returned home Monday night from competition in Stuttgart, West 
Germany, said that he is disappointed that Comaneci has not contacted him. He 
had invited her to live with him and his wife in Houston. But he said that he 
is glad Comaneci is taking charge of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I really wish from the bottom of my heart that she be associated 
with gymnastics, I am happy to see her taking her life in her own hands," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He, however, expressed concern about Panait's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who he is, what he wants or what his plans are," Karolyi said. "I 
appreciate his courage, taking a risk to get her out of Romania. But I want to 
know if he truly wants to help her." 
</P>
<P>
Similar concerns were expressed by Geza Pozsar, Comaneci's former choreographer 
who defected with Karolyi from Romania in 1981. Pozsar, who operates a gym in 
Sacramento, is married to Comaneci's second cousin. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made so many efforts to contact her," Pozsar said. "Maybe someday she'll 
remember the people who helped her when she was young." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that he believed her image would be damaged in the United States 
because of her relationship with a married man. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving in New York Friday, Comaneci sold the story of her defection to a 
London newspaper, The Mail on Sunday. It reported that the defection was 
organized by Panait and that she endured a muddy, nighttime trek through 
country terrain before reaching the Hungarian border when she left Romania 
under the cover of darkness Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci said that she, Panait and six other friends left her mother's home in 
Bucharest in a rental car and headed for the town of Timisoara near the 
Hungarian border. Panait dropped them off 10 miles from the Hungarian border at 
about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stumbling and often crawling through water and ice," Comaneci said. 
She said that the group encountered no border guards, although they heard guard 
dogs barking. 
</P>
<P>
They reached the border after walking for six hours, having veered miles off 
their planned route. At the border, the group was stopped by a Hungarian border 
patrol and taken to police headquarters at Szeged, Hungary, where they were 
reunited with Panait. Because he had an exit permit, he had legally crossed the 
border into Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"We never said we wanted to leave Hungary," Comaneci said. "We never let on we 
were planning to go to the West. I didn't know what would happen if I said I 
wanted to go to America. We had to lie." 
</P>
<P>
After the Hungarians had given them identity papers early last Wednesday 
morning, the group fled to Austria. She said that her friends are still there. 
</P>
<P>
She left without saying goodby to her parents, she told the Mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell no one I was escaping," she said. "I even had to lie to my 
brother. I was frightened, of course I was. I was scared of being picked up by 
the Romanian authorities." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that she had nothing with her when she crossed the border except 
for the clothes she was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not bring anything else with me, not even my precious gold medals or a 
photograph of my family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference Tuesday, Comaneci said that she fears retribution from 
Romanian authorities against her family members in Romania and hopes to call 
her parents this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go for me, to have a better life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she declined to discuss her plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I want just a quiet life, but I don't think I'll have a chance," she said, 
smiling at reporters.

STATISTICS: THE FOOL'S GOLD OF SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something Mike Tomczak said recently got me to thinking. There's a lot of time 
for thinking when you're winging to Las Vegas, particularly when you go by way 
of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the Chicago Bears' quarterback, after a recent ruinous afternoon, said, 
"Statistics are for idiots." 
</P>
<P>
After several hours poring over the stats from weekend National Football League 
games, I might amend that to read, "Statistics can transform you into an 
idiot." 
</P>
<P>
For years, coaches have been feeding us the line about how successful offenses 
are balanced offenses. 
</P>
<P>
So New Orleans runs out, creates terrific balance between its rushing and 
passing and ends up losing to the bedraggled Detroit Lions, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
After every Baltimore victory in the mid-1970s, Ted Marchibroda (alias, coach 
Furrowed Brow) used to say, "Now that was Colt football: good offense, good 
defense, good special teams." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Denver obviously played "Bronco football." They outrushed the 
Raiders, outpassed them and had a 26-11 edge in first downs. They had the ball 
all day, 44 minutes to 23, and 78 plays to 46. And they lost. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay lost a fumble, had two passes picked off, rushed the ball for only 61 
yards, had to punt nine times and was penalized 10 times. Uh-huh, the Pack beat 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In the biggest game of the day, Philadelphia drew 16 penalties while running 62 
plays and stuffed the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
As numbers were checked for contest after contest, a very definite pattern 
seemed to be forming; mentionably, there is no pattern to parity ball. 
</P>
<P>
The way the New York Jets and San Diego Chargers came through on big plays -- 
combined, they went 7 for 33 on third-down conversions -- it's amazing the game 
didn't end in an overtime scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Jets passed for an awesome 68 yards and prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
New England, trailing 16-15 and touchdown-less inside the last two minutes, 
drove the length of the field to score and beat Indianapolis. Faced with a 
third-and-21 on their own 26, the Patriots came up with a 30-yard play. 
</P>
<P>
One suspects the Indianapolis owner stole down from his box and was dictating 
defensive strategy on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
In game after game it was thus, the old tenets of the game, the cliches, the 
verities being brushed aside or disregarded. It was discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
With still hours to fill, a bunch of National Basketball Association boxscores 
was scrutinized in hopes sense would return to the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
A truth long held to be self-evident in hoops dictates that if a team has a 
dominant or at least capable center, it will win a lot more than it will lose. 
Rubbish! A half-dozen starting centers for NBA clubs tallied point totals of 
zero, eight, four, two, nine and zero, with rebound totals not even that good, 
and four of the teams won. 
</P>
<P>
Individually, David Robinson had a great night for the San Antonio Spurs 
Saturday, scoring 32 points and picking off 18 rebounds. Had the ball in his 
hands all night, right? Amazingly, he didn't record an assist. 
</P>
<P>
It's still early in the never-ending NBA season, of course, but where in 
Newton's Laws does it even suggest the possibility that the Los Angeles Lakers 
should be the only team among the 27 that has a winning record on the road? 
</P>
<P>
On and on the study raged as the bags of peanuts and apple juice kept coming. 
Numbers, numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone who follows pro football concedes the NFC is decidedly 
stronger than the AFC, yet in inter-conference tilts the latter holds a 20-17 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans, thought to be unbeatable after crunching the East German women in 
last year's Olympics, not only loses in the pool, but by two seconds, an 
eternity in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
The further the research proceeded, the more ridiculous the statistics became, 
just as quarterback Tomczak had instructed. 
</P>
<P>
It went from ridiculous to the sublime upon arriving in Las Vegas, where 
conservative estimates have folks paying in the vicinity of $60 million to 
watch a couple of oldies-but-goodies, Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, try 
to render each other senseless Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
With that much dough, a guy might be able to land himself a .500 pitcher, a 
utility infielder and a decent long reliever at baseball's winter meetings. 
Checking some of the deals in Nashville, Tenn., so far, obviously several 
general managers subscribe to Tomczak's theory about statistics.

PADRES EXPECTED TO SIGN CARTER TO THREE-YEAR CONTRACT TODAY

<P>
Center fielder Joe Carter will sign a three-year contract today with the 
Padres, sources said, that will finalize the Cleveland Indians' trade with the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have agreed to send catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., left fielder Chris 
James and minor league third baseman Carlos Baerga to the Indians for Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carter and the Padres have yet to finalize terms of the contract, 
which is expected to be in the $3-million-a-year-range, each side agreed to a 
three-year contract that will keep Carter in a Padre uniform through the 1992 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty excited about the trade," said Kansas City Royal second baseman 
Frank White, who visited Tuesday with Carter. "He said the Padres wanted to 
sign him to a four-year deal, but he wanted three years. Really, he's excited 
about everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The only bad thing about the trade, he said, was where the Padres spend their 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"He hates Yuma." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, even paradise has its flaws. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have a 7 p.m. (PST) deadline today to sign Carter. If they fail, the 
deal would be restructured, or possibly terminated. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see that happening, I'm very optimistic we'll get this thing done," 
said Jack McKeon, vice president baseball operations. "There's just a lot of 
details that need to be discussed, and that takes time. If we can get the 
dollar figure and contract provisions taken takes care of, I'm sure we'll get 
it done. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say I'm very confident."

The "bounty war" between Coach Jimmy Johnson of the Dallas Cowboys and Coach 
Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles heated up again as the teams prepared for 
Sunday's game at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has accused Ryan of placing a $200 bounty on placekicker Luis Zendejas 
and a $500 bounty on quarterback Troy Aikman in a Thanksgiving Day game won by 
the Eagles, 27-0. "And I think the officials will be on top of the game this 
time," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said linebacker Jessie Small deliberately went out of his way to hurt 
Zendejas. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL is investigating the bounty charges.

FITCH UNABLE TO UNTANGLE NETS' MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coaching changes are intended to revitalize a team, with the players expected 
to impress their new boss with all-out hustle and basketball intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
But it does not always work. Just ask Bill Fitch, who inherited the 26-56 New 
Jersey Nets this season. The rap against Willis Reed, who was moved to a vice 
president's job, was that he was too soft and failed to motivate the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch, who had won with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics and Houston 
Rockets, had a reputation as a petty dictator who could intimidate his players 
to play aggressively by threatening trades or banishment to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But Fitch has been unusually subdued while watching the rebuilt Nets, featuring 
center Sam Bowie and rookie playmaker Mookie Blaylock, stagger to a 4-11 start, 
including a nine-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to make a lot of evaluations and changes, but it's not my nature to 
wave the white flag," Fitch said. "I'm doing everything I can, but I'm only 90 
percent of it. It's not my nature to walk away and give up, but we have to find 
some character out there." 
</P>
<P>
After trading power forward Buck Williams, the cornerstone of the team the past 
years, to the Portland Trail Blazers, the Nets were left without a true leader, 
on or off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"The part I don't understand about this team is the lack of aggression," Fitch 
said. "Good teams can shoot bad and still win with tough defense, but we 
haven't shown that quality." 
</P>
<P>
Fitch reportedly has been most upset with the inconsistent play of forward 
Chris Morris, the top draft pick in 1988, rookie center-forward Charles 
Shackleford and veteran point guard Lester Conner. 
</P>
<P>
Watching his team dig a huge hole for itself, shooting guard Dennis Hopson 
said, "We're not doing what Coach Fitch wants us to do. It's crazy. The things 
we do in practice, we forget once the game begins. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to find the problems and solve them. It's not the same circumstances 
as the last few years. We've got a lot of new guys, but if one person falls 
into the losing mold, it starts to rub off and kind of snowballs." 
</P>
<P>
Trade bait: The hottest trade rumor has the Dallas Mavericks offering Roy 
Tarpley, who was leading the league in rebounding, to the Golden State 
Warriors. The Mavericks are looking to acquire shooting guard Mitch Richmond, 
the National Basketball Association's 1988-89 Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, who need a big man, reportedly are willing to deal Terry Teagle 
or Winston Garland but will not part with Richmond, who has struggled this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley has a history of drug and drinking problems. He has been suspended 
twice and is in an outpatient clinic in Dallas for alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Said a Warriors source, "It seems unthinkable to trade a person with as much 
talent as Tarpley. But on the other hand, you have to wonder if he'll ever play 
for you and what will happen to his trade value." 
</P>
<P>
In all likelihood, the Mavericks will be stuck with Tarpley, for better or 
worse. With two strikes against him, a third would bring a life suspension. 
Tarpley would have a right to appeal after two years. So, a team trading for 
the gifted power forward would risk getting nothing. 
</P>
<P>
It's only a name: Disgruntled Sacramento Kings fans are booing and heaping 
ridicule on Pervis Ellison, the first player chosen in the 1989 NBA draft. In 
college, the All-American center-forward was known as "Never Nervous Pervis." 
</P>
<P>
But after missing nine of the first 13 games while recuperating from ankle 
surgery and then averaging only five points and five rebounds, Kings supporters 
dubbed him "Out of Service Pervis." 
</P>
<P>
Bad timing: The Mavericks' team calendar starts with November and a picture of 
head coach John MacLeod, who failed to survive the first month. Tarpley appears 
as January's centerfold. 
</P>
<P>
Coach's rebuttal: Mike Schuler, an assistant with the Golden State Warriors, 
said that to this day he has not been told the reason he was fired as head 
coach of the Trail Blazers last February. His replacement, Rick Adelman, has 
the Blazers off to a 12-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation at the time of the firing was that Schuler had lost control of the 
team, particularly All-Star guard Clyde Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler said last week, "I've had some of my old players look me right in the 
eye and tell me, 'Coach, you weren't the problem, and you couldn't have solved 
it.' 
</P>
<P>
"If I couldn't get along with the players, how come I won so many games in 
Portland and coach of the year (1986-87)? The things I was doing in Portland 
were good, solid and sound. And the team did not win when I left last season. 
I've proved I can win. I don't think I have to defend the job I did in 
Portland." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about disagreements with Drexler, Schuler said, "He's a hard player to 
coach. I won't say much more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Minor disturbance: After being fined $5,000 for threatening referee Mike 
Mathis, Philadelphia 76ers forward Charles Barkley said, "It was just a slight 
disagreement. Of course, when you shoot someone dead on the street, that's a 
disagreement, too." 
</P>
<P>
More Barkley: When the 76ers played the Boston Celtics recently in Hartford, 
Conn., Barkley was disturbed to find that the hamburger joint in teammate Rick 
Mahorn's old neighborhood featured a Mahorn Burger, Michal Adams burger and one 
even named after homebred welterweight champion Marlon Starling. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't got anything like that for me back home in Atlanta," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because they can't make a burger big enough," said Mahorn. 
</P>
<P>
Dive play: In the off-season, Houston Rockets Coach Don Chaney gets his kicks 
sky-diving. "I don't do it during the basketball season," he said. "I might be 
tempted not to push the button."

AUTOPSIES PLANNED ON TWO CHICAGO HARNESS HORSES

Autopsies are planned on two horses that died while running a harness race at 
Maywood Park, a track spokeswoman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary examinations indicate that Fredericton N. died of a heart attack 
and that a common condition called "choking down" (when the animal chokes on 
blood pumped from its heart into its lungs) killed the other pacer, Judge For 
Yourself, according to spokeswoman Eleanor Flavin. 
</P>
<P>
Both horses collapsed during the eighth race Monday night and were dead by the 
time track veterinary aides reached them. 
</P>
<P>
Fredericton N., a 7-1 shot, went down just past the quarter-mile pole during 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just past the turn for home, Judge for Yourself, off at 9-2, swerved off 
the track, crashed through a rail and died on the spectator apron. Driver Jim 
Knowlton, who fell from the sulky before it broke through the rail, was 
uninjured.

SUNDAY SILENCE TRULY HORSE OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the time of year when voters are traditionally pondering or debating 
their selections for the horse-of-the-year title or other Eclipse Awards. In 
1988 the choice between Alysheba and the undefeated filly Personal Ensign 
prompted deep soul-searching. In 1987 any discussion of the merits of Alysheba 
and Ferdinand could turn into a heated argument. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, for once, the thoroughbred season came to a climax at the 
Breeders' Cup that was as decisive as it was dramatic. There is no question 
about the identity of America's outstanding racehorse: Sunday Silence is 1989's 
horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He won this continent's two premier races, the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' 
Cup Classic. He earned more than $4 million. He scored three victories in four 
confrontations with Easy Goer, who had demolished the best runners in the East 
and looked virtually invincible when he was running against anybody but Sunday 
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, many occasions when one horse will beat another 
handicappers can argue convincingly that the loser was nevertheless the better 
horse. (That is the case in the voting for this year's Eclipse Award-winning 
sprinter, for example.) But even if Sunday Silence's winning margins were 
narrow, they were authoritative. He beat Easy Goer by a nose in the Preakness 
after a stretch drive that was a test of pure heart and determination. He won 
the Breeders' Cup because he had the ability to outaccelerate his arch rival at 
the critical stage of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other choices for the Eclipse Awards of 1989 are fairly clear-cut 
too. Where there is debate, it centers over the now-common question of how much 
weight should be placed on the outcome of a single event-the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two-Year-Old Colt: -- In this category, for example, Rhythm won the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile, but it was the only stakes victory of his career. 
Summer Squall won all five of his starts before being sidelined by an injury. 
Who is the champion? 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm is. Summer Squall never won beyond a sprint distance and his victories, 
although impressive, were not so awesome that anyone could proclaim he is 
definitively a better horse than Rhythm. Not only did Rhythm win the country's 
most important 2-year-old event, but he lost by only a neck in the second-most 
important, the Champagne Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two-Year-Old Filly: -- In a division in which nobody was outstanding, Go 
for Wand earned the title with her clear-cut Breeders' Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three-Year-Old Colt: -- Sunday Silence, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three-Year-Old Filly: -- Even though her form tailed off at the end of a 
long, hard campaign, Open Mind was one of the most admirable thoroughbred 
competitors of the year. Because of her come-from-far-behind style she 
frequently had to overcome adversity, but she nevertheless won eight stakes in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Older Male: -- Although the Breeders' Cup Classic will be remembered as a 
two-horse race between Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, Blushing John was only a 
length behind them at the finish, and his proximity to those great 3-year-olds 
was no fluke. He had defeated the strongest field of older horses assembled 
anywhere before the Breeders' Cup when he captured the Pimlico Special, and he 
beat top-class competition in California too. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Older Female: -- Bayakoa, with nine victories in 11 starts and a decisive 
Breeders' Cup victory, was a standout. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Male Turf Horse: -- In a dismal year for U.S. grass runners, Steinlen 
compiled a solid record, winning the Breeders' Cup Mile, the Arlington Million 
and four other stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Female Turf Horse: -- There wasn't a runner in this category who deserves 
to be called a champion; Brown Bess gets the title by default, on the basis of 
her victory in the Yellow Ribbon Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sprinter: -- The Breeders' Cup Sprint traditionally determines the 
champion, but this year's winner, Dancing Spree, does not deserve the Eclipse 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Spree sprinted nine times this year and won only three of them. He 
defeated top-class competition only once, in the Breeders' Cup, and that 
victory was largely a fluke. Half of the field was wiped out at the start, in a 
chain-reaction bumping incident, and Dancing Spree escaped the trouble. Then 
two brilliantly fast speedsters, Safely Kept and Olympic Prospect, waged a 
suicidal head-and-head battle, after which Dancing Spree rallied up the rail to 
win in a photo finish. 
</P>
<P>
The country's most talented sprinter may have been On the Line, but he didn't 
get a chance to prove it in the Breeders' Cup, where he suffered a 
career-ending injury. So Safely Kept deserves the title. She won eight straight 
stakes before the Breeders' Cup, and even though she was beating only fillies, 
she was running fast and she gets high marks for consistency. Then she 
outdueled the quickest sprinter in America, Olympic Prospect -- a horse who had 
never before been outrun for the lead -- before losing to Dancing Spree by a 
neck. In an otherwise cut-and-dried set of Eclipse Award categories, she is the 
only candidate who merits a vociferous argument on her behalf.

'I-VEE' KEEPS CHRISTMAS TREES FRESH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tree I-Vee is a newly developed, intravenous watering system to keep a 
Christmas tree fresh and moist for up to six weeks, says Harold Odom, its 
Houston inventor. 
</P>
<P>
The watering process eliminates the need for cumbersome stands; water for the 
tree is stored in a plastic jug -- a gallon milk jug or a two-liter soft drink 
bottle -- and travels through a filter, tube and flow plug into the tree's 
trunk. The tree can remain secured on a wooden stand. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tree I-Vee feeds water directly into the tree to compensate for lost root 
function," Odom explains. "As moisture evaporates from the needles, the tree 
literally sucks replacement water from the jug." 
</P>
<P>
Before marketing his device, Odom tested it on cut trees from a Texas farm and 
found that they stayed fresh for up to six weeks, he said, adding, "One tree 
drank 1 1/2 gallons in a day." 
</P>
<P>
Tree I-Vee is installed by drilling a 1/2-inch hole into the trunk; then 
inserting the flow plug to form an airtight, leak-proof seal. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which includes four replacement filters, costs $11.95, plus $3 for 
shipping and handling. To order, call Tree I-Vee Inc.'s 24-hour toll-free 
number (800) 562-3777. 
</P>
<P>
Cushion Protects Car From Dents 
</P>
<P>
Tired of having careless motorists put dents and nicks in your car doors when 
you park your vehicle in a lot? Consider the Dent Preventer -- sturdy foam 
cushions that strap to your car doors in a minute to provide protection. 
</P>
<P>
The Dent Preventer is two closed-cell, charcoal-colored foam pads, 37 inches 
wide, 11 inches high and an inch thick. The cushions attach to the doors with 
self-adjusting bungie cords that clip over the top and bottom of each door. 
</P>
<P>
The Dent Preventer, sold by Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories, costs $49.95 a 
pair, plus $4 for shipping and handling. To order, write BHMA, 200 S. Robertson 
Blvd., Beverly Hills, Calif. 90211. Outside California, call the firm's 
toll-free number, (800) 421-0911. If you live in California, Alaska or a 
outside the United States, call (213) 657-4800. 
</P>
<P>
Padded Packaging Saves Mail Items 
</P>
<P>
In limited parts of the country, 3M is introducing its Self-Inflating Cushion

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: SENSIBLE STEPS IN DISCIPLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How to discipline is a source of many family arguments. How much do you know 
about this important subject and how different styles affect children? 
</P>
<P>
Here's a chance to test your views with those of some experts. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTIONS: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- It's not important for parents to agree on styles of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Children should never know that a parent is angry with them because it 
erodes their self-esteem and their sense of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- There's no need for a parent to explain the reason for demanding certain 
behavior. A command in itself should be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Children raised by traditional-style authoritarian parents are more likely 
to abuse drugs and alcohol as adults than children raised in other homes. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Authoritarian and authoritative parents discipline in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Basically, permissive parents are probably the best parents in terms of 
how their children develop. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWERS: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- FALSE. Consistency in discipline is important, and if a child discovers he 
can get away with something with one parent, but not with the other, or if 
their styles of discipline are totally different, the youngster will be 
confused. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- FALSE. It's all right for children to know that a parent is angry. Anger 
is an acceptable part of love, but children need to learn constructive outlets 
for anger. Parents and children need to learn to talk about their feelings with 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- FALSE. Parents who use the do-it-because-I-say-so discipline are 
authoritarian and their children don't learn how to think, analyze or make 
decisions on their own. They become followers rather than leaders. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- FALSE. Studies conducted by Berkeley psychologist Diana Baumrind revealed 
that while children raised by authoritarian parents were immature, showed poor 
self-esteem and weren't motivated to do well in school, they had a relatively 
low level of alcohol and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- FALSE. Authoritative parents take the time to explain the reasons for 
following certain commands, unlike authoritarian parents. They set limits of 
behavior, but they consider the child's point of view when setting limits. 
Children of authoritative parents, unlike children of permissive or 
authoritarian parents, are outstandingly well-adjusted, mature, happy, 
motivated, independent and socially adept. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- FALSE. The 12-year longitudinal Berkeley study revealed that the children 
who were worse off were those raised by permissive parents. Like those reared 
by rigid authoritarian parents, they had low self-esteem.

Question: It is my understanding that some medications that are applied locally 
can have an effect on other parts of the body. From what I've been told, even 
something like eye drops can affect the entire body. I have been told to use a 
vaginal estrogen cream for reasons that are not important for my question. 
Since estrogen also is prescribed to prevent bone loss in menopausal women, 
would this vaginal estrogen cream do any good for that, or do I also have to 
take estrogen some other way? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If, as I assume, the vaginal estrogen cream was prescribed for the 
purpose of improving vaginal atrophy, the dose is probably insufficient to have 
any effect on the development of osteoporosis.

SCREEN STYLE: THE LATEST IN STREET SMART

The Show: "21 Jump Street" (Monday, 8 p.m., KTTV) 
</P>
<P>
The Set-Up: Undercover police officers posing as students infiltrate high 
schools and colleges to solve crimes. Teen heartthrob Johnny Depp (pictured) 
stars, with Peter DeLuise, Dustin Nyugen and Holly Robinson as other 
plainclothes officers. Steven Williams plays the foursome's captain. 
</P>
<P>
The Look: It runs the gamut from rough and raggy to GQ magazine chic, because 
the key players dress to blend with their ever-changing surroundings. One week 
Depp and company might hang with runaways, wearing tattered jeans and flannel 
shirts. The next, Depp could sport a layered look, complete with white Hanes 
T-shirt, fit for the fashion pages, as he joins a well-paid juvenile theft 
ring. Usually, costumer Emma Trenchard outfits the undercover foursome in urban 
street chic that walks on the wild side. Always, the correct earrings are as 
crucial for Depp (he wears several at a time, only in his left ear, and prefers 
small hoops) as they are for Robinson. (Long, dangling, ethnic styles are her 
favorite these days.) 
</P>
<P>
The Stores: Trenchard shops the boutiques and department stores in Vancouver, 
British Columbia for the hourlong drama shot on location there. Woodward's and 
The Bay (which Trenchard compares to Bullock's) are her best sources. In L.A., 
she combs Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
The Program: The stars need doubles of almost all their well-worn outfits. 
(It's rough out there). So, Trenchard buys two or more of many things and 
artificially "ages" them. Her costume assistants do the dirty work, hanging out 
in the laundry room washing, tearing and dying new blue jeans, T-shirts and 
denim jackets until they look tattered. Trenchard does patronize thrift shops 
for unusual shirts, but only when doubles aren't needed. 
</P>
<P>
The Payoff: Outfitting the show's characters in average-Joe costumes, 
satisfying the actors' personal taste at the same time, is a tall order. 
Trenchard says Nyugen, for example, would rather wear high fashion sportswear. 
But even he gets the jeans and T-shirts treatment that is the soul of this 
show. Trenchard believes versions of the look are right for all these street 
smart types. "There aren't any pretty boys or pretty girls," Trenchard says of 
the cast. Except, of course, for lady-killer Depp. CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS

CRITIC AT LARGE: MUSIC CENTER CELEBRATES ITS SILVER ANNIVERSARY; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: SOME FEARED THE COMPLEX WOULD DEPLETE FUNDS AND AUDIENCES. INSTEAD, IT 
HAS SPURRED GROWTH IN THE ARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, it is hard to realize that the dawning of the Music 
Center was not anticipated with unalloyed delight. 
</P>
<P>
The colossus on Bunker Hill would, some worriers said, act like a great 
cultural sponge, sopping up all the audiences, art funds and creativity in 
Greater Los Angeles. Such existing theater as there was, notably James A. 
Doolittle's valiant efforts at the Huntington Hartford in Hollywood, would be 
imperiled by the opening of not one or two but three new venues at the Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
But it became clear very quickly, and is even clearer now from the perspective 
of a quarter-century, that the worriers need not have worried. The belief, in 
merchandising, that the best place to open a supermarket is across the street 
from an existing supermarket, proved to be relevant to the Music Center 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably in the area of theater, the Music Center has functioned as 
stimulus and catalyst. It has demonstrably enlarged rather than diminished or 
merely relocated the amount of theater in the community. Significantly, the 
Music Center defined the existing of a sizable, loyal and thirsty audience for 
the stage, not only for the star-lit productions at the Ahmanson but for the 
hard-edged, controversial and innovative works presented under the guiding hand 
of Gordon Davidson at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Theater in Los Angeles and elsewhere had been victimized, like the movies, by 
the arrival of television. The local theater diet was richer in the '20s and 
'30s (although many of the offerings were imported). By the late '50s, there 
was hardly enough local theater to constitute a steady item in the local 
cultural menu. 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of other theater spaces as large and glossy as the Shubert in 
Century City and as tight as the Powerhouse Theatre in Santa Monica can be 
traced spiritually though not literally to what might be called the sense of 
the possible symbolized by the success of the Taper and the Ahmanson. The 
success of the complex as a whole undoubtedly spurred as well the major efforts 
that led more recently to the creation of the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
There is an interesting connection between the role of the Music Center and the 
role of professional sports in defining Los Angeles as a place. 
</P>
<P>
The old joke about Los Angeles being 60 suburbs in search of a city had some 
hard truth in it (there were actually more than 60 suburbs, but 60 preserved 
the alliteration). Los Angeles was historically the most decentralized 
metropolis in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The sense that Los Angeles was one major metropolis grew stronger with the 
population explosion, the westward shift, that began during World War II. The 
first freeways could be seen as symbolic, uniting sinews. But it was the 
professional sports teams, the Dodgers, the Lakers, the Rams and ultimately the 
Angels, the Raiders, the Kings and the Clippers that really confirmed what 
could be called the centrality of Los Angeles. (Granted the Angels are now 
claimed by Anaheim and the Raiders appear to have no fixed address; no image is 
perfect.) 
</P>
<P>
In much the same way, the opening of the Music Center gave the metropolitan Los 
Angeles area a sense of its cultural cohesion. The city had never been quite so 
artistically arid as its (non-resident) critics made it out to be. But, like 
almost everything else about the region, the pleasures were so diffused that 
only the persistent could locate them and tot them up. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a permanent home of its own for the Los Angeles Philharmonic was 
the founding impulse for the whole Music Center complex. And the orchestra's 
new base in the Pavilion and the excitement attending its new young conductor, 
Zubin Mehta, combined to revitalize the Philharmonic and ultimately to upgrade 
its international ranking. 
</P>
<P>
It has not all been easy or triumphant. The Civic Light Opera, another of the 
founding groups of the Music Center, has suffered from two problems: the aging 
of its most loyal followers and a decline in the amount of new work being done 
in the kind of lavishly mounted mainstream musical theater with which the CLO 
clientele are happiest. 
</P>
<P>
The Ahmanson Theatre has proved an awkward, in-between size -- too large to 
work well for straight plays that demand a degree of intimacy between cast and 
audience, too small for the high-budget musicals that demand either more seats 
or longer runs than were original possible. But the formula of recruiting such 
national and international stars as Charlton Heston in popular vehicles helped 
the Ahmanson over its roughest passages. And it now looks to be housing 
"Phantom of the Opera" through the turn of the century (or at least for the 
foreseeable future). 
</P>
<P>
It has taken most of a quarter-century (marked by transient hopes and 
disappointments) to establish opera and ballet on more than a tour-stop basis. 
But the bi-coastal Joffrey Ballet and the ambitious, adventurous new Music 
Center Opera prove that a great deal of patience is its own reward. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center was part of an explosion of city centers for the performing 
arts that has characterized the postwar period in the United States (the famous 
edifice complex). Elsewhere there were casualties when recessions reduced 
public and corporate support for the arts. At the Music Center it was made 
clear from the start that building the structures was only Step 1; providing 
sustained support for the arts organizations within the center was a crucial 
Step 2. 
</P>
<P>
From Mrs. Dorothy B. Chandler's founding efforts at finding the start-up money 
(cheerful arm-twistings that cut across geographic and ethnic lines and 
affirmed early-on the wide metropolitan basis of the undertaking), the Music 
Center has been nothing if not a super-efficient and ongoing fund-raising 
organization, with a variety of support groups that leave nothing to chance. 
The arm-twisting, firm but cheerful, never stops. 
</P>
<P>
The subtler problem, identified early in the life of the Music Center, was how 
to minimize its image as an elitist institution bringing the high arts to the 
high-born, high-income faithful. Those marble columns and marble steps did look 
formidable, and even with a patina of age on them they are still not your 
neighborhood cinemas. 
</P>
<P>
But the Center Theatre Group started a school outreach program at the 
beginning, sending such actors as Roscoe Lee Browne to read poetry at high 
schools and colleges, and having improvisational game-players entertain 
elementary school kids. 
</P>
<P>
Student tickets and special invitational performances have done a good deal to 
make the marble columns seem less formidable and the theaters more accessible, 
without diminishing the magic of what goes on inside. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Arts Festival in 1984 is generally thought of marking the cultural 
coming of age of Los Angeles, when the world at large could no longer ignore or 
fail to see the greening of what it had thought was a cultural desert. But the 
coming of age in fact was an accelerating process that began in the heady days 
of early postwar. And insofar as there was a watershed date between the Los 
Angeles that had been and the Los Angeles that was to be, it was 25 years ago 
today, when the new place on Bunker Hill lit up the sky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the first of the Music Center's three buildings 
atop Bunker Hill, opened 25 years ago today. The Mark Taper Forum opened April 
9, 1967, and the Ahmanson Theatre three days later. Cost of the complex on 
Grand Avenue, between First and Temple, was $43 million.

ANIMATED ARTWORKS FETCH $320,000: NO RECORDS; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION: BURBANK SALE CONTINUES TREND TOWARD STABILIZATION OF PRICES SET IN NEW 
YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Prices remained high but failed to break records Monday night at the first 
public auction of artwork from animated films held in Southern California in 
over a decade. More than 400 people crowded into a conference room at the 
Burbank Hilton to bid on cels, backgrounds, drawings and preliminary artwork, 
nearly all of it from Disney cartoon features and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 235 lots offered by animation art dealer Howard Lowery, 233 found 
buyers, for a sale total of more than $320,000. The sale continued the trend 
toward steady, modest prices set at Christie's East in New York last month, and 
suggests that the market for animation art is stabilizing after several years 
of skyrocketing prices. 
</P>
<P>
A cel and background of Captain Hook, Mr. Smee and Peter Pan aboard the 
Captain's pirate ship from Walt Disney's 1953 feature went to an unidentified 
telephone buyer for $22,550, the highest price in the sale. The same collector 
spent over $62,000, paying $23,100 for cel and background set-ups of Br'er 
Rabbit from "Song of the South" (1946) and the Seven Dwarfs from "Snow White 
and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937), plus an additional $14,600 for two preliminary 
paintings for "Snow White" and the Oscar-winning short "The Old Mill" (1937). 
</P>
<P>
The sale did not offer any of the black-and-white cel and background set-ups 
from early Mickey Mouse shorts that command six-figure prices. (A set-up from 
"The Orphan's Benefit" brought a record-breaking $286,000 at Christie's in 
May.) Most of the cels and drawings offered Monday night sold in the $500 to 
$1,500 range. 
</P>
<P>
"When prices go past the $2,000 mark, a large sector of market gets cut out," 
said Lowery. "Many members of the Baby Boom generation can afford to spend 
between $800 and $1,200 for something, but when the price goes over $2,000, it 
becomes more of a major decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The pieces that sell for $10,000 or more generally go either to someone who 
has devoted himself to creating a definitive collection and is willing to pull 
out all the stops, or to someone who intends to resell it. Dealers buy a lot of 
their stock at auctions." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of animation artwork continue in Southern California tonight and Thursday 
in a telephone auction held by the firm Another Movement.

MORNING REPORT: NBC WINS AGAIN; ERRATIC SHOWING FOR 'JILLIAN'

For the 10th time in the 11-week-old 1989-90 TV season, NBC won the ratings 
race last week. Its prime-time schedule averaged an audience of 13.8 million 
homes, compared to 12.2 million for ABC and 10.7 million for CBS. The full list 
of prime-time ratings is on Page 8. 
</P>
<P>
* You can lead viewers to a new show, but you can't make them like it. When NBC 
introduced "Ann Jillian" behind the top-rated "Cosby Show" last Thursday, 
viewers in more than 23 million homes watched. But when the sitcom moved to its 
regular time slot three days later, only about 9.8 million homes were tuned in. 
NBC said that was better than what the network had been doing in the time 
period previously, and the show outdrew ABC's programming. But it was far below 
the audience for Angela Lansbury in CBS' "Murder, She Wrote" -- 18.2 million 
households. Lansbury also won the ratings battle from 9 to 11 p.m. on Sunday as 
her movie on ABC, "The Shell Seekers," attracted 24% of the viewers to top 
NBC's "True Blue" and CBS' "No Place Like Home."

ABC AXES 2; CBS RE-SIGNS LANSBURY 
</P>

ABC removed the three lowest-rated shows on prime-time network televison 
Tuesday, canceling newcomers "Homeroom" and "Living Dolls" and placing the 
veteran "Mr. Belvedere" on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, meanwhile, was happy to announce that Angela Lansbury had agreed to return 
for a seventh season of "Murder, She Wrote" next year. As the star of the CBS 
entertainment division's only Top 20 show, Lansbury commanded another lucrative 
resigning deal similar to last year's haul. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "Homeroom," which this season ranks 81st of the 84 shows on the Big Three 
networks, was dropped from its Sunday 8:30 p.m. slot and will have its last 
telecast Dec. 17. "Living Dolls," dead last in 84th place, will make its final 
appearance Dec. 30. "Mr. Belvedere," tied at 82nd, will go on hiatus after its 
Dec. 30 broadcast but will return later in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Added to the ABC lineup is the "Father Dowling Mysteries," which appeared as a 
replacement series on NBC last season. The hour drama, starring Tom Bosley as a 
crime-fighting Chicago priest, will air in the Thursday 8 p.m. suicide slot 
opposite NBC's top-rated "Cosby Show." "Mission: Impossible," which airs in 
that time period now, will move to Saturdays at 8 p.m. starting Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which ran as an ABC special on Nov. 26 and 
pulled a strong 25% share of the viewing audience, will premiere as a series 
Sunday, Jan. 14, at 8 p.m. "Free Spirit," currently seen at 8 p.m. Sunday, will 
slide back to the 8:30 p.m. slot. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, in its deal to keep Lansbury for another season, has committed to buying a 
series from her company, Corymore Production, Inc. The series, slated for the 
1990-91 season, would not star Lansbury. Last year CBS committed to buying a 
comedy series, in which she would star, as soon as "Murder" ceases production. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also has agreed, through various deals, to buy several movies from 
Lansbury's company. 
</P>

Photo, TV COMINGS, GOINGS: Third-ranked CBS has some good news to report: It 
has signed Angela Lansbury, above, to return next season in its highest-rated 
entertainment program, "Murder, She Wrote." ABC, on the other hand, posted 
cancellation notices for two low-rated comedies, "Homeroom" and "Living Dolls."

Peace talks between rebels and the Sudanese government collapsed in 
disagreement over the country's Islamic legal code and other issues that have 
kept them at war for nearly seven years. "In my opinion, neither side came to 
Nairobi (Kenya) prepared to take the difficult steps necessary for peace," said 
former President Jimmy Carter, who acted as an unofficial mediator in the five 
days of talks. Both Carter and the Sudan People's Liberation Army said the 
talks failed, but the government said they were merely postponed.

Hazleton Research Products, a Reston, Va., research laboratory where monkeys 
were found to be infected with a rare and deadly virus, said that precautionary 
testing found all of its employees to be free of the disease. The company sent 
workers' blood samples to the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta 
for analysis after one man who handled monkeys infected with the Ebola virus 
became ill and was placed in isolation at Fairfax Hospital. The disease, which 
has an incubation period of two to 21 days, causes internal and external 
bleeding and organ failure and has a 50% to 90% mortality rate.

The Navy announced in Washington it has complied with orders by Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney and terminated all production contracts for the 
controversial V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft program for the Marines. Cheney 
and Congress were at odds this year over Cheney's decision to kill the 
$27-billion program for the revolutionary aircraft, which takes off and lands 
like a helicopter and flies like a plane. Congress eventually agreed to fund 
only research and development and not production, and Cheney ordered the 
production contracts terminated.

First Lady Barbara Bush urged shopping malls not to bar holiday Salvation Army 
solicitors, as she dropped $10 into the kettle at a Washington, D.C., mall 
where she was Christmas shopping. Mrs. Bush cited the group's work to help the 
needy and victims of natural disasters and said: "It just wouldn't be Christmas 
without that bell ringing." A comparatively high number of Washington malls are 
excluding the annual solicitation on the grounds that they do not allow any 
other groups to solicit. A Salvation Army officer said that the bans will cost 
the group about $100,000 this year.

A lawsuit filed in Sacramento Superior Court seeks to halt the decommissioning 
of the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant until effects of the shutdown on the 
environment are determined. The suit contends that closing the plant will 
worsen air pollution in the Central Valley because of the need for gas-fired 
plants and other sources to replace Rancho Seco's power generation. The suit 
was filed on behalf of UC Davis radiobiology professor Marvin Goldman, Daniel 
St. Croix, a nuclear licensing consultant, and David Freeman, a nuclear physics 
student at Davis. Closing the plant, the suit said, "will cause significant 
incremental emissions of carbon dioxide, other gases and particulate matter, 
all of which are injurious to health, and which will accelerate the 'greenhouse 
effect,' lead to 'acid rain' and may have other serious adverse environmental 
effects." Meanwhile, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District will continue to 
decommission the plant as required by a ratepayers' vote last June to close the 
facility.

MINORITY FIRM ASKS TO BUY 51% STAKE IN AILING FAMILY S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A minority-owned Washington investment firm is seeking regulatory approval to 
buy the 51% stake in Family Savings &amp; Loan now held by Oliver A. Trigg Jr., 
a controversial Los Angeles businessman ousted as the thrift's chairman last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the transaction would help improve the Los Angeles-based S&amp;L's 
weak financial condition and keep one of the nation's largest black-owned 
thrifts under minority ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The details of the proposed transaction weren't disclosed, but persons familiar 
with the deal said Opportunity Funding is expected to pay just under $1 million 
for Trigg's shares. Trigg paid $1.2 million for the stock two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunity Funding is a small venture capital firm with investments in 
black-owned cable television stations and a North Carolina industrial park. C. 
Robert Kemp, president of Opportunity Funding and a former director of Safeway 
Stores, declined comment on his plans for Family Savings until federal thrift 
regulators completed their review. 
</P>
<P>
But Family Savings Chairman William Shearer said Opportunity Funding has an 
ambitious plan to develop a financial services network around Family, based in 
Los Angeles' Crenshaw District. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale is approved, Opportunity is expected to inject an undetermined 
amount of money into Family Savings to improve its weak financial condition. 
Family falls below new federal capital standards that are used to measure a 
thrift's health. 
</P>
<P>
Trigg, a real estate executive who joined Family's board in 1986, was ordered 
to sell his shares after a lengthy federal investigation into possible fraud at 
the thrift. The secret investigation was prompted by an October, 1987, Times 
story that said a company formed by Trigg sold land to Family Savings for a 
large profit. 
</P>
<P>
Trigg denied that he made money on the land deal, which involved a residential 
tract in Whittier's exclusive Friendly Hills development. But in a suit filed 
against Trigg earlier this year, Family Savings claimed that Trigg used profits 
from the land deal to buy his Family Savings stock. 
</P>
<P>
Family Savings put the land up for sale but has never recovered its $5-million 
investment. Under the terms of Trigg's confidential agreement with federal 
thrift regulators, any money he receives from the sale of his stock must revert 
to Family Savings to make up for its losses on the Whittier land. 
</P>
<P>
Trigg's lawyer, Arthur Barens, said his client is unaware of the pending stock 
sale, which was negotiated by UCLA law professor Reginald Alleyne, the 
government-appointed trustee. "No one has given us official notice," said 
Barens. "I don't see how they can proceed with the sale without giving us 
notification." 
</P>
<P>
Alleyne declined comment.

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY RISES OUTSIDE L.A., ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to falling housing prices, the ability of prospective home buyers to 
afford a home in California is improving again. Housing affordability in 
October rose for the third consecutive month as buyers continued to shift away 
from homes in pricey urban areas toward more affordable outlying communities, 
the California Assn. of Realtors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, 19% of families could afford to buy the median priced home, which 
sold for $193,557 in October, compared to 18% in September and 17% in August, 
the realtors group said. A year ago, 21% of California households could afford 
the median priced home. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers found little relief in fast-growing urban areas such as Los Angeles and 
Orange County, however. The median price of a Los Angeles home rose slightly in 
October to $222,842 from $221,954, while the median Orange County price rose to 
$253,034 from $250,885. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming a 20% down payment, Angelenos would have to earn $73,675 annually to 
buy a home, and Orange County residents would need to earn $83,657. Although 
these qualifying incomes were also up slightly from month-ago levels, the 
affordability rate remained constant at 14% in both counties, the real estate 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
However, realtors said the Los Angeles and Orange County figures do not reflect 
a steep slowdown in salability of high-priced homes. 
</P>
<P>
"In price ranges of $250,000 and above, there has been a real slippage of 10% 
to 12% from where prices were in March or April of this year," said Chuck Lamb, 
senior partner at the Century 21-Lamb Group in Northridge. "The balloon just 
burst." 
</P>
<P>
There is a lag between the time that the real estate market ebbs and when 
housing prices begin to show a decline because sellers are reluctant to lower 
prices, according to real estate experts. 
</P>
<P>
"Sellers' expectations tend to lag the market by three to six months," said 
Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics for the 
California Assn. of Realtors. "If people want to move and have to move, they 
have to price realistically to the current market. But because a significant 
number of people who sell don't have to move, they just take their houses off 
the market when they don't get their price. That makes prices real sticky on 
the way down." 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest factor in the rising affordability rates is the trend to buy in 
outlying areas, real estate experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"A huge amount of the population will be housed farther and farther out of the 
city," said Jim Wilson, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
"That will make it look like the average price is falling, while the prices 
will actually be flat in many areas." 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson still expects housing prices to drop another 5% to 10% on average 
during 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors and analysts are still divided on whether the rising affordability 
will spur a rebound in the currently lackluster housing market, however. Sales 
volume is down steeply from year-ago levels, realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb believes that the market will improve in January, the traditional end of 
seasonal slowdowns. But Appleton-Young said that will depend on what happens 
with the overall economy.

JAMES FLANIGAN: IBM PAINED BY INDUSTRY'S SPEEDY GNATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What must IBM do? That's one of the most interesting and important questions in 
U.S. business today. 
</P>
<P>
But few felt they got much of an answer Tuesday when the giant computer company 
said it would cut its U.S. work force by 10,000 and repurchase up to $4 billion 
worth of its stock in an attempt to improve its competitiveness and increase 
shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction was swift and confused from a chorus of computer analysts and 
consultants. Some said IBM hadn't gone far enough to cut its work force, while 
others said it hadn't done enough to give power to its people in the field. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction in the stock market -- where IBM is held by more shareholders than 
any other issue -- was lukewarm. For all the drama of the restructuring 
announcement by IBM Chairman John F. Akers and Chief Financial Officer Frank A. 
Metz to a hastily called morning meeting with security analysts, IBM stock rose 
only 37.50 cents a share to $99.625. Before the stock market's crash in 
October, 1987, IBM sold for more than $170 a share. The total value of all its 
shares is now roughly $45 billion below that pre-crash figure. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion was understandable, because IBM's problems are complex. The 
company faces the dual challenge of how it copes with a changed industry and 
its own immense, $60-billion (sales) size and structure, which isn't always an 
asset in today's world. 
</P>
<P>
A good part of IBM's business today is affected by the shift of computing power 
to desktop computers -- small machines that can do jobs of data processing that 
it once took rooms full of big computers to do. Technically, IBM is no slouch 
in small machines -- its personal computers and workstations lead the 
$35-billion desktop market. 
</P>
<P>
Rather the problem appears to be with speed and responsiveness -- how fast a 
large worldwide company can react when the competition is often from companies 
like Dell Computer Co., a 5-year-old firm founded by a 24-year-old that sells 
computers by mail order and takes sales away from IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny Dell, and companies like Compaq Computer and Sun Microsystems, can compete 
with IBM because the power in computers these days comes from complex chips, 
called microprocessors, that are developed not by IBM but by companies such as 
Intel and Motorola who sell them to all comers. Thus virtually anybody with a 
knowledge of computers can put together a package of the latest microprocessor 
and a few additional features and compete with the giants. They can compete 
successfully, moreover, because the small firm's costs are almost certain to be 
lower than those of the big company, which carries generous health and pension 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Once before, in the early 1980s, IBM reacted to such a challenge. Confronted by 
Apple Computer's introduction of personal computers, IBM set up a separate 
operation to get it into the PC business fast. The PC was a great success and 
IBM was praised for being nimble. 
</P>
<P>
But things are not so easy today. When IBM brought out the PC, customers still 
relied on IBM to deliver the computer power they needed. But now big and small 
companies mix and match computer hardware, thinking nothing of transferring 
data from a big IBM mainframe to desktop workstations from a variety of 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
IBM realizes this. "A computer today is nothing more than a package of the 
latest technology," said IBM President Jack D. Kuehler in a recent interview. 
Therefore if the company is not on the market with the latest chips and 
software, at the lowest price, it's not going to get the business no matter 
what its name or traditions. 
</P>
<P>
So to adapt to this new cruel world, IBM began on Tuesday to slim down -- 
cutting its work force through early retirements and hiring curtailments. And 
Chairman Akers indicated that this may not be the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
But cutting costs may not be the whole answer. IBM has strengths no other 
company possesses. Its technical abilities are enormous, and its worldwide 
breadth and depth is an undoubted asset. 
</P>
<P>
What must IBM do? Simply put, the company must find a way to take advantage of 
its size while coping with an industry where market power is fragmenting as 
technology changes. In all likelihood, many experts said Tuesday, the solution 
will involve IBM decentralizing its operations, sending power out to the field. 
"IBM needs to reduce headquarters staff and transfer authority to the field," 
said Michael Maples, a former IBMer who is now a vice president at the software 
company Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it's an immense and important challenge -- not just for IBM and its 
employees. A lot of U.S. industrial leadership rides on its abilities, as do 
the savings of hundreds of thousands of IBM shareowners. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM is fundamentally a strong company, with vast technological expertise," 
said Andrew Heller, who was a vice president with IBM in Austin, Tex. "But it 
will take time for the company to work out its problems," which appear to be 
more human than technical.

Program Trading Activity Down Sharply: Program trading activity dropped sharply 
in the first two weeks of November after an outcry over the controversial 
strategy, which has been blamed for increasing market volatility, the New York 
Stock Exchange reported. A steep decline in index arbitrage, the main form of 
computerized program trading, reflected an exodus by large brokerages after the 
strategy was blamed by some for worsening a stock market drop on Oct. 13. Index 
arbitrage accounted for 38.7% of program trades from Nov. 6-10 and 25.7% from 
Nov. 13-17, down from 53.8% in October, the NYSE said.

Investors Warm to WPPSS Bonds: Apparently unconcerned over the spectacular 1983 
bond default by the Washington Public Power Supply System, investors snapped up 
the new WPPSS refunding bond issue. Underwriters had set a preliminary pricing 
of $738 million for WPPSS projects one and three refunding bonds, but the issue 
was oversubscribed. The strong demand is expected to increase the size of the 
issue to about $835 million to $840 million and to decrease yields, officials 
said.

Detroit Papers Increase Prices: The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press 
will increase their single-copy price to 25 cents from 15 cents and 20 cents 
respectively on Saturday. The increases had been anticipated since the 
beginning of a partial merger of the papers Nov. 27. Advertisers also will 
begin paying more soon because of the joint operating agreement, under which 
all non-editorial functions of the papers were merged under the Detroit 
Newspaper Agency. The combined Sunday edition of the newspaper will go from 75 
cents a copy to $1 effective Sunday.

CHEVRON ASKS ITS BANKS NOT TO LOAN TO RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVERS: THE ENERGY COMPANY IS QUIETLY TAKING STEPS TO DEAL WITH A POSSIBLE 
HOSTILE BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chevron Corp., which has been the subject of takeover rumors for weeks, has 
asked its banks not to lend money to potential raiders, the latest move in what 
is emerging as a sub rosa anti-takeover strategy. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its attempt to arrange a $5-billion revolving credit line, San 
Francisco-based Chevron is seeking assurances that its banks will not lend to 
outsiders buying up Chevron shares, according to sources close to the bank 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron spokesman Larry Shushan declined to comment, as did officials of many 
of Chevron's banks. 
</P>
<P>
The energy company has steadfastly refused to discuss rumors that it is the 
target of a takeover or forced restructuring by Pennzoil Co. or other 
companies, but such speculation has driven Chevron's stock to new highs in 
weeks of heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its unwillingness to discuss possible takeover threats, the company has 
taken steps to deal with them. Last week, Chevron announced the creation of a 
$1-billion employee stock ownership plan that would raise the percentage of 
shares in employee hands to 16% from 11%, which, under Delaware law, would 
allow them to block a takeover. Chevron is incorporated in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a banker for one of Chevron's foreign-based lenders called 
Chevron's request for assurances "highly unusual" but said in an interview that 
many of the energy company's lenders would probably agree to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe not some of the American money center banks, but certainly the European 
and Asian banks probably will," added the banker, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The banker said the request is still under negotiation. Chevron is trying to 
line up the $5-billion line of credit for "general corporate purposes," which 
would include financing a war chest against raiders, the banker said. Chevron 
has business relationships with about 30 banks. 
</P>
<P>
The trade journal American Banker reported that banks expected to take part in 
the credit line include the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, Bank of Nova Scotia 
and Royal Bank of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Chevron's anti-takeover moves, many analysts and investors continue to 
discount the possibility of a serious bid for the massive oil company, a bid 
that could cost as much as $35 billion. Despite weeks of rumors, no sizable new 
investor has emerged.

Regulators Seize Brookside Savings: Federal regulators have taken over 
Brookside Savings &amp; Loan, a four-branch thrift in Los Angeles that got into 
trouble because of problems with real estate loans and property owned in 
Arizona, Texas and Nevada. The savings and loan will operate under normal 
business hours, with the federal Resolution Trust Corp. as receiver. The 
thrift, declared insolvent by the Office of Thrift Supervision, has $629.9 
million in assets and $574.4 million in deposits.

LOOKING AHEAD / DATAQUEST: JAPAN MAY USE PATENT AWARD TO MODIFY LAWS

The recent awarding to Texas Instruments of a Japanese patent for the basic 
integrated circuit could certainly help remove some of the trade friction 
between the United States and Japan. More significantly, it presents an 
opportunity for Japan to modify its patent laws in ways that could blunt South 
Korea's future advance in the Japanese semiconductor market. 
</P>
<P>
The seeming breadth of this award is comparable to saying that Texas 
Instruments has a patent on all cars built in Japan that have four wheels, an 
internal combustion engine and a steering column. 
</P>
<P>
New Japanese patent laws could require royalties from South Korean suppliers on 
virtually all integrated circuits that they might ship to Japan. 
</P>

High-Tech Trend in Defense 
</P>
<P>
This year's defense spending bill demonstrates a clear trend developing on 
Capitol Hill to maintain, exploit and expand America's technological 
competitive edge using Pentagon management and funding. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fiscal 1990 defense budget represents the fifth-straight annual 
decline in defense spending after adjustment for inflation, Congress did 
preserve or increase spending on several strategic high-technology programs. 
This has set up a showdown with the Bush Administration, which has proposed 
cutting 1991 funding on many of those same programs. 
</P>
<P>
Another development favoring high tech in this year's spending bill are several 
initiatives designed to increase the Pentagon's use of commercial products and 
to have the Pentagon adopt more commercial-like contracting and pricing 
procedures. With defense spending projected to decline in inflation-adjusted 
terms, these commercial initiatives are designed to help the Pentagon save 
money while taking advantage of quality improvements of mainstream, commercial 
products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Cool to Soviet PC Sales 
</P>
<P>
Despite two recent developments that should make it easier for Western computer 
companies to conduct business in the Soviet Union, many firms are still 
reluctant to seize the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the U.S. Commerce Department relaxed controls for exporting 
personal computers to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign 
Relations decided to allow majority ownership of joint ventures by foreign 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of U.S. computer executives found three major concerns about 
conducting business in the Soviet Union: the difficulty in taking earnings out 
of the country, current and potential export controls on more sophisticated 
technology (such as supercomputers) and the general political risks of 
investment in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union lags far behind the United States in personal computers, with 
fewer than 200,000 PCs, compared to 38 million in the United States. The 
tremendous demand for PCs has caused the Soviets to relax their rules and look 
outside their country for possible business partners. The lack of Soviet PC 
technology presents a huge opportunity for sales of personal computers there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interactive Tech Put to Use 
</P>
<P>
Computers that provide sight, sound and touch information to produce simulated 
versions of realistic environments are rapidly developing into mainstream 
business tools for use in space and seismic explorations, medicine, 
entertainment, manufacturing and other industries. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneered by scientists at NASA's Ames Research Laboratory just five years ago, 
so-called virtual reality is being developed by more than a dozen companies, 
along with NASA, the Air Force and academic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
A virtual reality system consists of a headset with two small television 
screens, one for each eye and stereo headphones for sound. 
</P>
<P>
A glove equipped with sensors is used in place of a computer keyboard or mouse 
to manipulate objects in this computer-generated world. Working with the 
headset and gloves, which are connected to a computer, the user interacts with 
a three-dimensional environment. For example, with the gloved hand, the user 
can grasp objects and pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
The application potential of this technology merits the serious attention of 
the business world and investors. 
</P>
<P>
Wright Patterson Air Force Base sponsored the development of a flight simulator 
that allows pilots to see their airplanes and enemies through the eyes of a 
third party above the action. Objects in Mattel's Nintendo can now be 
manipulated with a glove similar to that used in virtual reality. 
</P>
<P>
Architects will be able to walk through a building before construction begins 
to test the design. Finally, in education, a medical student can practice 
surgery on a simulated heart.

BEVERLY HILLS LOAN BROKER CONVICTED IN S&amp;L FAILURE

Albert Yarbrow, a Beverly Hills-based loan broker, was convicted on eight 
counts of conspiracy, wire and mail fraud and other charges, all stemming from 
his role in the largest financial institution failure in Oregon history. 
</P>
<P>
Yarbrow was the last of four defendants to be tried for their roles in the 1985 
collapse of State Federal Savings and Loan Assn. of Corvalis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
"The conduct of these people caused the failure of State Federal," said Lance 
Caldwell, a Portland-based U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators have previously estimated that State Federal, which had $550 million 
in assets when it failed, will cost the thrift industry's insurance fund $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the thrift's problems stemmed from a series of loans made to Thomas 
Edward Nevis, a real estate developer introduced to the thrift by Yarbrow, 
according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Yarbrow, who collected fees on the loans State Federal made to Nevis, acted as 
a "straw borrower," applying for a $12.2-million loan on Nevis' behalf, 
according to the indictment. This fraudulent process allowed Nevis to fool 
savings and loan regulators, who would not allow thrifts to lend more than a 
specific amount to any one borrower. 
</P>
<P>
Yarbrow escaped liability to repay the loan by creating a dummy corporation 
called Roswell Properties Inc., "which would have no assets and no purpose 
other than to be a nominee for Nevis on the Roswell loan," according to the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yarbrow collected a $200,000 fee for his role in getting Nevis the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
Yarbrow was also charged and convicted of mail fraud because of a deal he made 
with State Federal officers to conceal another loan brokerage fee. (Yarbrow 
collected nearly $900,000 in loan fees from State Federal over a two-year 
period, according to federal investigators.) 
</P>
<P>
In this case, State Federal agreed to give Yarbrow an $88,000 Rolls-Royce in 
lieu of a fee, but Yarbrow convinced the thrift to send him a letter calling 
the payment a gift in order to avoid California income tax liability and 
Department of Motor Vehicle fees. 
</P>
<P>
Yarbrow's attorney, Howard Gillingham, refused to comment about the case. 
Yarbrow could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Yarbrow, whose conviction came last Friday in U.S. District Court in Portland, 
will be sentenced in early January, according to Caldwell.

 Managing Travel: As travel costs continue to escalate, more companies are 
hiring travel managers, up from less than 10% in 1982 to 30% in 1988. These 
managers work with travel agencies to guarantee the best bargains in lodging 
and transportation. The big hotels and major car rental agencies are open to 
volume discount negotiation, and the airlines, while not admitting it openly, 
will also "work with" companies for lower fares. Midway Airlines, in a bold 
departure from implicit policy, announced publicly in July that it will 
provide, in its words, "long-term packages with discounts based on travel 
volume." Now that the cards are on the table, and as prices continue to rise, 
more companies are likely to get into the game by hiring their own travel 
managers, and then the airlines really will have to deal. (Tampa (Fla.) 
Tribune)

Circuit City Expands: In the midst of an industrywide slowdown, Circuit City is 
expanding rapidly in the Philadelphia area. The area's first four stores opened 
in November, and another four are scheduled to open within a year. The retailer 
of electronic items hopes eventually to have 15 stores in the Northeast, from 
Philadelphia to Atlantic City, where company insiders expect Circuit City to 
gain 15% to 20% of the market. Despite existing chain competition, Circuit City 
looks to its wide selection, knowledgeable sales force and slick presentation 
to help establish the chain in the Northeast. (Philadelphia Inquirer)

Encyclopedia on a Cassette: Franklin Computer Corp., the company that gave us 
the electronic Bible and other hand-held, computerized reference works, has 
plans for a new video tome. It has acquired the rights to the Concise Columbia 
Encyclopedia, a single-volume work, which it expects to produce electronically 
as the first of its kind. Marketing of the new reference work will follow 
tried-and-true channels -- mail order, specialty department stores and college 
bookstores. No date has yet been set for its debut. (Newark (N.J.) Star Ledger)

Trend Toward Premium Liquor: Looking for a holiday gift for the person who has 
everything? Brown-Forman is hoping you'll turn to its bottled libations, 
particularly its pricier premium liquors such as Gentleman Jack, for the 
answer. Retailing at about $20 a bottle, the premium whiskey is targeted at 25- 
to 45-year-olds and those who invest some ego in their liquor purchases. 
Brown-Forman is counting on status-seeking consumers to pull this beverage out 
to impress friends with the taste as well as the price. The company hopes that 
the trend toward premium liquors will continue to pick up steam as exports grow 
and as aging baby boomers pick up dad's drink of choice, as long as it's a 
choice drink. (New Orleans Times-Picayune)

The Pizza Push: In their race to catch up with the burger biggies, pizza 
purveyors are striking out in new directions. A pizza chain in the Southwest, 
Nunzio's, has developed and built its first Nunzio's Express in Albuquerque, 
N.M. This drive-up outlet, which takes up about as much space as a Fotomat 
booth, promises a $1.79 pizza in one minute. Outlets are planned for Denver and 
Phoenix for next year. At the same time, Pizza Hut has taken the cue from 
McDonald's and entered the arena -- literally. McNichols Sports Arena in Denver 
is the first stadium to sell Pizza Hut products, with Detroit and Cleveland 
next on the list. Although it's not expected to be extremely profitable, the 
exposure will be worth millions. (Rocky Mountain News, Nation's Restaurant 
News)

Money for Mementos: Baseball cards are a booming business these days, and the 
cards you kept in a shoe box under the bed may be worth a lot more than the 
sentiment attached to them. Collecting the cards is the fastest-growing hobby 
in the United States, and 30% of card purchases are made by adults, which is 
one reason prices are skyrocketing. The card for San Francisco Giant Will Clark 
when he was a rookie, for instance, went for a nickel in 1986 and now sells for 
$26. Topps, the biggest name in baseball cards and the company that brings you 
Bazooka bubble gum, will introduce its Topps magazine in January, a quarterly 
aimed at the 2 million serious collectors in the country. (Chicago Tribune)

GM MAY SPEND $1 BILLION TO SHIFT OUTPUT

General Motors Corp. may spend about $1 billion to realign its luxury car 
production, including a move that could breathe new life and new jobs into its 
Detroit-Hamtramck plant by 1992, a trade publication said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It has been rumored for months that the giant auto maker intends to consolidate 
Cadillac production at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant, which has been building 
GM's smaller luxury models since it opened in late 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But the facility, billed by GM as its technological showcase, has been 
operating substantially below capacity for several years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, it employed more than 5,900 workers on two shifts. Today, it employs 
fewer than 3,600 workers on a single shift because of relatively slack demand 
for the Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Seville, Eldorado and 
Allante models assembled there. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said publicly that we think it makes sense for a dedicated Cadillac 
facility, especially in light of the progress we've made in engineering and 
manufacturing in the last several years," Cadillac spokesman William O'Neill 
said in response to a report by MetalWorking News about the massive program. 
</P>
<P>
"That obviously has not changed, and we are working toward a dedicated 
facility," he said. "But there has been no final decision made on what facility 
or what products will be involved." 
</P>
<P>
MetalWorking News, a weekly publication that tracks tooling and machinery 
orders for steel-intensive companies such as auto makers, said the new 
generation of Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood cars would be transferred to the 
plant in 1992, when they switch to the front-drive "K" platform used by the 
Seville sedan. 
</P>
<P>
GM is also reportedly finishing plans to transfer production of the Riviera and 
Toronado to its Orion Township plant north of Detroit, where they will be based 
on the car maker's larger front-drive "C" platform, the publication said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the second phase of GM's large car realignment could be completed 
in time for the 1994 model year -- provided that part of the program gets final 
corporate approval. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned but awaiting final approval because of possible new fuel economy 
pressures is a new full-sized, rear-drive Cadillac to replace the current aging 
Brougham model. It is known as GM380 and could debut in mid-1992.

WEST AIR TRYING TO ACQUIRE ROUTES OF VIRGINIA AIRLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
West Air said Tuesday that it is talking with United Airlines about taking over 
the routes of a troubled Virginia airline that halted operations Monday. 
</P>
<P>
West Air, based in Fresno, said it wants to take over the routes of 
Presidential Airways, which fed passengers from small East Coast cities to 
United Airlines' hub at Washington's Dulles International Airport. Presidential 
filed for bankruptcy protection in October. 
</P>
<P>
West Air feeds passengers from small airports in California, Washington state 
and Oregon to United hubs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland. 
It is the nation's largest regional airline and, as part of a marketing 
agreement with United, operates under the name United Express. 
</P>
<P>
West Air is not the only airline interested in Presidential's routes. A person 
familiar with the situation said Tuesday that Air Wisconsin, an Appleton, 
Wis.-based regional airline that already flies into the Washington area, is 
also interested in Presidential's business. Air Wisconsin is also a United 
Express carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Peterson, a spokesman for West Air, said the regional airline is not yet 
sure how it would deploy aircraft to take over Presidential's 24 daily flights 
from six cities. He said West Air has orders and options for 37 British 
Aerospace Jetstream 31 aircraft, some of which could be used for an East Coast 
operation. The new aircraft are to be delivered through 1992.

AMERICAN TO MATCH PAN AM FARE HIKES 
</P>

<P>
American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, said Tuesday that it plans to 
raise the widely used domestic Maxsaver fares by $10 to $20 next week, matching 
increases announced by Pan Am Corp. last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided late yesterday (Monday) to match Pan Am effective Dec. 16," a 
spokeswoman for American said. 
</P>
<P>
American, a subsidiary of Dallas-based AMR Corp., plans to raise fares on the 
heavily discounted round-trip tickets by $10 on trips of less than 1,000 miles 
and by $20 on trips of more than 1,000 miles within the continental United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Maxsavers, highly restricted fares that require 14-day advance purchase, are 
used mainly by leisure travelers and are among the most popular tickets sold. 
</P>
<P>
American is the first of the major U.S. airlines to precisely match Pan Am, 
which unveiled its fare rises last week. Pan Am startled many in the industry 
by boosting the Maxsaver fares soon after a round of modest increases on 
business fares were announced. 
</P>
<P>
Both increases are designed to boost revenue in a period of slowing traffic and 
accelerating costs, airline analysts said. But they noted that in order to be 
sustained the hikes must be matched by all of the major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly having American come along is a big help," said airline analyst Paul 
Karos of First Boston Corp. "They are the biggest carrier, and they are seen as 
an important pricing player. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am still cautiously optimistic about whether the increases will go 
through," Karos added. "The key will be Delta, they were the last to come along 
on the business fares, and they are enjoying a very strong business environment 
on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines Inc., USAir Group Inc., NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines, UAL 
Corp.'s United Airlines and Texas Air Corp.'s Eastern Airlines and Continental 
Airlines units all said they are studying the American and Pan Am moves. 
</P>
<P>
Trans World Airlines Inc. last week countered Pan Am's move with an even more 
aggressive fare hike, saying it planned to raise Maxsavers by $10 on domestic 
flights of less than 750 miles and by $30 on flights of more than 750 miles. 
</P>
<P>
None of the carriers has responded to TWA's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Airline pricing executives have said they did not expect any decision on the 
Maxsaver increases until after the planned $5 to $8 increase in domestic 
business fares goes into effect Friday.

TOY INDUSTRY SLAMS THE DOOR ON THOSE WHO BUILT IT: AMATEUR INVENTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGARET K. WEBB, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American toy industry, once an entrepreneurial mix of clever marketing and 
lighthearted creativity, is not what it used to be. It's more careful, more 
self-contained and more secretive. And although annual sales last year were at 
a record $13 billion, the field seems to be dominated by a few large companies. 
Despite a boom in the number of children under the age of 12, the industry is 
in the midst of a shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
Among the casualties of all this are the amateur inventors, the tinkerers who 
were once the lifeblood of the industry. Now many have become the victims of 
their own business naivete, the toy industry's fear of patent suits and the 
competition for retail shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the smaller toy companies began going out of business and merging into 
larger companies when the first wave of high-tech toys in the late 1970s 
saturated the market and companies everywhere suffered greatly for heavy 
investments in a market that then went flat. They also suffered at the hands of 
large toy store chains that used their buying clout to force down prices from 
manufacturers; in the process, they forced out of business many of the 
independent toy retailers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, even some of the larger companies have vanished. Coleco 
Industries Inc. filed for a reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. So 
did Worlds of Wonder Inc., whose Teddy Ruxpin products swept the market three 
years ago. Milton Bradley Co. was bought by Hasbro Inc., now the largest and 
most diversified toy company in the country. Ideal Toys was purchased by Tyco 
Toys Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a condensing of the toy industry," said Robert Rao, senior vice 
president of marketing and product development for Mattel Inc. "There used to 
be dozens of second- and third-tier companies. Now that just doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few $25- to $50-million companies any more, and even fewer $50- 
to $100-million companies," he said. It was in these companies that "the 
independent inventor found a home." 
</P>
<P>
For the amateur inventor, the toy companies have become all but inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we really get to the purpose of our business and not waste 
time on weak ideas," said Leslie DiFranco, manager of research and development 
services at Fisher-Price, the leader in the market for infant and preschool 
toys. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that the casual inventor's ideas often are not really right for 
what we are trying to put on the market," DiFranco said. "And, unfortunately, 
the society that we live in today tends to resolve its conflicts in court, 
which can get very costly." 
</P>
<P>
The conflicts that worry DiFranco are patent infringement suits filed by 
inventors who claim their ideas were stolen by manufacturers that initially 
feigned disinterest. While cases of large magnitude are rare -- such as the 
$24.8 million awarded to an inventor last month in Chicago for a patent 
infringement claim against Mattel for the flexible track used in its 
best-selling product, Hot Wheels -- they have soured the relationship between 
companies and inventors. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything," DiFranco said, "they make us more sure that what we are doing, 
that being so careful, is the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
As toy executives see it, the inventors do not understand that even if they 
send an idea to a toy company, and the toy company comes out with something 
similar the following year, it does not mean that the concept for that product 
came from that particular inventor's idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We average something over 100 letters a week from would-be game developers," 
said Michael Meyers, senior vice president for research and development for 
Milton Bradley. "We basically don't look at them. If you do, you are exposing 
yourself to all kinds of legal problems. People think, 'I sent the letter, so 
you know what's in it.' We have to erect walls around ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher-Price alone receives about 2,000 unsolicited ideas each year, despite 
the company's efforts to discourage such submissions. Other toy companies 
report similar numbers. DiFranco said two people work part-time to return 
unopened packages and answer queries, which often means referring the person to 
the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc. in New York or to a reputable toy broker 
who can act as an intermediary between the company and the inventor -- a route 
many inventors avoid because they don't want to share their royalties for the 
credit for their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Toy companies also receive a number of letters from children who have ideas for 
toys -- letters especially hard to handle. On one hand, the toy companies 
cannot use these ideas; on the other hand, they do not want to discourage what 
may be a creative young mind. "We have a specific letter that we send to them 
without all the legal terminology we would send to an adult," DiFranco said. 
"We try to encourage them to continue the fine efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Because the toy industry is, in effect, a fashion industry, dominated by 
consumer tastes and marketing fads, companies cannot afford to be totally 
insulated from the outside reality of children, television and trends. They 
must deal with outsiders to some degree. 
</P>
<P>
But almost without exception, toy companies will deal with only the so-called 
professional inventing community: Perhaps 100 to 125 people in the country who 
design toys for a living, have proven themselves trustworthy, productive and 
knowledgeable about how the industry works. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Levy, a Bethesda, Md.-based professional inventor who has marketed 
through toy companies a number of successful products, such as Adverteasing and 
Hot Lixx Guitars, said companies do not believe they are losing anything by 
ignoring the smaller inventors. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies don't want products, they want lines," Levy said, referring to a 
whole series of products based on a single character or concept. "The amount of 
money it takes to launch a product is astronomical, and they want to be sure 
they are in it for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Levy recently published "The Inventing and Patenting Sourcebook," a large 
reference book that outlines some of the basics of marketing an invention. He 
published it, he said, because small inventors, being a generally frustrated 
and unsuccessful group, are especially prone to the dangers of some 
disreputable invention marketing firms that often advertise on late night 
television trying to get money from unwitting inventors. They ask exorbitant 
fees and accomplish nothing, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
The success of Nintendo also doesn't help the independent inventor, he said. 
"When Nintendo comes on the market and captures a billion dollars of the 
industry, it's not good for anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Toy analyst Paul Valentine, who follows toy company stocks for Standard &amp; 
Poor's in New York, agreed: "It been a rough couple of years for the American 
toy industry," he said. "Nintendo has really eaten their lunch -- it's 
diverting attention away from traditional toys. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a complaint in the industry that there is not enough willingness to 
take a risk," Valentine continued. "I think all the toy companies realize that 
they have to be more creative and agile than they have been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Niles, senior vice president at Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., a 
$200-million-plus company in California, understands why the larger companies 
are so unwilling to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a company like Mattel that has the Barbie brand and the Hot Wheels brand 
-- why do they have to take risks?" he said. "They can reinvest in their 
existing products, extend their lines and know they will make money." 
</P>
<P>
Mattel's Rao conceded that while it does sometimes happen, it is hard for a 
free-lance inventor to feed the company's core brands. 
</P>
<P>
The executives of toy companies today, Niles said, are not the entrepreneurial 
inventors who began the toy industry. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are professional brand people, not professional toy people," he 
said. "The inventor who brings in revolutionary things can probably not even be 
appreciated by these people." 
</P>
<P>
Niles said second-tier companies, such as Kenner Products of Cincinnati, which 
has revenue of about $600 million to $800 million, buy expensive licenses to 
marketing concepts that are already proven commercial successes, such as movie 
characters Robocop and Ghostbusters, rather than deal with the expense and risk 
of introducing untested products. 
</P>
<P>
Because the industry has changed so much, it is easy for toy executives and 
inventors to talk about the old days. But the old days for the toy industry are 
not so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
David Doyle, a scientist and former inventor who lives in Boston, was able to 
break into the toy market fairly easily in the late 1970s. His inventions were 
electronic, and he hit the market just as the entire industry was jumping on 
the high-tech bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
"To come to the toy industry was ideal," Doyle said. "They had a standard 
channel for going in and talking to a senior vice president for research and 
development. And there was a relatively agreed on royalty rate." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Parker Bros. brought out one of Doyle's games, Merlin, and it was an 
immediate success. Merlin and Simon, electronic games that required the player 
to repeat an increasing series of tones or light pulses, appeared together on a 
cover of Newsweek that year, testimony to the effect high-tech games were 
having on the toy market. In 1979, Doyle said, practically every toy company 
entered the business of electronic games. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we went into another whole technology era," he said. "The toy companies 
wished they didn't have to pay royalties to independent inventors. 
</P>
<P>
"By 1980, the (toy companies) were begining to develop products in-house," 
Doyle said. Where the industry was once welcoming outsiders, it became 
"unwilling to talk to anyone other than the so-called professional inventing 
community." 
</P>
<P>
In-house design groups today are generally quite large, particularly those of 
the bigger firms. Fisher-Price has a sizable design group, DiFranco said, which 
the company keeps insulated from outside designers to protect against possible 
idea overlap. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro has more than 100 people in its research and development group. Mattel 
has more than 400. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rounds, who conducts seminars in Los Angeles for thousands of inventors 
every year, said the industry has a bad taste in its mouth from the great 
influx of inventors that helped make the high-tech boom what it was. Now, he 
argued, it is scared of the entrepreneurial spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"The leading edge stuff is going" to foreign manufacturers, he said. "Nintendo 
made a huge commitment in a high-risk field. No toy manufacturer in the country 
would make that kind of commitment (today)." 
</P>
<P>
One of Rounds' inventor students, Wendy Cutler, came up with a toy designed for 
parents who make long drives with children. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler, who like most amateur inventors said she is "always coming up with 
silly ideas for things," will not reveal what her toy is before it is shown for 
the first time at the annual toy fair in February. After two years of having 
drawings and prototypes done, after spending thousands of dollars researching 
and getting a patent on her toy, she is not about to let someone else take her 
idea. Cutler is also one of the lucky ones: After she spent three weeks trying 
to get through to Mattel and was rejected by another fairly large company in 
California, she found a small company, Placo Products Co. in Los Angeles, that 
decided to take on her product. 
</P>
<P>
She entered into a contract with the company, she said, at a healthy 8% royalty 
rate (most royalty rates are 3% to 4% and often have to be split with a broker 
or another design firm). 
</P>
<P>
But while dealing with a smaller company gives her a more generous royalty and 
more control over the modifications that may be made on her toy, it does not 
necessarily guarantee that Cutler will make more money. 
</P>
<P>
She realizes that Placo, because of its size, will likely not have a large 
enough budget to advertise on television -- a crucial marketing tool in the toy 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Still, like most amateurs, Cutler is a determined optimist, hoping her good 
idea will largely sell itself. She even has planned what she will do with her 
royalty check if the toy becomes a hot seller: She'll buy a new house.

FRIENDLY PARTY AFTER THE 'WAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The War of the Roses," one of the Christmas season's first big film releases, 
had its premiere Monday night at 20th Century Fox studios. The movie, directed 
by and starring Danny DeVito, with co-stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen 
Turner, screened in two theaters and was followed by a party on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Guests filed through a facade and mock-up of the house featured in the movie, 
where most of the nasty divorce "war" takes place. But only good moods 
prevailed this night, as well-wishers greeted DeVito and congratulated him on a 
job well done. The elegant cocktail party atmosphere was carried out with a 
string quartet playing classical music and food that included champagne and 
caviar, pasta and desserts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,000 people at the party were Michael Douglas and father Kirk; 
Turner; "War" producer Jim Brooks; Chevy Chase; Marlee Matlin; Albert Brooks; 
Timothy Busfield; Christian Slater; Jane Seymour; Olivia Newton-John; Courteney 
Cox; Arnold Schwarzenegger; Shirley MacLaine; Jennifer Tilly; Lakers coach Pat 
Riley and DeVito's wife Rhea Perlman.

CAMPUS NERDS AIM FOR LAST LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's the laugh. That obnoxious giggle that ends in a full-fledged snort. That's 
the mark of a true nerd. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Kahn has it. Naturally. He is the founder, president and ideological 
spokesman for the newly formed Society of Nerds and Geeks -- or SONG -- at 
Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
If Veritas (truth) is the motto of Harvard and Vanitas is the motto of the 
Harvard Lampoon, then the slogan of SONG is "Veritas is more important than 
Vanitas," explained Kahn, 20, a junior majoring in math. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of people we're looking for are very interested in what they're 
studying. Not as worried about -- like -- what other people think about them," 
said Kahn, who punctuates a lot of his sentences with "like." 
</P>
<P>
"Truth is more important than to look good," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows or has known a nerd or a geek. A nerd was that brainy math major 
in college, the one with the thick glasses, the perpetual pocket calculator and 
plaid shirt. A geek was a guy -- or gal -- who wore mismatched socks or strange 
color combinations and walked to the beat of a drummer no one else heard. 
</P>
<P>
Nerds, however, go on to invent amazing new machines and make millions on the 
patents. Geeks go on to found new companies and become the CEO featured on 
Fortune's cover for their maverick style. Nerds and geeks always have the last 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Will nerds inherit the earth? No, but they might just save it, according to 
Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
The first step, he says, is to help take the stigma off students who live to 
study, not party. SONG, organized in mid-October by Kahn, aims to do that with 
meetings, speakers and other activities. "Basically it's putting academics 
ahead of social life." 
</P>
<P>
With about 35 members, SONG meets weekly and fosters discussions on how to 
study better and improve academic standings. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about -- like -- why grades are important to us or how we see 
relationships, which may seem strange for nerds and geeks to talk about," said 
Kahn. And he laughed that nerdy laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Future plans for SONG include lectures, off-beat dances for those slightly out 
of step and a special "procrastination hot line." This would involve a "kind, 
caring and generous counselor" to talk with students who simply can't get down 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think students procrastinate more than anyone else. It's amazing how much 
time I spend procrastinating," Kahn said. A hot line could get students "on the 
road to recovery. In 10 minutes they'd be sitting down and getting to work." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn had been thinking about organizing some kind of club since he entered 
Harvard. "Freshman year I found myself very isolated. For the first time in my 
life I could not concentrate on studies. No organization that would, like, help 
me concentrate on studies." 
</P>
<P>
So he thought up the name Society of Nerds and Geeks, registered it with the 
proper Harvard authorities and began having meetings. Most members are math 
majors, but other disciplines are represented as well, such as Sanskrit. 
</P>
<P>
The club's graduate student adviser, Leonid Fridman, has written a "Nerd 
Manifesto" about the dangers of anti-intellectualism. Yet the alumni adviser is 
the assistant coach of the Harvard wrestling team, proving that nerds and jocks 
aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"The role of women in SONG isn't any different from that of men. We are 
equal-opportunity nerds," said freshman Kate Tulenko, an 18-year-old 
biochemistry major. 
</P>
<P>
There's a funny saying going around Harvard, "Blessed are the nerds and geeks 
for they will become trend-setters," Kahn said. And then he laughed -- like a 
nerd.

IT'S NO JOKE: COMIC STRIPS ARE BIG BUSINESS

Attention shoppers! The following items, thanks to the comics industry's 
expanded nucleus of marketing devices, are now available at your local 
department store: 
</P>
<P>
Garfield balloons, greeting cards and pajama tops. Garfield coffee cups, party 
napkins, alarm clocks, nightgowns, stuffed toys and stickers. Garfield shirts, 
calendars, books, house slippers, mud flaps for trucks, bookmarks and women's 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention Garfield on suction cups clinging to car windows. 
</P>
<P>
"We designed those to go on bathroom mirrors and people's picture windows. It 
never occurred to us that people would stick them on car windows," says 
Garfield's creator, Jim Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"That brought us a lot of attention and it makes us nervous. People are talking 
about it too much," he says. "I have a closet full of cartoons that have 
mentioned this." 
</P>
<P>
It was a marketing strategy that backfired, but one of the few such problems 
Davis has had to worry about on the way to seeing his funny orange cat become a 
pop-culture icon. 
</P>
<P>
This is a story about comic strips and big business, about an industry in which 
a cartoonist like Davis can draw a cartoon cat and end up with much of the 
profits from a major pet food chain's $73-million advertising campaign. Davis 
was in Allentown recently for the unveiling of ALPO Petfoods Inc.'s new line of 
cat food, which is being advertised with commercials featuring Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
If the comics section seems little more than a frivolous bunch of cartoons and 
running gags, consider what's been happening behind the scenes of the nation's 
funny pages: 
</P>
<P>
* A decision by Universal Press Syndicate to yank its comics from The Dallas 
Times Herald and sell them to the competing Dallas Morning News prompted the 
Herald to file suit against the syndicate. Times Herald attorneys argue that by 
losing such strips as "The Far Side," "Doonesbury" and "Tank McNamara," the 
newspaper will be at an unfair disadvantage in Dallas' newspaper wars. 
</P>
<P>
* Cathy Guisewite, creator of "Cathy," has hired an attorney to challenge 
certain aspects of her contract with Universal Press. Guisewite declined 
comment on the dispute, but industry sources say she is charging that her 
contract violates California's labor laws which restrict companies from 
compelling employees to sign contracts of more than seven years in duration. 
</P>
<P>
* "Calvin and Hobbes" creator Bill Watterson recently told an audience of 
students that comics have been "cheapened and corrupted" by product licensing. 
"Syndicates are only too happy to sell out the comic for a quick buck," 
Watterson said. 
</P>
<P>
* "Family Circus" creator Bil Keane waged a successful battle last year with 
King Features syndicate for the rights to own his comic and its characters; the 
agreement came 10 years after the syndicate he once worked for threatened to 
bring in another cartoonist to draw "Family Circus" if he didn't approve the 
terms of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I do know of a couple of situations where certain cartoonists are demoralized 
by the fact that the characters they invented 20 or 25 years ago are owned by 
the syndicate, and are not theirs," said Mell Lazarus, president of the 
National Cartoonists Society. 
</P>
<P>
Their morale hasn't been helped by the newspaper industry's decline in recent 
years. Cities with two competing dailies are now few, a fact that forces 
syndicates to scrounge for potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
Paul G. Eberhart, assistant director of sales and international sales manager 
for King Features, said syndicates are paid roughly the same fees for most 
strips they were 10 years ago. The fee newspapers will pay is determined by the 
paper's size, whether it faces stiff competition from another paper, and the 
strip's popularity. Newspapers can pay anywhere from $10 to $500 weekly to run 
a comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
"In the good old days, when you had two-newspaper towns, editors would go out 
and aggressively buy comics hoping that one would catch on and develop a 
following. Now they're less eager to take chances on a new strip," said Brad 
Bushell, vice president and sales manager for the New York-based syndicate, 
United Media. 
</P>
<P>
Artists and syndicates are at odds over the question of who should own the 
rights to a comic strip, and Bushell said artists are becoming increasingly 
vocal on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In all but a handful of cases, syndicates own the rights to each strip and its 
characters. That means that United Media's United Feature Syndicate owns the 
rights to "Marmaduke," not its creator, Brad Anderson. Cartoonists have 
traditionally surrendered the rights to their strips when a syndicate agreed to 
represent them. Now some cartoonists are sorry they did. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not own my creation and I feel that one should. In that respect, I'm sure 
all cartoonists feel the same way," said Bob Thaves who draws "Frank &amp; 
Ernest." "I have asked for the rights time after time, and they have refused. 
They view it as a corporate asset, and they probably don't think they should 
give it away." 
</P>
<P>
Syndicates spend from $15,000 to $30,000 to sell a new comic strip, Bushell 
said. That means they need to be assured that a popular cartoonist won't stop 
drawing his strip or take it to a competitor before the syndicate makes a 
profit. In many cases, cartoonists are asked to sign contracts of 10 and 20 
years, said Richard S. Newcombe, who founded Creators Syndicate two years ago, 
and now serves as its president. 
</P>
<P>
Newcombe believes that cartoonists should have the ownership rights to their 
work, and to walk away from working conditions they don't like. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be voluntary at all times, just like a marriage. If the creators are 
very unhappy then they should have the right to renegotiate their contract or 
leave. And that was called radical when I started," Newcombe said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all cartoonists would walk away if they had a chance. And Lazarus admits 
that it might be hard for the public to sympathize with their angst; the 
nation's newspaper cartoonists earn from $50,000 to $30 million annually, 
according to industry analysts. The two top moneymakers are Charles Schultz's 
"Peanuts," and Davis' "Garfield." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing well. I can't complain," Davis said. "If you have a good program, 
good salesmen and good reputation, it really doesn't matter who owns the 
rights. I am in a very small minority of cartoonists who is content with his 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
So is Anderson, who draws "Marmaduke" for United Feature Syndicate. About 10 
years ago, a manufacturer began producing Marmaduke dolls, a move that angered 
Anderson because he had not authorized their sale. The syndicate's attorneys 
contacted the manufacturer and distributor. 
</P>
<P>
"They made them pull the toys off the market and destroy them. If it had been 
me trying to handle this alone they probably would have snowballed me," 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Eberhart expects that more cartoonists will follow Keane's example and try 
to wrestle ownership rights away from the syndicates. To the cartoonists who 
want rights to their work, ownership is a question of principle. 
</P>
<P>
"The cartoonist is the guy who should be steering the ship, not the other way 
around," Keane said. "I considered it morally wrong for a corporation to own a 
creation." 
</P>
<P>
Keane does not see anything wrong with a cartoonist making additional income by 
having "Family Circus" characters endorse infant formula or laundry detergent. 
And he, like most cartoonists, isn't opposed to seeing his strip generate 
spin-off products such as greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a result of our marketplace, which has changed dramatically," said Bob 
Duffy, Universal's vice president for sales. "A lot of the auxiliary businesses 
that many cartoonists are in have become very important."

KILLEA CLAIMS NARROW VICTORY OVER BENTLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a race seen as a referendum on abortion and how far Catholic Church leaders 
may go in opposing it, Democratic Assemblywoman Lucy Killea narrowly won a 
special election in a heavily Republican state Senate district Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher made her a national cause 
celebre by denying her Communion because of her pro-choice stand on abortion, 
Killea apparently defeated Republican Assemblywoman Carol Bentley in the 39th 
state Senate District -- a conservative stronghold with a daunting 11 
percentage point Republican registration edge. 
</P>
<P>
With 2,800 absentee ballots that were dropped off at the polls Tuesday 
remaining to be counted today, it is mathematically possible -- though 
improbable -- that Bentley could overcome her 1,528-vote deficit. However, in 
order for Bentley to overtake Killea, she would have to draw a 
disproportionately large percentage of those absentee ballots -- an unlikely 
development given that Killea handily carried the absentee votes counted 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Final unofficial figures showed that Killea received 60,012 votes (50.6%), 
compared to 58,484 votes (49.4%) for Bentley, a first-term legislator who was 
seeking to become the fourth consecutive Republican from her 77th Assembly 
District to move up to the 39th District Senate seat. A minor third candidate, 
Tom Connolly, a public defender from El Cajon, was little more than a political 
footnote in the race, drawing only about 50 write-in votes. 
</P>
<P>
Though better known, better financed and having a longer legislative resume 
than her opponent, Killea's apparent victory nonetheless was an improbable one 
attributable more to the fallout from Maher's unusually harsh -- and, many 
felt, improperly political -- sanction than anything said or done by either 
major candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although Killea, not wanting to be labeled a single-issue candidate, 
consistently stressed that abortion was "only one of many differences" between 
herself and Bentley, Maher's action undeniably galvanized her campaign, 
infusing it with a fervor rarely seen in state legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
If his purpose was to make Killea an example to other pro-choice Catholics in 
public office, Maher's action did precisely that -- though clearly not in the 
way he had intended. By guaranteeing that the volatile abortion question would 
overshadow all others, the bishop unintentionally drew campaign battle lines 
most favorable to Killea -- in the process offsetting the daunting partisan 
disadvantage confronting her that, under normal circumstances, would have all 
but preordained a Bentley victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had a good chance before, but this makes it more of a race," Killea 
said shortly after Maher's sanction. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley glumly offered the same analysis, saying: "The bishop's action 
certainly played right into (Killea's) hands. In a way, he did my opponent's 
work for her." 
</P>
<P>
Viewed as an important, if otherwise obscure, state legislative race at the 
outset, the 39th District contest was catapulted to national prominence in 
mid-November when Maher imposed his sanction against Killea. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Killea "an advocate of this most heinous crime," Maher ordered her not 
to take Communion at Mass unless she recanted her position -- something that 
the 67-year-old former San Diego City Council member made it clear she did not 
intend to do. 
</P>
<P>
By making Killea the first American Catholic elected official so severely 
punished for a pro-choice stand on abortion, Maher ignited a political 
firestorm that provoked another heated round in the continuing public debate 
touched off by last summer's U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states broader 
authority to restrict abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Maher's action revived the familiar debate over separation of 
church and state, drawing alternate interpretations as a deserved punishment of 
one who flouted church orthodoxy or an unwelcome church intrusion in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, Maher's action dramatically altered the dynamics of the race 
for the seat that Republican Larry Stirling vacated two months ago to accept a 
Municipal Court judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
If for no reason other than the district's 49%-38% Republican registration 
edge, the special election had been widely regarded as Bentley's to lose, 
despite her shorter tenure in Sacramento and lower name recognition. Maher's 
sanction, however, turned conventional political wisdom on its head, 
introducing a potent outside force that knocked the campaign off its axis, 
sending it careening off in wildly unpredictable directions largely beyond the 
control of its two principals. 
</P>
<P>
Though Maher described his action as "more pastoral than political," even the 
bishop was well aware of the political ramifications of his controversial 
decision. Expressing hope that Catholics would heed his message, Maher said: "I 
doubt that Lucy Killea will get many Catholic votes." 
</P>
<P>
Far from damaging Killea, however, Maher's action proved to be an asset, 
transforming the unassuming, low-key legislator into an overnight celebrity who 
made national television appearances on the Phil Donahue show, "CBS This 
Morning" and other network news programs. 
</P>
<P>
Killea's new-found fame, in turn, acted as a magnet for dollars and volunteers, 
helping her to outspend Bentley by a more than a 2-to-1 ratio -- $317,000 to 
$128,000, as of last week. Moreover, it riveted public attention on the very 
issue that Killea had always hoped to highlight as one of her major differences 
with Bentley, who opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or where the 
mother's life is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Among Killea's strategists, abortion was seen as precisely the kind of 
emotional issue that could persuade pro-choice Republicans to cross party lines 
and generate a higher-than-usual Democratic turnout -- factors essential to her 
chances in the heavily Republican district. The sprawling district covers most 
of eastern San Diego County, stretching from Ocean Beach to Imperial County and 
reaching north to Escondido and Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
But, although the episode was a momentous political break for Killea, it also 
presented considerable potential risks. Killea consultant Larry Sheingold 
noted, for example, that there was "a thin line between reacting effectively" 
and appearing overly eager to capitalize on an incident that Killea herself 
described as "emotional and painful." To that end, Killea persistently 
emphasized that the confrontation with Maher "was thrust upon me," and declined 
press requests to accompany her to Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley, meanwhile, watched with a mixture of amazement, confusion and chagrin 
as her opponent's extended stay in the media spotlight depreciated her own 
candidacy from front-runner status to one mentioned almost as an afterthought 
in stories about the race. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see your opponent's picture on Page 1 every day, and she's on the TV 
news every night . . . it is a little upsetting," the 44-year-old freshman 
legislator from El Cajon said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bentley doggedly stuck to her original plan -- chipping away at 
Killea's superior name recognition by building up her own, emphasizing the 
candidate's partisan differences in a district where that distinction clearly 
benefitted her, and trying to paint the four-term Democrat as a liberal with 
close ties to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
"Lucy Killea likes to tell Republicans she's a Democrat with a small 'd,' " a 
Bentley mailer said. "But her voting record proves she's a Democrat with a big 
'D' and a liberal with a big 'L.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the two candidates differed on a range of issues beyond abortion, with 
Killea's votes generally falling within a moderate to liberal range, while 
Bentley typically hews to a conservative line.

TRAVELER'S TRAIL ENDS OMINOUSLY IN SPAIN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: STEVE JUGGERT OF ORANGE VANISHED MONTHS AGO DURING A EUROPEAN 
HITCHHIKING JOURNEY. HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF ROBBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Weary of the frenetic pace of his sales job, Steve Juggert set out a year ago 
today for the back roads of Western Europe and the Middle East on a journey of 
self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Orange man began his trip in Spain, carrying with him only a 
backpack, a camera and a note pad in which to chronicle his adventures. 
</P>
<P>
In his only letter home, postmarked Dec. 19, 1988, Juggert wrote of 
encountering herds of sheep and goats, visiting quaint mountain villages and 
meeting warm, friendly natives while hitchhiking through the Spanish 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"So far the trip is going better than I expected," he wrote to his parents. "I 
am safe and I have not run into any sort of problems." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was followed by a collect phone call to his parents three days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Then the communication stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, his parents learned that $1,300 worth of his traveler's checks 
were cashed in one day at a bank in a Spanish port town, all bearing forged 
signatures. The checks, family members said, represented almost all the money 
Juggert took for what was to be a yearlong trip. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the U.S. State Department notified the family that four men 
suspected of robbing hitchhiking tourists had been arrested in Europe, two of 
them in a Spanish coast town near where Juggert was traveling and the other two 
in West Germany. The family fears the worst as authorities examine stolen 
property recovered from the men to see if any of Juggert's belongings are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
"It is and it isn't our hope that some of Steve's stuff is there," said Bob 
Oppermann of La Habra, Juggert's brother-in-law. "The fact that we don't have 
an answer is the hardest part of this. We just need to know one way or 
another." 
</P>
<P>
The case of Steven Lee Juggert has drawn international scrutiny from law 
enforcement agencies. The agencies involved include the La Habra Police 
Department, the State Department, Spain's Guardia Civil and Interpol, the 
international police agency that is coordinating the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Interpol officials, by policy, would not comment on this or any other 
pending cases, U.S. officials in Washington and Madrid confirmed Tuesday that 
they are working with Spanish authorities on the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking this very seriously," said State Department spokesman Phil 
Covington in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In Madrid, Begonia Alvarez, a U.S. consulate services assistant, said the 
Juggert case is the most serious of any now under investigation involving 
Americans missing in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"We have Americans that sometimes families call us about, but no one like 
this," Alvarez said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez confirmed that the police in Spain are investigating two men arrested 
there last month in connection with a string of robberies, mostly involving 
hitchhiking tourists. The robberies, she added, have been occurring for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said that hitchhiking is just as unsafe in Spain as it is in the United 
States and many other parts of the world. She noted that Juggert did not 
register with the local U.S. Embassy and leave an itinerary when he arrived in 
Spain -- an important precaution, she said, for anyone intending to hitchhike 
unfamiliar back roads, as Juggert told friends and family he was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
Juggert was a novice world traveler. According to his longtime friend, John 
Davis, Juggert had never ventured outside the United States, "except to 
Tijuana." He had spent much of his adult life building an impressive sales 
record at industrial products companies in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and others who knew him said Juggert loved sports and was an avid camper. 
It was this camping experience, Davis said, that helped prepare Juggert for his 
travels in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Although Juggert had outperformed many of his fellow salespeople, he found 
himself out of a job and at a crossroads in life when his Chicago-based 
employer went out of business in the fall of 1988, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
That's when he decided to go to Europe and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just going for the nice trip that everyone wants," said Davis, 31, of 
Long Beach, who grew up with Juggert in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with the "rat race" of Orange County sales, Juggert was searching 
for something more meaningful, said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to be a writer," Davis said. "He took two books with him: One was 
the Bible, and the other was a book on grammar so he could study up while he 
was there." 
</P>
<P>
Juggert left no fixed itinerary. Davis said Juggert told him he planned to 
visit Spain first, because of its warm Mediterranean climate during December. 
</P>
<P>
"From there he would go to Israel and then to Greece and he would work his way 
north, to Scandinavia, for the summer," Davis said. "He was basically planning 
to take a year or until his money ran out. There were no official plans." 
</P>
<P>
Juggert also left behind his former girlfriend, 29-year-old Susan Ramage of 
Orange, and their 4-year-old daughter, Jenni-Sue, this year's Orange County 
United Cerebral Palsy poster child. Ramage said Jenni-Sue misses her father and 
their weekend outings at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play at park with my daddy," the child said as her mother recounted 
the frustration of dealing with the disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"This one needs some answers," Ramage said. "You feel like if you could go to 
these places, you could turn over the rocks and get some answers. But we're so 
far away." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Oppermann, who is married to Juggert's only sibling, Laura, said that 
Juggert's parents were against the trip, especially his father. They were 
worried about his traveling alone so far from home. 
</P>
<P>
Juggert's parents, Carl and Paula Juggert of Bell, are so distraught over their 
son's disappearance that they declined to comment. In an Aug. 28 letter to 
their congressman, the Juggerts expressed their frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply upset," they wrote in urging Rep. Matthew G. Martinez 
(D-Montebello) to initiate speedier U.S. search efforts for their son. 
</P>
<P>
In his only letter home, Juggert gave no hint that anything was amiss. He had 
been in Spain for 12 days and had hitchhiked from Madrid to Andalusia, a 
sprawling region of mountains and hills in southern Spain. He had spent the 
last nine days camping in the mountains, and wrote that he was headed toward 
Spain's southern beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The skies are very blue and very clear, except for Madrid," Juggert wrote from 
the mountain town of Cazorla. "It is so clear you can see Mars or Venus amid 
millions of stars. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here," he wrote, "are very friendly, also very small. It is little 
poorer than the U.S. but not too noticable (sic). There are very few fancy cars 
and fancy homes, but the people live well. They all seem very dignified. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen no other travelers yet, but I'm sure I will once I get on the 
coast," Juggert wrote. "I love you all and wish you a Merry Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, on Dec. 22, 1988, Juggert telephoned his parents collect. He 
did not say where he was. The call lasted eight minutes. He promised to write 
or call again soon. 
</P>
<P>
Family members grew concerned when February rolled around and they still had 
not heard from him. Oppermann said he called the State Department to try to 
start an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"They said he was probably lying on a beach somewhere," Oppermann said. 
</P>
<P>
The family spent the ensuing months waiting and wondering. Finally, in August, 
they received evidence of foul play -- American Express notified them that 
Juggert's forged traveler's checks all had been cashed in Huelva, an Atlantic 
coastal town of about 60,000 near the Portuguese border. 
</P>
<P>
A review of American Express records also revealed that the last known place 
Juggert had been was Mojacar, a village near Cazorla in which he cashed one of 
his $100 traveler's checks, Oppermann said. 
</P>
<P>
A missing persons investigation was then launched. Oppermann said he was told 
to file a missing persons report with La Habra police, and then relay pertinent 
information such as photographs and other identifying information to the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The family and friends are still waiting by the phone for confirmation of their 
worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling now is everything is in limbo," Davis said. "You want to hold out a 
little bit of hope that he is alive somewhere. But at this point, I don't see 
how that is possible. It's just been so long now." 
</P>

SOVIET TEAM TO VISIT O.C. SDI TEST SITE 
</P>

Soviet scientists will arrive in Orange County this month to visit a sensitive 
"Star Wars" test facility near San Clemente for an unprecedented briefing on 
the controversial space-based defense program, military officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the visit will lead to Soviet understanding and eventual 
acceptance of U.S. proposals . . . for regular and reciprocal visits to (space 
defense) laboratories" in both countries, the Pentagon said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet delegates to space arms control talks in Geneva officially accepted the 
2-month-old invitation last Friday, said Lt. Col. Alan R. Freitag, a spokesman 
for the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The SDI program, better known as "Star Wars," is intended eventually to provide 
a partial shield against an incoming ballistic missile attack with a network of 
space-based lasers, particle beams and other high-technology weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to visiting the Orange County test site, the Soviet delegation will 
tour a second SDI research facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 
New Mexico, Freitag said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say with authority that we have never (before) entertained Soviet 
visitors at SDI research facilities," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the visit still are being worked out in Geneva, and a firm date for 
the trip has not been set, but both sides have agreed that it will take place 
this month, according to a U.S. State Department official who asked not to be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
The United States expects that the Soviets will send a delegation of about 20 
to 30 scientists and technicians and that the visit will last about a week, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're spring-loaded," said Freitag. "We have been preparing for a visit, so we 
can make this happen whenever they tell us they're coming." 
</P>
<P>
Several officials said the visit will be strictly business. "There are no 
extracurricular activities planned," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Pentagon statement, "One purpose of this initiative is to 
demonstrate further U.S. openness and build confidence between the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union by allowing the Soviets to learn more about U.S. SDI research and 
by reducing the risk of future technological surprise." 
</P>
<P>
The visit also could serve as a model for future visits by U.S. scientists to 
Soviet test sites, the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County research facility, operated by TRW Inc., is on a 2,000-acre 
site on Avenida Pico just outside San Clemente, inland from Interstate 5. It is 
formally known as the TRW Capistrano Test Site, although technically its 
grounds are on unincorporated county land. 
</P>
<P>
Established about 20 years ago, the facility largely has been used to test 
satellite antennas, TRW spokeswoman Montye C. Male said. 
</P>
<P>
Under a $200-million contract with the government, TRW also uses the site to 
test a potent chemical laser, known as the "alpha laser," for use in the SDI 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Currently in the early stages of development, the laser eventually will be 
enlarged and installed on a space-based platform to test its ability to both 
detect and destroy incoming missiles armed with nuclear warheads, Freitag said. 
Such tests are planned for the middle to late 1990s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As originally proposed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1983, SDI would 
have shielded the nation with an impenetrable shield of space-based defenses. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, however, members of the Bush Administration have 
significantly lowered official expectations for the program. Officials now 
acknowledge that SDI would offer only partial protection against incoming 
missiles.

COUNTY SCHOOLS CHIEF MAY FACE REELECTION TEST

<P>
A Whittier College education professor, using a novel appeal to area school 
district superintendents, is quietly testing the waters for a bid to unseat 
controversial longtime Orange County Supt. of Schools Robert D. Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
The professor, John F. Dean of Newport Beach, last week sent a sharply worded 
letter to the superintendents of every Orange County school district, asking 
for their support and advice on a possible race against Peterson, a frequent 
target of county grand jury management investigations who recently announced 
his intention to seek a seventh term. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Robert Peterson has announced that he will seek a seventh term, and many 
of us had hoped he would not run again," Dean, 63, said in his letter. "As long 
as Bob is at the helm, Orange County schools will never have the qualified 
leadership we need desperately." 
</P>
<P>
If Dean proceeds with his campaign plans, a decision he said he will make 
within the next month or so, he likely will face an uphill struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who is paid $98,663 annually to supervise the $60-million-a-year 
operation, has held the superintendent's post for more than 20 years. Although 
he often has run into controversy over management of the department, he has 
deftly turned back several attempts to push him from office. A school principal 
in Santa Ana before winning election as superintendent in 1966, Peterson hasn't 
faced serious opposition in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that he would enter the race as an underdog, Dean said he hopes a 
unique plank in his campaign platform will strengthen his chances. Besides 
announcing his possible candidacy, Dean's letter also proposes changing the 
nature of the superintendent's post, making it an appointed position rather 
than an elected one. 
</P>
<P>
"I may well be the only political candidate in history pledged to eliminate his 
job," Dean said in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
County grand juries have recommended the same thing -- one even suggested 
abolishing the county Education Department altogether. But county voters have 
twice rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, chairman of Whittier's education department for 19 years, said Tuesday 
that he has received responses from three area superintendents so far: "Two of 
them urged me to go ahead, and one warned me that Peterson can't be beat." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, 69, has leaned on his solid support from some conservative backers to 
easily rebuff challengers over the years. But while he has built a strong 
political base, Peterson has also irritated some district superintendents, who 
complain that area schools do not receive enough services from the county 
office. Some also grouse that Peterson has not kept abreast of developments in 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, many district superintendents, who are appointed by their school 
boards, say they support changing the county superintendent's post to an 
appointed one. 
</P>
<P>
An education consultant hired by a 1986 grand jury found what it called 
"universal criticism" of the county department among local school districts. 
That report -- which also said the county department failed to communicate with 
local districts, ran an expensive videotape operation that was used 
infrequently and mismanaged other functions -- suggested that the 
superintendent be appointed rather than elected. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Peterson said he was surprised by Dean's exploratory 
challenge, but confidently predicted that it would not topple him from office. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be swimming upstream," Peterson said, adding that he expects to spend 
about $60,000 on his reelection campaign. He predicted it would cost any 
opponent twice that just to establish comparable name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, who worked as a public school administrator in Newport Beach for 20 years 
before moving to Whittier College, agreed with Peterson's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a lot of money. And I would guess that 100,000 is about 
right," he said, adding that he will explore fund-raising possibilities in the 
coming weeks before making up his mind about the campaign.

DIANNE KLEIN: NEW AIRPORT WILL OPEN ON SEPT. 15, UNLESS IT DOESN'T

<P>
If you've been reading the newspaper this past week, you've undoubtedly heard 
about the expansion at John Wayne airport. It's behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers around these parts appear to think that this is news. One of them, 
not the one that happens to employ me, even bannered this information across 
its front page. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I don't know about you, but it takes more than "Airport Won't Be on Time, 
County Officials Admit" to get me worked up. 
</P>
<P>
Something along the lines of "Airport Work Going Swell: On Time, Under Budget" 
might have done it. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, county officials seemed a little upset by all this. Some of the 
supervisors were even reported to have been angry. 
</P>
<P>
Delays don't make government officials look too good, lumping them together on 
the reliability index with furniture delivery people, plumbers and doctors who 
are lucky to squeeze you in at 2:30 for your 1 o'clock appointment. 
</P>
<P>
And you know what they say about time being money and all that. Estimates are 
that the delay will mean at least $5.6 million that the county wouldn't be 
getting from airlines that were going to use the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Or, who knows, maybe some officials were sore because they didn't get the joke 
that the scheduled terminal opening of April 1, 1990, was April Fool's Day. 
Nobody likes to admit that they have no sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
So the new opening date is Sept. 15, the start of Mexico's Independence Day 
celebration. Airport officials called a news conference on Monday to announce 
this, officially and for the record, although they had already done so on 
Friday, and Thursday as well. 
</P>
<P>
Seems they were concerned about not making too big a deal about the whole 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Manager George Rebella -- "as far as the airport goes, the buck stops 
here" -- started things rolling by getting the bad news off his chest, again. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, this is a five-month delay," he said. "I hope this is kept in perspective 
by the news media. The delay, while a disappointment, is not a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Then Rebella tried to bring this down to the level that we news types might be 
able to understand (so that we could keep this in perspective). 
</P>
<P>
Surely, he said, each of us has had a personal experience, or knows of someone 
who has had a personal experience, involving the addition of an extra bedroom 
or maybe a remodeled kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"There are almost always disappointments," Rebella said. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so we were disappointed then and we are disappointed now. I felt I could 
keep this in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Rebella if the new airport was really going to open on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's achievable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, not to count hairs here, but that's what Rebella had said a few moments 
earlier, even adding that opening the new terminal behind schedule was 
"achievable without acceleration." I wasn't quite sure what that meant. 
</P>
<P>
"So does that mean it's going to open on Sept. 15?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know that we are very close to the Newport-Inglewood fault, and 
there could be a major earthquake," he said. "Or an airliner could crash into 
the terminal, or we could have a major strike." 
</P>
<P>
I could see that Rebella was a man with a lot on his mind. I thought I'd make 
things easier for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Barring a major earthquake, an airline crash or a strike, is the terminal 
going to open on Sept. 15?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very achievable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So anyway, call me dense, but by this time I was having a little trouble 
keeping this in perspective. I asked about that opening day again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's achievable," Rebella said. "You can write whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, George. I will.

2 BARS FACED WITH NEW RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Newport Boulevard bars must operate under new restrictions, aimed at 
appeasing neighbors, or lose their entertainment permits. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted to extend the use permit for Henry 'N Harry's Goat Hill 
Tavern at 1830 Newport Blvd. for three months only. In addition, the owners 
were ordered to correct a number of electrical violations and take steps to 
control customers. 
</P>
<P>
Police records indicate that between September, 1988, and September, 1989, 
there were 57 reports involving the tavern. 
</P>
<P>
The council also extended the permit for Hogue Barmichael's bar at 1976 Newport 
Blvd. until March. The bar also was ordered to close the dance floor at 11 p.m. 
on Friday and Saturday nights, restrict the line outside to 20 people and 
improve parking. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Jules Boryczewski said the restrictions will, effectively, force him out 
of business.

STUDENT PROTESTERS BURST INTO MEETING

<P>
About 30 chanting, sign-waving Cal State Fullerton students burst into a 
student government board meeting Tuesday, charging racism on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the school's Latino and black organizations said they were 
protesting the disqualification of two supporters of minority rights from the 
board of Associated Students Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters said they also objected to the recent sponsorship by Associated 
Students Inc. of controversial talk-show host Morton Downey Jr. and the 
forceable removal of a Latino student from the organization's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fed up, and we're not going to take it any more," said Rafael 
Plascencia, a co-chairman of the Latino student organization, MEChA (Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan). 
</P>
<P>
Plascencia called for the resignation of Associated Students' President Jim 
Simon and other board members. 
</P>
<P>
On the charges of racism, Simon said: "I don't think these are signs of racism 
on campus. I believe there have been incidences of racism, but I don't think 
these incidents are an indication of that." 
</P>
<P>
Simon said the two minority supporters were disqualified from the board for 
failure to complete financial disclosure forms. He added that two other board 
members were removed for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that the allocation of $5,000 in student fees by Associated Students 
for the appearance of Downey was a sign of racism. MATT LAIT

<P>
The Saddleback Community College District has selected an Anaheim athletic 
director as its board president for 1990, officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member board of trustees met Tuesday evening and cast secret ballots, 
tapping Joan J. Hueter, a Tustin resident who was first elected to the board in 
1985. Hueter has served as vice president and clerk of the board, which 
oversees both Saddleback College and Irvine Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Hueter thanked her colleagues and urged the board to tackle 
challenges facing the district. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see the board spearhead the search for a site for a third 
campus in south Orange County," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hueter said she would urge the board to increase the number of 
classes offered at the Saddleback campus in Mission Viejo and to add more 
full-time faculty members to that campus as well as the Irvine Valley facility. 
</P>
<P>
Hueter, director of girls' athletics at Katella High School in Anaheim, has 
taught physical education and coached girls' sports there for 20 years. JIM

SENIOR HOUSING PLAN OKD ON SECOND VOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
A 179-unit senior citizen housing project has won approval from the City 
Council, which reversed an earlier decision. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 0 Monday night to approve the Valley View Senior Villa 
development plan, which it had previously turned down by a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the developer has gone out of his way to make sure that this project 
will be compatible with the surrounding area," Councilman Raymond T. Littrell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The council had rejected the three-story project on Nov. 6 because of 
neighbors' concerns about traffic and privacy problems that could result from 
the project, which will be built on a 2.8-acre site at 12200 Valley View St., 
south of Chapman Avenue in west Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
David Michelson, president of Valley View Senior Partners of Irvine, told the 
council that his company had met with neighbors to find out their concerns and 
has agreed to plant 40 trees on the side of the project facing residences, make 
some architectural changes and install "grabber" bars in bathrooms in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
In addressing traffic worries, the city and the developer also plan to study 
the possibility of coordinating traffic signals along Valley View Street. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate-cost housing complex will include food service and exercise 
facilities. JAMES TORTOLANO

SPORT ARENA'S IMPACT REPORT CALLED MISLEADING; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: A MOBILE-HOME PARK OWNER SAYS ANAHEIM IS IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO 
BUILD A 20,000-SEAT VENUE NEXT DOOR. PARK RESIDENTS PLAN THEIR OWN ACTION.

<P>
In their rush to break ground on a sports arena before Santa Ana does, Anaheim 
officials have underestimated the effects of their project on a mobile-home 
park next to the arena site, the park's owner says in a report to the Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has already determined that it wants the arena, that it views the 
(environmental review) process as an impediment to constructing the arena, and 
that the city perceives that unless construction is commenced on the project 
before the city of Santa Ana . . . Anaheim's arena project will be dead," Jack 
Stanaland, president of park owner Campanula Properties, said in the 67-page 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland was responding to the city's environmental impact report that said 
the $85-million, 20,000-seat arena would have a minimal effect on the 
surrounding area, except for Orangetree Mobile Home Park on Douglass Road. In 
the report, the city acknowledged the arena would cause noise and traffic 
problems for park residents but proposed ways in which the problems could be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 people live in the 20-acre park, which is next to the Phoenix Club on 
Douglass Road. The city bought the club for $8 million in October and plans to 
demolish the building to make way for the arena, which is planned for 17 acres 
northeast of Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Park residents also plan to file individual responses to the environmental 
impact report this week. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officials were not available for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland claims that it would be illegal for the Planning Commission and City 
Council to approve the environmental impact report because it contains 
inaccurate and misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland's major concerns are: 
</P>
<P>
* Parking: Douglass Road already is packed with overflow parking from the 
Phoenix Club and Anaheim Stadium on days when events are held. The city's 
report addresses the traffic resulting from Los Angeles Rams football games, 
but not California Angels baseball games, Stanaland said. 
</P>
<P>
* Traffic: The city took two to three weeks to compile a report on the traffic 
the arena would generate, and Stanaland contends that a more thorough 
assessment is needed. Furthermore, he said, the city has failed to address the 
impact upon already congested freeway interchanges in the area. 
</P>
<P>
* Conflict of interest: The city is serving as both the applicant seeking 
approval for the arena and the lead agency with the power to approve all arena 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is, quite simply, a case of the fox watching the hen house," Stanaland 
said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
These problems can be attributed to the city's "misplaced and destructive sense 
of urgency" resulting from the race with Santa Ana to see which city can build 
an arena first. For example, Stanaland notes, the entire process for an 
environmental impact report usually takes the city about nine months but is 
being completed in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials have criticized Anaheim for proceeding too rapidly with the 
environmental impact report and providing an unrealistic opening date for the 
arena. Anaheim says it will break ground in January and open the arena by 
October, 1991. According to the environmental impact report on the Santa Ana 
arena, that project will not open until autumn of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact report and accompanying responses will be considered 
Dec. 13 by the Planning Commission and Dec. 15 by the City Council. The report 
must be approved before work can begin on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland maintains that there is no way to reduce the problems the arena will 
cause for Orangetree park residents, and he wants the city to acknowledge that. 
He said that if the city approves the environmental impact report without any 
changes, he may file a lawsuit that could block the project. 
</P>
<P>
A better solution, Stanaland said, would be for the city to relocate the 
mobile-home park elsewhere in Anaheim, as was done for the Phoenix Club. He 
said he is not interested in being bought out by the city, although city 
officials have not offered to purchase or relocate the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be real happy" about being condemned, he said. "It's a business I 
and my family have been in for 20 years."

SUPERVISORS MODIFY FEE POLICY FOR LAWYERS DEFENDING THE INDIGENT; 
</P>
<P>
TRIALS: ACTION IS DESIGNED TO LIMITS COSTS WHEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER GOES INTO THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR AND DEFENDS AN INDIGENT CLIENT FOR MORE MONEY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a package of staff recommendations 
to help streamline costs of defending indigents in criminal cases, but made one 
modification in an attempt to control the costs of outside lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley persuaded other supervisors to agree that anyone 
leaving the county public defender's office who takes a case with him or her 
into private practice should not be paid at a rate higher than the county pays 
its contract attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been occasions where the public defender who leaves the office 
(ends up) getting paid at a cost which often exceeds that which would have been 
(incurred) by the public defender's office," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Public Defender Carl C. Holmes later called the supervisors' 
decision reasonable. But Holmes said he could recall only a few instances in 
which that has happened. If a public defender leaves to go into private 
practice, the indigent client has the right to ask the court to let him or her 
remain on the case as a private attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"When this has happened, the lawyers have agreed to stay on the case at the 
county's rate, exactly as Supervisor Riley has called for," Holmes said. "What 
the supervisors really are talking about is the Randy Kraft case." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, a 44-year-old computer consultant from Long Beach, was sentenced to 
death last week for the murders of 16 young men in Orange County. Two of his 
lawyers -- C. Thomas McDonald and William J. Kopeny -- left the public 
defender's office specifically so they could accept appointments to represent 
him. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, chief public defender at the time, had asked for a leave of absence. 
When supervisors balked, he resigned. The supervisors suggested that McDonald 
should take the case as a public defender, at his usual salary. 
</P>
<P>
The total attorney fees in the Kraft case have been sealed by court order. But 
two of his lawyers, McDonald and James G. Merwin, were paid $90 an hour for 
in-court time. Kopeny was paid $50 an hour and refused to ask for a pay raise 
the court had granted his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Because the costs have been sealed, the county supervisors have been given no 
report to indicate how much the Kraft case has cost the county so far. 
</P>
<P>
But Holmes said the Kraft case is not comparable to the kind of situation 
Riley's amendment seeks to prevent. The Kraft case, Holmes pointed out, had 
never been assigned to the public defender's office. It had gone from private 
attorney to court-appointed attorney when Kraft's family did not have enough 
money to continue his defense. McDonald was recommended to the court by Merwin, 
a longtime friend who was already on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The package of recommendations from the County Administrative Office that was 
approved Tuesday includes more stringent scrutiny of money paid to a contract 
lawyer after the public defender declares a conflict of interest in handling 
the case of an indigent defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Another gives judges more input in setting standards for fees to those contract 
cases. Another is designed to tighten controls in cases in which defendants 
claim to be indigents, yet have some assets that could go toward the cost of 
their case.

<P>
A 23-year-old college student from Westminster who had been missing since Nov. 
28 was found shot to death in the back of a parked car here, police reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside police said they found the body of Tom Van Do on Monday. Do's body 
was stuffed in the back seat of his 1983 Porsche, which was parked in a 
residential area of Oceanside, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy San Diego County Coroner Bill Leard said Do died of a gunshot wound to 
the head. The initial investigation indicated that Do had been dead for one or 
two days when his body was found, Leard said. 
</P>
<P>
In Westminster, Lt. Bob Burnett said police had received a missing-person 
report Sunday on Do. 
</P>
<P>
"It was filed by his roommate," said Burnett, adding that the roommate reported 
Do had last been seen Nov. 28, when he was driving to Los Angeles. The 
roommate, who was not identified, said that Do should have returned at least by 
last Friday because of a test scheduled at California State Polytechnic 
University, Pomona, where he was a student. 
</P>
<P>
Do's body was found after Oceanside police made two trips to inspect a parked 
car that had been reported by residents.

Oceanside police had received complaints from residents of the 400 block of 
Bush Street that a parked Porsche had not been moved for some time, Oceanside 
Police Officer Bob George said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers went to the scene about 9 a.m. Monday and matched the car's license 
number to the missing person report filed by Do's roommate, George said. The 
investigators, however, had to leave to respond to a priority call before they 
could open and check the inside of the car. 
</P>
<P>
Before the officers could return, George said, a resident of the area examined 
the car and saw a man's body in the back seat, partially covered by bundles of 
clothing. The resident telephoned police shortly before noon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police returned to the car a few minutes after that call, George said, and this 
time they found the vehicle's rear license plate and radio missing. 
</P>
<P>
Both items were present when police had initially inspected the car on Monday 
morning, George said. George added that thieves may have looted the car during 
the three-hour interim, and in the process, they may have disturbed clothing in 
the back seat that had hidden Do's body when police first went to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects, and George said no weapons or items that would suggest 
a motive for the shooting were found in the Porsche.

ROBINSON EXPRESSES HIS GREAT EXPECTATIONS AGAINST 49ERS

The Eagle was soaring last year when the Rams sacked San Francisco quarterbacks 
nine times en route to a 38-16 victory in the regular-season finale. Ten weeks 
ago, however, the Rams resorted to a less-aggressive, containment-oriented 
defense and beat the 49ers, 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
So what's in store for Monday night? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to mix it up," Coach John Robinson said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Are the 49ers burning the midnight projector bulb trying to figure out which 
tactic the Rams might employ this time? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they're confused, well not confused, maybe they're uncertain a little 
bit," Robinson said. "I doubt Joe Montana will be confused." 
</P>
<P>
You'll have to excuse Robinson for having a little fun talking about the Rams' 
recent mastery of the 49ers -- they've beaten them three times in a row, if you 
count a 16-13 exhibition victory in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
And understand that Robinson is only joking when he says, "We've got their 
number." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when the 49ers regularly danced on the Rams to the tune of 
scores such as 33-0 and 48-0. These days, the Rams feel as if they have a good 
shot at winning one of these biannual NFC West slug outs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an even football game," Robinson said, "and I think our players 
do, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't played them that many times when you could say these two teams are 
equal. It's closing in now, maybe. But they have that residual experience from 
their success and maybe three of the great players (Montana, Jerry Rice and 
Roger Craig) in the history of this game." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco also has an 11-2 record and a distinct advantage in the 
standings. But the Rams (9-4) could change that with a victory Monday night. If 
they beat the 49ers and win their last two games -- at home against the Jets 
and at New England -- then a San Francisco loss against either Buffalo or 
Chicago would give the Rams the division title. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is serious to them," Robinson said. "They're playing for the 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, however, feel like they present a formidable obstacle on the 49ers' 
path to another world championship. 
</P>
<P>
"The 49ers are clearly the team that is dominating the league," Robinson said. 
"George (Seifert, 49er coach) has done a great job. You can't underestimate 
that job. It's not as though you just pick up the reins and the horse runs by 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet they're saying, 'We're 11-2 and our best football is ahead of us.' 
But we're looking forward to playing them." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is acutely aware that the glow of anticipation could fade in a hurry 
Monday evening if San Francisco puts together what he describes as "one of 
those absolutely perfect games." 
</P>
<P>
"I think with the 49ers, you're always aware that they can produce that," 
Robinson said. "We've all seen them play those kinds of games. They can take it 
up a notch. And they can let it slip down a notch and still pull it out. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, all of sudden, it's zip-zip-zip and it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the past eight times the Rams have played host to the 49ers, it was 
zip-zip-zip and the Rams got zapped. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the references to an emotional roller coaster, cornerback LeRoy Irvin 
feels as if he has been on a joy ride with the Blue Angels all season. 
</P>
<P>
He's not sure whether to scream in exhilaration or be sick. 
</P>
<P>
"One week everybody wants me and the next week no one will talk to me," Irvin 
said. "I guess that's the nature of this business. Up, down, it's mind 
boggling." 
</P>
<P>
He began the 1989 campaign with an impressive training-camp performance that 
helped lead the Rams to believe their secondary would be a strength. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-day suspension for violating the league's substance-abuse policy put more 
than a slight damper on his summer, however. Shortly after he was reinstated on 
Sept. 26, the Rams slipped into the throes of a four-game losing streak and 
their pass defense was among the worst in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Nov. 5, Irvin bruised his foot and saw very limited action the next 
two weeks. Meanwhile, heir apparent Clifford Hicks took over Irvin's spot in 
the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin's first venture into his new business -- fight promotion -- proved to be 
a disaster when one of the boxers on the program, Tony Tubbs, tested positive 
for cocaine after winning his bout. Irvin lost, however. At least $20,000, 
according to one source. 
</P>
<P>
His psyche was in a crash dive. 
</P>
<P>
But Hicks hurt his knee in the first quarter at New Orleans and Irvin was back 
at right cornerback. He pulled out of his swoon with five tackles and a 
deflected pass against the Saints. And Sunday in Dallas he had three tackles, 
another pass defensed and a third-quarter interception that led to a 21-10 Ram 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks is expected to return Monday night, but Robinson says Irvin will retain 
his starting assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"LeRoy's played well, he's done the right things," Robinson said. "There was 
the injury and he kind of hit a slump there, but he's coming back now." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, a two-time Pro Bowl selection in his 10th year, works hard at 
maintaining a cynical air these days. He couldn't help but feel good after 
Sunday's game against the Cowboys, though. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was riding the bench, I had my retirement speech already written," he 
said. "But now I'm back and who knows, maybe I'll go one more year." 
</P>
<P>
Then he quickly reverted to the power of pessimistic thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can never tell," he said, softly. 
</P>
<P>
"And they say the fight game is a cut-throat business."

RADER STILL SMILING EVEN WITHOUT YOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether out of superstition or experience, Doug Rader hasn't permitted himself 
the luxury of daydreaming about adding American League most valuable player 
Robin Yount to a team that already includes Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm not that imaginative to let my imagination run wild," the Angel 
manager said. "I've certainly had some wonderful thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' thoughts have changed as the winter baseball meetings have 
progressed. When Yount postponed his decision on departing Milwaukee, it 
prevented the Angels from addressing their other needs. But Rader said Tuesday 
he doesn't believe the club will suffer because it didn't get Joe Carter from 
Cleveland because Carter might not have been the ideal solution to the Angels' 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our priorities were set in a way that some things hinged upon others taking 
place," Rader said. "It was a case of 'If A and B were accomplished, C is 
feasible.' In terms of opportunity slipping away, that's not the case. A and B 
leading to C is still debatable as far as being the right way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"In acquiring Joe Carter, that would create a void elsewhere, without being 
specific. You can't do that without knowing the availability of somebody 
elsewhere. We didn't feel we were in a position to weaken ourselves elsewhere 
and not have Robin Yount to fill those holes." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are said to have offered center fielder Devon White and second 
baseman Johnny Ray to Cleveland for Carter. Instead, Carter's rights were 
traded to the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said he has "a lot of things up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
"We're juggling six baseballs and when they come down, hopefully we'll catch 
one or two or three of them on the way down and we'll be better for it," Port 
said. "I'd like to think we will not drop all eight." Langston's signing leaves 
Rader juggling six starting pitchers next season, unless one is traded in the 
interim. It's a happy problem for Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to have Mr. Langston. Not only is he a force unto himself, 
whenever something like that takes place with your pitching staff, it deepens 
it. That's when you become very good," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Oakland: They have seven or eight guys who could start and that 
doesn't even count (Dennis) Eckersley. When you have that much flexibility, 
that's great. . . . The thing about a little extra depth is that when you go 
into a series, you like to see how many runs you can expect to score. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Kansas City, with (Bret) Saberhagen and (Charlie) Leibrandt, that kind 
of depth. Hopefully, it's going to be very difficult to score runs (against the 
Angels). That's good." 
</P>
<P>
But they might have difficulty in scoring runs themselves. That prospect, 
though, is not enough to convince Rader to sacrifice pitching and defense for 
the sake of offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The business at hand is to make sure the pitching at hand has the proper 
support," Rader said. "If you borrow from Peter to pay Paul, that doesn't help. 
We've got to make sure we not only can pitch it, we can catch it. If we improve 
our offense, so be it. It's important to improve your strengths." 
</P>
<P>
As strong as Langston has made the Angels' pitching staff, Rader didn't 
celebrate when he heard about the $16-million man's signing. His restraint may 
be an effort to avoid increasing the pressure sure to rest on Langston, the 
team and himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very grateful the organization is able to do something like this, but the 
fact that we have him doesn't guarantee success," Rader said. "If we do 
something special with Mark Langston on the ballclub, that would be the 
appropriate time to jump up and down. Now is not the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd better prepare ourselves for a very difficult pennant race. It's going to 
take a very good ballclub to win it and there's not going to be any easy stops. 
Everybody in our division understands it's going to take 100 wins to win it."

TAYLOR RUNS UP TO EXPECTATIONS

<P>
High expectations can prove to be an athlete's greatest downfall, and this 
year, Edison High School sophomore Shelley Taylor faced expectations as high as 
Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being praised since the season began, Taylor -- in just her second year 
of running -- handled the attention like a veteran. She was undefeated through 
the first 10 weeks of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Her only loss came Nov. 25 at the state championships in Fresno, where she 
placed seventh overall, third among Orange County girls. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really feel pressure," said Taylor, The Times' girls' cross-country 
runner of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see where it would bother some people, but it doesn't seem to affect 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor said she considers her season a disappointment by virtue of her 
performance at the state meet, a quick look back at her winning streak should 
be enough to prove her wrong. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Hills Invitational Sept. 23, Taylor ran the fastest time of the 
day, 17 minutes 16 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
At the Dana Hills Invitational Sept. 30, Taylor won in 17:03, more than a 
minute faster than her closest competitor and a sophomore girls' course record. 
</P>
<P>
At the Central Park Invitational Oct. 14, Taylor won in 16:35 (in a 2.9-mile 
race), outkicking Agoura's Deena Drossin -- the two-time state champion -- in 
the last half mile to win by seven seconds. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mt. SAC Invitational Oct. 21, Taylor caught a speedy Miesha Marzell of 
Sparks, Nev., who had a 80-yard lead in the first half-mile. Taylor went on to 
win in 17:50, outrunning second-place finisher Drossin by 25 seconds. Taylor's 
time on the course was the third-fastest ever for an Orange County girl. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunset League competition, Taylor won all dual meets easily, and won the 
Nov. 4 league final by nearly a minute. 
</P>
<P>
At the Southern Section preliminaries Nov. 10, Taylor won her 4-A division heat 
in a county-leading 18:30. 
</P>
<P>
At the Southern Section finals Nov. 18, Taylor became the first county girl 
since 1981 to win a title, winning the 4-A race in 17:59, 23 seconds faster 
than her nearest county competition, Tanja Brix of University. 
</P>
<P>
And then, the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
While some speculated that Taylor's performance in Fresno might have been 
caused by an inability to handle the pressure, Taylor disagreed. She had been 
fighting off a bad cold for two weeks, she said, and when it came to line up 
for the race, physically, she felt miserable. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who became more and more pale as the race progressed, was never in 
contention, and with a half mile to go, she tumbled to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned home, Taylor was tested for anemia and mononucleosis, but 
doctors told her it was a severe sinus infection that caused her health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I get so bummed when I don't feel good in races; it's like it's not fun 
anymore," she said. "And I wasn't feeling good in the last three races. I feel 
bad, but besides the last three races, I'm satisfied with my season, I guess."

GUSTAFSON SEEKING FUN OUT OF POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Gunnar Gustafson has decided to have a little fun in his senior year at Corona 
del Mar High School. And what could be more fun than a fourth Southern Section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson has been a member of three Sea King water polo teams that have won 
4-A titles, and now he wants to try his hand at volleyball. To do this, he has 
to forgo the swim season, but, for a little fun and possibly another title, 
it's worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my last year in high school, so I want to have a good time," said 
Gustafson, The Times' player of the year in water polo. "The idea has been in 
the back of my mind since I was a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't completely a whim on Gustafson's part. He does have some background 
in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
As an eight-grader, Gustafson played for the Balboa Bay club team. He was a 
middle blocker on the team, which won the national championship in the 
14-and-under division. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had enjoyed his one year of volleyball, there was no question which 
sport he would play in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"As a kid, I really looked up to the water polo players," Gustafson said. "I 
would see them hanging out at the pool wearing their team sweats. I really 
wanted to be like them." 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson has competed for club swim teams since he was in kindergarten and has 
been a good age-group swimmer. He made the natural transition from swimming to 
water polo when he entered high school. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Gustafson was a key reserve for the Sea Kings. He has been a 
starter the past two seasons and was named first team All-Southern Section both 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Although water polo is a fall sport and volleyball a spring sport, there was no 
way to play both. Corona del Mar water polo coach John Vargas requires all his 
players to compete on the swim team. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason Vargas has been so successful is because he makes his players swim 
in the spring," said Corona del Mar volleyball coach Charlie Brande, whose team 
won the 4-A championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
But Brande didn't give up on Gustafson completely. 
</P>
<P>
"He always talked to me about possibly playing my senior year," Gustafson said. 
"I already have all the swimming background I needed, so I talked to Charlie 
before water polo season began and he said he would work with me." 
</P>
<P>
Brande has a little background in converting water polo players to volleyball 
players. In 1977 when he was the coach at Newport Harbor he did the same thing 
with Ted McGinley, a three-year starter on the Sailor water polo team. 
</P>
<P>
McGinley played his senior season for the volleyball team, which also featured 
Olympian Steve Timmons. 
</P>
<P>
"The sports are similar in some ways," Brande said. "What Gunnar will have to 
improve on is his jumping ability. That's the one thing that swimming a lot 
takes away from an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson began training shortly after the Sea Kings defeated Villa Park to win 
the water polo title. He rides a bicycle every day and has been lifting weights 
periodically. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson also will have to learn a new position. At 6 feet, he is too short to 
play middle blocker and will likely play outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been a problem for Gustafson, though. He's just having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been great to see all the guys I played volleyball with in the eighth 
grade," he said. "It's been fun. Of course another title would be awesome, 
too."

AGEE WARD MAKING NAME FOR HIMSELF AT POWER FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FULLERTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With four starters back, there was only one spot open in Cal State Fullerton's 
basketball lineup this season, Derek Jones' power forward spot. And by the 
second game, Agee Ward had claimed it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, any challenger has to go through him, which won't be particularly easy, 
considering Ward possesses the largest shorts the Fullerton equipment crew 
could locate. 
</P>
<P>
Ward figures he knows what people think when they see him. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-5, he is closer to the height of most guards than most power 
forwards. 
</P>
<P>
And at 225 pounds, they tell him he is built for football. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at me and say, 'He's all fat. He doesn't jump a lot,' " said Ward, 
a sophomore who was ineligible under the minimum academic standards of 
Proposition 48 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Ward only has to point to a statistics sheet to show what nonsense that talk 
is. 
</P>
<P>
He may be only 6-5, but he is outrebounding 6-8 center John Sykes by more than 
three a game. 
</P>
<P>
Ward is averaging nine rebounds and nine points as well, even though he is only 
playing about 23 minutes a game for Fullerton (3-0) because he isn't yet in top 
condition after a preseason ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
Ward averaged 15 points and nine rebounds a game as a senior at Los Angeles 
Washington High School. And although he played only one year of high school 
baseball, Ward says with an amount of certainty that he could have played it 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
He is probably right. His father is Gary Ward, the two-time All-Star outfielder 
who finished last season with Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have played pro baseball because of my name," Ward said. "But I wanted 
to tell my kids I succeeded because of who I am and because of what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is proud of his father, whom Ward says comes to Fullerton's games 
wearing sunglasses and "undercover," being recognized for his own achievement 
is important to him. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I struggle is every time I make something happen, they put his 
name behind it -- like you're doing right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward may yet face competition at his position, particularly when Ronnie 
Caldwell, a transfer from Washington, becomes eligible in mid-December, 
possibly in time for the Cal State Northridge game Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I see that I can do to make myself stand out is get as many 
rebounds as I can," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing helping him stand out are his outlet passes to start fast 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"(Other players) hug the ball, bounce the ball," Coach John Sneed said. "Agee's 
outlet pass will bypass four (opponents)." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Ward's prime playing time came after Fullerton's 
basketball practices were over last season. 
</P>
<P>
That was when he would hit the court in Titan Gym for two or three hours of 
pickup ball. Ineligible as a freshman, Ward couldn't play or practice with the 
team, but he could watch, and he could work out by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of those hungry redshirts," Sneed said. "It killed him not to be 
able to play." 
</P>
<P>
Ward learned Fullerton's system by watching, and he watched senior Derek Jones 
particularly closely. That was going to be his spot. 
</P>
<P>
And for now, at least, it is. 
</P>
<P>
The volleyball team began this season with a new coach, some new players and 
new hopes. Things were going to change. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the fourth match of the Big West Conference schedule, things had 
changed. The Titans upset San Diego State, ending a 34-match losing streak 
against conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
But when the season ended recently, the Titans finished with an 8-23 record, 
1-17 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the one conference victory, it wasn't much different than last 
year's record of 11-24, 0-18. 
</P>
<P>
But Susan Herman, a senior who finished as the school's career leader in kills, 
says the Titans made progress even if it didn't show much in the record, which 
included an upgraded nonconference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we only got blown out really twice," Herman said, referring to matches 
against Cal State Long Beach and Pacific. "Other than that, we were pretty 
competitive. . . . We were really close to winning a lot of games, but we never 
got over the hump. But it was a lot more fun this year. It was more fun because 
we were more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Herman long ago became the career kill leader. Her final total of 1,534 far 
surpasses Kristen Bowlin's total of 683. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, she set a school record for kills in a season with 517. This year, 
she finished with 390. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I had a lot of individual goals, like getting 500 kills," Herman 
said. "This year I just wanted to win." 
</P>
<P>
Under first-year Coach Jim Huffman, who replaced Fran Cummings after she 
resigned under pressure following last season, the Titans "definitely" made 
progress, Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was disappointing and frustrating to keep losing," she said. "We tried 
new things, a new system, a new coach, new players. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will need to find a new player to replace Herman, who said she will 
graduate in May with a degree in communications. 
</P>
<P>
But before she begins a career in advertising, she plans to play a bit longer, 
perhaps for a European professional team. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting News selected Cal State Fullerton kicker and punter Phil Nevin as 
the "Head of the Class," naming him the best freshman kicker or punter in 
Division I-A. . . . Genia Miller of the women's basketball team is second in 
the Big West Conference in scoring with a 23.3-point average. She is averaging 
11 rebounds a game and has blocked 12 shots in three games. . . . The women's 
basketball team (2-1) plays UCLA in Pauley Pavilion at 7 p.m. Friday in a game 
that will be broadcast live on KMNY 1600. John Rebenstorf will call the action. 
. . . The men's basketball game against Tulsa on Saturday in Titan Gym will be 
broadcast live on Prime Ticket beginning at 4 p.m.

EL TORO ASSISTANT FOOTBALL COACH SUSPENDED FOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Bosanko, assistant football coach at El Toro High School, has been 
suspended from coaching football for one year by Saddleback Valley Unified 
School District officials following a recommendation from administrators of the 
Southern Section office. 
</P>
<P>
"We determined that there was a rule violation based on information provided to 
this office, and El Toro has accepted a recommendation that the coach be 
suspended," said Bill Clark, Southern Section administrator in charge of 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Bosanko, the running backs coach for the football team, also is the school's 
golf coach. He will continue to coach golf and teach history at El Toro during 
the suspension. Bosanko violated Rule 1412 of the Constitution of the 
California Interscholastic Federation regarding Sunday restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The rule states: "A school may not play a football game or conduct a scrimmage 
or football practice of any type on Sunday." An explanation of the ruling also 
states that meeting on Sunday "for a skull session or reviewing a game film" is 
not permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Bosanko allowed Steve Stenstrom, El Toro's starting quarterback, to review the 
game film of El Toro's 28-14 victory over Villa Park at his home on Sunday, 
Nov. 26. Bosanko was not present when Stenstrom reviewed the film. 
</P>
<P>
"He violated the intent of the rule, but it was a very harsh punishment," said 
Don Martin, El Toro's principal. "There's a big difference between a 
student-athlete taking stats off your own game film and a coach conducting a 
skull session." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo coaches allegedly learned of the film viewing at Bosanko's home a 
day before the Diablos lost to El Toro, 28-21, in the Division III semifinals 
last Friday. Robert Metz, Mission Viejo's principal, filed an appeal with the 
Southern Section on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Metz issued a statement on Tuesday stating: "There has been alleged violation 
of 1412. We together, meaning El Toro officials, Mission Viejo officials and 
the commissioner (Stan Thomas) discussed all the evidence in detail. 
</P>
<P>
"The results are that there has been a suspension of the coach in question and 
a letter of reprimand issued to El Toro High School. I prefer to say we found 
solution. Beyond that, I have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro is scheduled to meet Paramount on Saturday night at Cerritos College 
for the Division III championship. Southern Section officials concluded that El 
Toro did not gain an unfair advantage in preparing for its quarterfinal game 
against Mission Viejo by allowing Stenstrom to review the game film. 
</P>
<P>
"El Toro will remain the entry for the championship," Clark said. "The player 
in question will be allowed to play. We consider the matter closed."

TOYOTA WILL EXPAND ITS NEWPORT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toyota Motor Corp. said it will expand its North American automotive design 
center in Newport Beach with a $17-million facility that will focus on 
long-range planning. 
</P>
<P>
The 85,400-square-foot building will be next to Calty Design Research Inc. on 
Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility will be used to develop advanced design proposals and for 
research on North American life style and trends, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
All of the major car makers have design centers in Southern California because 
they consider the Southland to be the trend-setting center of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Calty, which opened in 1973, is Toyota's first design plant built outside of 
Japan. Three other automobile makers have design centers in Orange County: 
Mazda in Irvine, Mitsubishi in Cypress and Subaru in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota said the Calty expansion is part of a $144-million effort to bolster 
sales, distribution, product research and development. 
</P>
<P>
As part of that program, Toyota also opened a new regional sales headquarters 
in Irvine, is expanding its technical center branch in Ann Arbor, Mich., and 
last month broke ground for a technical center headquarters in Torrance.

SYMPOSIUM SPOTLIGHTS U.S. HIGH-TECH DECLINE 
</P>

<P>
Some of the most famous names in American engineering have spent the past two 
days here debating a problem that has bedeviled policy makers for nearly a 
decade: how to reverse the relative decline of America's high-technology 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a symposium marking the 25th anniversary of the National 
Academy of Engineering, a privately funded, federally chartered organization 
that is struggling to emerge from the shadow of its older sibling, the National 
Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The NAE is currently working on a study of how the engineering community should 
adapt to the globalization of technology, and this week's meeting at the Arnold 
and Mabel Beckman Conference Center was designed to provide input for that 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the discussion among the impressive array of industry, government 
and academic leaders present focused specifically on how the United States can 
stop the steady erosion of its leadership position in science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Murrin, deputy secretary of commerce, set the tone in his keynote 
address, declaring that while international cooperation and free trade were all 
well and good, "if our country wishes to assure both its economic and military 
security, we have no choice but to make our own national interests our top 
priority." While stopping short of specific recommendations, Murrin implied 
that a more nationalistic approach to high technology should be incorporated 
into trade and science policies. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the early discussion, indeed, was focused on how to secure the elusive 
"level playing field" that would allow U.S. industry to compete effectively 
with the Japanese. The one point on which most participants agreed was that 
something should be done about the high cost of borrowing money in this country 
-- which would require the type of massive cut in the federal budget deficit 
that has proved beyond the reach of policy makers. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis M. Branscomb, director of the science, technology and public policy 
program at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, addressed the 
tension between national interests and corporate interests in the age of the 
global economy. For example, a foreign company that manufactures many of its 
products here may make a greater contribution to the U.S. economy than a 
U.S.-based firm that builds most of its products overseas. In developing a 
technology policy, Branscomb noted, government must take that paradox into 
account. 
</P>
<P>
And with prominent industrialists such as Hewlett-Packard Chairman David 
Packard, Intel Corp. Chairman Gordon Moore and retired Unocal Chairman Fred 
Hartley looking on, several speakers from industry then demonstrated just how 
little consensus there is on what the United States should do about the 
Japanese challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Mary L. Good of Allied-Signal Inc. called for aggressive government-industry 
action in countering Japanese competition, while Philip M. Condit of Boeing 
Corp. emphasized that the United States can't win by "hiding behind trade 
barriers or by attempting to protect highly perishable technologies." 
</P>
<P>
There was more agreement on the second day of the meeting, when the discussion 
turned to education and research and what the United States should do to make 
its schools and universities more effective. National Science Foundation 
director Erich Bloch pointed out that contrary to popular belief, expenditures 
for scientific research at American universities continue to rise. Bloch said 
that the budget squeeze being felt in many areas is due to increased 
competition for existing resources, and that the complexity of contemporary 
science demands more money and coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"With the increase in scale of much research, especially inter-disciplinary 
research and and university-industry research, there is great pressure to share 
the costs of equipment -- and cooperation is cumbersome and time-consuming," 
Bloch said. He also criticized universities for putting too much emphasis on 
research and not paying enough attention to undergraduate education. 
</P>
<P>
University of California President David Gardner rejected criticism of the high 
number of foreign students enrolled in university graduate programs in science 
and engineering in the United States, and also defended the growing number of 
university research programs that are sponsored in part by Japanese or other 
foreign companies. "The focus of our concern," said Gardner, "should not be on 
creating artificial barriers -- they won't work anyway -- but on fostering 
cooperation between universities and their sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner called for more emphasis on long-term research efforts, and said the 
criterion for industry participation in university research should be the same 
for foreign or domestic firms: all research results should be public, and the 
university should own any research that emerges from joint projects. 
</P>
<P>
And while all the speakers agreed that improving the overall quality of 
education at all levels was critical to the nation's future, University of 
Michigan President James J. Duderstadt focused specifically on the challenge 
posed by the racial and ethnic changes in the makeup of the American 
population. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that universities were responsible for "reflecting the diversity of 
the population and building models of pluralistic communities." He cited 
statistics showing that the overwhelming majority of university graduates in 
coming years would be minorities and women, and engineering and science 
education in particular would have to adapt to that. 
</P>
<P>
That observation was rather pointed, made as it was to a roomful of white men 
representing the nation's science and engineering elite. The audience could 
only nod in acknowledgement.

HOMEOWNERS GROUP WINS $22.4 MILLION FROM BREN ON CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A homeowners' association has won a $22.4-million jury verdict against a 
construction firm owned by Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren to repair a 
series of construction defects at a 419-unit condominium project. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict, returned Monday in San Diego Superior Court, found that the 
foundations of condominiums built by the Bren Co. were not built to adequately 
resist high winds or earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bren Co. is a home construction firm owned by Bren and is not part of the 
Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also found other defects such as untested fireplaces, as well as 
unstable soils and drainage systems that caused the partial landslide of an 
adjacent hillside onto nearby Interstate 5 in 1983, according to a lawyer for 
the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an engineering question," attorney Mickey McGuire said. "Every time we 
looked at something in depth with those condominiums, we found problems of 
things that didn't meet design restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that their design assumptions just didn't work on paper. The 
buildings weren't designed to resist the lateral forces exerted by anticipated 
natural events such as high winds or earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Daren Groth, senior vice president and San Diego division manager for the Bren 
Co., said in a prepared statement that the company has never denied that there 
were problems with the condos but that it considered the jury verdict 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the decision is disappointing," he said. "In our judgment, it seeks 
to impose a penalty far beyond the actual responsibility that is properly ours. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bren Co. has always acknowledged that some repairs were necessary. Our 
structural engineers contend that the homeowners' association demands were 
based on very different approaches to a solution and inflated cost estimates." 
</P>
<P>
He said the company probably would appeal the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the disagreement, Groth said, is whether construction of the 
condominiums adheres to the uniform building code, which he called a complex 
document that, among other things, sets the standard for a building's 
resistance to natural events such as high winds or earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Different structural engineers have different approaches to designing a 
building to withstand an earthquake," he said. "Their qualified experts said 
the buildings were not structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
"But we had equally qualified experts who looked at those buildings and found 
them to be structurally sound. We couldn't resolve the differences." 
</P>
<P>
The Bren Co. has built more than two dozen projects in the San Diego area over 
the past 15 years, Groth said. 
</P>
<P>
The project in dispute, the 40-acre La Jolla Southpointe Village, was built in 
four phases between 1974 and 1979. The one-, two- and three-story condominiums 
have a market value in excess of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling allows slightly more than $50,000 for structural repairs needed at 
each of the 419 units, McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire said the verdict was a message from the jury that a homeowner has the 
right to rely first on a builder's ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"It says people have a right to expect code minimums to be met whether the city 
catches the violations or not," he said. "The city didn't catch them breaking 
the code, so it's supposed to be all right. Well, it's not all right. 
</P>
<P>
"And when the builder gets caught, his hands should be slapped but good." 
</P>
<P>
Problems with the condos first came to light in 1983 when the complex's storm 
drainage system overloaded after a rainstorm and caused a mudslide. 
</P>
<P>
"Caltrans sent the homeowners' association a letter saying that their faulty 
drainage system had caused a road hazard." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans cleaned up the mess, he said, but told the homeowners, " 'We're going 
to send you a bill unless you do something about the problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
McGuire said engineers hired by the law firm later found numerous construction 
defects at the complex, including structural cracks and faulty roadway 
construction.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: KARCHER LISTS DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.: The Anaheim-based owner and franchiser of Carl's 
Jr. Restaurants reported a 4% decline in earnings for the third quarter of 
fiscal 1990 despite a 14% gain in revenue. For the quarter ended Nov. 6, net 
income was $4.1 million compared with $4.2 million recorded for the 
year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $121.6 million from $106.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, net income declined 13%, to 
$14.5 million from $16.6 million for the like period of fiscal 1989. Revenue 
increased 18%, $393.3 million from $334.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said a decline in investment income and an increase in interest 
expense contributed to lower net income for both the third quarter and for the 
first nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Donald F. Karcher, president and chief operating officer, said revenue growth 
slowed slightly during the third quarter due to higher competitive discounting. 
In addition, the company's expansion program resulted in higher general and 
administrative costs.

China moratorium -- An article on Dec. 1 reported that Cal State Northridge 
President James Cleary had ordered a temporary halt to the school's academic 
exchange programs with China after the military crackdown against student 
protesters in June. In fact it was California State University Vice Chancellor 
Lee R. Kerschner who ordered the moratorium. Cleary said he argued 
unsuccessfully against the order.

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's Egon Krenz resigned as president today and a non-Communist took 
over as head of state for the first time in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign that the security situation may be sliding out of control, the East 
German government appealed for calm, saying there were growing signs that 
citizens might attack army bases. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last few hours, there have been growing indications of stormings of 
facilities and installations of the National People's Army," the government 
said in a statement distributed by ADN. 
</P>
<P>
It did not specify where the assaults were taking place or say how many people 
were involved. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, angry citizens began surrounding and in some cases forcing their 
way into buildings housing the secret police in an effort to stop the 
destruction of documents needed in prosecutions of former Communist officials. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz, 52, had only three days earlier lost his post as Communist Party leader 
after barely seven weeks in the job. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of State chose Liberal Democratic party leader Manfred Gerlach to 
stand in as head of state until Parliament can elect a new Council of State and 
National Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
A non-Communist has never before held the post of president in East Germany. 
Under previous Communist governments, the post had been largely ceremonial, but 
it was unclear whether it would have a more important role in the current 
turmoil shaking the country. Reflecting the political crisis in the country, 
Gerlach said he is "not happy" about taking on the new duties. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach immediately announced a comprehensive prison amnesty and the shattered 
Communist Party brought forward to Friday an emergency congress charged with a 
salvage operation. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful Defense Council was dissolved temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the change in 
leadership was "another in a rapid series of changes that have taken place in 
response to a long pent-up desire of the people of East Germany for a voice in 
their government." 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this will lead to further reforms which will meet the aspirations of 
the people for freedom and democracy," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
No reason was given today for Krenz's resignation as president. His ties with 
past leaders had made him the target of growing criticism within the party and 
among opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach's Liberal Democrats were long allied with the Communist Party but have 
since said they will no longer run in a Communist-led bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach has been spearheading drives for reforms in East Germany and has been 
taking on an increasingly prominent role since the ouster of hard-line 
Communist Party leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18.

BUSH BARRED NAVY CUTBACK AT MALTA, WHITE HOUSE SAYS

<P>
President Bush ruled out at the Malta summit a proposal from Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to restrict the superpowers' navies, including removing 
nuclear weapons from surface warships, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told Gorbachev that "it was 
unacceptable to us because the United States is a naval power. We depend upon 
the seas for contact with all of our allies and with other continents of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is a land-based power. But the Navy is crucial to us in terms 
of maintaining all of our commitments around the world, maintaining open sea 
lanes and commercial lanes around the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It simply is so key and vital to our basic role in world military affairs as 
well as commercial affairs that we cannot consider that," the spokesman said, 
adding that "I don't detect any flexibility at this point" on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev expressed concern at the weekend summit that his country is 
surrounded by U.S. naval power, and even gave Bush a KGB-produced map of U.S. 
installations to hammer home the point. "He would like to see reductions in the 
naval forces," said Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave us the chart, the map. We made some jokes that we'd fill in the 
blanks, and that was about it," the White House spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
The White House also announced today that Bush is delegating Deputy Secretary 
of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to coordinate U.S. support to Eastern Europe, 
including the recently passed $938 million in aid for Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met in the Oval Office today with former Italian Prime Minister Bettino 
Craxi. 
</P>
<P>
Craxi, prime minister from 1983 to 1987 as head of the Italian Socialist Party, 
said after the meeting that the Malta summit gave "a further impulse" to the 
changes taking place in Europe.

<P>
A truck bomb exploded during rush hour today in downtown Bogota, and officials 
said at least 34 people were killed and 950 injured near a building housing 
Colombia's federal police force. 
</P>
<P>
Several stores were destroyed, and police appealed for anyone in the area with 
picks and shovels to help search through rubble for survivors. Cries for help 
could be heard beneath some of the ruins, according to radio reports. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which heavily damaged the police building, left a crater 15 feet 
deep and 30 feet wide and damaged or destroyed 60 cars. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell on drug 
traffickers who have repeatedly bombed the nation's cities in an effort to stop 
the government from extraditing suspected traffickers to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
National Police Gen. Nazim Yannine Diaz told reporters that police had detained 
four suspects in the attack. No details were immediately available on the 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, which was rigged with dynamite, exploded in front of the 
headquarters of the Department of Administrative Security, Colombia's federal 
investigations police. 
</P>
<P>
The DAS building was left standing, but a senior official said all walls inside 
were destroyed. The official, Col. Manuel Antonio Gonzalez, said the building 
was too damaged to continue to serve as headquarters for the agency, which has 
been at the forefront of Colombia's anti-narcotics campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Casualty reports changed almost by the minute, but bodies of dead and injured 
people were spread over a five-square-block area. 
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross said that the blast killed at least 34 people. 
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Eduardo Diaz said in an interview with the radio network 
Caracol that about 250 people were injured seriously and 700 treated for minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Today's blast occurred in the morning rush hour as people were hurrying to 
work. It flattened buildings across the street from the DAS headquarters and 
severely damaged at least 100 shops, witnesses said. Scores of employees who 
had been inside the building and nearby structures wandered around dazed, some 
of them weeping. Rescue workers and firemen using shovels and pickaxes searched 
for victims trapped in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Windows were shattered in buildings up to 10 blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
The government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas declared war on the nation's 
cocaine cartels after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential candidate 
and anti-drug crusader, was assassinated on Aug. 18. As part of the crackdown, 
the government has been extraditing drug suspects wanted on charges in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The drug traffickers have responded with a nationwide bombing campaign. More 
than 200 attacks have killed 29 people and wounded 238. 
</P>
<P>
In Lugano, Switzerland, police said today that Severo (Junior) Escobar, 
reputedly one of Colombia's leading drug barons, had been arrested in southern 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman who declined to give his name confirmed reports in the 
French-language Tribune de Geneve that the 30-year-old nephew of Colombian 
kingpin Pablo Escobar Gaviria, 39, was arrested Nov. 29.

The Supreme Court was urged today to permit the withdrawal of life-sustaining 
treatment from a Missouri woman described as "an unconscious shell." But a 
state lawyer said the woman's parents have no constitutional right to order 
such action. 
</P>
<P>
William Colby, a lawyer representing the parents of Nancy Cruzan, said if the 
permanently unconscious woman "was lucid for a moment and could come before 
this court," she would ask that a tube in her stomach providing food and water 
be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"Her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in this case," Colby 
said. "She would choose liberty." 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert L. Presson of Missouri said the parents have no 
constitutional right to precipitate their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
"In this extraordinary situation, the decision should be made by a judicial 
body," Presson said, referring to a state court ruling that the feeding tubes 
must be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the Bush Administration's top courtroom 
lawyer, supported Presson. 
</P>
<P>
Starr urged the court to give states "wide latitude that reflects reasonably 
the wishes" of their citizens "in this highly sensitive and deeply vexing 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
There is no constitutional right to choose to die in such cases that overrides 
a state's determination to require continued food and water for unconscious 
patients, Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, preparing for their first "right-to-die" decision, asked 
extensive questions of the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked whether a lower court that required the 
life-support treatment for Cruzan decided the case based on "the best interests 
of the patient?" 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told Colby, "You presume there is a liberty to die 
without clear and convincing evidence" of the patient's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
In his presentation to the justices, Colby said of Cruzan, "She is an 
unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers for the rest of her life." 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan, 32, has been in what doctors call a persistent vegetative state for 
almost seven years. Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, are asking the court to 
let them order removal of a surgically implanted tube providing her with food 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri Supreme Court ruled doctors may not remove the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a Jan. 11, 1983, car crash.

Cuba said today more than 2,000 of its soldiers were killed while fighting 
abroad over the last three decades, nearly all of them in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
The exact figure, which for years was kept a closely guarded secret, was 
released the day before the bodies of Cuba's war dead repatriated from foreign 
battlegrounds were due to be buried in a nationwide day of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry statement said a total of 2,289 Cubans died "on civilian and 
military internationalist missions" in Angola, Ethiopia, and other countries 
since the 1959 revolution that overthrew a right-wing dictatorship in Cuba and 
brought Fidel Castro to power. 
</P>
<P>
Of the dead, 863 were killed in direct combat, 597 died from illness and 829 
were killed in accidents, the statement said, and 204 were civilians.

A portrait of Queen Elizabeth II that makes no attempt to hide her wrinkles, 
furrowed brow and gray hair went on display today, and its creator said the 
monarch likes it a lot. 
</P>
<P>
The painter, Richard Stone, said he realized that some people might be shocked 
by the life-size picture, which shows the queen in profile wearing a crown, 
jewelry and robes for the annual state opening of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should be offended because the queen is 63 after all and she is still a 
fine-looking woman for her years," said Stone, 38, who has completed 15 other 
portraits of Royal Family members. "She has seen the painting and she is 
delighted with it." 
</P>
<P>
Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the portrait, unveiled at the Town 
Hall in Colchester, 50 miles northeast of London. It was commissioned to mark 
the 800th anniversary of the royal charter granted to Colchester.

Egypt and Israel have agreed in principle to Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III's plan for talks on the future of the Israeli-occupied territories and the 
United States will host a three-way Middle East conference early next year, the 
State Department announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Baker received a "positive response" from 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismet Abdel-Meguid to Baker's five-point proposal for 
a framework for talks dealing with the future of Israeli-occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel sent a similarly worded reply but with certain "assumptions" 
or reservations. Egypt, which is representing the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in the preliminary negotiations, also added "certain views," 
Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
The positive response from both sides prepare the groundwork for a Washington 
conference with the United States, Egypt and Israel, probably in January, if 
various scheduling difficulties can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
The conference would deal with setting up the machinery to set up elections for 
the Palestinian Arabs who will choose their representatives to a conference 
with Israel to determine the future of the occupied territories.

NEW CZECH GOVERNMENT DUE FRIDAY;

<P>
Czechoslovakia's opposition leader Vaclav Havel said today that Premier 
Ladislav Adamec will announce a new government Friday after approval by the 
country's pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Havel spoke at a news conference after emergency talks with Adamec and 
Communist Party leader Karel Urbanek aimed at resolving a 3-week-old political 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He said Adamec will show his list of ministers to the Civic Forum opposition 
movement before making it public. 
</P>
<P>
The new government will replace one formed only last Sunday and rejected by the 
opposition because 16 of its 21 members were Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist leadership agreed to change the government after the Civic Forum 
threatened a general strike next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Havel did not say whether Civic Forum wants to nominate ministers of its own 
rather than independent experts. 
</P>
<P>
But political sources said the opposition, which had earlier excluded Civic 
Forum ministers, has switched its tack. They said workers' representative Petr 
Miller and Slovak Catholic activist Jan Czarnogursky are among those the Civic 
Forum wants Adamec to include. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak state radio said Havel and an opposition delegation handed Adamec 
a list of names this morning and have been asked to provide more. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier Cabinet formed by Adamec was regarded as unrepresentative of the 
balance of political forces after the Communist Party's surrender of its 
political monopoly last week. 
</P>
<P>
Today's talks were the first time Urbanek has met directly with the opposition 
since he replaced hard-liner Milos Jakes as party leader Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said Urbanek spoke of his difficulties in persuading lower-level party 
officials that their 40 years of full political dominance were over. 
</P>
<P>
Urbanek said of a meeting he held with district party secretaries: "For three 
hours, I explained to them that the Communist Party does not want to carry out 
power politics any longer. Some of them didn't want to understand." 
</P>
<P>
The Civic Forum has shown during a campaign of demonstrations and a previous 
general strike that it can mobilize the support of millions of people.

U.S.-Soviet talks on a new long-term grain pact began today with U.S. officials 
saying several sessions are likely before a pact is forged, but that the talks 
were infused with goodwill from the Malta summit. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come with the expectation that we're going to reach agreement this 
week," said Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz, head U.S. negotiator. 
"This is really an initiation of the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The current grain trade pact, first signed in 1983 and extended a year ago 
after nine months of fruitless negotiations, expires in December, 1990. Major 
issues in those negotiations included minimum purchase levels and Soviet 
eligibility for U.S. crop export subsidies.

</P>
<P>
Similar cuts in more than 4,700 tariffs were made between May and July this

McGraw-Hill Inc., a diversified publishing group, said today that it is cutting 
about 6% of its work force and will take a $220-million charge against earnings 
in the fourth quarter in a bid to cut costs and improve profits. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based company said it will cut 1,000 jobs. The company currently 
employs about 16,250 people. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw-Hill said $145 million of the write-off will cover the shuttering of its 
general books unit and streamlining its Data Resources operations. 
</P>
<P>
The other $75 million in charges will be used for a reserve for severance 
payments associated with the staff reductions and other items. 
</P>
<P>
The market reacted negatively to the company's announcement, driving its shares 
down $1.50 to $62 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the one-time charges will lower earnings for 1989. But for 
1990, it said it expects earnings per share to rise from $3.50 a share to $4 a 
share, excluding non-recurring gains. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the company earned $167 million, or $3.45 a share, on sales of $1.82 
billion.

The City Council has approved legislation to protect the health and safety of 
more than 12,000 city workers who use video display terminals. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law of its kind in 
a major city, according to the New York City Video Display Terminal Coalition 
of labor unions and occupational safety and health groups. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved Tuesday, mandates that VDT operators at city agencies be 
given a 15-minute break whenever they are required to work at a terminal for 
more than two consecutive hours. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions -- including 
pregnancy -- would be allowed to obtain transfers. Some studies have suggested 
prolonged VDT exposure increases risk of miscarriage.

The corporate announcements, further evidence of a weakening economy, revived 
hopes that the Federal Reserve would nudge interest rates lower to avert a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Many participants held to the sidelines waiting for Friday's November jobs 
report -- the first official gauge of how the economy performed last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's just sitting around waiting for numbers," said Hildegard Zagorski 
at Prudential-Bache Securities. "The Fed shows no sign of doing anything. The 
market has kind of run out of steam." 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose slightly in extremely light trading today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 1/16 point, or under $1 per $1,000 
face amount, around midday. Its yield fell to 7.87% from 7.88% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a shade higher on virtually no volume at all," said economist Steven 
Wood with BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco. "People are 
basically content with their positions until the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Wood also said the Federal Reserve did not intervene in the money market this 
morning as it typically does, removing another possible spur to bond trading 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said there was no market movement following a government report this 
morning that productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy improved at an 
annual rate of 2.5% in the third quarter. The report contained clear signs of 
further economic weakening. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were unchanged to up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities were up 1/16 point to 
3/32 point and long-term issues were unchanged to 3/32 point higher, according 
to Telerate Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 0.77 to 1,196.67. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills slipped to 7.79% as the discount lost 1 
basis point to 7.55%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.66 as the discount 
declined 1 basis point to 7.29%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.65% as the 
discount lost 1 basis point to 7.16%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8 7/16%.

The San Francisco Symphony announced Tuesday it has included three concerts in 
East Germany among 10 additional dates for its August-September European tour 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Performances in East Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden will be the first by an 
American orchestra in East Germany since the country's lifting of border 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Blomstedt, the symphony's music director, was music director of the 
Dresden orchestra for 10 years before coming to San Francisco in 1985. He said 
his return to Dresden is "a special privilege." 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to Dresden as music director of the Staatskapelle 15 years ago, it 
was not only for the joy of making music with one of Europe's finest 
orchestras, but also because it was an opportunity to build bridges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The isolation felt in East Germany was extremely painful and even the smallest 
opening in the Iron Curtain was an event. I was received with an enthusiasm I 
have never experienced before."

<P>
There are no plans to mark the anniversary of the rock concert at Altamont 
Speedway 20 years ago today -- the day "free love" turned into fear and good 
vibes turned into violence. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who went are still trying to forget the Dec. 6, 1969, concert at 
a wind-swept, barren, sunbaked pasture 50 miles east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Stones organized the free "thank you" holiday concert for 300,000 
fans, featuring the Jefferson Airplane, Santana, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young 
and the Flying Burrito Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
But the hastily organized event quickly deteriorated into a disaster that 
heralded the end of the rock festival phenomenon and shattered the dream of a 
utopian counterculture for the '60s generation. 
</P>
<P>
The concert climaxed when a young black man drew a gun and was knifed to death 
near the stage by members of the Hells Angels, who had been hired as bodyguards 
to the Stones. 
</P>
<P>
Another youth drowned in a canal and two more died after being run over by a 
car. Drug overdoses were rampant. Many of the fans ignored those who were in 
distress on "bad trips" so as not to miss the music. 
</P>
<P>
Some people were injured during fights with the Hells Angels. Property damage 
to adjacent ranches was in the tens of thousands of dollars. The lack of 
planning resulted in what at the time was the area's largest traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger surmised afterward: "If Jesus Christ had been 
there, he would have been crucified." 
</P>
<P>
Days after the festival, following Woodstock by barely six months, writer Todd 
Gitlin declared the concert "the end of the Age of Aquarius." 
</P>
<P>
The anarchy of the chilly December day was captured by filmmakers Albert and 
David Maysles in the documentary, "Gimme Shelter."

Promoters have called off one of two planned disaster relief concerts sponsored 
by the American Red Cross because they were unable to line up performers in 
time for the scheduled Dec. 17 event in the Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
But the second concert to be held the same night in Los Angeles will go on as 
planned. Barry Levine, a concert producer in Los Angeles, said most of the 
superstars needed to fill the 25,000-seat arena in Charlotte are in recording 
studios, on the road or overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters last week announced that rock stars Bruce Springsteen and David Lee 
Roth were among possible acts being booked for the Charlotte concert. 
</P>
<P>
The rock concert was planned in Charlotte to complement a variety production in 
Los Angeles. Both events were aimed at raising money to replenish Red Cross 
disaster funds drained by Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco-Oakland area 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Los Angeles concert at Universal Amphitheater will be 
carried, possibly by CBS-TV, on that date.

Comedian Redd Foxx earned more than $1 million in an 18-month period ending in 
June, yet owes the Internal Revenue Service $996,630, according to an affidavit 
released in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit said IRS agents who swooped down on Foxx's home Nov. 28 found 
$12,769 in cash and a dozen guns, including a semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit, released Tuesday, lists more than 300 items which were taken in 
the raid. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit said Foxx received in excess of $1 million from Jan. 1, 1988, 
until June 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foxx said the groups Santana and The Who have sent him money to help 
cover his tax debts. 
</P>
<P>
Publicists for the two groups denied that they had given Foxx any money.

Williamson is the second player this season to be suspended for academic

</P>
<P>
Brown did not detail the offenses of either Roberts or Williamson.

"It goes back to the same thing we said with Stanley, he has just has not made 
the academic commitment that he needs to make," Brown said Tuesday.

"Staying eligible is one thing. Educating yourself for life is the second

Duke Coach Steve Spurrier has interviewed for the Phoenix Cardinals' head 
coaching job, a Phoenix newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona Republic said Spurrier confirmed that he met with the NFL team's 
general manager, Larry Wilson, last Thursday at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wilson would not give details about the meeting, he told the Republic, 
"I think he has an outstanding record, and I thought we had a good meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals fired fourth-year Coach Gene Stallings Nov. 20 after Stallings 
had announced that he would not return next season. The team hired running 
backs Coach Hank Kuhlmann as interim coach for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Republic reported today that Redskins assistant Joe Bugel, Los Angeles Rams 
defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, Minnesota defensive coordinator Floyd 
Peters and Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney have all expressed interest in the 
job and have talked to Wilson. Wilson has said that he hasn't ruled out 
Kuhlmann for the job.

Alan Hinton, coach of the Tacoma Stars of the Major Indoor Soccer League, has

<P>
He was replaced by Keith Weller, assistant coach with the league champion San

"This is a big shock to me," he said. "I didn't expect this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time Hinton has been fired by the Stars. The franchise's 
original ownership group fired him in January, 1988. He was rehired when the 
new ownership group revived the team in the summer of 1988. 
</P>

Hinton said his assistant coach, Steve Buttle, also has been fired.

The sophomore scoring sensation said Tuesday that the policy is paid for with a

Jackson, who set an NCAA record 30.2 scoring average as a freshman, said he

All-America linebacker Keith McCants told a Mobile newspaper that he will 
return for his senior year at Alabama, but an Atlanta newspaper reported today 
that he will pass up his final season to enter the NFL draft next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, Keith McCants is a junior at the University of Alabama, and 
I'm planning on being a senior," he said in a Mobile Press Register interview 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
McCants finished second Monday in voting on the Butkus Award that goes to the 
nation's top linebacker. "As far as the Butkus Award goes, I came in second but 
I feel like it's a tremendous honor to be one of the finalists being that I'm 
only a junior. So I've got another year to get it," McCants told the Mobile 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Constitution, however, quoted unidentified sources close to McCants 
and the school's athletic department as saying that the 6-foot-5, 256-pound 
junior would bypass his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Crimson Tide Coach Bill Curry has told several staff members that McCants will 
leave Alabama after this season, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nationalistic fervor whipped up by the government is turning Thursday's title 
fight between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran into a symbolic political 
clash. 
</P>
<P>
The fight comes at the low point in Panama-U.S. relations, with the U.S. 
government imposing economic sanctions to force the ouster of military 
strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. A coup that began with U.S. support was 
botched in October. 
</P>
<P>
"For Panama, I am going to beat that loudmouth," Duran said in a television 
advertisement, in which he also asks fans "to be smart and bet on me." 
</P>
<P>
The city is expected to come to a standstill Thursday night during the live 
television broadcast of the fight. Giant screens are being put up in low-income 
neighborhoods to make it easier for fans to watch. 
</P>
<P>
A radio announcer warned Tuesday that the Defense Forces should be alert 
because it would be the best time for an invasion by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the nearly 12,000 soldiers on U.S. bases in Panama also will be 
watching the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine whom I'll be rooting for," a U.S. Army officer said. 
"Leonard." 
</P>
<P>
The fight, to be held in Las Vegas, has joined government officials and 
opposition leaders in wishing that the durable Duran, known as Mano de Piedra 
or "Hand of Stone," wins his fifth world crown. 
</P>
<P>
A popular novelty item is a baseball hat with Duran's name and four embroidered 
crowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to put the fifth one here," a fan told a television interviewer, 
pointing to the center of his hat. 
</P>
<P>
The nationalistic fever was boosted this week by Duran when he called sports 
officials to say U.S. officials had forbidden the singing of the Panamanian 
national anthem before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctions forbid U.S. companies to deal commercially with people, companies or 
agencies associated with Noriega, so broadcasting rights became a controversial 
issue.

Americans Jim Courier and Pete Sampras, the youngest pair in the history of the 
tournament, were beaten by Australians Darren Cahill and Mark Kratzmann 6-2, 
6-2, 7-6 on the opening day of the Masters doubles championship today. 
</P>
<P>
Courier and Sampras said they needed more experience to make an impact in 
top-class doubles. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to know about court coverage. You need knowledge and experience," 
said Courier, 19, a year older than his partner. "Doubles is less about pure 
skill and more about strategy." 
</P>
<P>
In the other group of the round-robin event at Royal Albert Hall, South 
Africans Piet Aldrich and Danie Visser -- second in the 1989 Nabisco points 
rankings -- beat Todd Witsken of the United States and Jorge Lozano of Mexico 
6-2, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The format of the five-day tournament is the same as the singles Masters, won 
last weekend by Sweden's Stefan Edberg. Eight high-ranking teams play three 
days of round-robin matches, then go into elimination play for the semifinals 
and final.

Joe Carter reached agreement with San Diego on a three-year contract today, 
clearing the way for the Padres to complete a multiplayer trade that will send 
Sandy Alomar Jr. to the Cleveland Indians, the Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the deal was to be announced this afternoon at baseball's winter 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland and the Padres reached agreement late Monday night on Carter, one of 
baseball's biggest sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
The trade could not be finished until San Diego signed Carter, who would have 
been eligible for free agency after the 1990 season. The teams had until 2 p.m. 
Tennessee time to reach agreement or the deal was off, although they could have 
extended the time limit if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Carter and the Padres concluded negotiations about 15 minutes before the 
deadline.
