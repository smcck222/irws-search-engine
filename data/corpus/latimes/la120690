CULTURE FESTIVAL TO COMPLEMENT ART EXHIBITION 
</P>

When the mammoth art exhibition "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" hits 
town next fall, it will be accompanied by a host of film, visual and performing 
arts events called the Artes de Mexico festival. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexico exhibition, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from Oct. 6 to 
Dec. 29, 1991, features 400 works from 1000 BC to 1950 and is being billed as 
the most comprehensive survey of Mexican art to be mounted in 50 years. It will 
be divided into four periods: pre-Columbian, colonial, 19th Century, and the 
first half of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're looking to do with this exhibition is to create an appreciation and 
awareness for all the art of Mexico and its cultural diversity," said Miguel 
Angel Corzo, president of the Los Angeles-based Friends of the Arts of Mexico, 
which is sponsoring the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people's perception about Mexico is based only on the things you hear 
about, like the drugs and the corruption . . . but that's not what Mexico has 
to offer to the world. It's got much more, and that's its arts and culture," 
Corzo said. 
</P>
<P>
"For Mexican-Americans, it will bring a pride in their past, and a better 
perception of their own roots. And for others, it will expose them to these 
traditions, maybe for the first time. The exhibition presents a facet of 
Mexico, linked through 3,000 years, that shows imagination, creativity, a will 
to do things, and high aesthetic quality." 
</P>
<P>
Artes de Mexico, scheduled to run from mid-September through December, will 
feature about 16 locally produced exhibitions and events and about 20 
additional programs with groups and individuals brought in from Mexico itself, 
according to Armando Duron, president of the festival committee. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, other local groups and artists will be invited to produce 
accompanying programs in a manner similar to the Los Angeles Festival's Open 
Festival, said committee member Samuel Mark. 
</P>
<P>
Although the festival is still a year away, a number of events are already 
confirmed, Duron said. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* A new theatrical adaptation of Mariano Azuela's classic Mexican novel "Los de 
Abajo," o be staged at the Bilingual Foundation for the Arts Sept. 24-Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
* Three November weekends of screenings -- at historic Broadway movie theaters 
downtown, in East Los Angeles and at USC -- of mostly contemporary film and 
video works by Mexican and Mexican-American filmmakers, plus a one-day 
conference at USC for filmmakers from both sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
* A display of little-known Revolution-era photographs on "Mexican Life and 
Culture During the Porfiriato: The Photography of C. B. Waite, 1898-1913," at 
Southwest Museum, Sept. 12-Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
* The prestigious "Folk Treasures of Mexico: Highlights From the Nelson A. 
Rockefeller Collection of the San Antonio Museum of Art" at the Craft and Folk 
Art Museum, Sept. 8-Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
* Four performances of traditional regional Mexican dance by the Tonantzin 
Dance Group. 
</P>
<P>
* Three public mural-painting sessions by the Latino muralist group East Los 
Streetscapers. 
</P>
<P>
* A daylong fiesta of family-oriented activities, workshops, and performances 
in Hancock Park in October. 
</P>
<P>
* Lectures and concerts at various locations on "African Influences in the 
Music of Mexico" and a newly mounted exhibition tracing the influences of 
Mexican artists on African-American artists at the California Afro-American 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also searching for contemporary theater and dance from Mexico to bring 
in," Duron said, noting that more than half of the programming is still to be 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the organizers are already billing it as a festival highlight, "Women 
in Mexico," a visual art exhibit featuring about 120 modern and contemporary 
works by 22 female artists, is one of the events not yet confirmed, according 
to Selma Holo, director of USC's Fisher Gallery, which hopes to present the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Holo said final plans for the show were put off when the Rockefeller Foundation 
decided to delay its decision on her application for a $20,000 start-up grant 
for "Women in Mexico." The Rockefeller Foundation has already donated about 
$175,000 toward the Artes de Mexico Festival, which is budgeted for $450,000, 
Mark said. 
</P>
<P>
"We frankly can't do it unless we get the grant; we're just not in a position 
to do it ourselves," said Holo, noting that the foundation's staff had told her 
they were waiting to ascertain how the exhibition is being received in New 
York, where it is currently at Manhattan's National Academy of Design. 
</P>
<P>
"I've left a spot open for it, and now I'm in limbo; I'm frankly a little 
annoyed," Holo said. "It's as good a show as you can get of that material, and 
it includes a good selection by Frida Kahlo. She is not only the best woman 
artist in Mexico, but she may even be the best artist, and that's why I really 
want to do the show." 
</P>
<P>
Duron agreed that the "Women in Mexico" show is vital to the festival. It, 
along with two other still-unconfirmed contemporary visual art shows, would be 
able to fill in the post-1950 gap left unrepresented by "Mexico: Splendors of 
Thirty Centuries," which, Duron said, "kind of comes to a screeching halt with 
(Rufino) Tamayo." Thus additional visual art exhibitions are needed, he said, 
to bring the main exhibition "up to date." 
</P>
<P>
One highlight of the festival should be "Folk Treasures of Mexico," which will 
serve to extend even further the topics brought up by LACMA's massive "Mexico" 
exhibition by addressing the "more popular issues," according to Patrick Ela, 
director of the Craft and Folk Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Still another component of Artes de Mexico, Duron said, will be educational 
programming. Committee members have been meeting with officials of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District to develop a program and materials related to 
the festival's offerings. In addition, he said he hopes to find corporate 
sponsors to underwrite tours for schoolchildren to various festival shows. 
</P>
<P>
Although events similar to the Artes de Mexico festival are also being held in 
New York (where "Thirty Centuries" is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through 
Jan. 13) and San Antonio (where the exhibition will be at the San Antonio 
Museum of Art from April 6-Aug. 1), Los Angeles' festival will be of a 
different, more up-to-date flavor, according to committee member Mark. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis in New York is on pre-Columbian Mexican arts and in San Antonio on 
colonial Mexican arts, he noted. The festival will be "much more contemporary 
here and be much more Mexican-American in focus," said Mark, assistant vice 
president of civic and community relations at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Duron, an attorney in family law who is also involved with several arts groups, 
said, "I think a greater understanding among people is the clearest 
accomplishment we can hope to make here -- a greater understanding among 
non-Latinos of Latinos, and a greater understanding among Latinos of 
themselves, and particularly of Mexicans."

* Attorney John Huerta has joined Los Angeles' Western Center on Law and 
Poverty as a specialist in land use and housing law, and he has also been named 
to the city's new Affordable Housing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy helping poor people, the people who don't have the means to assert 
their rights," said Huerta, once an attorney for the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund. "In today's legal market, people with low and 
moderate income cannot afford attorneys," he said. Huerta said his goal on the 
commission "is to make more affordable housing available in Los Angeles for 
low-income and moderate-income individuals -- not just in ghetto areas." EDWARD

BROAD NEW LAW CHANGES POLICIES ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Immigration Act of 1990, adopted by Congress in late October, increases 
U.S. legal immigration by about 35%, prohibits deportation of spouses and 
children of newly legalized immigrants, and extends by a year the deadline for 
completing the second phase of the amnesty process. 
</P>
<P>
Among other provisions significant to Latinos, the measure offers an 18-month 
period of safe haven for hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans who live in this 
country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation contains the most sweeping changes in 40 years of U.S. law 
governing legal immigration. It follows by four years the passage of the 
landmark Immigration Reform and Control Act, which resulted in extending legal 
residency to 3.1 million illegal immigrants living in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the significance of the 1990 law depends on one's point of view. The 
measure was a compromise among various groups with different interests in 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of immigrants rights were happy about the measure's expansion in the 
issuance of visas for immigrants to this country. This increase and the 
liberalizing of per-country limits, advocates hope, will relieve the long waits 
of people who otherwise qualify to move to this country. This is expected to be 
especially true for Mexican visa applicants, who often have waited up to 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The advocates applauded provisions barring deportation of amnesty applicants' 
immediate relatives who can show they have been in the country since before May 
5, 1988. This clause is expected to have a wide impact in Los Angeles because 
nearly 1 million amnesty applicants live here. Amnesty applicants were also 
given an additional 12 months to satisfy Second Phase requirements for U.S. 
history, government and English instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The advocates were disappointed that some of their immigration reform goals 
were not met. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the glass is half full, rather than half empty," said Linda Mitchell, 
a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights in Los Angeles. 
"We still have to do more work in the family unity area to ensure that the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service carries out its mission." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said immigrants advocates favored the House version of the measure, 
which would have allowed nearly 800,000 visas each year. The final version 
provided for 700,000 visas annually from 1992 to 1994, dropping to 675,000 in 
subsequent years. About 500,000 people annually have immigrated legally in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Noriega-Pena, directing attorney for One Stop Immigration &amp; 
Educational Center in Boyle Heights, said the law's benefits will be too 
limited to apply to many Mexicans and other Latinos. "Other than the 
Salvadorans' safe haven, I don't see much benefit in this bill for Latinos," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On the immigration enforcement side, some former INS officials also were 
disappointed. They were chagrined that a provision allowing for the 
experimental use in three states of a national identification card was knocked 
out before the measure was adopted by both houses. Such a card is seen by 
supporters as one way to verify a person's legal status in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"There are terrific things in this bill, but we will never regain control of 
our borders without a tamper-proof ID card," said former INS Western Regional 
Commissioner Harold Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
"Call it what you like -- driver's license, a Social Security card, a national 
ID card, whatever. We have to have one." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles) and other Latino lawmakers threatened to 
delay passage of the historic measure because of the experimental card 
provision. They argued that a national ID card was an Orwellian attempt to curb 
civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
The major sponsors of the bill -- Rep. Bruce Morrison (D-Conn.), Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.), and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) -- agreed to drop the 
provision after caucusing late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the measure Oct. 26 on an 89-8 vote. The next day, the 
House followed suit on a 264-118 vote. 
</P>
<P>
How the law will be administered by the INS will not be clear until the agency 
issues new regulations. The agency's resources have been stretched to the limit 
by the 1986 immigration reform law. 
</P>
<P>
INS critics caution that the lines at agency offices could be extremely long if 
a rush of applicants deluge ill-equipped INS personnel. 
</P>
<P>
To help streamline the INS, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh named a panel of outside 
managers to reform the immigration service and cited the sweeping reform's 
passage as a major reason for his action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF 1990 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the major provisions of the 1990 Immigration Act of 
particular importance to Latinos. People affected are advised to seek 
information from community-based, church or labor organizations that work with 
immigration issues. Call the NALEO information line at 1 (800) 346-2536 from 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday for details or to be referred to an immigration 
organization. FAMILY-SPONSORED IMMIGRATION 
</P>
<P>
* Establishes an overall cap on immigration, of 700,000 annually from 1992 to 
1994, and 675,000 thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
* Within that limitation, family immigration is allocated 465,000 visas 
annually through 1994, and 480,000 thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
* The family preference system will be as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 23,400 for unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 114,200 visas as a minimum for spouses and children of permanent residents. 
For spouses and minor children of residents, 75% of the visas are not subject 
to per-country limits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 23,400 visas for married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 65,000 visas for brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
* Visas for legalized immigrants' relatives -- 55,000 visas per year for three 
years specifically for newly legalized immigrants to reunite with spouses and 
children. These families are also eligible for visas under the category that 
includes spouses, sons and daughters of permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY UNITY 
</P>
<P>
Formalizes provisions to protect against deportation and provides work 
authorization for spouses and unmarried children of immigrants newly legalized 
under the amnesty program and the agricultural workers program. These relatives 
will have to show that they were in the United States before May 5, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
EXTENSION OF THE APPLICATION PERIOD 
</P>
<P>
Provides a 12-month extension of the 30-month application period for the Second 
Phase of the amnesty program. It especially helps thousands of legalized 
immigrants who have missed their Second Phase deadlines, risking return to 
undocumented status. 
</P>
<P>
NATURALIZATION 
</P>
<P>
A waiver of the English-language requirement for becoming a U.S. citizen is 
expanded to include people over 50 who have lived lawfully in this country for 
at least 20 years and people over 55 who have resided lawfully here at least 15 
years.

HOSPITAL BOARD ATTEMPTS TO SUE OVER 'NURSE' LISTING ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual legal maneuver, an Escondido-based hospital district board asked 
the state attorney general's office Wednesday for permission to sue to keep a 
home health aide off the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The application by the Palomar Pomerado Health System board is aimed at Nancy 
Scofield, who critics say misrepresented herself on the Nov. 6 ballot by 
listing herself as a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield did so, even though she had never been licensed as a nurse. She was a 
home health aide, which has no licensing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
In order for a public agency to sue a public official, it must gain the 
permission of the attorney general's office because the agency then represents 
the people of California. But it is so rare that an agency sues one of its own 
directors that it remains unclear how much the board must prove. 
</P>
<P>
Even the attorney general's office isn't sure who must show what. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't come about frequently, and certainly not lately, and I'm not certain 
to what extent it has occurred in the past," said Rodney Lilyquist of the 
attorney general's San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield's attorney, Timothy Rutherford, maintains that the board will have to 
prove that the listing as a nurse unfairly made a difference in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield placed second in a field of a dozen candidates in an election in which 
the top four finishers won seats. Scofield garnered 34,217 votes, and the 
highest losing candidate received 23,506 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to prove that one out of every three people who voted for her . . . 
would not have voted for her," Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Teel, attorney for the hospital board, declined to give his views on 
what the district must prove. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose a judge would look at what was the candidate's reliance on this 
title, was that the major point of her candidacy, was that her platform," 
Lilyquist said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd look at their campaign literature, possibly the other side's campaign 
literature, you look at what has been the pattern in the past of people in this 
type of position (whether it has) basically assured them of election or not, 
and they may have to provide some affidavits from the electors on the basis of 
their votes." 
</P>
<P>
The district board, in a complaint filed at the district attorney's office, 
said every candidate, with the exception of incumbents, that has identified his 
or her occupation as either physician, registered nurse or nurse has won 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield has insisted that she relied on her community volunteer experience and 
support from local organizations in her campaign. She ran with the endorsement 
of the Pro-Life Council, which distributed lists of anti-abortion candidates 
before the election. She also has claimed that the word nurse is a generic 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the California Nurse's Assn. have deplored Scofield's use of the 
term nurse, but Rutherford said it is a general term that does not imply a 
licensed person. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't run on my medical or educational qualifications, I ran to represent 
the common, average, hard-working taxpayer," Scofield said. 
</P>
<P>
"This entire sad affair has been thrust upon the community by a very vocal 
minority of people, a few disgruntled losing candidates and a handful of 
others," said Scofield. She said it is "a non-issue" that has been blown of 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
But Beverly Eastland, who also was listed in the application to sue, said the 
affair is very significant. 
</P>
<P>
"She lied. She perjured herself, and when she raised her hand and swore to tell 
the truth and did not tell the truth, it took votes away from other 
candidates," said Eastland, who has run for the board twice but did not run 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If they allow her to use the general term nurse, then I can tell you the next 
time I file, I'm going to use the three generic terms doctor, nurse and 
veterinarian," Eastland said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastland said she is already prepared to initiate a recall effort, if and when 
Scofield is sworn onto the board. 
</P>
<P>
The health district board, in a Nov. 19 meeting, urged Scofield to surrender 
her seat, and, after two weeks of consideration, Scofield said last Tuesday 
that she would continue to fight for her seat. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield, who was to have been sworn in Friday, has agreed to not take the oath 
of office until all legal challenges have been resolved or Jan. 31, whichever 
comes first.

OCEANSIDE'S NEW SLOW-GROWTH COUNCIL COMES IN LIKE A LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a maiden voyage awash in political blood Wednesday as the Oceanside City 
Council's new slow-growth majority fired most of the city's Planning Commission 
and stripped the mayor of an important post. 
</P>
<P>
Just one hour into the majority's first council meeting, Councilman Sam 
Williamson, who is now in the minority with Mayor Larry Bagley, said, "To see 
what's happening here this morning really disgusts me." 
</P>
<P>
First, the majority muscled through a motion to unseat four of the city's seven 
appointed planning commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"We need some fresh ideas and some new people involved in this city," 
Councilwoman Melba Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop was the council's longtime rebellious outsider until voters last month 
elected Nancy York and Don Rodee, creating a majority eager to smash what they 
regard as the developers' hold on Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
One of the ousted commissioners, Nancy Jakovac, wasn't going without a parting 
shot, and told the council, "I will not sit still and let somebody for 
political gain tear this Planning Commission apart." 
</P>
<P>
She blamed the council for passing exemptions to Proposition A, the city's 
growth control law, that made it hard for commissioners to practice balanced 
growth policies. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority said Jakovac, Nancy Boyer, Jack Cassan and Brian Sullivan 
may continue serving until new commissioners are appointed early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Rodee said voters support slow growth, and the commission needs members "with 
that philosophy." But the raid on the commission infuriated Bagley and 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor termed it "a blatant exercise of power" without regard to the fallen 
commissioners' tenure, experience or voting records. 
</P>
<P>
He flatly accused Bishop, York and Rodee of meeting privately to orchestrate 
their political actions, calling it a "clear violation" of the Brown Act, the 
state's open-meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop countered: "You're going to see a lot of like votes from these three 
people because our philosophies are similar." She called the mayor's accusation 
"ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
But the rancor was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the mayor assigns council members to committees, but newcomer 
York announced her list of committee appointments. Bishop quickly apologized 
for York, saying she actually meant to say "recommended" appointments. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote, the majority approved York's list, which placed the appointees 
on the most critical committees and removed Bagley as a director of the San 
Diego Assn. of Governments, a regional planning agency. He would have become 
the board's president next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley railed at the move, saying: "I would remind you I was elected mayor of 
this city. There may be a coup pulled here, but I will not go quietly." 
</P>
<P>
York replied curtly: "Your appointments to the major committees would continue 
the policies of the past, which have led us almost into bankruptcy." The city 
is considering cutbacks to erase a projected $5.8-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
However, the mayor protested that the city is basically financially sound, 
commenting: "I think we've done a tremendous job. We are in a glitch right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it became clear that Bagley would not be making the council's 
appointments, nor could he save his own prestigious place on Sandag's board, 
which is partly composed of other mayors.

DRUG-BUST SLAYING SETS CITY POLICE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police narcotics officer serving a search warrant Wednesday afternoon in East 
San Diego shot and killed a man who allegedly reached for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal shooting is the 11th this year by San Diego police, breaking a 
6-year-old record for slayings in a year. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the 25th police shooting of the year. According to police records, 
last year's total of 24 was the highest number of shootings since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Police said an undercover narcotics officer made a cocaine buy at an apartment 
in the 4100 block of Van Dyke Avenue. He returned with other officers about 2 
p.m. to serve a search warrant, and they identified themselves as police 
officers. When nobody responded, the officers broke down the door with a 
battering ram, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, they found four men and two women. One of the men pulled out a 
.22-caliber handgun, police say, and they shot him once in the chest. He was 
pronounced dead at Mercy Hospital a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide officers investigating the shooting did not identify the dead man or 
the officers, and did not say if anyone was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
They said the victim had $400 in cash and rock cocaine on him. Narcotics 
officers at the scene found rock cocaine, a .22-caliber revolver and an 
undisclosed amount of cash in the apartment, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's shooting will follow the normal course of investigation in 
officer-involved shootings: reviews by homicide detectives, the department's 
internal affairs unit, a special police board of commanders, the San Diego city 
manager and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Wednesday night that the high number of 
shootings is hardly surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"It's reflective of the times," he said. "There's more narcotics and more 
firepower on the street. It's a very deadly year, but this is a nationwide 
trend. Every major city has experienced an increase in violence." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said narcotics officers serving search warrants are especially 
vulnerable because of the weapons drug dealers carry. He said a member of the 
narcotics team was recently shot in the hand while serving a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting is bound to focus new attention on the use of deadly force, 
already the subject of an extensive internal department study that began in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fatal shootings have been particularly controversial because the 
victims had no guns. In two cases, the victims carried baseball bats. In 
another, a garden trowel. 
</P>
<P>
In those particular cases, civic activists and others questioned the officers' 
need to fire their guns and suggested that the victims could have been subdued 
in some other way. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has not filed criminal charges against an 
officer in six years, although it has reviewed dozens of police shootings 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Police Officer David DeLange was charged in 1984 with killing a 
22-year-old office secretary who was taken hostage and shot to death while 
fleeing her abductor. DeLange was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
The study of fatal shootings, initiated by Police Chief Bob Burgreen after a 
series of four over three months beginning in June, is supposed to be completed 
before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen had to take over the study in September when one of his deputy chiefs 
asked to step aside. Deputy Chief Mike Rice said he could no longer be part of 
the group after his son, Charles, a police officer, shot and killed a man who 
police said had threatened him with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over the study, Burgreen has held seven community forums on the 
shootings, most of which have been poorly attended. He said he has personally 
met with more than 300 police officers to seek their opinions, and department 
representatives have visited 15 law enforcement agencies, including the FBI's 
Virginia headquarters, the Phoenix and Kansas City police departments, and the 
Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens police review board is examining all officer-involved shootings and 
will make its findings known to the police chief and city manager. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times last month, Burgreen said he was looking at new 
equipment for the department and more extensive training for both rookie and 
veteran officers. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said that, although the changes will not be earth-shattering, he 
believes they will have a great impact on the department.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: MURDER TRIAL OF HARE KRISHNA DEVOTEE NEAR END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prosecution began its closing arguments Wednesday in the trial of a Hare 
Krishna devotee charged with murdering a critic of the faith. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Drescher, 42, is charged with the March 22, 1986, murder of Stephen L. 
Bryant, a disillusioned Krishna follower who had called for the death of 
Kirtanananda Swami Bhaktipada, Drescher's spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Drescher shot Bryant twice in the head with a 
.45-caliber pistol as the victim sat in his parked van a few blocks from the 
Hare Krishna temple in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris is scheduled to finish his arguments Monday 
in Van Nuys Superior Court, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district 
attorney's office. The trial is expected to go to the jury by the middle of 
next week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, of Royal Oak, Mich., died about a year after launching a crusade 
against Bhaktipada, whom Bryant accused of drug trafficking, prostitution and 
child abuse.

CHILD-MOLESTING CHARGES DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A father accused of sodomizing his 5-year-old son who later died of AIDS won't 
be prosecuted, a Municipal Court judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour preliminary hearing Tuesday, Judge S. Patricia Rosenbaum 
said there was insufficient evidence and dismissed the molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most tragic case I've seen, and I hope I don't see another like 
it," Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Henderson Sr., 27, who had maintained his innocence and denied he was 
infected with the AIDS virus, collapsed into the arms of his lawyer and cried 
upon hearing the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
His estranged wife, Terry, who testified against him, dropped her head to her 
knees and also cried. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Henderson was filed in June after Michael Henderson Jr. told 
his mother that his father had molested him, according to testimony at 
Tuesday's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The boy died in August, after a nearly two-year battle against acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Before the boy's allegations, the family and doctors had no idea how the child 
might have contracted the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Henderson, 25, testified that her son had no blood transfusions, which 
are one way the AIDS virus can be transmitted. But, outside court Tuesday, she 
said she was unconvinced that the boy got the disease from his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really say because I don't really know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Henderson Sr. twice tested positive for the AIDS virus, but he says the 
tests were faulty. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm not sick, and I know I don't have AIDS," he said outside court. 
"And I didn't molest my son. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my name cleared. I didn't want my boy to go to his death thinking that 
his daddy was a molester." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said he believed the allegations against him stemmed from a dispute 
with his wife and her family over child custody after the breakup of their 
marriage.

CAL STATE SAN MARCOS BOOK CENTER WILL SPEAK THESE KIDS' LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although American children have enjoyed a smorgasbord of literary offerings, 
from Dr. Seuss to Roald Dahl, Spanish-speaking youngsters have been starved for 
books, or sometimes force-fed a diet of political propaganda under the guise of 
children's literature, a North County educator contends. 
</P>
<P>
Although the situation has improved, American educators have not recognized the 
growing collection of quality children's books written in Spanish, said Isabel 
Schon, professor of reading education and library science at Cal State San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Schon will unveil a literary center that she believes is the largest 
contemporary collection of its kind in the world. The Center for the Study of 
Books in Spanish for Children and Adolescents, on the Cal State San Marcos 
campus, will show educators the types of quality Spanish-language children's 
books that are available, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which is open to the public, features more than 5,000 children's 
books in Spanish and books in English about Latino cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Schon said the center, which will have a bilingual staff, will encourage 
reading among children who speak only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"No country in the world compares to America in the quality and quantity of 
children's books in English," she said. "In the Spanish-speaking world, one has 
to be much more selective." 
</P>
<P>
"Ninos de Vietnam," published in Cuba, is an example of anti-American 
propaganda, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The children of Vietnam suffered so that the Cuban children will be happier 
today," according to the book. 
</P>
<P>
Although quality Spanish-language books do exist, Schon said, teachers and 
librarians often buy translations of popular English children's books because 
it is easier than looking for good original texts. 
</P>
<P>
"In the States, an overwhelming majority of teachers and librarians say they 
prefer to buy the translations because they know the books, and it's easier to 
read the translation of something, but they ignore the beautiful and authentic 
literature of the Spanish-speaking world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes the center, with its bibliographies and lists of Spanish-language 
publishers, will persuade teachers and librarians otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The center also has a collection of English books on Latino culture, which 
Schon called another much-needed resource. 
</P>
<P>
"I can count them on my hands the number of good books about Hispanic children 
in English," she said, adding that many such books often give the "tourist 
view" of life south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, school librarians have been slow to recognize the need for 
Spanish-language books, Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
"School librarians seem to have more negative attitudes against books in 
Spanish being in either the library or the classroom," she said, citing a 
survey of nearly 500 teachers, librarians and school administrators throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"These (librarians) are not professionally trained people, and I want to 
believe it's an attitude of ignorance and these people . . . do not have the 
understanding and awareness needed," Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
One in five respondents to the survey, which was conducted last March, said 
they agreed with the statement that "books in Spanish for children and 
adolescents are not needed in this school." 
</P>
<P>
Nine percent of the respondents said that using school funds to buy books in 
Spanish for children "is not in the best educational interests of young 
Hispanics in the U.S.," a response Schon finds frightening. 
</P>
<P>
"All research shows that (Spanish-speaking students) are going to be better 
readers and students if they start to read in the language they know and 
understand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Children who are native Spanish speakers and readers and are immersed into 
English become frustrated and discouraged, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we give them the books in Spanish, after three years they transfer to 
English, and in six years they are reading like their peers," Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
Several educators interviewed in San Diego County support Schon's position and 
have plans to take advantage of the center. 
</P>
<P>
"We have many students in San Diego that are coming to school with Spanish as 
their first language, and it's very important that we have quality materials in 
literature and language arts available to teach," said Rosalia Salinas, 
director of the statewide California Language Minority project. 
</P>
<P>
"When students come, if they come at an early age, we need to develop their 
reading and writing skills in the language they already speak, and not hold up 
their educational growth," Salinas said.

SHIFTING SANDS TO GIVE A BOOST TO BELEAGUERED CABRILLO BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE SAN PEDRO BEACH WILL BE WIDENED BY ABOUT 250 FEET WITH SAND 
EXCAVATED DURING CONSTRUCTION AT THE HYPERION SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outer portion of Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro, devastated by more than 25 
years of ocean currents and winter storms, will be widened by about 250 feet 
thanks to construction at a sewage treatment plant nearly 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 cubic yards of sand will be excavated next fall near the city 
of Los Angeles' Hyperion treatment plant in Playa del Rey and hauled by truck 
to San Pedro, under a plan approved by city recreation and parks officials on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal needs several other local, state and federal approvals, all of 
which are expected by the end of January. Officials from the city, county and 
Army Corps of Engineers have been working on the proposal since August, 1989, 
when it was suggested by Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
The excavation project at Hyperion is part of a multibillion dollar effort to 
improve the city's sewage treatment system. The sand must be moved to make way 
for a series of concrete settling tanks that will be used in the final stages 
of sewage treatment. 
</P>
<P>
About 750,000 cubic yards of sand were removed from the site nearly three years 
ago and deposited on Dockweiler and El Segundo beaches, both of which suffer 
similar erosion problems. The sand for all of the projects comes from a 
previously undeveloped knoll just south of the treatment plant on Vista del Mar 
and has been tested for impurities. 
</P>
<P>
"The beach at Cabrillo is disappearing," said Dale Hall, a planner with the 
county Department of Beaches and Harbors, which operates Cabrillo Beach for the 
city of Los Angeles. "The choice was to take the sand from Hyperion and dump it 
somewhere, or put it on the beach. This works to everyone's advantage." 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers, which has jurisdiction over the federal breakwater 
abutting Cabrillo Beach, warned in 1987 that the massive wall separating Los 
Angeles Harbor from the Pacific Ocean could be damaged if erosion at Cabrillo 
Beach continues unchecked. The corps estimated at that time that the outer 
beach, which buffers the rocky breakwater from the ocean's waves, loses 10,000 
cubic yards of sand each year. 
</P>
<P>
County officials concurred that a breach in the breakwater was "a distinct 
possibility" and said winter storms pose a particular threat to a parking lot 
and road along the breakwater. County officials estimate that winter storms in 
1984 and 1985 caused $25,000 in damage to the lot, which had received a 
$900,000 overhaul after severe winter storms in 1983. The county spent an 
additional $240,000 on the lot after storms in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The man-made beach has been locked in a constant struggle with the sea since it 
was built in 1927. Unlike the inner portion of Cabrillo Beach, which is located 
inside the breakwater, the outer beach doubles as a recreation area and a 
fortress, protecting both the breakwater and the harbor behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The beach, which attracted 1.6 million visitors last year, extends 3,000 feet 
along the outside breakwater from cliffs near Point Fermin. It has no natural 
source of sand supply and was last replenished in the early 1960s with 1.2 
million cubic yards of material dredged from the Los Angeles and Long Beach 
harbors. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the beach was about 250 feet wide, but 25 years of waves and 
storms have whittled away tons of sand, leaving some areas less than 50 feet 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
The replenishment project is expected to initially widen the beach by about 300 
feet and add about 10 acres in surface area. After the sand settles and reaches 
what officials call "an equilibrium condition," the beach is expected to be 
about 250 feet wider and 6.8 acres larger. About 40,000 cubic yards of sand 
will be deposited in a back-shore dune to provide additional protection against 
waves and to act as a reserve for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The hauling of the sand from Playa del Rey to San Pedro -- expected to take 
three to five months -- was originally scheduled to begin next April, but 
delays at Hyperion and concerns about the spawning of grunion have pushed the 
start date into September or October. Tentative plans call for the creation of 
an offshore berm with the first loads of sand to create a temporary beach for 
the grunion, which slither out of the water every spring and summer to lay 
their eggs in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists at the Cabrillo Marine Museum and officials from the state 
Department of Fish and Game are collecting data on grunion spawning at Cabrillo 
Beach, which will be used to devise a final plan for distributing the sand, 
officials said. An environmental report prepared by the county concludes that 
it will be "impossible to avoid impacts on grunion spawning entirely," but 
states the grunion will ultimately benefit from the wider beach. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles will pay for the replenishment project, with most of 
the money coming from the Hyperion construction account. Allan Kawaguchi, an 
engineer for Hyperion, said officials there agreed to pay a contractor to haul 
the sand to San Pedro since they would have had to haul it to a landfill 
anyway. Once the sand is at the beach, the city's Department of Recreation and 
Parks will spread it, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had no cost estimate for the project, but they described the 
arrangement as a bargain. The final cost, they said, will depend in large part 
upon bids received for hauling the sand. In 1987, the Army Corps of Engineers 
estimated it would cost $1.9 million to replenish the beach with sand dredged 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have cost us a lot more to go out and buy the sand and bring it in," 
said Julie Mantrom, an aide to Flores. "By taking advantage of this unusual 
opportunity, we will be saving a lot of money."

WORK TO START SOON AT HARBOR CITY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction is expected to begin within two months on a multipurpose community 
building at Harbor City Park, culminating a decade-long effort to expand the 
park's recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"What a wonderful Christmas present for the Harbor City community," said Minnie 
Elliott, director of the 11-acre park at Lomita Boulevard and Frampton Avenue. 
"With a larger center, we will be able to accommodate more people." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners voted unanimously 
Monday to award a $1.65-million contract for the project, which will be built 
on the site of a basketball court next to a complex of three small park 
buildings. The center is scheduled to open in early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-square-foot building is to include a gymnasium, performing stage, 
director's office, two meeting rooms and a storage area. A basketball court 
will be constructed next to the building, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We could use more room, I tell you," said Hattie Averil, head of Hi Neighbors, 
one of three senior citizen clubs that meets weekly at the park. "The new 
building will be lovely. I think it will be a real asset to the park here." 
</P>
<P>
The new center will have a maximum occupancy of 900 people, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The park now has an office, a meeting room and a preschool room. The three 
buildings, constructed in 1965, have a combined capacity of 130 people, meaning 
large groups have had to meet at local elementary schools or at Narbonne High 
School. And the park's annual Christmas program is held elsewhere because the 
existing facilities are too small. 
</P>
<P>
"Harbor City has no community facilities," said Niki Tennant, Harbor City 
deputy to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the area. 
"I am ecstatic. They have been waiting for this for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Various community groups, including the Harbor City Teen Post, began lobbying 
for a multipurpose building about 10 years ago because the community had 
outgrown the existing facilities. Parks officials estimate 13,000 people visit 
the park each week and about 600 attend meetings or classes in the existing 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
At Flores' urging, the city applied several times for state parks money to 
build a new center, but was repeatedly turned down. Finally, in 1988, the state 
awarded the city a $1.5-million grant for the center. The city will also 
contribute so-called Quimby funds -- money collected from developers to help 
build parks -- toward construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
Even with money in hand, work on the new center has been delayed because of 
problems with choosing a builder. The city selected a construction company in 
July, but was forced to drop the company because it did not meet city 
requirements for minority- and women-owned subcontractors, according to Dallan 
Zamrzla, contract administrator for the Department of Recreation and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The city requested new bids in October, but the low bidder also ran into 
problems with the subcontractor requirement. At its meeting Monday, the parks 
board voted to award the contract to Mallcraft Inc., the second lowest bidder, 
which has been able to meet the subcontractor requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Mallcraft's bid of $1.65 million was $115,000 above the low bid.

CHARGES DROPPED IN FATAL SHOOTING BY ESTRANGED HUSBAND IN LOMITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criminal charges were dismissed Tuesday against a Lomita man who faced a murder 
trial for shooting the nearly identical twin brother of his estranged wife's 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
William Henry Hosken, 24, had been charged with first-degree murder for killing 
Kevin Pack during a July 9 confrontation in the courtyard of Hosken's 
condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
Although a South Bay Municipal Court judge decided in September that there was 
enough evidence for the case to progress to trial, Torrance Superior Court 
Judge Cecil J. Mills ruled Tuesday that Hosken was acting in self-defense when 
he shot Pack. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a motion by defense attorney Michael Norris, Mills ordered all 
charges against Hosken dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Hanlon had alleged that Hosken shot Pack after he 
mistook him for Steven Pack, the man's twin brother, who had been dating 
Hosken's wife, Donna. Donna Hosken testified during the preliminary hearing 
that her husband had threatened Steven Pack several times before the July 9 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hosken's attorney said his client had been jumped by Kevin Pack and 
two friends before he fired his gun. 
</P>
<P>
Hanlon, who said she found Tuesday's ruling "very surprising," said her office 
may either appeal Mills' decision or refile the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"There were substantial grounds to hold him to answer," she said. "What I'm 
saying is that a jury should have decided this." 
</P>
<P>
After his ruling, Mills declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony during the preliminary hearing in September, Kevin Pack 
and two friends went to Hosken's home the night of the shooting to try to 
resolve the conflict between Hosken and Steven Pack. 
</P>
<P>
The trio apparently used a false name to try to get Hosken to open the 
complex's security gate. 
</P>
<P>
After Hosken refused, his lawyer said Tuesday, he heard other buzzers being 
rung in neighboring units and then heard voices in the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified that Hosken grabbed a gun and went into the courtyard as 
the three entered. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately a fight ensued, and Hosken fired two shots at Pack, striking 
him twice in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pack's friends say they simply wanted to talk to Hosken, Norris said 
other testimony indicated that they did not intend to do any talking. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no idea who these people were who were ringing his unit . . . and as 
soon as they see him, they jump on him," Norris said. "This was hardly a 
peace-keeping mission. . . . I think they thought they were on a commando 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill acted reasonably and, although it's an absolutely tragic situation that 
should have never happened, the criminal charges weren't right," Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
Hosken's wife, however, said Tuesday she believes Hosken fired the shots 
deliberately in the belief that he was killing her lover. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept telling me that he was going to kill me and he was going to kill 
Steve," she said. "The justice system is really messed up."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO SUSPECTS IN SLAYING OF 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police said Thursday they have no suspect or motive in the slaying 
of a young Wilmington woman and her son who were found stabbed to death Sunday 
morning in their new home in the 1000 block of M Street. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Marilyn Galloway, 27, and her son, Jose Morales, 12, were 
discovered about 10 a.m. by a neighbor, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Detective Larry Kallestad said the discovery came several days after 
Galloway last reported to work at a local fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, Kallestad said, had moved to the house in Wilmington within the 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Though police have not identified any suspect, Kallestad said they believe the 
killer was known to the victims because there were no signs of forced entry. 
Likewise, Kallestad said it was suspected that Galloway's son was slain because 
he could have identified his mother's killer. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are only suppositions at this point, but they are viable suppositions," 
said Kallestad. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are hoping for some significant leads to develop from our 
analysis of physical evidence," Kallestad added. The evidence includes what 
authorities believe to be the murder weapon, he said.

PROPOSAL TO BAN LEAF BLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Del Mar City Council listened to pleas from its citizens for relief and 
passed an ordinance, over a year ago, banning leaf blowers completely. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was not noise alone. 
</P>
<P>
The council's broader health concern was the gratuitous disbursement of pollen, 
dust, molds, dried animal and bird droppings and gas fumes. 
</P>
<P>
It was apparent that blowers do exactly that -- they blow. They merely move 
filth from one place to another. 
</P>
<P>
The ban is supported by real gardeners and horticulturists who recognize that 
foliage covered with dust is prone to disease and subsequent spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Our neighborhoods and business areas are once again as quiet as they were 15 
years ago. Now we hear the simple, gentle sound of rakes and brooms. And, 
perhaps allergy seasons are shortened. 
</P>
<P>
We hope that Los Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude's measure passes!

HOLIDAY WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
SELECTIVE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Glen, a self-proclaimed "customer terrorist," took a tour of a shopping 
mall with a Times reporter recently. The amusing, somewhat sadomasochistic 
mission was to point out bad customer service and ways the consumer can fight 
back. 
</P>
<P>
We all know the blood-boiling stuff: The it's-not-my-department sales 
associates. Sales people chronicling their dates while you wait at the counter 
with full arms. The clerk who's deeply examining the chip in her or his nail 
polish but is too busy to tell you where the nearest bathroom is. 
</P>
<P>
During a holiday season in which many stores expect to go begging for 
customers, the egregious examples of bad service will probably be few. But Glen 
is prepared for any contingency. His most dramatic weapon is a scream: "Help!" 
-- which of course brings it running. 
</P>
<P>
We have a few other ideas for those little extras likely to attract quick 
customer service: 1) A toddler -- one with sticky hands -- anywhere near silks, 
bone china or designer fountain pens. 2) Name-dropping -- but the names must be 
distinctive and in film or television: A Spielberg here, a Bochco there, within 
earshot of an ambitious sales associate. 
</P>
<P>
But before all that, we suggest something that's a bit radical in these days of 
so much talk about self-empowerment and taking charge. Perhaps a "Please" or 
"Excuse me, I really need your help." OK. Maybe those approaches are 
lily-livered and surrender too much power to the people who are paid to provide 
service. But it is, after all, the season of giving.

MANHATTAN BEACH GIVES INITIAL OK TO ZONING REVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents in the oceanfront area of Manhattan Beach passed out circulars in 
City Council Chambers Tuesday demanding that the council "Leave the Beach 
Alone!" in a citywide zoning update. 
</P>
<P>
They got a lot of what they wanted as the council gave preliminary approval to 
a comprehensive zoning ordinance revision program -- commonly called ZORP -- 
that permits larger homes on some beach lots than an earlier version, which had 
incensed beach area residents two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Under a formula approved by the council for single-family property at the 
beach, structures on small lots will retain their current square footage 
limits. Owners of larger lots will be limited to building smaller structures 
than currently permitted, but the cutback is not as severe as a proposal that 
earlier had received tentative council approval. 
</P>
<P>
That version of ZORP was attacked in October by beach residents, who charged 
that they were facing greater restrictions on house sizes than any other part 
of the city. Councilman Bob Holmes, who lives near the beach, likened it to 
"going in with a chain saw instead of a scalpel." 
</P>
<P>
"We had some 33% cuts (in beach-area house sizes), which were extreme compared 
to what we were doing in other sections," Councilwoman Connie Sieber said after 
Tuesday's council session. "What we did got them lined up more equally." 
</P>
<P>
A key issue in ZORP is the floor area ratio, which links allowable 
square-footage of homes to lot size. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing the floor area ratio for homes in beach 
neighborhoods, the council gave owners of multiple-residential property -- much 
of it in the beach area -- a break by excluding parking areas as a factor in 
determining floor area. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, residents will gain living space because garages will not be 
included in calculations of floor area. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is expected to be given final approval Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Although the voluminous ZORP document touches on everything from height limits 
and setbacks to parking requirements and neighborhood preservation, house size 
has been the magnet of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Square-footage is being rolled back throughout the city in response to 
complaints that huge buildings are replacing older, smaller homes. However, 
numerous hearings before the council have drawn a spectrum of opinions, from 
those who say their dream is to have a big home in Manhattan Beach to others 
who decry the "yuppification" of a quaint beach town. 
</P>
<P>
The final ZORP hearing Tuesday drew overwhelming opposition from people unhappy 
that they will not be able to build larger homes. But City Manager Bill Smith 
urged the council to approve the ordinance, saying: "You can't make everyone 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance calls for public hearings and a review within one year. "We will 
go back there and repair and amend where we need to," Mayor Steve Barnes said. 
"Things will turn up that need changing."

PROPOSAL TO BAN LEAF BLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend you for acknowledging the negative impacts of leaf blowers ("It's 
Time to Throttle Leaf Blowers," On California, by Robert A. Jones, Nov. 27). 
Noise pollution is only one impact associated with leaf blowers that I have 
coined the "mechanical devices from hell." 
</P>
<P>
Leaf blowers also are the culprits of two other sources of air pollution. Their 
two-cycle motors belch out blue smoke via the oil/gas mixture fuel. During the 
deceptive process of cleaning an area they create substantial volumes of dust 
that become airborne only to lodge in our respiratory systems. 
</P>
<P>
Indian Wells has received a positive response to our recently enacted ordinance 
banning their use. I can only hope that other cities follow this positive and 
environmentally sound action.

MAX PLANS TO SHIFT EL SEGUNDO ROUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Routes will be altered on MAX, the Municipal Area Express transit system that 
has been transporting commuters to aerospace companies in and around El Segundo 
for the last eight months. 
</P>
<P>
MAX officials say they hope the changes, effective Dec. 17, will continue the 
system's steady increase in riders. MAX is reporting an average of 2,495 riders 
boarding weekly, or 300 more than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that recent fuel prices have encouraged people to ride the bus," 
said John E. Wills, MAX program administrative assistant. Better marketing and 
commuters' desire to "ease up morning stress a little bit" could also be 
helping the system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The MAX line serving the South Bay beach cities will be rerouted in the El 
Segundo area and lengthened southward. Planners say the change is expected to 
more than double the number of passengers on the beach cities line, or Line 1, 
where ridership has lagged behind that of the other two lines of the 
8-month-old bus system. 
</P>
<P>
As Line 1 buses approach the aerospace companies, they will stop first at the 
TRW complex near Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Aviation Boulevard. The 25-seat 
white-and-blue buses then will continue north to serve other companies. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of Line 1, a new park-and-ride lot is being added at the 
Riviera United Methodist Church at Palos Verdes Boulevard and Calle Miramar in 
Torrance. The lot will serve as the southern terminus of Line 1, which 
currently ends farther north at Catalina Avenue and Avenue I. 
</P>
<P>
The lot may attract more commuters from the western part of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
MAX planners are also extending the Torrance-San Pedro route, or Line 3, to 
serve the U.S. Air Force housing complex near Western Avenue and 25th Street. 
The Air Force and the city of Los Angeles requested the change to transport 
people who live in the complex and work in El Segundo, MAX officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, buses on all three MAX lines will now make stops closer to the 
Hughes Radar Systems Group and Space and Communications Group buildings at 
Sepulveda Boulevard and Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
MAX is a joint project of nine South Bay cities and Los Angeles County. The 
first buses began running April 18 on lines formerly used by three older 
systems. Funding comes from fares, a Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission demonstration grant funded by Proposition A and from local cities' 
share of Proposition A money. 
</P>
<P>
The system recently won a 1990 Transportation Award of Excellence from Commuter 
Transportation Services Inc. and the Southern California Assn. of Governments.

<P>
CITIZEN DIPLOMACY: SELF- CREDENTIALED EMISSARIES TREK TO BAGHDAD, WHERE THEY 
ARE EAGERLY SEIZED ON BY IRAQI PROPAGANDISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS K. BAKER, Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers 
University, is the author of House and Senate (W. W. Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presence of former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali in Iraq may seem an 
insignificant event except for the fact that he was just the latest in a train 
of self-credentialed mediators bucking for Nobel Peace prizes who have flown 
off to Damascus to peddle their good offices. 
</P>
<P>
These pilgrimages pose serious problems for President Bush and great 
opportunities for Saddam Hussein, for the longer the gulf crisis continues 
without resolution, the more the would-be middlemen will come to represent to 
the Iraqi dictator the soft underbelly of American public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural visit was made by Jesse Jackson, who hoped, perhaps, to pull off 
another spectacular prisoner release like the one he engineered with the 
Syrians, after they shot down a U.S. Navy pilot during the American military 
involvement in Lebanon. Jackson was followed in Baghdad by an assortment of 
free-lance plenipotentiaries that included rock singer Cat Stevens, a convert 
to Islam who had enthusiastically echoed the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call 
for the slaughter of novelist Salman Rushdie. Former Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark 
made the trip in his trademark corduroy jacket and seemed to suggest that 
Saddam Hussein is really quite a reasonable guy who simply has a beef with the 
United States. The implication is that the President of the United States is 
truculent and bloody-minded and just spoiling for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern for this loose-cannon diplomacy was established during the Iran 
hostage crisis when a succession of Westerners went to Tehran to atone publicly 
for all the indignities, real and fancied, that the United States had heaped on 
Iran and to join the miserable captives for a round of Christmas carols. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Waldheim visited Iran in his capacity as secretary general of the United 
Nations and was almost lynched by a mob. Clark fancied that he had some 
credibility with the abductors because of a career spent in public penance for 
having served as Lyndon Johnson's attorney general. He was followed by a throng 
of dissident U.S. clerics who disgraced themselves by playing into the hands of 
the captors. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that all you need today to suit up as a mediator is the price of a 
ticket to Baghdad and some flimsy, self-conferred title such as "peace 
activist." These will virtually guarantee an audience with the dictator, who 
will use your presence to proclaim to the world that Iraq has no quarrel with 
the American people, just its imperialistic government and mad-dog President. 
It's a cinch that the longer the standoff continues, the more likely we are to 
see these aspiring Henry Kissingers jaunting off to Baghdad. And as Iraqi 
propagandists seize eagerly on these events and crank out videotape that shows 
Americans shaking hands with this thuggish dictator, the greater is the 
likelihood that some simple souls in this country will demand that we see the 
crisis from Hussein's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
It may be time to dust off the Logan Act and encourage the Department of 
Justice to prosecute these meddlers who are fostering in Saddam Hussein some 
dangerous illusions about American opinion. The act, passed by Congress in 1798 
in response to the private diplomacy of a Philadelphia doctor named George 
Logan, was designed to forbid just the kind of amateur statecraft that seems to 
be so fashionable in dissident circles today. Both the radicals of the French 
Directoire in 1798 and the regime of Saddam Hussein hoped to manipulate 
unofficial American emissaries to drive a wedge between the American people and 
their government. 
</P>
<P>
If Hussein wants to jerk our chain, let him at least not be assisted in the 
maneuver by American hands. Diplomacy may be too important to be left solely to 
diplomats, but it is surely too critical to be impeded by a bunch of dabblers 
whose private agendas may be quite incompatible with the best interests of the 
United States and whose activities may suggest falsely to Hussein that our 
domestic debate over the proper course to take in the gulf crisis is a weakness 
that he can exploit.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE GULF CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
IF WE START A WAR, CAN WE STOP IT?; 
</P>
<P>
INVASION OF IRAQ WOULD HAVE MYRIAD FAR-REACHING REPERCUSSIONS WITH ONLY ONE 
CERTAINTY: WE'D BE LARGELY ON OUR OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI, Zbigniew Brzezinski was President Jimmy Carter's 
national security adviser. This is adapted from his testimony Wednesday before 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the possibility that the United States might be plunged by a presidential 
decision into a war with Iraq, I urge (the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) 
to examine carefully and press the Administration for answers regarding the 
following three clusters of critically important issues: 
</P>
<P>
1) What are the political limits and the likely geopolitical dynamics of war, 
once the President decides to initiate it? 
</P>
<P>
For example, one has to be concerned that the use of air power in order to 
mitigate casualties for U.S. ground forces will require the killing not only of 
the hostages but also of thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands or even more -- 
of Iraqi civilians, who are not to be held responsible for Saddam Hussein's 
flagrant misconduct. I wonder if this is politically viable, in terms of the 
longer-range relationship of America with the Muslim world. And is it morally 
admissible? 
</P>
<P>
It is also not clear to me how the Administration envisages the termination of 
the war. Are we counting on a total surrender or a negotiated outcome after a 
spasm of violence? If a complete military victory becomes necessary, are we 
prepared to occupy all of Iraq? Are we logistically prepared for a war that is 
not promptly resolved by air power, and are we psychologically prepared for 
heavy American casualties? 
</P>
<P>
Once war begins, Iran and Syria may not remain passive and the war could 
spread. One has to anticipate the possibility that Iraq will seek to draw 
Israel into the war. Does the Administration have a contingency plan in the 
event that Jordan becomes a battlefield? What might be the U.S. reaction if 
some Israeli leaders seek to take advantage of an expanded war to effect the 
expulsion of all Palestinians from their homes on the West Bank? The gulf 
crisis and the Arab-Israeli conflict could thus become linked, our efforts to 
the contrary notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
I believe the Administration is paying insufficient attention to these inherent 
uncertainties of war. The war could prove more destructive, more bloody, and 
more difficult to terminate than Administration spokesmen and sundry private 
advocates of war seem to think. An American military invasion of Iraq would be 
likely to set off a chain reaction that could bog America down in a variety of 
prolonged security operations, in a setting of intensified political 
instability. 
</P>
<P>
2) What are the likely broader after-effects of the war? 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is yet to move beyond vague generalities regarding its 
concept of the postwar Middle East. Yet considerable anxiety is justified that 
the United States might not be able to extricate itself from the Middle Eastern 
caldron, especially if in the meantime the Arab masses have become radicalized 
and hostile to the Arab regimes that endorsed the U.S. military action. 
</P>
<P>
With the United States embroiled in the Middle Eastern mess for years to come, 
Europe and Japan -- free to promote their own agendas -- would pursue 
enhancement of their economic power. 
</P>
<P>
It is probable that fundamentalist Iran would become the dominant power in the 
Persian Gulf, and that terrorist Syria would inherit the mantle of leadership 
among the Arabs. It is also possible that the destruction of Iraq by America 
and the resulting radicalization of the Arabs might leave Israel, armed as it 
already is with nuclear weapons, more tempted to use its military force to 
impose its will in this volatile region. 
</P>
<P>
None of the above possible developments would be in the American interest. Yet 
I do not sense that sufficient strategic planning has been devoted by the 
Administration to an analysis of the wider shock effects of a war that is bound 
to be exploited by other parties for their own selfish ends. 
</P>
<P>
3) Finally, what is being done to ensure that the war's burdens and sacrifices 
are more fairly distributed among its potential beneficiaries or participants? 
</P>
<P>
One cannot help but be struck by the relatively limited contributions of our 
allies. Some states with forces in Saudi Arabia have indicated that they will 
not participate in offensive operations. The American public certainly is not 
satisfied with the financial support extended by Germany and Japan. Is the 
Adminisitration satisfied? What additional financial contribution can be 
expected from the Saudis and the Kuwaitis? It is noteworthy that Saudi Arabia 
has already benefited very substantially from the oil crisis, and that the emir 
of Kuwait and his family are in the forefront of those arguing for Americans to 
initiate military action. Are we thus -- despite all of our rhetoric about "the 
new international order" -- not running the risk of becoming the mercenaries in 
this war, applauded and financed by others to do the fighting and the dying for 
them? 
</P>
<P>
I believe that it is already evident that the principle sacrifices of war -- 
both financial and in blood -- will have to be borne by America, and to a 
massively disproportionate degree. Such evident unfairness will inevitably have 
a very adverse impact on American attitudes toward its allies, with deleterious 
consequences for American public support for the so-called international order. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in my view, neither an American war to liberate Kuwait nor a 
preventive war to destroy Iraq's power is urgently required, be it in terms of 
the American national interest or of the imperatives of world order. President 
Bush's initial commitment to punish Iraq and to deter it remains the wisest 
course, and one that this nation can resolutely and in unity sustain over the 
long haul. 
</P>
<P>
By any rational calculus, the trade-offs between the discomforts of patience 
and the costs of war favor patience. Both time and power are in our favor, and 
we do not need to be driven by artificial deadlines, deceptive arguments, or 
irrational emotion into an unnecessary war.

</P>
<P>
TRADE: LATIN AMERICA, MORE THAN CENTRAL EUROPE, OFFERS AN INVESTMENT CLIMATE 
THAT CAN WITHSTAND ECONOMIC SHOCKS.

<P>
When the forces of political and economic liberalization were unleashed in 
Eastern Europe last year, the international financial community quickly turned 
cool to Latin America. Yet it is Latin America that is now showing itself to be 
better positioned to shoulder the tough challenges immediately ahead of both 
regions: a huge debt overhang, a new round of energy price shocks and the 
consolidation of the 12 countries of the European Community into a powerful 
common market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Both Latin America and Eastern Europe are straining to service a large external 
debt. Neither has been able to obtain the necessary levels of new financing or 
to secure significant reductions in interest or principal. Yet, during this 
time of fierce international competition for capital and relatively few breaks 
from the commercial banks or official lenders, Latin America is coming out 
ahead. Bob McCormack, head of Citicorp's country debt review committee, 
explains that bankers are leaning toward "known quantities, like a Mexico, a 
Venezuela or a Brazil rather than sink themselves very deeply into a region 
whose future economic outlook could remain uncertain for a good part of the 
next decade." The statement shows just how fickle the international financial 
community can be -- a lesson that the Eastern European countries are learning 
the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
On the energy question, the volatility of the price of intermediate crude oil 
could be disastrous for both regions, but probably more so for Eastern Europe. 
The price disruptions have hit at a time when Poland and Hungary, like Brazil 
and Argentina, are buckling down to complete stringent economic stabilization 
programs, while the East Europeans are also trying to make a difficult 
full-scale transition to market capitalism. At the same time, the East 
Europeans are being called on to devise a set of remedies for "stagflation," 
the combined effect of rapid inflation and immediate recession. This problem, 
familiar to Western officials from previous oil price shocks, is one that the 
East, long buffered by state controls, has had little practice in solving. The 
East's energy plight is compounded by its oil dependence on the Soviet Union, 
which has begun charging its former satellites world prices in hard currency 
for petroleum imports. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America's track record in managing oil price hikes has been far from 
exemplary. It was, of course, the reckless borrowing of recycled petrodollars 
in the 1970s that landed the region in its present debt quagmire. Yet Latin 
America does not have to start from scratch in designing the financial 
institutions and policy tools for managing the crises commonly related to 
energy price shocks. It also has indigenous oil supplies and alternative fuel 
resources to fall back on in the event of a long-term supply crunch. In view of 
the harsh economic impacts felt the world over from the two major oil supply 
disruptions of the 1970s, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that the 
latest shocks could set Eastern Europe's market reform effort back several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, for all the economic synergy surrounding "EC 1992," Eastern Europe has 
not had much luck getting in on the action. Despite the signing of a joint 
declaration that normalized relations between Eastern and Western Europe in 
1988, Eastern Europe's trade with the EC stands exactly where it did in 1958, 
at just 2.9% of Western Europe's trade balance. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Eastern European exporters are still six times more likely to be 
hassled by EC "anti-dumping" measures than producers from elsewhere. The 
improvement of East-West trade ties will be hampered by the comparatively poor 
quality of most Eastern products, and because of tensions related to shared 
export structures between the East and new EC members like Portugal and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America, though braced for the worst, has done slightly better with the 
EC. Though its highly protectionist barriers on agriculture and other consumer 
products show no signs of loosening soon, the EC still purchased 21% of Latin 
America's exports in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the region's more sophisticated firms have begun to operate directly 
within the EC, an option that would probably be unthinkable for firms from the 
East. This is so with producers of Argentine foodstuffs and several Brazilian 
paper-industry companies, all of which have moved into production niches left 
empty by investors who could no longer hold costs down within the EC's 
hyper-competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
As West European transnational companies become stronger under the thrust of EC 
1992 and seek to expand their production networks into low-cost foreign 
locations, Latin America is frequently mentioned as a preferred candidate for 
subsidiary component supply operations. Mexico and Brazil are already 
successful in that role, producing for U.S. transnationals in such sectors as 
motor vehicles, computers and pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
Again, until a convincing set of price signals and investment norms is in 
place, Eastern Europe will not make this short list. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the development debate was leaning in favor of a debt bailout for 
Latin America, while Eastern Europe was hailed as virgin territory for private 
initiative and capital. Now the tables have turned: Although both regions still 
need a break on debt, Eastern Europe is clearly going to need a bigger break 
from public and private lenders and its immediate neighbors in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America needs encouragement, mostly through U.S. trade and investment 
incentives, to barrel ahead with the economic reforms that most states in the 
region are perfectly capable of making.

KINGS HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A TIE; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: GAME WITH THE JETS STRETCHES LOS ANGELES' WINLESS STREAK TO FIVE GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Coach Tom Webster has replaced injured Tomas Sandstrom with Luc Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
He has kept his team in a tie for the Smythe Division lead. 
</P>
<P>
He has prevented the Calgary Flames from moving ahead for yet another day. 
</P>
<P>
What more could a coach ask for? 
</P>
<P>
How about a victory? 
</P>
<P>
Although the Kings held on to tie the Winnipeg Jets Wednesday night, 3-3, 
before a Forum crowd of 14,646, the game extended the Kings' winless streak to 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd better get our act together," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kings take the ice for a Forum rematch with Winnipeg Saturday, it will 
mark two full weeks since their last victory. 
</P>
<P>
Over that span, the Kings are 0-2-3. But, with a 16-7-4 record, they are even 
with the Flames, 4-1 winners over the New York Rangers Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets held on to fourth place in the division by one point over the 
fast-closing Edmonton Oilers. Winnipeg is 9-17-5. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing like a bunch of losers, but we're going to have to play a 
lot better," King goalie Kelly Hrudey said. 
</P>
<P>
"The confidence just isn't there. Two weeks ago, we were saying, 'What's this 
team coming into our building thinking they are going to take a point.' Now we 
don't have that confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille played on the first line with Wayne Gretzky and Tony Granato. 
Sandstrom is out with a small fracture in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Robitaille from the second line didn't hamper its effectiveness 
early in thegame. 
</P>
<P>
Just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with replacement Mike Donnelly on his left side, center Todd Elik used 
the occasion to make his own reappearance in the goal-scoring column. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring only one goal in his last nine games, Elik struck in the first 
period Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Battling Phil Housley along the left boards, Elik controlled the puck, rushed 
the net and scored with a wrist shot over the stick of Winnipeg goalie Richard 
Tabaracci at the 5:50 mark. It was Elik's ninth goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets tied the score at 16:16 of the period on Pat Elynuik's team-leading 
11th goal. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg went ahead at 10:05 of the second period on Paul MacDermid's fifth 
goal, but Robitaille's 12th goal, and his first with his new linemates, again 
deadlocked the game only 23 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky put the Kings on top at 10:28 of the final period with his 17th goal to 
tie Sandstrom for the team lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Danton Cole sent the game into overtime with a strong single-handed effort. 
</P>
<P>
He skated in from the right side and shot, only to have Hrudey block the puck. 
</P>
<P>
But as he did so, the King goalie's momentum turned him away from Cole. The 
puck was still on the ice underneath Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
There was an opening of only about a foot between Hrudey and the ice as he 
started to fall,but that was all Cole, still in front of the net, needed to 
shove the puck in. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, Cole's fifth, came with 3:06 to play in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were outshot, 11-5 in the final regulation period, 2-1 in the 
overtime and 32-27 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The other team is working harder than we are," King center Steve Kasper said. 
"We shouldn't be going on the ice seeing how the other team is going to play. 
We should have a hunger." 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks without a victory, that hunger should reach the starvation 
level. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Forward Tomas Sandstrom could be out for a month, according to a club official. 
When Sandstrom suffered a small fracture in the lower back on Nov. 29 in St. 
Louis, it was estimated he'd be out a minimum of one to two weeks. Coach Tom 
Webster has since labeled that estimate "optimistic." Said Sandstrom, "I'm just 
taking it week by week. I feel a lot better than I did a week ago." The injury 
was originally believed to have occurred when Sandstrom slid into a goal post. 
Not so, Sandstrom said. "I cut in front of the net and got hit in the back with 
(Paul) Cavallini's stick." By the time Sandstrom hit the ice, the damage was 
already done. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Bob Halkidis was rushed up on emergency recall Wednesday afternoon 
to replace Brian Benning after Benning experienced back spasms in the morning 
practice. Halkidis was down in the farm system, first with New Haven and then 
Phoenix, working his way back into shape after off-season shoulder surgery. 
Halkidis had a goal, three assists and 10 penalty minutes with the New Haven 
Nighthawks in seven games. He had appeared in only two games for the Phoenix 
Roadrunners, getting a goal, an assist and four penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Jet center Thomas Steen is out with a fractured ankle. Teammate Mark Osborne, a 
left wing, is out three months with torn ligaments and a fracture in his thumb. 
. . . The rematch with Winnipeg Saturday at the Forum is also the last night of 
the Kings For Kids toy drive. Fans are asked to bring unwrapped toys to the 
game. The toys will be donated to the Los Angeles Children's Hospital and the 
Children's Hospital of Orange County for the holidays.

DAVE DISTEL: MCILVAINE FACED WITH A NEW SET OF WEAKNESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gee, I hate to see Robbie Alomar go. 
</P>
<P>
And, gee, I hate to see Joe Carter go. 
</P>
<P>
But I like it. I like Joe McIlvaine's first major trade as the Padres' general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Major? 
</P>
<P>
Trading Robbie Alomar and Joe Carter to Toronto for Fred McGriff and Tony 
Fernandez is major as in off the scale. This is a star-spangled stunner. 
</P>
<P>
Trader Jack, meet Trader Joe. These McGuys can McWheel and deal. 
</P>
<P>
Few trades of this magnitude are made in these days of free agents and no-trade 
clauses. One of the bigger trades of the 1989-90 offseason was the Dec. 6 deal 
which brought Carter to the Padres and sent an unproven catcher, Sandy Alomar 
Jr., to the Cleveland Indians. That Alomar, Robbie's brother, magnified the 
impact of that trade by becoming the American League rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
This trade, Wednesday afternoon's Windy City Whopper, involved four proven 
athletes. This one, the trade itself, gets exclamation points rather than 
question marks. 
</P>
<P>
OK, maybe one question. 
</P>
<P>
Who got the best of it? 
</P>
<P>
I have to score it even. 
</P>
<P>
You trade big sticks who can bust it to the tune of 30 home runs and 100 RBI a 
season, Carter for McGriff, and middle infielders who can play some defense and 
hit better than most middle infielders hit, Alomar for Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The first impulse was that giving up Alomar, at 22, was a little much. However, 
the psychological impact of the Padre manager, Greg Riddoch, having fired 
Alomar's father, third base coach Sandy, might have been a factor. There's also 
the fact that the Padres really wanted Alomar to play shortstop and he didn't 
really want to play shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
So what they do is trade for Fernandez, a mere 28 and a proven shortstop, and 
open second base for Bip Roberts, who is much more adept and adapted at that 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Padres came out of Wednesday in much better shape at second 
and short than they went into it, assuming they do not turn around and deal 
Roberts. That, at this point, would be risky business. 
</P>
<P>
And McGriff's arrival solves The Jack Clark Problem at first base. When Clark 
gets his "second-look" free agency, don't give him another look. Let him go. 
McGriff, 27, will be just fine at first base. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though this deal itself is not at all questionable, it does raise 
questions elsewhere in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Switching Roberts to his comfort zone at second base creates considerable 
discomfort at third base, where there is neither an incumbent nor an heir to 
the throne. The same applies to left field, which Carter vacates, having been 
in trades involving both Alomar brothers in the span of exactly 365 days. 
</P>
<P>
What the Padres did was make a blockbuster trade that moved their weaknesses 
around. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that this deal cannot be the bottom line if this team is 
going to move into contention in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
It does not negate the fact that San Francisco has picked up Willie McGee, Dave 
Righetti and Bud Black and the Dodgers have picked up Darryl Strawberry and 
Kevin Gross and Atlanta has picked up Terry Pendleton. The Padres had been 
ominously quiet in the face of all this activity. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
What they cannot do is think that shaking the rafters with such a trade will 
move them any further from the basement than they previously have been. 
</P>
<P>
This trade has to be a comma rather than a period. Something has to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Third base, left field and center field are vacant. And I don't see think the 
answer lies in further trades. The Padres are not stacked at any one position, 
such as they were a year ago when they had a catcher to "give" or Wednesday 
when they could deal Alomar and fill with Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Unless I'm getting a wrong read on this roster, filling one opening will create 
another. 
</P>
<P>
The answer lies in following their NL West brethren into the free-agent market. 
It will cost bucks, but didn't the hike in ticket prices come with the 
stipulation that it costs money to build a contender? 
</P>
<P>
Fine. Spend it. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Jim Presley and outfielder Tom Brunansky are both out there on 
the market. Those guys must be pursued. Get them both and you could play Ronnie 
Lott in center field and let him chase everything down. 
</P>
<P>
Presley and/or Brunansky would also fill another void. The departure of Carter 
and the imminent departure of Clark makes the Padres a bit vulnerable to 
left-handed pitching, what with both McGriff and Tony Gwynn batting from that 
side of the plate. The Padres need a right-handed "force" in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
There you have it, what they have done (open some eyes) and what they have to 
do (open their wallets).

ROWE NAMED SECOND TEAM ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State wide receiver Patrick Rowe's scrapbook season continued 
Wednesday when he was named to the second team of the Associated Press 
All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
In Aztec history, only wide receiver Webster Slaughter (second team, 1985) and 
offensive guard Pete Inge (second team, 1978, 1979) have placed that highly on 
the AP team. Defensive back Henry Williams was named second team to the United 
Press International's All-American team in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, a junior, and Miami's Wesley Carroll are AP's second-team wide receivers. 
The two named to the first team are Virginia's Herman Moore and Florida State's 
Lawrence Dawsey. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just overjoyed," Rowe said. "I felt quite honored because it was one of my 
preseason goals." 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that when Rowe met with Curtis Johnson, SDSU receivers' coach, 
before the season, he listed "honorable mention, All-American" as one of the 
things he would like to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"I put 'honorable mention' as a starting base," Rowe said. "And to (be) second 
team, that's quite an honor." 
</P>
<P>
But as far as AP goes, Rowe never could have made honorable mention. The wire 
service did away with the honorable mention portion of its All-American team 
last season. It names three teams. 
</P>
<P>
"He deserves it. He works hard. He had a hell of a year," said quarterback Dan 
McGwire, who was bypassed in favor of Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer, 
Virginia's Shawn Moore and Houston's David Klingler. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe finished the season with 71 passes caught for 1,392 yards and eight 
touchdowns. He led the nation with an average of 126.55 receiving yards per 
game and was fifth with 6.45 receptions per game. He set the NCAA record with 
nine consecutive games in which he had 100 or more yards receiving, surpassing 
the previous record of eight held by Howard Twilley (Tulsa, 1965) and Henry 
Ellard (Fresno State, 1982), and he and Dennis Arey became only the second 
receiving tandem in NCAA history to each have more than 1,000 yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe's 1,392 yards receiving also set Western Athletic Conference and SDSU 
single-season records. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gary Johnson of the NCAA, Rowe's nine consecutive games with more 
than 100 yards receiving is considered a single-season record, and if he 
continues his streak into next season it will be considered as a career record. 
The NCAA currently does not have a category for consecutive 100-yard games in a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, who was named to the all-WAC team last month, said he will return to SDSU 
next season and bypass the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay at State and get another year of experience and have another 
year of school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, second-team All-America status still leaves room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It leaves a lot of hard work," he said. "It makes me want to become first 
team, now." 
</P>
<P>
The players were selected by AP sports editor Darrell Christian, college 
football writer Rick Warner and regional AP sports writers.

Green Bay Packer quarterback Don Majkowski threw for 10 minutes before practice 
Wednesday and said he was encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
But whether he will be able to to play Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks 
remains uncertain. Majkowski suffered a deep bruise in the rotator cuff of his 
throwing shoulder Nov. 18 at Phoenix. He has not started the last two games and 
has been unable to throw in practice.

The Raiders put tight end Mike Dyal on injured reserve because of a pulled 
hamstring Wednesday and signed free-agent wide receiver Keith McDonald. Dyal, 
who started all 16 games in 1989, suffered the injury in Week 2 this season 
against the Seattle Seahawks and had been on injured reserve until last Sunday, 
when he was activated before the 23-20 victory over the Broncos in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
However, he was injured again in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The team also announced that it had signed tight end Rich Bartlewski and added 
him to the practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes said Wednesday that former USC star Rodney Peete 
would start at quarterback for the Lions against the Raiders Monday night at 
Pontiac, Mich. Peete had been plagued in recent weeks by a hamstring injury.

Injury Update: Wide receiver Aaron Cox and tight end Damone Johnson, both of 
whom missed last Sunday's 38-23 victory over the Browns in Cleveland, are 
listed as questionable for this Sunday because of sore hamstrings; cornerback 
Bobby Humphery is probable despite a calf injury. All three practiced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson agreed with New York Giant Coach Bill Parcells' 
controversial decision to bypass a field goal and go for the touchdown on 
fourth and goal while trailing the San Francisco 49ers, 7-3, Monday night. The 
Giants failed on the try and lost by the same score. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have gone for it," Robinson said without hesitation. "If you kick the 
field goal, the 49ers get the ball at the 30 probably, 25 or 30. Which is far 
different than at the nine. . . . You may never get the ball back. My thought 
was, you aren't ever going to get down there again. I would've gone for it. And 
the way it turned out, I would've been wrong." TIM KAWAKAMI

The Chargers on Wednesday signed cornerback Sammy Lilly and waived linebacker 
Antonio Goss, who was signed Nov. 21 when linebacker Richard Brown was put on 
injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly (5-9, 175) was selected in the eighth round of the 1988 draft by the New 
York Giants. After spending his rookie season on injured reserve because of a 
knee injury, he joined the Philadelphia Eagles in 1989 and played 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he was on the Eagles' roster for the first 10 games, playing in 
seven.

HIGUERA SPURNS PADRES FOR FOUR-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Padres' euphoria over their blockbuster trade Wednesday afternoon was 
subdued by nightfall when free-agent pitcher Teddy Higuera rejected their offer 
and re-signed with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera signed a four-year, $13-million contract with the Brewers, turning down 
the Padres' offer of three years and an option worth about the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were believed to be the leading candidate to sign Higuera, but when 
the Brewers raised their contract offer Tuesday to guarantee the fourth year, 
the Padres refused to match. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it all we had," McIlvaine said, "but it all came down to the 
guarantee. I'm not getting into four years with pitchers. If that costs us 
pitchers, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is insanity in the game, but I only want to have a small part of it." 
</P>
<P>
When reached at his home in Los Mochis, Mexico, Higuera said: "San Diego wanted 
me very much, but the contract was for three years. Four years is a big 
difference for me." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Dalton, Brewer general manager, said the Brewers were forced to provide 
the fourth year of the contract. If they didn't, he said, Higuera likely would 
be in a Padre uniform today. The Brewers will pay Higuera a $1 million signing 
bonus, $2.5 million in 1991, $3.25 million in 1992, $3 million in 1993 and 
$3.25 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Southern California clubs are our biggest compeitition anyway," 
Dalton said. "It's close to home for him, and he had some appeal. Plus he would 
be a big box-office attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bud Selig, Brewer owner: "We spent more time agonizing on Teddy Higuera 
than any single player in the 22-year history of the Brewers. The stakes are 
unblievable, but we felt we had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Higuera's decision leaves the Padres with a vacancy in their starting rotation, 
but perhaps more damaging is that they don't have the use of starter Greg 
Harris for trade bait. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have plenty of other things we want to get done," McIlvaine said. "We 
have some holes to fuill." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who also have holes at third base, second base and left field, 
still are involved in trade discussions with the Kansas City Royals in an 
attempt to acquire outfielder Danny Tartabull. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, according to sources, have offered to trade Bip Roberts to the 
Royals in exchange for Tartabull. It would provide the Padres with an everyday 
power-hitting left fielder, and the Royals with the leadoff hitter they desire. 
</P>
<P>
But, McIlvaine said, the Royals might be reluctant to trade Tartabull until the 
conclusion of the NFL season. The Royals apparently want to make sure 
outfielder Bo Jackson finishes the Raiders season healthy, enabling them to 
trade Tartabull without the risk of also being without Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also had trade discussions with the Montreal Expos about outfielder 
Tim Raines, with the Baltimore Orioles about third baseman Craig Worthington 
and with the Boston Red Sox about right-handed reliever Wes Gardner.

WINCHELL WILL GAMBLE ON OLYMPIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In September 1966, Vern Winchell spent $15,000 to enter his 2-year-old filly, 
Mira Femme, in the $226,525 Arlington-Washington Lassie Stakes at Arlington 
Park near Chicago. She hung on to win by three-quarters of a length, and 
Winchell wiped his brow and pocketed $96,525. 
</P>
<P>
Flash forward 24 years, and Winchell finds himself with another hot 2-year-old 
and another expensive gamble. To run his Prevue Stakes winner, Olympio, in 
Sunday's $1-million Hollywood Futurity, the former king of doughnuts must pay a 
$50,000 supplementary fee for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of money," Winchell said earlier this week from his Las Vegas home. 
"But I doubt very much if we'll be clear out of it. That being the case, I 
think it pays to take the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell is gambling far more on Olympio than the Futurity's $50,000 late fee. 
Ever since the dust cleared after Olympio's remarkable debut on Oct. 13 at 
Santa Anita, the owner has been receiving almost daily offers to sell all or 
part of the colt. It was, without a doubt, the most exciting losing effort of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I could hardly believe what I was seeing," Winchell recalled. "It reminded me 
of a rush Silky Sullivan made one time at Santa Anita." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell was not exaggerating. Olympio was left standing in the gate that day 
like a guy waiting for the next bus. By the time he got in gear, he trailed the 
leaders by more than two dozen lengths. Then, approaching the far turn, he 
began to run like a 78-r.p.m. record against a bunch of 45s. 
</P>
<P>
Olympio still was some 15 lengths behind with a furlong to run, but at the wire 
he was beaten by only 1 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the finish, he went by the winner so fast that (Olympio) actually 
thought he won the race," Winchell laughed. "In his own head, I'm sure he 
thinks he's undefeated." 
</P>
<P>
Olympio, who is trained by Ron McAnally, won his next race by 6 1/2 lengths, 
then took the Nov. 3 Prevue at Hollywood in a three-way photo-finish with 
Barrage and General Meeting. They will both be back for Sunday's Futurity, 
along with Norfolk Stakes winner Best Pal and the Wayne Lukas-trained colt, 
Cien Fuegos. 
</P>
<P>
Olympio is a half-brother to Classino, a colt of considerable ability who also 
was trained by McAnally in 1987 and early '88. Classino won one of three 
starts, by 10 lengths, but then died mysteriously. Attending veterinarians were 
convinced the colt was stricken by a neurological disease, although no autopsy 
was performed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the horse business 32 years, and I realize these horses are 
subject to all sorts of injuries and problems," Winchell said. "I think I've 
experienced most of them, but a new one seems to come up all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell claimed Carols Christmas, the dam of Olympio and Classino, in 1980 for 
$25,000. He liked her speed and her pedigree, but he was worried about her 
posture. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a pretty bad swayback," Winchell said. "I was concerned that she might 
pass it on to her offspring. But she never has. Her foals have all been quite 
good-looking." 
</P>
<P>
Especially Olympio. With a coat the color of butterscotch pudding and a white 
blaze trickling down his forehead, he's the kind of horse little children love 
to hug. He is not a big colt -- conformation experts would call him "neat" -- 
but his stride covers a lot of ground for his size. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell and McAnally have been in the game long enough to rein in their 
enthusiasm for Olympio until he passes Sunday's test. Even then, dreams of a 
Kentucky Derby could run dry when his bloodlines take over. Everything about 
Olympio's immediate family indicates a mile to 1 1/8 would be his maximum 
range. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell said he will settle for a brilliant miler. Anyway, he has taken a colt 
to the Derby only once before, and that was in 1981 when Classic Go Go, the 
sire of Classino, finished fourth, six lengths behind Pleasant Colony. 
</P>
<P>
The owner had his best Derby shot in 1962 with his first good horse, Donut 
King. The California-bred colt had beaten the best field of 2-year-olds 
assembled anywhere in 1961 when he won the Champagne Stakes at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
The next spring, Donut King was ranked among the favorites for the Kentucky 
Derby. Then, barely a week before the Derby, McAnally discovered a tenderness 
in a hoof. It turned out to be a bone disorder from which Donut King never 
fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Ask McAnally to name the best horses he has ever trained and, after naming John 
Henry and Bayakoa, he will add Donut King without a blink. Obviously, Olympio 
has a way to go. Sunday could be a big step. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally is expected back today from a horse-buying trip in South 
America. He spent the last few days under tight security in Buenos Aires, where 
an army officers' mutiny and terrorist bombings had the city in turmoil. . . . 
Olympio will have his final Futurity prep Saturday morning in a leg-stretching 
quarter-mile. . . . Prevue runner-up Barrage worked a half-mile in 48 seconds 
Wednesday morning for trainer Vladimir Cerin; General Meeting worked five 
furlongs in 1:02 for Dave Hofmans, and Deputy Meister went the same distance in 
a leisurely 1:05. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar's first $1-million race, the Pacific Classic, will be part of the 
American Racing Championship Series announced Wednesday. The 10-race series 
will be aired on ABC-TV and include the Santa Anita Handicap and the Hollywood 
Gold Cup. A bonus of $750,000 awaits the top performer in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay was out Wednesday morning to work a horse for the first time 
since breaking his collarbone on Nov. 8. He was aboard Fly Till Dawn, the 
Budweiser International winner, who will make his next start in the $500,000 
Hollywood Turf Cup on Dec. 16.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: DELUCA FAILS TO REGAIN FLYWEIGHT TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's Tony "Bazooka" DeLuca failed in his attempt to regain the North 
American Boxing Federation flyweight championship Wednesday night at the Sports 
Arena by losing a unanimous 12-round decision to Blythe's Ysaias Zamudio. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat is DeLuca's third in a row and lowers his professional record to 
17-5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Zamudio (21-3), ranked No. 1 by the World Boxing Assn., dominated the fight 
throughout and never gave DeLuca an opportunity to land any effective blows. 
</P>
<P>
Zamudio was the much quicker fighter and he cut DeLuca's right eye in the 11th 
round. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a little fast," DeLuca said. "I think he was quicker than (Michael) 
Carbajal and he was a little more unorthodox than Carbajal." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will continue fighting, DeLuca said: "I've got boxing in my blood. 
I'd have to be talked into giving it up by my trainers." DAVE MCKIBBEN

MORSE TIGERS PILE UP HONORS AS THEY PILED UP VICTORIES; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: FIVE FROM UNBEATEN TEAM NAMED TO FIRST TEAM, TWO TO 
SECOND TEAM IN THE TIMES' ALL-COUNTY SELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morse High School is being called by many as the greatest team in San Diego 
Section history. The Times' 1990 All-County selections illustrate seven reasons 
why. 
</P>
<P>
Five Tigers were named to the first team and two made the second team, making 
Morse one of the most represented schools in the 13 years The Times' has 
selected all-county teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista had three players on the first team for the third year in a 
row (the Longhorns had four in 1988), including one of the running backs. An 
Aliipule from Rancho Buena Vista also has been on the first team three years in 
a row. Don Aliipule has made it the past two years, Al Aliipule in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma had brothers La'Roi and Darcel Glover at defensive ends. La Jolla 
Country Day, the 1-A eight-man champion, placed two juniors on the first team. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are six juniors on the first team, two more than the past two 
years combined. 
</P>
<P>
Players are selected by the Times' high school football writers based on 
performances during the regular season and recommendations from coaches around 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the 1990 first team: 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Darnay Scott, Kearny, wide receiver -- Scott, one of the county's top Division 
I recruits, had 23 receptions for 456 yards, a 19.6 per-catch average, despite 
being double- and triple-teamed all season. Scott (6-feet-3, 190 pounds) also 
had a county-high nine interceptions as a free safety. His 14 touchdowns came 
five different ways -- on punt, kick and interception returns, on receptions 
and on runs. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Plash, Orange Glen, wide receiver -- A reliable possession receiver, 
Plash, a junior, can be elusive once he gets the ball. He's superb in Orange 
Glen's short passing game and has a knack for getting the necessary yardage for 
first downs. Coach Rob Gilster says Plash has dropped only one pass in two 
years. He was third in the county this season with 51 receptions for 758 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Edwards, Chula Vista, tight end -- As a leader and person, Edwards is a 
coach's delight. Add size (6-3, 195), quickness and skills, and Edwards, in 
Coach George Ohensorgen's words, "stuck out like a sore thumb." On offense, 
Edwards bolstered a line that enabled four Spartan backs to ahve big seasons. 
As a linebacker, Edwards keyed a defense that finished second in the county. 
Edwards lettered three years in football and baseball and two in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Don Aliipule, Rancho Buena Vista, offensive line -- Aliipule comes right out of 
the mold of former section player of the year, Jack Harrington. The Longhorns 
do only one thing -- run -- and they do it behind the mobile Aliipule. He is as 
athletic as any player on the team, including Markeith Ross, except Aliipule is 
240 pounds and delivers crunching blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Salua Poutoa, Morse, offensive line -- The leader of perhaps Morse's best 
offensive line ever, Poutoa (6-0, 295) helped open holes for a backfield that 
gained more than 3,500 yards in 10 games. "I think he's the real spark plug on 
our team," Coach John Shacklett said. "He's the leader. He has tremendous 
pride, and he set the standard for our offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
John Moe, Morse, offensive line -- Another outstanding member of a line that 
helped Morse average 48 points a game during the regular season, Moe (6-2, 270) 
ranks with some of the best blockers ever to play for the Tigers. He has great 
technique and mobility on pulls and traps, and has smarts to go with it. He 
carry's a 3.1 grade-point average in school and plans to attend the Naval 
Academy next year. 
</P>
<P>
John Michels, La Jolla, offensive line -- Coach Dick Huddleston called Michels, 
who is 6-7, 230, an intense player who learned schemes quickly and made good 
adjustments. Michels also played defense, where he displayed great quickness 
and lateral movement. A 3.8 student, Michels has orally committed to play at 
USC. "He's made good progress, and he's getting tougher all the time," 
Huddleston said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Abraham, San Marcos, offensive line -- Described as a late bloomer by 
Coach Ken Broach, Abraham (6-3, 215) started only a couple games as a junior. 
But this year at left tackle, he was one of the main reasons junior fullback 
Mark Frazier rushed for more than 1,900 yards. "We usually ran behind him when 
we needed tough yards," Broach said. "He got better each week. I think he 
surprised himself more than anybody." Broach added that it was Abraham's 
athletic ability -- he also plays basketball and baseball -- that allowed him 
to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Lawrence, Morse, quarterback -- Morse used to compare all its great 
athletes to former football/basketball standout Keith McGee. Lawrence (5-9, 
175) now sets the standard. Coach John Shacklett said Lawrence is the best 
athlete he's ever coached. Shacklett said Lawrence was reluctant to play 
quarterback at first, but he flourished in Morse's option set, rushing for 
1,158 yards during the regular season and a county-best 19 yards per carry. He 
also threw seven touchdown passes and just one interception in 48 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Taylor, Morse, running back -- Taylor (6-0, 165) became the second junior 
in a row to lead the county in rushing with 1,977 yards in 170 carries. He was 
second in the county with 25 touchdowns, yet Coach John Shacklett said he may 
be one of the Tigers' most improved players. A quick, tough back with great 
cutting ability, Taylor has improved his field vision and ability to find holes 
throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
Markeith Ross, Rancho Buena Vista, running back -- Rancho Buena Vista has had 
three of the county's four 2,000-yard rushers heading into this season -- Scott 
Garcia, O.J. Hall and Ross, who had 2,242 last year. Ross gained 1,622 yards 
this season, but the county's all-time leading rusher (5,285) combines the 
moves of Garcia and the speed of Hall. As a result, he had 26 touchdowns, 
including scoring runs of 83, 80, 72, 64, 59, 49, and 41 yards. His 158 points 
put him ahead of some select company, including Lincoln's Marcus Allen (156, 
1977). Ross (5-10, 180) is a bona fide game-breaker, and Bell said his blocking 
is underrated. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Abrams, La Jolla Country Day, kicker -- A second-team selection in 1989, 
Abrams was again impressive this season. In 11 games, Abrams made 74 of 76 
extra-point conversions (three others were blocked), placing him second in the 
section record book behind Rancho Buena Vista's Abel Lopez, who had 81 in 14 
games last year. In addition, every one of Abrams' 100 kickoffs carried into 
the end zone, which in high school cannot be returned. Just a junior, Abrams is 
already second on the career conversion list with 125, and he is third in 
career points with 140. Abrams has been called by at least one scouting service 
as the premier junior kicker in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Mike Johnson, Southwest, defensive line -- Defensive player of the year in the 
Metro Conference for the second consecutive year, Johnson was one of only four 
juniors on The Times' first team in 1989. Johnson, who also played on the 
offensive line, led Southwest (9-3) to a second-place finish in the Metro. A 
dominating pass rusher and run defender, Johnson (5-11, 225) led the Raiders in 
tackles and sacks for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Darcel Glover, Point Loma, defensive line -- Quickness may earn Darcel Glover a 
spot on a Division I college team. Coach Bennie Edens says Glover, a senior 
defensive end, has improved his grades since last season, making him more 
attractive to college coaches. "A year ago his (school) work habits weren't 
real good," Edens said. "He has always been in advanced classes, but he hadn't 
achieved at the level of his ability. Now he has settled down and he's doing 
great." San Diego State, among others, has shown interest. Glover is the senior 
member of Tag Team Glover. His younger brother, La'Roi, was Point Loma's other 
starting defensive end. Darcel (6-2 1/2, 225) finished the season with 32 
tackles, 10 assists and 5 1/2 sacks. He also doubled as a back-up receiver. 
</P>
<P>
La'Roi Glover, Point Loma, defensive line -- Coach Bennie Edens said Glover, a 
strong, overpowering defensive end, could be the best lineman in Point Loma's 
history. "He's a dominating football player," Edens said. "He's very intense, 
quick off the ball and very aggressive." La'Roi, a 6-2, 265-pound junior, 
starts on defense with his older brother, Darcel, and outweighs him by 40 
pounds. The Glover brothers helped anchor a defense that gave up an average of 
9.3 points a game during the regular season. La'Roi had 43 tackles, 18 assists 
and eight sacks; he also started at guard on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Walton, Helix, defensive line -- A good athlete who also plays basketball, 
Walton (6-4, 235) was a big reason Helix led the county in defense, allowing 
2.3 points per game during the regular season. "Gary is a good demonstration of 
commitment and hard work," Coach Jim Arnaiz said. "He will go down in our 
record books as one of the best defensive lineman we've had." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul McCullough, El Camino, linebacker -- Coach Herb Meyer couldn't find a 
position for McCullough during spring practice. McCullough (5-11, 185) was 
auditioned at tight end, running back and defensive end, before he settled in 
at outside linebacker. McCullough replaced Ricky Spears, who now plays for Cal, 
as the Wildcats' big-play linebacker. Selected as defensive player of the year 
in Avocado League, McCullough had 13 sacks among his 33 tackles and returned 
all three of his interceptions for touchdowns. "He's like a garbage man in 
basketball," Meyer said. "He's always around the ball." McCullough scored a 
fourth touchdown while playing tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Pittman, Mira Mesa, linebacker -- Another outstanding athlete that played 
both ways, Pittman made The Times' team as a linebacker for the second year in 
a row. He was a second-team pick last year. Pittman, who had 17 sacks, was a 
big hitter on what was one of the best defenses in the county all season. As 
the cornerstone of Mira Mesa's offense, Pittman (5-11, 190) gained 1,604 yards 
rushing and had 17 touchdowns during the regular season. He added 205 yards and 
three scores in the Marauders' opening playoff victory over Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Sailors, Rancho Buena Vista, linebacker -- Coach Craig Bell said Sailors 
"is a fierce competitor to the point of being nasty." What more do you want of 
a linebacker? Sailors' quickness, agility and nose for the ball set him apart 
and helped make him a dominant player on defense. Sailors (6-2, 220) had 26 
sacks, four interceptions, six fumble recoveries and four forced fumbles. He 
also blocked five kicks. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Sanders, Helix, defensive back -- "Brandon is a demonstration of 
aggressive, intense football playing," Coach Jim Arnaiz said. "He is a blend of 
the best defensive backs over the years, but he plays with his own personality 
of reckless abandon." Sanders had four interceptions and five blocked kicks 
during the regular season. Arnaiz said that Sanders and Gary Walton were, "The 
catalysts for a defense that will go down in Helix history." 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Bennett, Morse, defensive back -- Bennett (6-2, 190) was an unsung hero 
on a team full of them. But his instincts, athletic ability and intelligence -- 
he has a 3.2 grade-point-average -- have piqued the interest of recruiters from 
UCLA and Stanford. He had six interceptions, two of which were spectacular 
one-handed grabs, and four touchdown receptions as quarterback Teddy Lawrence's 
primary target. He also returned punts and kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Rashaan Salaam, La Jolla Country Day, defensive back -- Because he was also one 
of the county's best running backs, Salaam had ample motivation on defense; the 
more he got the ball . . . Salaam, a 6-1 junior, put up unbelievable numbers at 
the eight-man level in a championship season that included four 11-man 
victories. He finished with 2,162 yards on 114 carries and 51 touchdowns, 
including 45 rushing. Though he intercepted only three passes, he was dominant 
on defense as well. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Branch, Sweetwater, defensive back -- Played five games this year with a 
broken wrist and a tender hamstring, but not even sore limbs could trim Branch. 
"He's got a heart bigger than his body," Coach Andy Sanchez said. "There's no 
quit in him. Pound-for-pound, he's the best all-around player in San Diego 
County." High praise, but consider Branch's numbers: 5-7, 165 -- his height and 
weight; six interceptions -- two returned for touchdowns; four fumble 
recoveries -- one returned for a touchdown; and three kickoffs returned for 
touchdowns. On offense, he added 789 rushing yards, third best in the Metro 
Conference. Little wonder Branch was named BMOC at Sweetwater's homecoming.

LAWRENCE'S BIG GAME, BIG CHOICE HAVEN'T MADE FOR BIG PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Not long from now, Teddy Lawrence will step into a world where the players are 
a little faster, a little stronger, a little bigger and a little better. 
</P>
<P>
And everybody will expect a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence is the quarterback of the Morse football team, the team many think is 
the best in San Diego County history. 
</P>
<P>
Morse is a team of good players, but Teddy Lawrence is something altogether 
different. 
</P>
<P>
When he runs, spectators smile, even shake their heads. He has been a starter 
for three seasons, two at quarterback and one at defensive back. His teammates 
sometimes watch him from the sidelines, chuckle, slap each other on the 
shoulder pads and say: "Look at Teddy." 
</P>
<P>
His coach, John Shacklett, worries when Lawrence stands in punt formation. That 
isn't because he doubts Lawrence's ability to kick the ball. It is because 
Lawrence is such a crafty runner that sometimes he decides to scrap the punt 
and take off up the field. That makes a coach's heart jump, even though 
Lawrence hardly ever gets caught. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night Lawrence will play the final high school game of his career when 
the Tigers (13-0) take on Orange Glen (9-4) in the 3-A championship at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Really, Lawrence and his teammates have less to gain 
than they do to lose. Few expect Orange Glen to win. 
</P>
<P>
After the big game, there will be the college recruiters, the ones Shacklett 
diligently kept away from Lawrence until the season is over. These are the men 
who will use every ounce of persuasion they possess to put Lawrence in their 
school's uniform. They will play a part in taking the kid out of Teddy Lawrence 
and helping him graduate to adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence has pared his choices down to six: UCLA, USC, Stanford, Washington, 
Michigan State and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford looks pretty good to him. Up to now, the Stanford coaches are the only 
ones he has met. Besides, Stanford is closer to home than Washington, Michigan 
State and Notre Dame, and it's not in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mom, Kathy, 
doesn't like Los Angeles. It scares her, although she says it probably wouldn't 
scare Teddy. 
</P>
<P>
With the big decision ahead, and the big game Saturday, Lawrence should be 
feeling some extra weight on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
But that's what is odd. He is a high school senior, and he is worried about the 
same things that all other high school seniors are worried about. Football, in 
high school, college, or otherwise, is the least of his concerns. He knows how 
to play football. 
</P>
<P>
It is the rest of growing up that makes him uncertain -- leaving his friends, 
leaving Morse, leaving San Diego and leaving his mom. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been on my own, really," he said. "I don't know what to expect. I'm 
excited, but I'm also scared." 
</P>
<P>
Football should help. It doesn't bother him that the class of competition will 
be so much higher. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, I feel more secure going out because I'll have guys on the team 
that I can be around that can help me out," he said. "If I was just going in as 
a regular student, I would be on my own and have to go out and basically do 
everything on my own." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence isn't easily rattled by anything that happens on the football field. 
If there was ever a time for that to happen, it would have been last weekend, 
when Morse trailed Chula Vista, 28-13, at halftime in the 3-A semifinal. 
Suddenly, the season looked as if it might be a week shorter than planned. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the locker room, waiting to return to the field, Lawrence had to 
tell teammate after teammate that he was OK. Players kept approaching and 
urging him to settle down. That puzzled him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really worried," he said. "Everybody else was worried about me. They 
thought I was going to break down in the second half. They didn't think I was 
going to come through. Everybody was just coming over telling me to settle 
down, but I don't know why. I didn't feel any pressure or anything. I didn't 
feel like I couldn't come back in the second half and do better." 
</P>
<P>
He hadn't done well in the first half, not by Teddy Lawrence standards. He made 
two errant pitches on option plays and had one pass intercepted. Maybe that's 
why everybody was worried. It isn't often that he makes mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, things were back to normal in the second half. Morse came back, tied 
the game, 28-28, and then Lawrence ran 44 yards for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence says he never gets nervous in difficult situations. A put-on? No, says 
Shacklett. As someone once said about Joe Montana, Lawrence is as cool as the 
other side of the pillow. The publicity doesn't appear to faze him. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think he does get that affected by it," Shacklett said. "I 
think, to be honest, Teddy prefers to keep a low profile. He's very quiet, 
especially with people he's not familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why he's uncomfortable when his mom brags about him. One time, she 
was buying him a pair of cleats and the salesman asked him what team he plays 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"Morse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Kathy spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Teddy Lawrence," she said, the way a proud mom will say those things. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy cringed, the way a son does when he is embarrassed by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I was like, 'Oh, don't be doin' this,' " he said. "I hate when she does that. 
She's not humble like me." 
</P>
<P>
Other times, it's hard to be humble. Shacklett has him run the scout team in 
practice so he doesn't disrupt things. He can be a real clown. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he can also be serious, such as when he plans for his future in college 
football. Lawrence, 5-feet-9, 175, has decided he will switch from quarterback 
to either defensive back or wide receiver. He wants to play a position that 
will help him get a crack at the NFL, and he doesn't think quarterback will do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
If you think he's shy, put yourself in the place of a college recruiter and try 
telling him you want him to come to your school to play quarterback. He'll tell 
you to forget it. That's what he did to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be stubborn," Shacklett said. "He is a very strong-willed person and he 
has a very strong self image. He knows what he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
So when someone from Notre Dame called and said something like, "How about 
playing quarterback for us?" he gave his answer immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'No,' " Shacklett said. "Right then. Boom. He'll tell Notre Dame 
that. He'll tell the Pope that. He'll tell anybody." 
</P>
<P>
That is his tough side. The other side is the one his mom sees, the one who 
comes home from practice, goes straight to the refrigerator and says: "Hey mom, 
we ain't got nothin' to eat." 
</P>
<P>
He is still a high school kid. 
</P>
<P>
He will be for one more game.

Law of Love: Italian porn star and parliamentarian Ilona Staller and U.S. 
sculptor Jeff Koons have fallen in love via intercontinental faxes. "They are 
madly in love," said Sabrina Innocente, Staller's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Though the two had met earlier, the relationship developed "via fax," said 
Innocente. The brassy blonde has campaigned for an end to obscenity laws. 
</P>
<P>
Knocked Out: The Army rejected an offer to send Boxing Illustrated magazine to 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia because the Saudis might consider it pornographic, 
an Army spokeswoman in New York said Wednesday. A magazine with pictures of men 
wearing only boxing trunks is "offensive to the Saudis," said the spokeswoman. 
But Bert Sugar, the magazine's publisher, was not down for the count: "I have 
waited this long in my life to be called pornographic. It's wonderful!" he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
Cover-Up Girl: The current Esquire magazine cover reads: "What Michelle 
Pfeiffer Needs . . . Is Absolutely Nothing." Not so, says the January Harper's 
magazine, which is publishing the photo retoucher's bill of $1,525 to "clean up 
complexion, soften smile line, trim chin . . . soften neck muscle a bit." 
Harper's Editor Lewis Lapham pictured the expose as a public service: "Women 
are constantly faced with perfection in magazines. This is to remind the reader 
in an amusing way there's a difference between life and art."

Colorful: Crayola company officials in Easton, Pa., might be turning a little 
red -- make that fuchsia -- with news that its top crayon maker is blue-green 
colorblind. But Emerson Moser, 63, says he has only a shade of it. "If you have 
a serious case of it, you could foul up a lot of materials," said Moser. He 
hasn't. He's made a record 1.4 billion correct crayons.

What would Louis Kahn do? 
</P>
<P>
Architects Jack MacAllister and David Rinehart, former associates of Kahn's, 
asked themselves that question often as they worked during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
And, last week at the meeting of the North County chapter of the American 
Institute of Architects, MacAllister unveiled their company's design for a 
significant expansion of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, one of Kahn's 
masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
The building, just south of a La Jolla bluff popular among hang gliders, is the 
only work of local architecture to achieve international acclaim as one of the 
20th-Century's great works. 
</P>
<P>
Architects, architecture critics and architecture lovers visit from all over 
the world to stand in its austere travertine plaza, suggested to Kahn (who died 
in 1974) by the Mexican architect Luis Barragan. They marvel at study towers 
lining the plaza, angled to capture ocean views. And engineers admire the 
generous mechanical core that runs the length of both wings between floors, 
allowing the Salk Institute, completed in 1965, to easily reconfigure 
laboratory spaces. 
</P>
<P>
The three-level, 97-by-408-foot addition proposed by MacAllister, Rinehart and 
their associates at Los Angeles-based Anshen + Allen would house offices, labs, 
a 300-seat auditorium and a large flexible meeting room-lobby. 
</P>
<P>
But already, controversy is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego's Historical Site Board has discussed designating the 
Salk Institute as historical, which would not prevent the addition but would 
mean a series of public design presentations in front of the board. Jeffrey 
Shorn, a member of the site board, hasn't seen Anshen + Allen's scheme, but 
said he fears an addition might compromise Kahn's building.

"It is one of the most significant buildings in Southern California, and its 
significance means the community needs to be involved in the expansion," Shorn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the new 105,000-square-foot structure would be built in the middle of a 
eucalyptus grove, 125 feet east of Kahn's building. 
</P>
<P>
To many Kahn lovers, the existing approach to the building through the trees 
captures the enigmatic, spiritual nature of his architecture. You wander 
through the grove, climb a few steps and find yourself at the edge of a vast, 
hard-edged plaza sprawling toward the blue Pacific like something out of a 
Surrealist painting. 
</P>
<P>
"People may think it's romantic (to approach through the eucalyptus), but a 
visitor doesn't know where to go," said MacAllister in defense of the addition. 
"Some people end up entering on the side." 
</P>
<P>
A plaza between the old building and the new, with trees -- perhaps jacarandas 
-- and pads for sculptures, would preserve some of the mystique, but the 
addition would give visitors an entirely different first impression of the 
complex than they get today. 
</P>
<P>
The new building would be 30 feet high, 15 1/2 feet lower than Kahn's. Between 
symmetrical halves of the $18-million structure, a square courtyard would serve 
as the Salk Institute's new "front porch." In the middle of this space, four 
curved, 24-foot-high hollow concrete "light prisms" would stand in a circle, 
serving as entry monuments and bouncing light down to a lower-level lobby 
outside the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
A stainless steel bridge would cross the courtyard 12 feet overhead, connecting 
the building halves. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most powerful elements of Kahn's design is the east-west axis 
established by the plaza, through which a narrow channel of water courses 
toward the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Last week after MacAllister's presentation, some observers questioned the 
courtyard within Anshen + Allen's building, wondering whether it should be more 
open, in keeping with Kahn's. Maybe the concrete light tubes should be 
eliminated, some said. 
</P>
<P>
But the soaring dimensions of the new space will make it grander than it 
appears in model form. Kahn might enjoy the play of light and shadow over the 
tall, unusual skylights. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that both David and I very consciously considered not only the roots 
of this project in the original building, but also, in Kahn's drawing, where he 
anticipated a building on that end," MacAllister said. "We continue to practice 
architecture very much in the philosophical spirit of Kahn, that's the basis of 
our work. Therefore, it's natural that this building should be designed the 
same way. We're not necessarily copying the forms of Kahn or the architectural 
language, but the philosophical approach." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn always intended for the Salk Institute to have an entry building, 
MacAllister said. One of his original drawings shows a three-story, T-shaped 
building, with the top of the T fronting the existing plaza, and the stem 
extending east to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Today's space requirements dictated a substantially larger building, according 
to MacAllister. The rectangular addition would be as wide as the existing 
building, but the landscaped open space between old and new structures would 
allow Kahn's building some breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
In details, proportions and materials, the new building would take its cues 
from Kahn's, except that it wouldn't have teak window frames. Like its 
predecessor, the addition would be built of concrete, travertine and stainless 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
From preliminary drawings and photos of models presented by MacALlister last 
week, it is hard to tell exactly what the exterior would look like, but the 
design doesn't seem to have the power of Kahn's original. MacALlister, Rinehart 
and associates may have erred on the conservative side in attempting to let 
Kahn's building keep the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Another troubling aspect of the proposed expansion is the need for additional 
parking that would accompany it. 
</P>
<P>
For the short term, the institute will expand surface parking to the northwest 
of the original complex. Long-range, though, MacAllister envisions a 
three-level parking structure where the east lot is now, with one level 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a new parking structure on the east lot is a bad one. Additional 
parking should go somewhere else on the Salk Institute's 27 acres, or even on 
other property. 
</P>
<P>
During the design process, MacAllister, Rinehart (who also worked on the 
original Salk Institute) and the rest of the design team solicited criticism 
from people who knew Kahn and his work, such as UCLA architecture professor Tim 
Vreeland and architect and publisher Richard Wurman, who both worked with Kahn. 
MacAllister said they approve of Anshen + Allen's design. 
</P>
<P>
As Kahn did in the 1960s, the architects are working closely on the design with 
the institute's founder, polio vaccine developer Dr. Jonas Salk. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was Salk who brought Anshen + Allen back to design the addition, 
after an underground addition proposed by San Diego architects Deems Lewis 
McKinley didn't please him, MacAllister said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the expansion, the institute is considering building housing in a 
canyon west of the existing building, where Kahn envisioned housing for 
visiting researchers. The first structure would be a house for the institute's 
president, since the high cost of housing in La Jolla makes it difficult to 
lure top academics from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
A conference center to the northwest of the existing building, included in 
Kahn's original master plan, may also be built some day. 
</P>
<P>
The Salk Institute has raised $9 million toward the addition, and is continuing 
its fund-raising efforts. MacAllister said construction could begin if the 
institute has 60% to 70% of the $18-million cost in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Before construction can start, however, the project must be reviewed by the 
city of San Diego. MacAllister is confident that work will begin next October 
and be completed in 20 months.

TIMEOUT: IN OR NEAR THE MALL OF YOUR CHOICE THERE IS SOMEPLACE TO SIT YOURSELF

You finally found a parking space. You actually got a salesperson to help you. 
</P>
<P>
You fought your way to the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
Good. 
</P>
<P>
One down, the rest of the list to go. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of hours of this exercise we call Christmas shopping, you are 
going to need a cup of coffee or tea, or a straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
Take heart. There's help nearby, at least with the munchies. 
</P>
<P>
In or near the mall of your choice there is someplace to call timeout, sit 
yourself down, catch your breath and have a bite to eat. 
</P>
<P>
And that's important. 
</P>
<P>
The three rules for Christmas shopping, from a world-class shopper, are: 
</P>
<P>
* Make lists. 
</P>
<P>
* Make a budget -- and stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
* Make yourself stop when you are tired. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing more dangerous than shopping on empty, according to former 
Studio City resident Suzy Kalter Gershman, now the American Express shopping 
consultant in New York City and author of the book series "Born to Shop," which 
tells you where to get the best bargains in cities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"You will exhaust yourself and your pocketbook if you don't take a break when 
your feet refuse to stand for any more," she said, adding that most expensive 
mistakes are made when you are just too pooped to think about what you are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
"Just try to look at Christmas shopping as a game of endurance in which you 
have to pace yourself," she said. "Tired and broke are not good ways to 
experience the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
If you shop at Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, Antelope Valley Mall or the 
Sherman Oaks Galleria, the obvious, but not necessarily best, choice for your 
"sit and snack" might be the food halls. It's fast-food and about as relaxing 
as the "1812" Overture, but at least you don't have to move your car. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sherman Oaks Galleria, there are several places nearby where you might 
go for an afternoon aperitif, or some coffee and a sweet, if you are willing to 
stash your packages in the trunk and drive a couple of blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Both L'Express, near Kester Avenue on Ventura Boulevard, and Le Cafe, down the 
street near Van Nuys Boulevard, offer tea and sympathy. The pastry chef at 
L'Express has gotten raves for good reason. Le Cafe has outside seating, if the 
weather is good. 
</P>
<P>
At Topanga Plaza, there are several excellent options to the food halls, and 
two are on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
The California Pizza Kitchen offers designer pizza and hearty salads, along 
with lighter fare. The Red Robin is gourmet fast-food served in pleasant 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
If you can face another crowd, head over to the Cheesecake Factory in the 
Trillium on Canoga Avenue. The food and ambience are impressive. So, 
unfortunately, is the waiting time, although between 3 and 5 p.m. you'd 
probably breeze right in. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Galleria and Northridge Fashion Center are busy places as well, 
but they don't have the food hall situation. 
</P>
<P>
In the Northridge mall, Anna Miller's Pies is an OK place to sit for a few 
minutes and collect your thoughts, and there is Coco's at the northeast end of 
the mall, in a separate building. 
</P>
<P>
If you are willing to give up your parking place in exchange for getting out of 
the fray, there are a string of restaurants south on Tampa Avenue, including 
Marie Callender's and the pleasant El Torito. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has a number of excellent places for a quick stop inside the mall, 
including La Petite Boulangerie and Cafe Le Pafe, which have homemade pastries 
and aromatic gourmet coffees and teas. There is also a Good Earth, near 
Mervyn's, where you can get organic munchies. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the mall, if you are willing to hoof it, there is Fresco on Brand 
Boulevard, where you can sit down to white linen and gourmet goodies. 
</P>
<P>
At the newly redone Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, there are several good 
choices, including the salads and soups at California Crisp, and everything at 
Paradise Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
But if you are willing to car hop, you can trundle down to La Serre or the 
Bistro Garden at Coldwater for some pastries or other goodies and enjoy all the 
ambience at very little cost. Since meals aren't being prepared, your 
selections will have to run to sweets or sandwiches, but it's a great way to 
visit these gourmet greats without shelling out the lunch or dinner prices. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more relaxed malls in our area, where the crowds are almost always 
in the acceptable range, is the Promenade in Woodland Hills. This upscale 
shopping area, which will be renovated after the Christmas rush, curiously has 
no place to enjoy a gourmet goodie, except for the tiny lunch room at I 
Magnin's. There is also Magic Pan and Anna Miller's. 
</P>
<P>
The surrounding area, however, is lush with possibilities. There is the 
pleasant, publike Bob Burns in a free-standing building just west of Saks. And 
across the street is the Marriott Hotel, which offers a number of dining rooms 
in which to rest and recover. 
</P>
<P>
Heading north from the center there is the aforementioned Cheesecake Factory, 
and next door to that is the Hilton Hotel, a pleasant place to pop in for a 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing is not where you go, but that you take the time to do 
it.

THE SEASON OF 'MUGGING'; 
</P>
<P>
PRESENTS: AT THE HOLIDAYS, TEACHERS ARE SWAMPED WITH GIFTS FROM STUDENTS. 
WHETHER IT'S ANOTHER COFFEE MUG OR A DEAD CHRISTMAS TREE, THEY SAY IT'S THE 
THOUGHT THAT COUNTS.

<P>
In the nearly two decades that Cheryl Abrams has been teaching elementary 
school, she has received hundreds of mugs, plaques, rulers, key chains and 
T-shirts -- many of them inscribed "1 Teacher." And those were the good gifts. 
</P>
<P>
During the holidays, students and parents present teachers with small tokens of 
appreciation. How many mugs or rulers can one teacher use? Do you go for the 
personal touch, and find out their favorite brand of perfume? Or stick with a 
more generic stationery set? 
</P>
<P>
Teachers these days get gifts at least twice a year -- at Christmas and the end 
of the term -- from about 80% to 90% of their class. That's a lot of mugs. 
</P>
<P>
With school budget cuts getting deeper, many of about 100 San Fernando Valley 
teachers surveyed said they really appreciate items they can use in the 
classroom, such as children's books, markers or rubber stamps. 
</P>
<P>
"These are things I end up purchasing myself," said Ede Kotal, a 12-year 
teaching veteran. 
</P>
<P>
As Abrams, who taught in Inglewood, Reseda and now Agoura, found herself buying 
more classroom supplies, she posted a "wish list" last year on her classroom 
door. "Dear Santa," she wrote. "I've been good, I've taught the children all 
year, I've graded papers . . . here are some things I would like you to bring 
this year." Her list included hamster food (for a class pet), books, class 
cooking utensils, games and stickers. Some of her wishes were fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Last Valentine's Day, Abrams received a bag with "little things I could use in 
class" such as stickers, glue, a reading book and markers. "It was really, 
really thoughtful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At this year's open house, her principal suggested that parents ask the 
teachers what kind of gifts they would like. One parent did, and Abrams 
suggested film and developing for pictures she takes in the classroom. Within a 
few days the parent gave her a $100 check that she used to buy school supplies, 
including a camera and film. "It's amazing how fast that $100 went," she said 
with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
"Once someone made a donation in my name to a food bank," added Abrams. "That 
was real nice." 
</P>
<P>
David Rosen of Sepulveda, whose fifth-grader always helps pick out her 
teachers' gifts and signs the card, said: "We don't feel obligated at all to 
give a gift. When we give a gift, it's a warm appreciation of what they are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
"One year, Nicole did not have a good experience with a teacher and did not 
give her a gift," Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do appreciate getting gifts," said Mary Beatty, a fourth-grade 
teacher at Gledhill Street Elementary in Sepulveda, who has been teaching 38 
years. "I feel it shows appreciation for the effort I put into my teaching. 
What I get doesn't matter. One girl wrapped up two of her used toys from last 
year. I still have them, and smile every time I look at my poor dingy purple 
squirrel." 
</P>
<P>
"I love to open anything," echoed Karen Hansen of Agoura. "I am most touched by 
things that show some thought about me as a person went into buying the gift," 
such as wooden or crystal apples for her collection. She also was delighted 
with a musical schoolhouse and "a joke written down to give me a laugh." 
</P>
<P>
"My students can't afford much, but they mean well," said a third-grade teacher 
at a San Fernando school. "They give a lot of homemade things, like pot holders 
and baked goods." A department store gift certificate is always a treat, said 
several teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite gifts are things I can use, like a nice candy dish or a pretty 
vase," a Northridge nursery schoolteacher said. "I don't like it when the 
parents all get together and buy one big gift." She said she can always sense 
who is in charge of buying that gift because they are always bustling around, 
acting like it is a chore. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the kids learn more from giving individually," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
In her 20-year career, Sandy Brookshaw, a Las Virgenes first-grade teacher, has 
received caviar, opera tickets, an uncooked fresh goose, a sack of oysters and 
a Lladro porcelain figurine. 
</P>
<P>
Other interesting gifts received by Valley teachers include a three-flavor 
selection of Neiman-Marcus brand after-dinner toothpaste, a picture made from 
butterfly wings, a computer program, baby powder, four pairs of used gloves, a 
stuffed baby toy, a bedspread, a quilted wall hanging and a carved jade dog. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, gift-giving can get out of hand. One year, a Valley mother of two 
admired the expensive-looking watch on the wrist of the headmaster of a private 
Westside school and learned it had been a Christmas gift from the parent of a 
student. "Are we supposed to give you presents like watches?" she asked him. 
"Some parents do," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's shocking," said the mother, who thinks home-baked brownies make 
nice gifts. "It didn't seem appropriate. When I told him I thought there should 
be a limit on gifts, he said some of the teachers might get upset. One year, he 
told me, every teacher got a Cuisinart" from the same parent. 
</P>
<P>
"A gift should be a token from the child to the teacher," a North Hollywood 
mother said. "Anything more than that is appalling." 
</P>
<P>
In a West Valley fifth-grade class last week, parents talked about chipping in 
to buy the class a globe as a holiday gift because the school doesn't have 
money to buy one. Several mothers said they would buy the globe anyway if it 
was needed, but teachers work hard and deserve personal gifts as well. 
</P>
<P>
At a Northridge elementary school, teachers thought about asking parents to 
contribute money for school supplies rather than buying individual gifts. But 
the feeling was that "it was presumptuous to tell parents what to do when not 
every parent gives a gift," explained one teacher. Sometimes, she added, a 
parent may buy a very inexpensive gift but would feel embarrassed about 
contributing only that small amount as a donation. 
</P>
<P>
Home-baked cookies, muffins and brownies or boxes of candy are generally crowd 
pleasers -- with some reservations. 
</P>
<P>
A teacher who worked at a school in an economically deprived neighborhood said 
the principal warned the staff one year to toss the cookies and cakes brought 
by students in case they were drug-laced. 
</P>
<P>
"I once had a family that was forever making brownies and sending them to 
school," another teacher said. But she sensed hygiene standards in the home 
were not the highest, so she hesitated about eating the food. "If brownies ever 
appeared in the faculty lunch room," she added, "the first question was, 'Are 
they from -----?' " 
</P>
<P>
"If I know the family well, I enjoy," said Randi Stern, whose 25-year teaching 
career has spanned schools from New York to Moorpark, in every economic strata. 
"If not, I trash it." 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, the other gifts. Half-empty bottles of cologne, makeup 
samples or promotional giveaways, gifts "that have obviously been recycled" and 
used clothing make "1 Teacher" mugs look good. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheap, gaudy jewelry that I feel required to wear," a selection of 24 bottles 
of nail polish, plastic flowers and "really awful home decorator items" are 
among the gifts that made some teachers cringe. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the dead cat that Kotal received one year. The teacher, who 
worked in a low-income area, said one student, a first-grader, constantly 
brought her gifts throughout the school year. At Christmastime, he found a dead 
cat and thought she would like it. "It was definitely a gift of love," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kotal also has received a catfish wrapped in a newspaper and a dead Christmas 
tree she was given in June. 
</P>
<P>
"The tree was about 3 feet tall, on a stand, totally brown and slightly bent," 
Kotal recalled. "We decorated it and put it on the principal's desk the last 
day of school." 
</P>
<P>
"When people give these gifts, their hearts are always in the right place," a 
co-worker explained. "They really mean well." 
</P>
<P>
It really is the thought that counts, teachers emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel any gift is tacky," said Marcia Fisher, who teaches 3- and 
4-year-olds at Weekday Preschool in Northridge. "Every gift should be 
appreciated. Gifts should be part of the child. My favorites are the ones the 
children pick out. One year a child painted me a rock. I love things like that. 
</P>
<P>
Giving gifts, teachers said, is a way parents and students show appreciation 
for a year of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel it's an accepted form of sharing, caring and thanks in our 
society," said Stern, who now is a teacher-adviser in the L.A. Unified School 
District education and problem prevention program. "I also love cards with 
personal notes." Getting a gift or a card, she added, is "one of the ways 
teachers are acknowledged. We give gifts to our letter carriers, housekeepers, 
manicurists, why not our child's parent-away-from-home?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's valuable for children to learn to give," added Fisher. "I truly 
hope there isn't pressure to spend." 
</P>
<P>
Students give mostly "because they want to show appreciation" and not because 
they feel obligated, a Newhall first-grade teacher said. "Many of my students 
write notes and make gifts because they are so giving," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe children have ever felt obligated (to give teachers gifts)," 
Beatty said. "Most children in the lower grades enjoy it, but many boys, as 
they get older, think it is a sissy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Newhall teacher Cornelia Griswold, who is chalking up her 24th year in front of 
a blackboard, said she would prefer that students didn't buy presents, "but 
since they do, I enjoy seeing how pleased they are to give gifts." Her 
children, she noted, did not give gifts when they were school-age. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers work very hard, and giving a gift is one way to show we appreciate 
what they are doing," said Caryn Ograskin of Sepulveda, the mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
Although unwanted gifts may be given away, thrown out, or sold at garage sales, 
most are kept. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to throw these things away when people are so obviously sincere," 
Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
Most teachers acknowledge gifts with a hand-written thank-you note or a 
telephone call, even though "it is time consuming, especially with classes of 
32 children," Kotal said. "I guess I feel it's the least I can do if they go to 
the trouble of purchasing a gift." Thank-you notes are usually sent to the home 
"because kids love getting mail." 
</P>
<P>
But maybe, said a Las Virgenes fourth-grade teacher, "a well-thought-out 
personal letter from a parent telling me that I have done well" is the best 
gift of all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
If You Run Out of Apples . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gifts that teachers might put on their holiday wish list: 
</P>
<P>
* Notes and letters of appreciation 
</P>
<P>
* Classroom supplies such as stickers, markers, books, arts and crafts 
supplies, rubber stamps or games 
</P>
<P>
* Baked goods or boxed candy 
</P>
<P>
* Stationery or note pads 
</P>
<P>
* Handmade items from the child 
</P>
<P>
* Plants or flowers 
</P>
<P>
* Gift certificates to department stores 
</P>
<P>
* Personal items, such as jewelry or perfume, if you know the particular 
teacher's taste

BARGAINS: BUYING AT TOYS AT DISCOUNT CAN BE FUN AND GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since most department stores eliminated their toy departments, a lot of the 
magic has gone out of shopping for toys. Santa moved to the malls, and now we 
shop for toy bargains in warehouse-type surroundings. But we're still paying 
retail prices, albeit discounted. Toys R Us, K mart, Target and Kay-Bee are the 
major toy discounters, and though the prices are good, how about buying at 
wholesale? 
</P>
<P>
Intelico imports developmental games and toys that you will usually find at toy 
stores and schools. However, its stockroom is open to the public, and the 
prices hover near wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
These toys are designed to improve motor skills; there are puzzles, games, 
stacking toys and much more. Amusement Park is a building toy with more than 
100 interlocking pieces and gears, which allows a child to build a kind of 
amusement park. A major toy distributor was retailing this for $35, but the 
price here is $12.99. 
</P>
<P>
Those magnetic blocks that sell for $20 to $30 at many stores are $11.99 at 
Intelico for the 16-piece set. And these are the originals -- not the knockoffs 
that have flooded the market. There's a lot more in Intelico's inventory, but 
this gives you an idea. 
</P>
<P>
Call ahead because this is a wholesale operation and does not necessarily keep 
usual store hours. Since the showroom is designed for little ones and has a 
hands-on policy, bring them along.

 Intelico, 7232 Canby Ave., Suite 5, Reseda; (818) 345-8997.

L.E.C. World Traders sells primarily to large corporations, providing them with 
bulk amounts of quality toys to donate to organizations such as Toys for Tots. 
They're open to the public, and you can walk in off the street and purchase 
anything from its stock of more than 500,000 items, which includes 60% to 70% 
of the major U.S. and European manufacturers, at 24% below retail. However, if 
you call ahead of time to apply for a special discount card, you can buy 
anywhere from 40% to 50% below retail. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,500 square feet of toys, packed to the ceiling, is an awesome sight. Plan 
on spending time here and DO NOT bring the kiddies. The aisles are so loaded 
with inventory that there's not even room for a stroller. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the major manufacturers are represented: Lego, Playskool, Tyco, Little 
Tikes and Revell. Here's an example of how the pricing works: A Little Tikes 
Fire Truck that retails for $24 is regularly discounted to the walk-in trade at 
$18, but when you call ahead for a card, the price comes down to $14.40. Some 
exotic stuffed animals are good deals if you've got the room. A 48-inch-tall 
camel comes in at $40, and a standing elephant measuring 6 feet from nose to 
back heel is $60. 
</P>
<P>
 L.E.C. World Traders, 8150 Sunland Blvd., Sun Valley; (818) 768-6126. Special 
holiday hours: 9 a.m to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Still the best deal in town for LGB trains is San-Val, where a 32-foot layout 
of 15 working models is set up, and the prices are 20% to 30% lower than 
anywhere else. For a child's first train set, the Industrial Set, with an 
engine, four train cars, loaders, people and tracks, is a good buy at $159, 
instead of $199. For grown-up kids, check out No. 2019 -- the engine and tender 
for $629. This generally retails for $900 to $1,000. If you by any chance find 
a lower price (and I seriously doubt that you will), San-Val's owner, Al 
Kramer, says he will match it. 
</P>
<P>
 San-Val, 7444 Valjean Ave., Van Nuys; (818) 786-8274. Hours: 7:30 a.m. to 6

Old-Fashioned Fun 
</P>
<P>
Most of us know historical societies are for old fogies who sip weak tea and 
fondle their pedigrees. 
</P>
<P>
Lineage lionizing is a serious business with these folks, who also save some 
historically correct buildings. The buildings are generally more than 100 years 
old, with faulty plumbing and designed by someone's Cousin Jonathan or Uncle 
Ethan. 
</P>
<P>
Almost none of this interests any of the rest of us, who do not seek ways to 
experience group tedium. This is not meant as a slur upon these groups. The 
description is simply a widely held characterization. 
</P>
<P>
The folks at the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society have not grasped the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, anyone can join their group. This is not the done thing, of 
course, but these renegades do "things" their own way. Their Sunday Christmas 
party is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
The party, which is open to anyone, will be held in the old Saugus railroad 
station house that the group saved from demolition and transplanted to the 
William S. Hart Park in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone dropping in between 1 and 5 p.m. can listen to the membership rattle off 
all the history of the area, which has very little to do with anyone's pedigree 
and a lot to do with deviant behavior. 
</P>
<P>
It seems the valley used to be a haven for outlaws and other undesirables, 
particularly that old reprobate Tiburcio Vasquez, after whom someone saw fit to 
name a bunch of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michelle Hoffman, a Vasquez aficionado and society partisan, the 
old bandit used to hold whole towns hostage while he took his time robbing 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman seems to think that this is suitable fodder for a historical society 
and generally enthuses about the area's dark past. 
</P>
<P>
She said Newhall was the last frontier of the Old West and a hide-out for 
gun-happy desperadoes. She, or any of the other members, is happy to show 
exhibits in the station house that depict, through dioramas and other 
re-creations, the lives and times of these historical people. 
</P>
<P>
To get everyone in the historical mode for the fete, the members are dressing 
up in fashions from the bad old days, with some of the costumes being 
reproductions of the real thing, donated by the Kern County Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said her costume will include a hat with a dead owl on top, which she 
is certain was a great fashion statement of those bygone times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oh Christmas Tree 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, Oliver Holt was fresh out of the Army, newly married and working in 
his father-in-law's nursery. To make extra money, he suggested getting 
Christmas trees to sell, which he did. 
</P>
<P>
The first year he did about $3,500 worth of business and found that 
encouraging. This year, with five lots and a 12,000-person mailing list, he 
expects to gross about $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge lot, where he has been since 1962, is the main place of holiday 
business for the entrepreneur, who during the rest of the year is a landscape 
architect. The lot handles the local trade and is the dispersal center for his 
commercial accounts. His $400 and $500, 15- and 16-foot trees are headed for 
places such as the Biltmore and Hyatt hotels, bank lobbies and department 
stores. He has other lots in Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood and Toluca 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the big jump in sales, Holt said the primary differences between 
now and when he started in the Christmas tree business are safety and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
All his trees are sprayed with a fire retardant and are kept fresh by spraying 
them at night with an overhead sprinkler system. And instead of getting trees 
by permission from a forest, as he first did, he now works with tree farms in 
Northern California and Nevada. He said this is ecological and ensures that the 
trees are as full as possible. The farmers prune and shear the trees as they 
grow. This technology has developed to the point where every tree is picture 
perfect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another new development is the name of his organization. 
</P>
<P>
When he started out, it was just Oliver Holt Christmas Trees, said the father 
of five. Several years ago, it became Oliver Holt and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
This year his signs will say Oliver Holt and Sons and Daughters because "the 
girls probably work as hard or harder than the boys, and they are not going to 
be denied." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Going My Way? 
</P>
<P>
For 18 years, Pierce College has been harboring a travel agency, which may come 
as a surprise to some. The agency sends people on guided tours all over the 
Southland and often for less than purely educational purposes. Take Saturday's 
trip to Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
Round Town Tours will bus eager shoppers to the Barstow discount mall where 
firms such as Polo/Ralph Lauren, Bugle Boy, Evan-Picone and Royal Doulton have 
factory outlets. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this one-day outing is to shop, obviously, and the only thing 
participants are going to learn is how fast they can deplete their bank 
balances. 
</P>
<P>
Participants will receive an additional 10% discount at participating stores, 
said Marian Sukurt, who coordinates these tours. But the bus fare is $48, and 
you can get your own lunch. Sukurt admits that the bus fare is high, but said 
she is just covering expenses. She added that last-minute passengers will be 
welcome because the trip is not sold out. 
</P>
<P>
One that did sell out was the recent Victorian weekend at the Mission Inn in 
Riverside. Participants scouted the great old houses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
A weekend in Catalina and a nostalgia buff's trip to a railroad and airplane 
museum are planned in January. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Ante 
</P>
<P>
You know you've been hoarding pennies. There isn't much else you can do with 
them. Perhaps your penny jar has turned into a penny bucket, and the last time 
you lifted it you required corrective surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The helpful folks at Granada Hills Community Hospital will help you remove this 
irritant. Simply wrestle the penny container into your car and deliver it to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Employees Activity Committee is collecting 25 miles of pennies in 
conjunction with its 25 years of community service. 
</P>
<P>
They will turn the weighty coins in for folding green and use it to fund 
employee programs. 
</P>
<P>
It makes cents to them. 
</P>

AIDS Show Will Air: The AIDS episode of "Lifestories" that NBC had been 
reluctant to air will finally be shown Dec. 18 at 10 p.m., the network said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which deals frankly with AIDS, gay men and television's fears of 
dealing with the disease, had previously been scheduled to air on Dec. 2 in the 
series' regular early evening time slot. But the network yanked it, saying the 
subject matter was inappropriate for an 8 p.m. broadcast. Production on 
"Lifestories" itself has been shut down because of low ratings. CLAUDIA PUIG

More 'Saigon' Casting Calls: Cameron Mackintosh and Actors' Equity may be in 
for another go-round on the casting of "Miss Saigon." Mackintosh, who pledged 
to try to find an Asian-American actress to play the title role created in 
London by Lea Salonga (a Filipina), told Equity on Tuesday that, after an 
extensive search, he had found no one with the proper prerequisites and 
requested permission to cast Salonga. 
</P>
<P>
Equity's Dick Moore would say only that the request would go to Equity's Alien 
Committee for a recommendation and then be put to a vote by the Equity Council. 
Equity and Mackintosh had clashed last summer over the casting of Jonathan 
Pryce, a Caucasian, in the Eurasian role of the engineer. Equity at first 
denied permission for Pryce to re-create the role on Broadway, then changed its 
mind after Mackintosh said he would not bring the show to New York. CLAUDIA

MIFFED TEEN SUES HER DATE IN 'STOOD UP!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old girl sues her date when he stands her up for the prom. Is she a 
heroine or a troublemaker? The answer is never in doubt in "Stood Up!," today's 
simplistic "ABC Afterschool Special" (3 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Deakins ("The Boy Who Could Fly") is high school junior and budding 
photographer Becky, thrilled when senior gymnastics star Garrett (Spike 
Alexander) asks her to his prom. 
</P>
<P>
Becky earns money for a dress and on the big night eagerly waits for her 
escort. And waits. She learns later that he took his old girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? What any red-blooded American would do these days, apparently -- 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
In the teleplay, written by Peg Haller and Bo Schneider and directed by Aviva 
Slesin, there's no question that Garrett is an arrogant jerk, but why have 
Becky's photographer mentor (Jan Miner) comment, upon hearing who the girl is 
going to the prom with, "Oh, an athlete" -- as if she's just stepped in 
something? Cheap shot. She doesn't know him. 
</P>
<P>
There is some mitigating humor -- Becky imagines she has to wear a scarlet "S" 
for "Stood Up," and fantasizes getting revenge as a punk giantess in black 
leather. 
</P>
<P>
The pending lawsuit brings Becky notoriety, scorn and criticism. An alternative 
-- a "trial" at school -- is suggested by a high school teacher (Geoffrey Owens 
of "The Cosby Show"). 
</P>
<P>
That Becky wants reimbursement for the money she spent on an unreturnable dress 
is reasonable. That Garrett scores with his peers by suggesting that guys have 
to watch out for angry dates who file lawsuits is realistic. But it's a stretch 
to think this is an issue of burning concern to teens.

'END' AN HONEST SEARCH FOR SELF-ESTEEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1976, Dyan Cannon won an Oscar nomination for her remarkable short film 
"Number One," which showed how in early childhood we are made to feel guilty 
and confused about natural functions, drives and needs. In a very real sense 
her new feature, "The End of Innocence" (AMC Century 14), expands on those 
concerns. It's as if Cannon -- the film's writer, director and star -- is 
playing one of those children now grown up. 
</P>
<P>
At the climax of "The End of Innocence," Cannon gets carried away in her 
harrowing saga of a woman fighting to overcome a mental breakdown. She indulges 
in some foolish and overly emotional exultation; even so, her film is 
consistently a work of honesty and courage, deeply personal without being 
literally autobiographical. It's unsettling in the best sense because it's so 
easy to see yourself in varying degrees in Cannon's Stephanie, who strives her 
entire life to please others in her hunger to be loved, only to end up with 
nothing left of herself for herself. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of swift and succinct vignettes Cannon traces Stephanie from a 
child growing up in what seems clearly -- but is never directly stated -- a 
volatile Jewish household. Very early on, Stephanie (played from ages 18 to 25 
by the late Rebecca Schaeffer) learns to feel guilty about sex, yet in her 
desire to be loved is seduced more easily than she could ever imagine. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Cannon assumes the role, Stephanie is a neurotic, middle-aged 
divorcee in love with a nakedly self-absorbed and callous younger man (Steve 
Meadows) and working indifferently for her father (George Coe) at his lampshade 
business. She is a constant pill-popper and pot smoker who seems to live on ice 
cream bars. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie's inevitable crack-up and painful rehabilitation in intense group 
therapy (overseen by a calm, controlled John Heard) is the stuff of TV movie 
melodrama. What gives Cannon's histrionics as the now-raging Stephanie an edge 
is that Cannon the writer and Cannon the director chillingly convince us that 
the people nearest and dearest to Stephanie have never really paid any 
attention to her. 
</P>
<P>
You get the feeling that her shrill, vulgar mother (Lola Mason) as well as her 
father have never thought about her or listened to her. They seem to regard 
parenting as merely laying down rules and expectations and providing for their 
daughter materially. Stephanie, both as a child and as an adult, doesn't seem 
to exist as an individual for them. 
</P>
<P>
"The End of Innocence" (rated R for language and adult themes), which features 
Renee Taylor as a randy participant in the group sessions, has drive and 
passion. The sense of desperation that permeates both Cannon's performance and 
the all-too-heady note of triumph upon which the film ends suggests that for 
people like Stephanie, who is not so different from the rest of us, the 
struggle for self-esteem never is really over.

Vegetables such as beans and cabbage cause gas because they contain 
indigestible sugars that ferment in our digestive tracts. However, an enzyme 
called alpha-galactosidase will break these compounds down so they won't 
ferment, if you sprinkle a few drops of it on your first mouthful of the 
dangerous food. It should be available soon, under the elegant brand name Beano 
Drops, in the supermarket antacid section (meanwhile there's a Beano Hotline, 
800-257-8650). From Lactaid, Inc. of Pleasantville, N.J.

Robbing the Cradle of the Deep 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks back a Detroit man paid $320 for a 17 1/2-pound Maine 
lobster. It can take 100 years or so for a lobster to get that big, and Detroit 
animal rights activists picketed the restaurant and rang the diner's phone off 
the hook and offered to buy "Mimi" (as the news media had named the lobster) on 
the grounds that she was the equivalent of a historical building. It was to no 
avail -- Mimi died from injury and trauma in shipping, and so she got eaten 
after all. What all the Detroiters neglected to realize was that the best 
lobsters are the 1 1/2- to 2-pound size . . . the helpless infant size, that 
is.

Broccoflower, the pale green cross between broccoli and cauliflower introduced

Clearly, what the world needed was a card game for foodies, so here it is. 
Goulash is loosely based on Old Maid: You match cards containing the first and 
last parts of two-word dish names, and the card reading "goulash" is the card 
you don't want to get stuck with. The person who ends up with the Goulash card 
is, under the rules of the game, supposed to cook all the other players a 
dinner, but we'll see how often that happens. CHARLES PERRY

BOOKS YOU WOULDN'T BUY FOR YOURSELF; 
</P>
<P>
GIFTS: SIX BOOKS THAT SOMEONE YOU KNOW WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY HAPPY TO RECEIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL, TIMES FOOD EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are basically two kinds of books: books that you buy for yourself and 
books that you buy for other people. The latter are often called coffee-table 
books, but that implies that they are large and lavishly illustrated, which is 
not always the case. It is neither size nor splendour that distinguishes the 
first group from the second, but simple practicality. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to cookbooks, a book meant for giving ought to have a certain 
measure of frivolousness. You might wrap up a copy of one of the basic bibles, 
but when it comes time to pull off the paper, your friends would probably be 
much happier to find one of the following tomes lurking beneath the ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
The Complete Book of Spices by Jill Norman, 160 pages, Viking Books, $21.95. 
</P>
<P>
This is the book I want for Christmas; I can't imagine any really dedicated 
cook not coveting a copy. 
</P>
<P>
What sets this book off from the other spice compendiums is not only the 
encyclopedic nature of the information, but also the quality of the color 
pictures. A page is devoted to each spice, each lavishly illustrated with 
pictures of the spice in all possible forms -- whole, dried, ground, flaked, 
etc. -- so you really get to see an image of what you are looking at. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a friend who would be curious about anything from ajowan to zedoary 
-- with detours through cubebs and screwpine, this is the book for him. The 
color is so brilliant that as you rifle through the book you can almost imagine 
the scent of spices rising up from the pages. It's like a visit to a wonderful 
spice bazaar -- only this one even offers recipes. 
</P>
<P>
The Taste of China by Ken Hom with photographs by Leong Ka Tai, 192 pages, 
Simon &amp; Schuster, $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
The China of tourists is not the China that real people live in. Tourist China 
is a land of great halls and endless banquets. Meanwhile the streets teem with 
people gulping noodles and racing their bicycles through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Hom's China is the real thing. A man rides a bicycle down the street, 
wearing a suit with half a pig propped on the back of the bike. A little boy 
holds a huge, sticky cookie up to the camera. A healer sits on a blanket, his 
bones and roots and serpents spread before him. Baby ducklings cross a street, 
hundreds of ducks mill around a Canton market waiting for someone to take them 
home to dinner, and a young woman drives geese through fields of extraordinary 
green. Here is China in all its rollicking, crowded, noisy, delicious 
complexity. 
</P>
<P>
This is the book to give a friend who prefers slurping noodles in a Monterey 
Park dive to supping upon lobster in a Beverly Hills palace. It is a book for 
people who love the scent of ginger, garlic and chiles, for people who can't -- 
or won't -- go to China right now but are curious about what life is like 
there. The pictures are enticing, the text is appealing -- and the recipes are 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
The Heritage of Italian Cooking by Lorenza de Medici, 256 pages, Random House, 
$40. 
</P>
<P>
This is a book which practically cries out "Steal me" -- it disappeared from my 
office in less than a day. It's gorgeously illustrated with delicious old 
paintings and large enough to cover the better part of a coffee table. The food 
in the book is robust and appealing and makes you wish you were wandering 
around the Italian countryside. Don't give it to kitchen klutzes, however, for 
they may find themselves rushing out to the kitchen and right into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
For Lorenza de Medici's recipes can be very sketchy. Consider that pie made of 
live birds. While de Medici very considerately brings the recipe into the 20th 
Century by conceding that it will work with birds that are no longer on the 
wing, the recipe calls for 12 quail, one carrot, one stalk of celery, a few 
potatoes, some flour, salt, pepper -- and not a whole lot more. It seems more 
like the start of a recipe than a finished one. So while the book would be a 
very good present for an Italophile or an art-lover, you might want to throw in 
a good working Italian cookbook (one of Marcella Hazan's wonderful books, for 
instance), for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Gourmet Garden by Geraldene Holt with photographs by Hugh Palmer, 192 
pages, Little, Brown, $40. 
</P>
<P>
Give this to a real green thumb; anybody else would find it deeply depressing. 
For here are the kitchen gardens of eight well-known British chefs, in 
photographs of such unearthly beauty that the owners of ordinary gardens could 
only be disheartened. Can ordinary people really grow figs this plump, grapes 
this purple, peppers this perfect in our very own gardens? The photographs in 
the book even manage to make red cabbages look as lovely as violets. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's photographs are so gorgeous that they look like 18th Century paintings 
come to life. It's all so dreamy that you feel you are wandering around a few 
enchanted gardens. But if you must come down to earth, there are real tips for 
gardeners and real recipes for cooks. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Midda's South of France, A Sketch Book, 144 pages, Workman, $17.95. 
</P>
<P>
Probably destined to be the most-given book of the season, this is one of those 
small, precious books that is so pretty you pick it up, exclaim over it and 
immediately wonder who you ought to be giving it to. 
</P>
<P>
Midda seems to have wandered around the south of France, sketching anything 
that appealed to her. If you have friends who long to be sitting in a sidewalk 
cafe drinking coffee from a bowl and spreading warm fig jam on toast, this is 
the book for them. It's not a cookbook but a book that makes you want to cook, 
a sort of cat book for food lovers. You're bound to know someone who will want 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Ike the Cook by Edward and Candace Russoli, 120 pages, Benedettini Books, 
$15.95. 
</P>
<P>
"General Eisenhower was a hell of a man on a man-to-man basis, and the boss 
liked to cook," says Herbert Dixon, one of Ike's Secret Service Agents. He also 
says that Ike was "a very honest eater" who "ate the hell out of anything he 
liked" and always had spots on his ties. 
</P>
<P>
In a time when presidents manage the news so well it's hard to know what to 
think about any of them, its nice to see a president who was apparently a real 
person. Here's Ike in an apron at home on the range -- which is just like the 
one your mother and mine cooked on -- surrounded by grubby pots and pans and 
grinning broadly. No matter what your politics, it's hard to dislike a 
president who gives you a recipe for "In a Pinch Baked Beans."

MICROWAVE: FINDING THE BEST OVENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever questing for "the perfect microwave oven," engineers constantly add new 
features and refinements. The most important development to date is the 
introduction of variable power levels that give you as much control and 
flexibility as conventional ranges. 
</P>
<P>
If, for example, a sauce should bubble furiously on HIGH (100% power) and 
threaten to overflow its container, you need only reduce the power level to 
MEDIUM-HIGH (70%). Or if a stew should drop below a simmer on MEDIUM (50% 
power), you need only raise the power level to 60% or 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Two things determine the different power levels: whether the microwaves cycle 
on and off and how long they remain "on" per cycle. 
</P>
<P>
On HIGH there is no interruption in the flow of microwave energy. On MEDIUM the 
microwaves pulse on and off at regular intervals, so that periods of rest (no 
power) alternate equally with those of full power. 
</P>
<P>
At lower power levels, the "off" periods outlast the "on" and at higher power 
levels, it's the reverse. These on/off cycles mean that foods as heat-sensitive 
as meats, eggs, cheese and creams can cook far more evenly because the heat 
inside them has a chance to spread slowly and equalize during each "off" 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Top-of-the-line microwave ovens offer 10 variable power levels, the simplest 
ovens only HIGH and "Defrost" (usually 30% power), but it varies from 
manufacturer to manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Older ovens may also label 70% power as MEDIUM and 40% power as LOW, so it may 
be necessary to test the microwave oven to determine just what its power levels 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
1. Mix 1 cup cold water and eight ice cubes in 1-quart measure. Stir exactly 1 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
2. Pour 1 cup cooled water into microwave-safe 1-cup measure. Discard remaining 
water and ice cubes. 
</P>
<P>
3. Microwave water, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) until it comes to full 
rolling boil, 3 to 4 minutes. Jot down exact time it takes in microwave oven. 
Discard water and let measure come to room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
4. Repeat steps 1 and 2. Microwave water, uncovered, on MEDIUM (50% power) 
until it comes to full boil. Again jot down time it takes. If it takes water 
exactly twice as long to boil on MEDIUM as it does on HIGH, then the MEDIUM 
power level on microwave oven is indeed 50% power. If the water boils in less 
than twice the time, the MEDIUM power setting is higher than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
5. Again repeat steps 1, 2 and 3, but use power setting lower than MEDIUM. Once 
you determine which setting on the oven actually represents 50% power, you can 
then calculate which settings correspond to LOW, MEDIUM-LOW and MEDIUM-HIGH. 
Make record of each and post as handy reference. 
</P>
<P>
Please note that power levels can fluctuate according to local electricity 
consumption, thus at times of peak usage, the microwave oven may not be 
operating at full capacity.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: FIRE, WALK WITH ME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a certain type of man for whom hot food is never hot enough, the kind 
of guy who adores the green fire of Peruvian aji sauce and splashes chile into 
Korean soups that are already hot enough to smelt tin. Members of this 
brotherhood -- oddly enough there are few women -- keep certain rib stands in 
business, often reek of garlic and cook each other searing stir-fries of beef, 
garlic and habanero peppers. They are the men whose personal Everest can be 
identified by the words "spicy hot for adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Forget Sichuan or Mexican -- Thai food is practically the only stuff hot enough 
for them, Thai food and certain Punjabi curries. Better yet is Isaan cooking, 
from the northeastern part of Thailand, which can be hot enough to stun even 
natives of Bangkok -- even though it's mostly salads. The summit of Isaan 
cooking is the grilled beef thing called seua rong hai, which is reputed to be 
hot enough to make a tiger cry. A Thai friend rolls his eyes when he mentions 
it. 
</P>
<P>
But last week at the splendid Isaan-style restaurant Renu Nakorn, seua rong hai 
was the single mildest dish on the table. Typical comment: "Yowwwwww! Ohhhhh 
ohhhhh; ah-ah-ah . . . geeeeeeez!" This is the kind of stuff you probably hear 
all the time if you live next door to the Leather Castle. 
</P>
<P>
Renu Nakorn is a small restaurant in a Norwalk strip mall, down the street from 
burger stands and Western bars, next door to a working dairy, a mile or so east 
of the 5. (In the parking lot at night, you can smell cows even if you can't 
see them.) Though it seems to be at the end of the universe, it's only 20 
minutes south of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
There was a blistering larb of finely ground catfish seasoned with lime, chile 
and nutty-brown ground toasted rice; there were the thinnest sour strands of 
shredded bamboo shoot dressed the same way; there was an extraordinary, 
coarsely chopped Isaan version of steak tartare that was so delicious it 
could've seared the hairs out of your nostrils. (Renu Nakorn, which may serve 
more kinds of larb than Shakey's does pizza, also makes the minced salad with 
squid and chicken and wonderful browned duck, among other things.) The waiter 
brought a side plate of sliced cucumber and cabbage on a bed of crushed ice, 
which you could nibble on between bites to cool down, and sticky rice in little 
straw baskets, which you're supposed to roll into balls and eat with your 
fingers. The seua rong hai, sliced steak grilled rare and served with a gamy, 
tart dipping sauce, was almost benign, a pleasant, meaty intermezzo between 
fire-breathing salads. 
</P>
<P>
Renu Nakorn's food is spicy, but what makes it wonderful is the fresh play of 
tastes, a fugue of herbs, animal pungencies and citrus that is quite unlike 
anything at your corner Thai cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Later on we ate a chile-seafood soup that would have been terrific in Hollywood 
but seemed pedestrian in Norwalk, good grilled chicken, and fatty chunks of 
pork neck that tasted like fat trimmed off a really well-grilled steak and 
secretly eaten over the sink after dinner. The endorphin high on the way home 
was tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
I know a fellow who keeps in his wallet a card inscribed with Thai writing that 
says something like "He might be a gringo, but he likes his food hot. Please 
don't hold back in the kitchen." (If it really says "Kick Me" in elegant Thai 
script, the guy may never know.) 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he sat down at Renu Nakorn, he took out the card, put it on the 
table where it would attract the waiter's eye, and leaned back, smiling with 
smug satisfaction. A busboy saw it first, and he picked it up and grinned; the 
waiter was next. A man wandered out from the kitchen to examine the artifact. 
My friend was an instant celebrity, and he and the waiter bantered easily about 
chile levels for a few minutes. But the food we ate wasn't any hotter than the 
times we went in without the card. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is pretty extensive, but you'll get more of the best stuff if you 
choose a couple of dishes from the "Renu Nakorn Special" area of the menu and 
look plaintively at the untranslated insert when the waiter comes. You can 
negotiate a real Isaan meal with minimal effort, sweet-hot tendon soup and 
papaya salad studded with shocking chunks of salted raw crab. 
</P>
<P>
You might find a whole deep-fried catfish, crunchy and sweet, whose caramelized 
crust has the smack of Thai ice tea, or dry-fried beef that tastes like the 
world's best beef jerky, served with a smoky chile dip close to a thick 
chipotle salsa. Maybe you'll get the grilled shrimp. But try to finagle the 
grilled beef flanked with chopped raw chiles above and sliced raw garlic below, 
something to bring tears to the eyes of 10 tigers and an elephant and all the 
cows next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Renu Nakorn, 13041 E. Rosecrans Ave., Norwalk, (213) 921-2124. Open 
Tuesday-Sunday, 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Beer. Cash only. Dinner for two, food 
only, $10-$20.

AGRIBUSINESS HITS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An agribusiness coalition has launched a costly promotional campaign to restore 
confidence in the nation's food supply. The Washington-based Agriculture 
Council of America is coordinating the effort -- FoodWatch -- and has collected 
$750,000 in donations during the past 11 months from various commodity groups, 
chemical manufacturers and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The program is the latest in a series of steps being taken by agriculture 
interests to counter criticism over pesticide usage and other food safety 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for instance, Washington State apple growers filed a $150 million 
lawsuit against CBS-TV and the Natural Resources Defense Council because of 
losses stemming from the 1989 Alar controversy. Another recent indicator of the 
farm sector's public relations offensive was its well-financed campaign to 
defeat California Ballot Proposition 128 or "Big Green." 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, there is a new aggressiveness," said Ellen Haas, executive 
director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy in Washington. "There have 
been signs over the last six months that the food and agribusiness industries 
are going to invest heavily in this kind of advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Haas claims, however, that FoodWatch's goal is to "distort" food safety issues. 
"This is an effort to pull the wool over consumers' eyes and to anesthetize the 
public into thinking no problem exists in the food supply," she said. 
</P>
<P>
FoodWatch's current centerpiece is a television commercial portraying 
Pennsylvania Dutch town folk gathering for a meal in a church yard next to a 
corn field. The background music is a rendition of "Amazing Grace." 
</P>
<P>
The only words spoken during the spot are at its conclusion when a narrator 
says, "America's bounty: Brought to you by the 20 million men and women who put 
food on your table." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial's debut was on Thanksgiving Day in as many as 120 television 
markets. All the air time was purchased by supportive corporations or donated 
by local stations as public service announcements, a device that yielded 
significant savings for the FoodWatch campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Future components of the program include media relations, newspaper/magazine 
advertisements, public opinion polling and distribution of educational 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
"FoodWatch is designed to build public confidence in the food and agriculture 
industries and in the institutions that guide them, both public and private," 
said Judy O'Hara, executive director of the Agriculture Council of America. 
</P>
<P>
The FoodWatch solicitations are not as bucolic as the program's generic 
television commercial. A recent advertisement in California Farmer magazine was 
headlined, "What Would You Give to Tell Your Side of the Story?" The ad talks 
about a "nationwide crisis of confidence," "confused consumers" and "making 
sure we'll be able to control our future." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara said that major contributions and support from more than two dozen 
chemical companies and affiliated trade groups have not hurt FoodWatch's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"The (chemical interests') participation represents the fact that some segments 
of industry feel that this problem is more important than the others do," she 
said. "No segment of agriculture should be excluded (from FoodWatch) nor have 
an undue amount of influence." 
</P>
<P>
She also points out that 30% of the funds raised to date are contributions of 
$500 or less from individuals or local organizations such as the Boone County, 
Ind., Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The major presence of chemical companies and trade groups does bother Public 
Voice's Haas. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts their credibility and demonstrates the viewpoint that they are 
taking: Defend the status quo and chemicals in agriculture," Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the National Agriculture Chemical Assn. said that his group -- 
by supporting FoodWatch -- is just trying to explain farming to a vastly urban 
American public. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an excellent program that is supported by all of agriculture, and we 
are a part of agriculture," said Christopher Klose, vice president of the 
Washington-based chemical association. "It is our business to help farmers 
produce safe, abundant and nutritious supplies of food, and Americans do that 
better than anyone else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
FoodWatch's O'Hara says she knows of no formal criticism of the program from 
activist groups. In any event, both consumer advocates and environmentalists 
will be added to the program's advisory committee, which will be announced next 
month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"An important part of the advisory board will be from consumer and 
environmental organizations. Otherwise (the program) is not valid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute in 
Washington, remains skeptical about the motives behind FoodWatch. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the industry would instead spend all this money to clean up the 
problems with contaminated foods, promote safety in poultry processing and 
reduce the use of chemicals in agriculture," he said.

HOW TO BAKE FOR A VERY SMALL CROWD;

<P>
DESSERTS: THERE'S NO NEED TO PREPARE A MOUNTAIN OF COOKIES THIS CHRISTMAS; 
PAIRED WITH ICE CREAM, THESE QUICK-FIX COOKIES ARE A PERFECT DESSERT FOR TWO.

The aroma of freshly baked cookies is just as delightful a part of the holiday 
season as the scent of pine boughs. But even if you don't have a large family 
to bake for, you don't have to miss out -- this column has recipes for cookies 
and ice cream for two. 
</P>
<P>
The cookies, which supposedly originated years ago in Chicago's Senn High 
School (but more likely were part of the Board of Education's basic recipe 
book), are prized by practically everyone who went through that city's school 
system. The delicious, tender butter cookies with a light sugar coating may be 
the only thing some Chicagoans remember about their high school years. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the recipe was easy to scale down. Like most cookie recipes, this 
one is easy to double in case the enticing fragrance brings a crowd to your 
door. 
</P>
<P>
For a special dessert, serve them with rich homemade Cinnamon-Ginger Ice Cream. 
</P>
<P>
SENN HIGH SCHOOL

ball of dough to 3-inch circle, 1/4-inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 350 degrees 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Leave on baking 
sheet 5 minutes, then loosen with spatula and remove to wire rack to cool 
completely. Makes 8 cookies.

ABOUT WINE: FRENCH PRICES UP BUT DEMAND HEADS SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think prices for French wines are excessive, you're not alone. Even 
fine-wine collectors, people who don't raise an eyebrow at a $100 price tag, 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
According to an informal poll of major wine merchants in the Los Angeles area 
-- considered to be the most important wine market in the United States -- the 
weakness of the dollar against the franc, the number of excellent recent 
vintages and a lot of full wine cellars have combined to force down demand for 
expensive wines drastically. 
</P>
<P>
"The market for expensive wines? There is no market, as far as I can see," says 
Steve Wallace, owner of Wally's on Westwood Boulevard, one of the Westside's 
top wine merchants. "The people who usually buy these wines, the collectors -- 
their cellars are full. There is only a small group of people I call 'the 
players,' and they have seen so many good vintages in the last decade they're 
getting tired of the hype." 
</P>
<P>
He says savvy buyers find older wines at auctions at attractive prices. "You 
can find Second Growth Bordeaux for under $300 a case," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Seiple at the Wine House in West Los Angeles says the big buyers are 
dying off. At a recent wine auction, he says, "I saw a number of the 'big 
players' in Los Angeles. They are not players anymore, not involved in the 
market except as casual sippers. Their cellars are full, and they are selling 
their wines at auction." Newer buyers, he says, are more tentative in their 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Futures for the highly praised 1989 Bordeaux are selling slower than in other 
past vintages, when the wines also were rated as being excellent, merchants 
say. (In a futures purchase, buyers agree to make a down payment for wine they 
will take possession of in a year or 18 months, when it is released. Usually, 
such wines are not tasted by the buyer before they are bought.) 
</P>
<P>
"Without even tasting a wine, people will say: 'I have to have that label,' " 
says Tom Burke, a Los Angeles attorney and major wine collector. "Isn't that 
silly? 
</P>
<P>
"People buy wines they think are going to appreciate in value instead of laying 
them down to drink. They say, 'In 10 years this will be worth $200 a bottle 
more than I paid for it.' Sure, and I remember too well the people who bought 
the '69s only to find out that the wines were terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Burke says futures prices are too high; often the same wine will be available 
at a lower price when it hits the shelves. His advice is: "Take money and put 
it in a CD (certificate of deposit) and if you want the wine in a decade, you 
can still find it. It's amazing how many wines you can find on the secondary 
market. You can find high-quality Bordeaux from the 1970 vintage at a lower 
price than today's new releases." 
</P>
<P>
"Futures these days are a poor purchase," says Bob Golbahar of Bel Air Wine 
Merchant. "About 50% (of the sale of futures) is hype and 25% is price: People 
see the price of what some older vintages are selling for and they get excited. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'd say that 30% or 40% of the people who are buying wine today started 
with the 1982 Bordeaux, which have gone up in price, and they think prices are 
going to continue to rise. And I think the first vintage that it won't happen 
with is 1989." 
</P>
<P>
He says that if the franc, now trading at less than five to the dollar, should 
reach seven to the dollar, the price of French wine not yet shipped here would 
drop in price. But even if that doesn't occur, he says, "I think you'll see 
prices coming back"; some dealers in Bordeaux "are holding the '89s and they 
will start dumping them if they don't sell them." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the acclaim 1989 Bordeaux red wines have received, some merchants 
believe the vintage may not be all it's supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely concerned about the (1989) vintage," says Keith Perez of 
Northridge Hills Wine and Spirits. "I think some customers are going to taste 
the wines and wonder if they are worth this kind of money. The fact that people 
(from Bordeaux) have alluded to technical problems (with the wines) is a red 
flag. When they say the acidities are a little out of balance, well, that 
reminds me a little of 1982, and a lot of my customers are asking me to buy 
those wines back from them." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, merchants say, so many wine collectors' cellars are full they are 
trying to turn them into cash. 
</P>
<P>
"People always want the new thing," says Golbahar. "They forget what they have 
in their cellars. Then, after they buy the new stuff, they start selling their 
old wines. We're being offered a lot of '85 Bordeaux. That's why I see little 
market for '88 Bordeaux, and we didn't buy any futures of '89s; we don't see 
any interest in them. And all the stores that did buy them are just sitting 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
Burke, who owns a home in France, says the typical wine buyer doesn't drink all 
that is bought: "You like to buy wine, and you're obsessed with buying it, so 
years later there's some solace if it's (worth) $100 a bottle more than you 
paid for it. But the auction houses are selling off cellars from people who are 
deceased, who amassed huge collections and who died with the corks still in. 
What a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp says he has been offered "a lot of wine from private collectors, a lot 
more than before." Other merchants are buying private cellars too. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Masciana, wine buyer for Bristol Farms, sees no real slowdown in the sale of 
expensive wines, though he admits he's working harder to maintain them. 
</P>
<P>
"When business is down like this, a lot of wine shops don't promote. But our 
dollar volume is up in the last month, and that's because we've been more 
conscientious going after our loyal customers. We've done more advertising, 
sent out more flyers. And we've been selling a lot of Italian wines." 
</P>
<P>
Masciana says Bristol Farms doesn't offer futures on wine. "There so much of 
that available. If you tie up your money a year before you get the wine, you're 
entering into a competitive market where everybody is beating the daylights out 
of each other. Besides, we're buying private cellars and selling 1982s and 
1985s at less than the pre-offer prices. I have 1982 Mouton for $125 a bottle. 
I bought it from a collector. I remember buying that wine at $140 a bottle, 
wholesale, just a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Seiple at Wine House and Dale Sharp at Red Carpet in Glendale have sold a lot 
of Bordeaux futures for 1989, but both said they had to beat drums to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold a lot of wine in May, June and July, when the futures first came out," 
Sharp says. "It was based on all the hype -- you know, 'vintage of the 
century.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sales of expensive Burgundy wines, including those of Domaine de la 
Romanee-Conti (DRC) are off as well, merchants say. There was so little 
response to the initial offering of 1988 DRC wines that the West Coast 
representative for DRC, Wilson-Daniels Ltd., held a summit meeting with top 
wine shops in Los Angeles to find out why. On a futures purchase, the DRC wines 
had a suggested retail price of nearly $4,000 for a mixed case of the various 
vineyard wines. (The suggested retail price for a mixed case of the 1986 and 
1987 wines was $2,200 last year.) 
</P>
<P>
Wallace says he wrote letters to two dozen of the top Burgundy buyers, offering 
them some of the finest red Burgundies in the world, including the DRC wines, 
at cost plus 10%, and had no response. Golbahar says he mailed fliers to 2,000 
wine buyers offering high-end Burgundies at prices barely above cost and had 
about 10 responses. "I think they've priced them for the Japanese market," 
Golbahar says. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Daniels of Wilson-Daniels says sales of the DRC wines have been "good, not 
great. It's been slower than in past years, but that's a combination of things. 
We came out earlier with them this year, during the holidays, and then the 
wines are higher priced because it was an outstanding vintage, probably the 
best they ever made. Now, combine that with the weak dollar and our economy. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"But overall, the entire wine business has softened quite a bit. Even our most 
popular items are slowing down." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp says some red wines -- such as those of George Mugneret, Leroy, Jayer and 
Meo-Camuzet -- are so limited, he had more orders than he had wine to sell. He 
adds, "White Burgundies are dead too, with the exception of three or four 
producers, like Ramonet, Leflaive and Sauzet. There is big price resistance 
because buyers remember when they were $20 to $40 a bottle, and now they are 
$60 to $200 a bottle." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, merchants say the market for futures on high-end California wine 
appears flat too. "California futures is a bogus market," says Seiple. "People 
are not as interested in it as they were a few years ago. It was all based on 
limited supply, but it hasn't worked out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Perez at Northridge Hills adds: "I think people are being a lot more selective. 
A couple of years ago, a good wine selling for $125 would have sold. Now 
there's resistance. People are trading down and saying, 'Let's look for the 
value.' " 
</P>
<P>
He says this is a new phenomenon for Los Angeles. "(Wine buyers in) San 
Francisco and New York have a long history of buying fine Burgundy, and with 
them price was a major factor." In Los Angeles, he says, it hasn't been a major 
factor until now.

BEST BETS: FOLK SONGS OF THE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Yuletide concert filled with Christmas songs, Old World carols and 
seldom-heard winter holiday music may be your perfect entree into the holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday in Ojai, the folk trio Golden Bough will perform a holiday program that 
has been evolving since 1980, with new songs and melodies added each season. 
</P>
<P>
The concert will include many rare songs and instrumental pieces from Ireland, 
Scotland and England, including sing-alongs and favorite Christmas carols. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't hear 'Silent Night' and the like," said Becky Lowe, an Ojai folk 
concert producer. "They perform traditional Celtic folk music." 
</P>
<P>
The trio -- Paul Espinoza, Florie Brown and Margie Butler -- features two- and 
three-part harmonies and plays an array of instruments, including Celtic harp, 
violin, viola, mandolin, guitar, tin whistles, accordion and bodhran, a 
traditional Irish drum. 
</P>
<P>
The 7:30 p.m. concert will be held at the Ojai Valley Woman's Club, 441 E. Ojai 
Ave., Ojai. Tickets are $9.

JEFF KAISER'S NEW WORK COMBINES ELEMENTS OF CHUMASH AND MISSION MUSIC, USING A 
FLUTE AND ELECTRONICS. 
</P>

<P>
Just when you thought that it was safe to take in Venturan music . . . 
composer-performer Jeff Kaiser will be unveiling his latest work, "Changed 
Breaths," at the Momentum Gallery at 7 p.m. Saturday. Kaiser does voice and 
electronic gadgetry. Flutist Renee Janton performs on "Native American 
woodwinds." 
</P>
<P>
Expect everything but the expected. This is a site- and city-specified piece, a 
programmatic work that pays heed to Ventura's twin root systems -- the Chumash 
culture and the Spanish mission. Specifically, the piece deals with the harsh 
cultural subjugation of the latter over the former. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not writing Chumash music and I'm not writing mission music, per se," 
Kaiser said, "but am taking elements of them into a larger form." 
</P>

Kaiser, a 29-year-old who was raised in Ventura, was once headed toward a law 
degree. But the musical impulse reared its head, and he wound up studying 
composition at Santa Barbara's Westmont College. "I wanted to be a musician," 
Kaiser said. "That was a wild decision." Once at Westmont, Kaiser fell under 
the sway of iconoclastic trombonist John Rapson, the noted jazz player and 
composer who headed the college's music department until heading back East this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser is a trumpet player by training, "but mostly I compose and try to get 
other people to perform my stuff." 
</P>
<P>
For "Changed Breath," Kaiser will emerge, like the Wizard of Oz, from behind 
the curtain, to play recorder and vocalize, aided and abetted by sonic 
modifiers. By using electronic effects that create the illusion of multiple 
layers and superimposed harmonies, the Janton-Kaiser duo promises to create an 
effect larger than life. 
</P>
<P>
As Kaiser said, "there's one moment where she's playing a Mexican flute and I'm 
playing a recorder, doing a different melody against it. At the same time, 
weird electronic effects are going on. It makes for a dense texture and it 
sounds like there are a heck of a lot more live players than there actually 
are. I like that." 
</P>
<P>
After a pause, he added, laughing: "I like confusing people. Well, it's not a 
goal, but I like them to say, 'Where did that come from?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser, along with his frequent musical cohort Ted Killian, seems bent on the 
idea of bringing music from the fringe into the center of downtown Ventura. On 
another front, Ocarina Arts is the proposed handle for a home-grown company 
that would release regional New Music tapes. Tomorrow, the county. The next 
day, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
Holiday seasons are like recurring dreams, like your Aunt Lillian's fruitcake, 
the one that just won't go away, year after year. Strictly sweet and maybe a 
bit hard to swallow, the digestive experience has as much to do with nostalgia 
as the delectation of the taste buds. It's the constancy that charms. The same 
goes for "The Nutcracker," which pops up like clockwork every year around 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky had no idea, almost a century ago, that he would be 
supplying Americans with a seasonal perennial. But, peerless composer that he 
was, Tchaikovsky penned "The Nutcracker," one of those timeless works that 
thrive despite our cynical exteriors. 
</P>
<P>
This season, three area symphonies will present "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Symphony, in collaboration with the Channel Islands Ballet Company, 
will present the full ballet at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Symphony Orchestra conducted by Elmer Ramsey will offer its holiday 
wingding at 8 p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday. On the program, of course, will 
be "The Nutcracker Suite" (sans dance maneuvers), plus selections from Handel's 
"Messiah," seasonal brass music by Gabrielli and a medley of fireside holiday 
ditties. The featured vocalist will be soprano Gloria Hodes. 
</P>
<P>
And up the coast, the Santa Barbara Symphony does its annual "Nutcracker" duty, 
in tandem with the Goleta Ballet, at the Arlington at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Saturday 
and 2:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The more the better. After all, Christmas, fruitcakes and "The Nutcracker" come 
but once a year.

That magical moment in "The Nutcracker" ballet never fails to dazzle the 
audience. Suddenly, the glimmering standard-size Christmas tree grows upward 
and outward until it reaches the rafters of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Stunned children gape in amazement. How did they do that? 
</P>
<P>
"That's our secret," laughed Selma Lamb, an Oxnard ballet instructor. She is 
once again putting the final touches on a production of the famous ballet that 
has become traditional holiday fare. 
</P>
<P>
The magic will unfold Saturday when more than 100 dancers take the stage at the 
Oxnard Civic Auditorium to perform "The Nutcracker," a joint effort by the 
Channel Islands Ballet Company and the Ventura County Symphony. The ballet will 
also be presented Sunday and Dec. 14-16. 
</P>
<P>
It's a ballet for and about children, but adults see it year after year too, 
said Lamb, artistic director for the ballet company, now in its 11th production 
of "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
Set to the music of Peter Tchaikovsky, the ballet is the story of Christmas Eve 
at the Silberhaus home in Germany around the turn of the century. The 
Silberhaus children, Clara and Fritz, are anxiously waiting for the family's 
Christmas party to start. 
</P>
<P>
When they finally enter the living room, it is ablaze with the glowing 
Christmas tree and colorfully wrapped presents. During the party, their uncle, 
the eccentric Drosselmeyer, performs magic tricks. He gives Clara a special 
gift, the nutcracker doll. 
</P>
<P>
At the party's end, Clara falls asleep on the sofa in the living room. Her 
dream is the heart of the ballet. The nutcracker is suddenly alive and he 
protects her from an attack by the mouse king and his army of mice. He turns 
into a prince, and by the time Clara awakens she's traveled to several exotic 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
Any young dancer, said Lamb, dreams of performing the role of Clara. 
</P>
<P>
This year the honor goes to 11-year-old Angela Junck of Ojai, who has danced it 
the past two years. Junck has been a ballet student at Lamb's Ballet Academie 
in Oxnard since she was 4. She worked her way up in the ballet, first 
performing minor roles. 
</P>
<P>
The nutcracker prince is performed by Nikolas Saum of Camarillo. Christopher 
Evans, 7, of Ventura takes the role of Fritz. 
</P>
<P>
Kathaleen Hale of Oxnard, who graduates from high school this year, will dance 
the dewdrop solo in the "Waltz of the Flowers." Making a comeback as the Snow 
Queen is Wendy Nachazel, 28, of Ventura. She danced the part in high school, 
then took a break for marriage and two children. Now she's back doing the 
evening performances, while Danah Bella of Ventura dances the Sunday matinees. 
</P>
<P>
This year the magician Drosselmeyer will be less sinister and more mystical, 
Lamb said. Don McMahon, a local actor, makes his debut in the role. 
</P>
<P>
Returning again as special guest artists are Diana Kettler as the Sugar Plum 
Fairy and James Dunne as the Cavalier. Both have danced with major ballet 
companies around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The ballet is long -- 2 1/2 hours. It's a chance not only to see a classic 
ballet, but to hear a full symphony orchestra under the direction of Frank 
Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
"The Nutcracker" ballet, performed jointly by the Channel Islands Ballet 
Company and the Ventura County Symphony, will run Saturday and Sunday and Dec. 
14, 15, and 16 at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, 800 Hobson Way. Tickets are $21, 
$17, $13, and $9. They are available at the auditorium; Ticketmaster outlets, 
583-8700; the Ventura County Symphony office, 3471 Foothill Road, Ventura, 
643-8646; and Ballet Academie, 136 W. First St., Oxnard, 483-3744.

Christmas -- as anyone who has been out of doors or who has perused this 
edition of Ventura County Life knows -- is traditionally the time that local 
dance troupes produce their versions of "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama and Vaudeville Company is 
performing "Christmas Is . . . ," a theatrical version of "The Nutcracker." 
There's some ballet in this one, but there's quite a bit more. 
</P>
<P>
Credited to June Walker Rogers, with an adaptation by the Moorpark group's 
Linda Bredemann, "Christmas Is . . ." includes the dream-sequence story of the 
handsome Nutcracker Prince's (Mark Curry) battle with the conniving Mouse King 
(Richard Zemaitis), and even a bit of Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
But the show -- set in contemporary times -- also features a melange of silly 
gags, old and new songs and audience participation of the kind that is 
associated with the Moorpark Melodrama's non-seasonal productions. 
</P>
<P>
Director Paige Newmark keeps a large, enthusiastic and attractive cast in 
motion for nearly three hours, including two intermissions. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Marie plays Clara, the little girl who lives in a mouse-infested house, 
wears high-heeled shoes with her nightgown and leans toward rather vivid 
dreams. Claude Rowe is her father, Wendy Morgan her mother, and Randall Harold 
is her brother, Mickey, a bratty young man who's reminiscent of a young Tom 
Poston and who -- for reasons unclear -- briefly affects an Alvin the Chipmunk 
get-up late in the show. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Peterson Munz (who has a solo spot as a ballerina) choreographed, 
imaginatively; Wendy Morgan is the choral director, and Linda Bredemann 
designed the clever sets and large range of colorful costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The show itself totally eliminates references to the religious aspects of 
Christmas, treating the holiday simply as a time for good fellowship, family 
unity and gift-giving. 
</P>
<P>
About as far across the county as you can get from Moorpark -- about a 
45-minute drive if you know the way -- Ojai's brilliant Illusions Theater 
company is presenting a one-act, one-hour version of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer." Essentially an expansion of the story in composer Johnny Marks' song 
of the same name, this "Rudolph" features new musical material ("The St. Nick 
Shuffle," a rap, and "Christmas Time," both by West Craig Smith, who plays 
Santa), as well as better-known pop ("Teddy Bears' Picnic") and rock 
("Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now") songs. Phil Collins' "Another Day in Paradise" 
provides the backing to the show's most poignant scene, a retelling of the 
Little Match Girl (Deborah Wolk) story. 
</P>
<P>
Illusions founder Elizabeth Ridenour adapted the story, directed the play and 
plays Mrs. Claus, heading (with Smith) a cast of 25 players, ranging from quite 
young to parents -- and, perhaps, grandparents -- in the company's usual style. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour and choreographers Cheryl Singleton and Karen Moncharsh draw amazing 
performances from the youngsters, especially, and Steve Emery supplies 
sympathetic and appropriate accompaniment on keyboards and guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the Illusions company, sets and costumes are remarkable and cleverly 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
The onstage and backstage skill exhibited in both of those shows, contrasts 
with "Here's Love," the current production of Ventura's Encore Dinner Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The problems start with the book, music and lyrics by Meredith Willson, whose 
prior credits included "The Music Man" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown," both 
of which are vastly superior to this unmemorable show, based on the three 
Oscar-winning 1947 film "Miracle on 34th Street." 
</P>
<P>
The fable brings one Kris Kringle to downtown Manhattan, imbuing the management 
of competing merchants Macy's and Gimbel's with genuine holiday spirit and 
bringing a young couple together. It's pretty thin, and Willson's 1964 score is 
so unmemorable that the composer revived his 1952 "It's Beginning to Look Like 
Christmas" to add a bit of hum-ability. 
</P>
<P>
Beset with problems during rehearsal that included three replacement actors and 
a change in directors, the current production suffers most of all from horrible 
timing -- pauses in dialogue or during scenery changes that bring whatever 
momentum the actors may be generating to a dead stop. On the plus side, this is 
something that's bound to improve along the way. 
</P>
<P>
(Fairness dictates that we confess having left the show during intermission at 
Sunday's matinee, to arrive in Ojai on time for the Illusions production.) 
</P>
<P>
Reservations are virtually mandatory for each of these shows; the Moorpark 
Melodrama and Illusions Theater productions sell out quickly, and the Encore 
Dinner Theater needs to plan seating in advance of each performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
Idon't know about you, but whenever I hear the word art, I think of paintings, 
sculptures, music or dance. I don't think about jewelry, and I certainly don't 
think about clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps my fashion horizons need expanding. Then again, maybe I actually slept 
through something important in my college "Introduction to Art" class. What 
other explanations could there be for all the Ventura County stores now 
claiming to sell "art to wear?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course clothes can be art," Helga Cordes, co-owner of Helga and Hellmut 
Wearable Artin Ojai, said as she pointed to the hand-painted silk ensembles on 
a rack behind her. "These are all one-of-a-kind pieces that were made by a 
local artist. Each one is like wearing a canvas with unique coloring." 
</P>
<P>
Cordes, whose local artist-designer also happens to be her husband, isn't the 
only one who says that clothing and jewelry can be art. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Knight, originally from England and now living in Malibu, held up an 
ornate, brass patina belt in Cordes' store. "This is hand-sculpted and just 
look at the colors," she said. "This is art to me. I mean, have you ever seen 
anything like this?" 
</P>
<P>
In all honesty, it looked like a belt to me. A very nice belt but still not 
something I could see hanging in a gallery. But this view, I'll admit, might 
show a lack of visual sophistication on my part: I still think Andy Warhol's 
acclaimed box of Brillo pads belongs under a kitchen sink. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Gottweld, visiting from Germany, wasn't convinced of the wearable art 
concept, either. "It's nonsense," she said. "In Germany, you would never call 
this art. It may be beautiful, but clothing has nothing to do with art." 
</P>
<P>
Still not satisfied, I walked a few doors down to Ojai's Primavera Gallery. 
Gallery owner Khaled Al-Awar moved past the paintings and sculptures on display 
to show me some one-of-a-kind pieces of jewelry. One was a "treasure necklace" 
that combined small artifacts, including African trade beads, Peruvian coral 
carvings, Chinese coins and Indian ivory walruses. 
</P>
<P>
What, I asked him, was the difference between ordinary jewelry and art? If 
there was no other piece like it, did that automatically make it art? 
</P>
<P>
"Just like music, the colors have a certain harmony," Al-Awar said, holding up 
the treasure necklace. "Real artists create that harmony in their work. And a 
part of us longs for that." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, with a price tag of $1,350, I had to take my longing elsewhere. 
So I headed over to the Bluestone Gallery in Ventura, where owner Karen Stone 
had promised a two-day-only exhibit of jewelry by the famed French artist Erte. 
</P>
<P>
Erte, you may recall, is recognizable for his art deco drawings and sculptures. 
He joined such contemporaries as Picasso, Mondrian, Klee and Dali when he 
branched out into jewelry design. In fact, Erte actually trademarked the term 
"Art to Wear." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery, as it turns out, had only a handful of Erte pieces, which were 
displayed next to a glass case full of watches with the faces of the Mona Lisa 
and other well-known paintings. The Erte art deco cameos, in which gold and 
gems were used like colors of the artist's palette, made me reevaluate the 
whole idea of wearable art. 
</P>
<P>
One last stop at the Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks and then perhaps I would 
understand the whole concept. A small kiosk displayed "Wearable Art by Masti 
Ozlati." There were jean jackets with a rhinestone rendition of the city of Los 
Angeles, T-shirts with hand-painted fish, furry sweaters with rhinestone 
flowers and even a long-line bra studded with, you guessed it, rhinestones. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, I understood. Wearable art, like any other medium, is art if the 
artist says it is. 
</P>
<P>
I got into my car and drove home with a fresh, new perspective. This, I 
thought, must have been what my housekeeper was trying to achieve when she put 
my favorite cashmere sweater in the washing machine with my son's baseball 
jersey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PREMISE 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County is teeming with the fashionable and not so fashionable. There 
are trend-makers and trend-breakers. There are those with style -- personal and 
off-the-rack -- and those making fashion statements better left unsaid. Twice a 
month, we'll be taking a look at fashion in Ventura County -- trends, styles 
and ideas -- and asking you what you think. If you have a fashion problem, 
sighting or suggestion, if you know a fashion success or a fashion victim, let 
us know. We want to hear from you.

AVOCADOS OF THE BACON VARIETY, WHICH CAN TOLERATE FROST, ARE HARVESTED THROUGH 
THE CHILL OF FEBRUARY.

<P>
For many Californians, a salad isn't a salad without it. And without guacamole, 
what would happen to the tortilla chip industry? 
</P>
<P>
The avocado, a teardrop-shaped subtropical fruit, is one of Ventura County's 
leading cash crops. But more important to the eater, if you are going to eat a 
food with a high fat content, the avocado is a healthful, no-cholesterol 
variation. According to the California Avocado Commission, the fruit is low in 
sodium and teems with potassium and 17 other vitamins and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Carson grows about five acres of avocados in Ojai and offers the fruit at 
his Carson Farm Supply roadside stand. "We are just getting under way selling 
the Bacon variety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Bacon, Carson said a second variety is grown commercially in 
Ventura County. The Hass -- identified by its thick, pebbly skin that turns 
dark brown as it ripens -- is the most widely grown variety, making up 80% of 
California-grown avocados. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hass, a Guatemalan variety and the most popular between the two, matures 
February through October and is grown in the warmer districts because it's more 
susceptible to frost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson said the Bacon variety, with a thin, smooth skin, will be in production 
now through February and is grown in the cooler regions of Ventura County, 
given its tolerance to frost. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a Mexican variety that tends to be more watery than the Hass," he said. 
"And it does not command the market price that Hass do." 
</P>
<P>
Carson referred to the Hass as a "heavier, meatier variety with a somewhat 
nutty flavor," while the Bacon is lighter and "just doesn't have as much oil as 
the Hass." 
</P>
<P>
"The Bacon, however, is a more consistent bearer," he said. "You don't have the 
production fluctuation like the Hass." 
</P>
<P>
Harvest yields of the Hass avocado tend to alternate from year to year, Carson 
said. "You will have a big crop one season and the following year production 
falls off." 
</P>
<P>
As much as a 40% difference can be expected. "It's just the nature of the 
beast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At harvest time, the fruit is picked by hand when it has reached a mature, but 
not fully ripened state. 
</P>
<P>
"The fruit must soften off the tree," Carson said. "It's picked when the oil 
content reaches a certain degree." He said the minimum oil content of harvested 
avocados must fulfill strict California Department of Agriculture demands that 
are implemented to protect the consumer from buying undesirable fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum oil content guarantees that the fruit will ripen and will be 
edible," he said. "If picked too soon -- and the oil content is too low -- the 
avocado would just shrivel up and not ripen." 
</P>
<P>
A grower must also judge harvest-readiness relative to the time the avocado 
will spend waiting to be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
"Fruit left too long on the tree will have a high oil content, thereby 
shortening the shelf life because it reaches ripeness too quickly," Carson 
said. "And an avocado with a high oil content can soon become rancid." 
</P>
<P>
After purchasing avocados that haven't reached desired ripeness, consumers can 
control the rate at which the fruit ripens, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can vary according to your needs," Carson said. "Buy three. Put one in the 
fridge, one in a brown bag and the other on the counter. 
</P>
<P>
"The one in the fridge will ripen slowly. An avocado left in a bag will be 
exposed to its own ethylene gas, which speeds up ripening" and, left on the 
counter, an avocado will ripen at an average pace, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson said last year's avocado harvest was generally small due to unfavorable 
weather conditions. Specifically, a heat wave during April -- the bloom period 
-- sterilized the pollen. To make matters worse, a frost hit in February. 
Prices soared. 
</P>
<P>
"However, consumers can expect lower prices this harvest season because the 
crops are looking good," he said. "We'll see an increase in total poundage over

SERVING SUGGESTIONS AVOCADOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tired of that same old guacamole made from those ready-prepared spice packages 
that you simply mix into mashed avocado? 
</P>
<P>
Ventura resident Emily Thomson Beedy would like you to try her award-winning 
recipe. 
</P>
<P>
She recently took second place in the "Great Guacamole" cook-off at the 
Escondido Avocado Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I've always made and just kind of threw together without 
following a recipe," she said. "So when I entered, I had to sit down and 
actually write one out." 
</P>
<P>
And what makes hers special? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the secret to the recipe is the cilantro and Tabasco sauce that I 
use." 
</P>
<P>
Beedy's Famous 
</P>
<P>
 5 large ripe avocados (her recipe calls for the Hass variety) 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium garlic clove, pressed 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon (or to taste) Tabasco sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Mash ripe avocados with pastry blender or fork. Add remaining ingredients and 
mix. Serve garnished with additional cilantro if desired. 
</P>
<P>
Proven far more versatile than just for guacamole or slivered for salad, 
avocados can also be used to make a pie? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's real easy and tastes great," Beedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Here's another Beedy suggestion: 
</P>
<P>
Avocado Lime Pie 
</P>
<P>
 2 large ripe avocados 
</P>
<P>
 1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk 
</P>
<P>
 rind of one lime 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup lime juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
 dash of salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 9-inch graham cracker crust 
</P>
<P>
 1 pint whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 Mash the avocado (should be about 2 cups). Mix milk, rind, juice, yolks and 
salt. Stir until it thickens. Fold in avocado. Fill shell and chill several 
hours. Whip the cream and top the pie.

RANK 'N' ROLL; 
</P>
<P>
THE BAND TAKES ITS NAME FROM ONE IN A SALVADORAN VILLAGE THAT PLAYED ON AS THE 
ARTILLERY SHELLS CAME IN.

How many bands can you name in which every player has a military rank? Heavy on 
the brass, all four of the members of Santa Barbara's Official Resistance are 
officers. Colonel Vince Dirt is the singer, Colonel Doug Gutner is the guitar 
player, Major J.D. Aster plays bass while Captain Bart Tompkins beats out that 
rhythm on the drums. This group is prepared to be the official soundtrack for 
our boys in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really a military thing, but more a brotherhood thing," said Dirt in 
a recent interview. "They're just nicknames." 
</P>
<P>
A good deal of rock 'n' roll success has to do with "the look." Talent is fine, 
but that's incidental. Elvis invented "the look." Poison and a zillion of those 
metal bands have "the look." Milli Vanilli had "the look," if little else. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's hard-rocking quartet, Official Resistance, has not only "the 
look" but also the attitude. Swaggering frontman Dirt has lots of tattoos and 
often strips down to the waist and gives his impression of The Illustrated Man. 
Gutner, on guitar, also strips to the waist, becoming the blond guitar god. And 
by the time half the first song is over, five or six young, single females are 
usually dancing in front of the stage -- a sure sign of rock 'n' roll success. 
</P>
<P>
Official Resistance? What's there to resist in Santa Barbara? Is your espresso 
cold? Is the weather too perfect? 
</P>
<P>
"We're resisting anything worth resisting," Dirt said, "especially 
unintelligence. We got the name from this PBS special on El Salvador. Anyway, 
there was this band called Official Resistance in this Salvadoran village 
playing away while the village was being shelled -- like everything was blowing 
up everywhere -- but the band just kept on playing. We just took the name." 
</P>
<P>
The band has been around since 1988 and plays several times per month at the 
usual locations in Ventura and Santa Barbara. Its tape, "Resist This!," is 
selling well, and its second tape should be ready next month. 
</P>
<P>
"We play in Santa Barbara at Felix's, Joseppi's, Zelo's, the Carnaval Club, 
both Alex's and in Ventura at Charlie's and Club Soda," Dirt said. "We are one 
of only about 10 local bands that play more than twice a month." 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of the band is made up of Santa Barbara locals. Gutner grew up in 
Venezuela, where his parents worked for the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Dos Pueblos High School with J.D.," Dirt said. "After high school, 
J.D. went back to Boston to study drama, while I just hung out in Santa 
Barbara. When he came back, we hooked up, then we met Doug at a party and 
started playing as the Larva. Then we put an ad in the paper for a drummer. 
Bart was the 13th drummer to try out and he got the job. We've been Official 
Resistance since September, 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Official Resistance is a hard rock band with no R.E.M. or Kenny Loggins covers. 
They have 35 or 40 original songs, most fast and loud. The covers they perform 
are of the hard-edged variety by artists such as the Stones, Iggy Pop and U2. 
"Our music is just basic rock 'n' roll music," Dirt said. 
</P>
<P>
Not a scooby-doo/the sky is blue/I love you band, Official Resistance writes 
real lyrics about the Big Issues -- ignorance, the mistreatment of old people, 
democracy in Central America, drug abuse, complacency, things like that. The 
band has played benefits in Santa Barbara for Salvadoran relief funds, animal 
rights, voter registration and Toys for Tots, not to mention an acoustic set at 
a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
"The voter registration show was pretty bizarre," Dirt said. "We were playing 
on the steps of the courthouse, and Lagomarsino was hanging out in front of our 
giant Official Resistance banner. It would've been a great picture. I think we 
were the only ones there who were registered to vote." 
</P>
<P>
The band has the traditional goals in mind: more gigs, more money, and of 
course, the big-label deal. "We'd just like to reach more people and try to do 
some moral good in the world. . . . But it's tough -- there's a lot of apathy 
out there. It's only entertainment, and we're just a rock 'n' roll band." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
Official Resistance will perform at 9 p.m. Tuesday at Alex's Cantina, 633 State 
St., Santa Barbara, For more information, call 966-0032.

SINGER KENNY LOGGINS WILL AGAIN LEAD AN ANNUAL TELETHON TO BENEFIT THE NEEDY OF 
THE TRI-COUNTY AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Barbara singer Kenny Loggins, a veteran of benefit concerts and 
fund-raisers, came up with the idea of Christmas Unity four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit organization is a unified campaign throughout the counties of 
Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo to attract money, food, toys and 
clothing for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Loggins again heads the annual Christmas Unity Telethon, scheduled from 5 p.m. 
to 1 a.m. Saturday on KEYT-TV, Channel 3. Among his guests will be actors 
Michael Douglas and Jane Seymour. The past three telethons have raised more 
than $350,000, and Loggins said he hopes this year's event will set a new 
pledge record of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions come from throughout the tri-counties, with the money donated by 
each county going directly back to that area. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Christmas spirit of unity, the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic 
Preservation will stage a bilingual play tonight through Dec. 16, (except 
Mondays). "Una Pastorela" is in the tradition of the many shepherd's plays that 
were brought by European settlers to California, then a part of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1850s, Pablo de la Guerra, who lived in Santa Barbara, transcribed one 
of the plays. Five years ago, Francisco Gonzalez, a Santa Barbara resident, 
found the script in the mission's archives and adapted it as a bilingual play, 
to be performed by both professional and amateur actors in the community. 
Gonzalez, a former member of the rock group Los Lobos, also wrote the music for 
the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth annual presentation will be at the Presidio Chapel, 124 E. Canon 
Perdido at 8 p.m., with an additional 5 p.m. performance weekends. Tickets are 
$5. Call 966-9719. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Wood, an internationally known Ojai artist, will have an exhibit of 
her ceramic art at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art Saturday through Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Her pottery, both wheel-thrown and handcrafted, is known for its iridescent 
glazes. The exhibit will focus on a selection of her larger vases, but some of 
her figurative works and tiles will also be included. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the museum is $3, and is free Thursdays and the first Sunday of 
each month. Call 963-4364. 
</P>
<P>
For holiday entertainment with a twist, the public will provide the 
entertainment and a bunch of animals will serve as the audience. The Santa 
Barbara Zoo will hold its annual Sing-to-the-Animals afternoon of Christmas 
caroling Sunday. It's mostly for the kids but anyone who wants to sing to the 
bears and monkeys and lions is invited. 
</P>
<P>
Carolers should meet at the information booth at the zoo's parking lot at 2 
p.m. Participants will be led on a musical tour of the zoo with a 
representative who will provide commentary and background information on the 
animals. Admission is $4; children $2. Call 962-5339. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara City College Jazz Ensemble will play at 8 p.m. Monday at the 
Garvin Theater. Admission is $6. The Concert Band and Christmas Brass Concerts 
will perform 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Garvin Theatre. Admission is $6. Call 
965-5935. 
</P>
<P>
"Reckless," a dark comedy about a woman who escapes a slaying planned by her 
husband, opens tonight at Santa Barbara City College's Studio Theatre. It runs 
every night at 8 p.m. through Dec. 15, except Monday. A 2 p.m. matinee is 
scheduled Sunday. Tickets are $7. Call 965-5935. 
</P>
<P>
Also opening tonight is "The Belle of Amherst," a one-woman act exploring the 
life of poet Emily Dickinson. The play will run Thursdays, Fridays and 
Saturdays, beginning at 8 p.m., through Dec. 22 at the Backstage Theatre in 
Solvang. Tickets cost $8 to $16. Call 922-8313 or 800-221-9469.

LIVING ON THE EDGE AND LOVING EVERY BIT OF IT

<P>
I live in Encinitas, on the edge of the shopping centers that surround the 
mega-intersection of Encinitas Boulevard and El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Folklore would have it that such centers are deadening to the soul, redolent of 
modern greed and plasticity. That's bushwa, of course, like much that is 
written about suburban life. 
</P>
<P>
For a devout consumer, it is a daily celebration to live credit card-by-jowl 
with Village Square I, Village Square II, Wiegand Plaza, Village Encinitas 
Plaza, Little Oaks Plaza, Camino Encinitas Plaza, Camino Village Plaza, De La 
Plaza Encinitas, et al. 
</P>
<P>
Color me PIMBY: Please, in My Back Yard. 
</P>
<P>
Atop a hill, the most visible landmark of our community, sits a Target store, 
its large, glowing red sign beckoning all, a Parthenon of discount retailing. 
</P>
<P>
Our shopping centers offer cures for all that ails those with Excess Disposable 
Income. Where else would zombie teen-agers find employment? 
</P>
<P>
We feel protective of our shopping centers. They are a part of the cycle of 
life-death-rebirth of our community. 
</P>
<P>
They give us succor, eyeglasses while you wait, designer pet food, one-hour 
photo development, Southern barbecue, dental work and day care. 
</P>
<P>
A pasta market closes but Jenny Craig takes its place (same customers). An H. 
Salt Esq. fast-food fish place closes and is reborn as Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Generations ago, fathers took sons into the forest to hunt bear. Now we go 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
My son Wes, who is 3, knows that Target opens late on Sundays. He could say 
"Ralphs" before he could say "Daddy." He worships at the altar of Play Co Toys. 
</P>
<P>
We go to B. Dalton. I buy "The Closing of the American Mind." He gets "Sneak 
Attack: A Tasty Pop-Up Book." Same theme, really. 
</P>
<P>
We go to Video Depot (one of six video stores within a quarter of a mile). As 
always, I ask if there's anything new with lots of sex and violence. Wes zeroes 
in on "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Close Escrow," or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, our Video Depot was named store-of-the-month for North County. 
We're all so proud. 
</P>
<P>
Wes and I go to Great News, which sells knickknacks and novelties and cards and 
similar stuff, a great place for last-minute husbands who forget anniversaries. 
It's closing at the end of the month. Angst everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
I swear I hear Wes explain to a friend, "They lost their lease." 
</P>
<P>
Kids learn so early in the suburbs.

SURF WAX AND SPANDEX ARE OCEANSIDE STAPLES 
</P>

Newcomers to Oceanside hear tales of a day gone by, when the city had no budget 
deficit and the now-eroded beach was wide and gleaming. Back then, old-timers 
remember, San Diego County's northernmost city was known for this cheeky motto: 
"Tan Your Hide in Oceanside." 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed some. Now, civic boosters prefer "The Beauty by the Sea" to 
describe this struggling resort town that many seniors and military families 
call home. Still, now more than ever, an Oceanside shopping spree is more 
likely to yield sunblock than haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
If you like your clothing to contain at least some natural fibers, then yes, 
it's probably best to head for the malls. But for other items -- from surf wax 
to Spandex -- a trip to Oceanside will not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
A discerning shopper will find that, behind its tire outlets and discount 
furniture stores, Hill Street is Oceanside's Rodeo Drive. Especially if you 
have a yen for sporting goods. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you've visited its other branches, Hobie Oceanside Sports &amp; Beach 
Center is worth the trip. Housed in a pink mock-adobe building, the two-story 
outlet is like a museum for the eternally playful. 
</P>
<P>
There are surf-, boogie- and skateboards -- not to mention seriously casual 
clothing to lend you that I-look-this-good-without-even-trying attitude to 
which true beach bums aspire. The prices aren't cheap, but there are used 
boards upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Pro Motion Wetsuits down the street sells boards and surf accessories as well 
as rubber-wear. But this month, their windows alone are worth the trip. Painted 
for Christmas, they feature a spirited Santa riding a wave. A bikini-clad woman 
(Mrs. Claus?) watches admiringly from the next pane. "Oooh, Santa, you rip!!" 
she screams. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, near the intersection of Oceanside Boulevard, Alan's Cyclery 
awaits. Like Hobie, this is no bargain basement. But the selection is great and 
the salespeople are both knowledgeable and friendly -- and not just when 
they're ringing up your purchase. 
</P>
<P>
When I bought a helmet, a sales clerk spent half an hour adjusting it to assure 
a safe fit. 
</P>
<P>
And, because it is located along one of the county's most popular cycling 
routes, the store often serves as a way station for bikers whose chains have 
slipped. 
</P>
<P>
They can make a quick trip inside to fix that chain, pump up a tire and maybe 
even get a new water bottle and pair of riding gloves before hitting the road 
again.

Other people take their out-of-town guests to Sea World. My wife takes ours to 
Kobo. The place is a shrine to California casual, the style they crave back 
East but haven't quite perfected in New York or Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Bag the Zoo. We go to El Corral Pottery. All that terra cotta and Mexican 
pottery, displayed neatly in front of the store and on miles of shelves inside. 
Find that in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
You see, we're from the Northeast. We get a lot of visitors. A lot of repeat 
visitors, to be specific. They come in winter, when they can't stand the cold, 
and again in summer for a cheap vacation. And when we've done Disneyland, the 
Wild Animal Park and the beach, we've got to take them somewhere. Our house is 
too small. 
</P>
<P>
So we've perfected the shopping-as-tourism routine. Near our North County home, 
that means the little shops of Carlsbad Village and downtown Carlsbad, where 
they naturally gravitate to the beach and border stuff that is hard to come by 
in their pinstriped environment. 
</P>
<P>
There are actually three Kobos -- two in Del Mar and one in Carlsbad. One Del 
Mar store specializes in pricey T-shirts and sweat shirts that we buy for my 
younger brother's birthday every year. The other is full of dressier casual 
chic that the Easterners are drawn to but never seem to buy. My wife and her 
sister spend hours there each summer trying it all on without buying anything. 
I know a woman who calls this "clothes bulimia." 
</P>
<P>
But, when it's time to dump the kids on the husbands and flex some serious 
plastic, it's Kobo Carlsbad. They have the T-shirts and sweat shirts, the 
beachwear and that all-cotton, trendy, summer casual stuff. One visitor who 
wears colorless sacks from the clothing equivalent of the Whole Earth Catalog 
always leaves looking like Shari Belafonte. 
</P>
<P>
We're lobbying the owners for a sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
El Corral is our ace in the hole. About a week before the guests arrive, we 
wander through there and pick out a few things we like. Then we take the 
tourists back. They love it and, more important, they always insist on a small 
gift to thank us for holding our tongues when their 3-year-old spilled barbecue 
sauce on the new carpet. My parents have bought us most of a set of dishes this 
way. 
</P>
<P>
We still need the gravy boat. My folks are due in April.

TAX INCREASE MAY HELP METRO RAIL REACH VAN NUYS BY 2000, PLANNERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
The voters have provided enough money to complete the Metro Rail subway from 
downtown to Van Nuys by 2000 -- one year earlier than previously planned -- and 
all the way to Warner Center by 2009, county rail planners said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, separate light-rail lines could be built from downtown to Pasadena by 
1995 and from downtown to Glendale by 1996, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Planners raised those possibilities in a report to the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission on tentative plans for allocating the proceeds of the 
extra half-cent sales tax that voters approved last month. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners, who took no action on the staff recommendations Wednesday, 
cautioned that the staff-drafted plans might be changed substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope people don't take this as set in stone," said William Bicker, Mayor Tom 
Bradley's representative on the commission. "We still have to work out 
thousands of details." 
</P>
<P>
In March, when the commission staff last unveiled a construction schedule, no 
provision was made for extending the subway west of the San Diego Freeway to 
Warner Center or for building a light-rail line to Glendale. Transit officials 
said there was no money available for those projects. 
</P>
<P>
But because county voters on Nov. 6 passed a second half-cent sales tax to 
finance transportation spending -- in 1980, voters approved the first half-cent 
tax increase -- planners now have $800 million a year to spend on building and 
operating rail and bus lines, plus federal and state money allocated for 
specific projects. 
</P>
<P>
Under two scenarios the staff suggested to the commission Wednesday, Metro 
Rail's second, third and fourth phases would be completed simultaneously in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
The three segments, each of which is to be built with a different mix of 
federal, state and local funds, include: from MacArthur Park on Wilshire 
Boulevard to the northern edge of Hollywood, from there to Lankershim and 
Chandler boulevards in North Hollywood, and from there to the San Diego Freeway 
just south of Victory Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Under one scenario, the line's final nine miles from Van Nuys to Warner Center 
would be completed in 2009, while the second plan called for completion in 
2020. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission in March voted to extend the downtown subway west from 
North Hollywood to Van Nuys, a group of monorail supporters continues to push 
for an elevated monorail along the Ventura Freeway from Universal City to 
Warner Center in lieu of the Metro Rail extension. 
</P>
<P>
They are predicting that a commission-paid study of the monorail plan will find 
that the 16.5-mile line can be built for about the same $1.1 billion that it 
would cost to build the 5.6-mile subway extension from North Hollywood to Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Under both plans unveiled Wednesday, the downtown-to-Pasadena light-rail line 
would benefit most from the new infusion of cash. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the line was formally adopted by the commission and scheduled for 
construction from 1995 to 1998. But both scenarios suggested that construction 
begin next year, with completion by 1995.

15 SITES STUDIED FOR SCHOOL FOR EXPELLED STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: DISTRICT OFFICIALS MAKE ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER WOODLAND HILLS RESIDENTS 
PROTEST SUGGESTION THAT PROBLEM STUDENTS BE SENT TO NOW-CLOSED HUGHES JUNIOR 
HIGH.

<P>
Los Angeles school officials said Wednesday they are studying about 15 
locations throughout the city, including a Woodland Hills site that roused 
neighbors' fears, to house special classes for the growing number of students 
expelled from regular schools for violence, or possessing drugs or weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District officials suggested earlier this week that 
about 30 expelled students be sent to two classrooms at the former Hughes 
Junior High School in Woodland Hills, now used as office space for district 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion drew complaints from nearby residents who said they feared that 
the students would increase crime in the west San Fernando Valley neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Joy Picus, who lives about a block from the school site, said 
she is adamantly opposed to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved to Woodlands Hills because it has a very low crime rate," said 
Melinda Harrison, a real estate agent who lives in a cul-de-sac that faces the 
school. "It's a frightening thought. These students were expelled for criminal 
offenses." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Mostovoy, administrative consultant for school operations, said the 
Hughes school is only one of about 15 closed campuses and administrative 
offices being considered for use by the Los Angeles County Office of Education, 
which operates special schools and assists local districts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite news reports that Hughes was the only site under consideration, other 
unnamed sites are also possibilities, he said. "Hughes was just one name that 
popped out" during a school board discussion Monday night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mostovoy, who declined to name the sites, said they are divided about evenly 
between the San Fernando Valley and the rest of the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The county office now operates 14 community day centers, where expelled 
students can earn high school diplomas while receiving special attention in 
smaller-than-average classes. But the Los Angeles district has used up its 
allotted number of seats in the county program and the centers are full. 
</P>
<P>
With a tough new expulsion policy this year, Los Angeles school officials 
expect to boot out more than 200 students by June, almost five times the 41 
students expelled in the 1988-89 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years, when most students classified as "expelled" were simply 
transferred to other schools, students caught carrying weapons are now removed 
from the system entirely. They can apply for readmission after two semesters. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley school board member Julie Korenstein, who pushed for increasing 
expulsions in the district, said the district must also do its share to find 
other schools for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want them wandering the streets," Korenstein said. "It is also more 
cost-effective to find them a place in school rather than a place in the 
juvenile justice system or prison." 
</P>
<P>
However, Korenstein said she opposes the Hughes site because it is at the 
western edge of the county, too far for most students to travel. 
</P>
<P>
Picus, who is in Houston attending a meeting of the League of Cities, is 
"absolutely opposed to this use of the school," said her aide, Jackie Brainard. 
Picus believes the school would "bring in kids with severe behavioral problems 
and would have an extremely negative impact on a quiet, peaceful neighborhood," 
Brainard said. 
</P>
<P>
Her office received about 25 "really emotional" phone calls from local 
residents opposed to the proposal, Brainard said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, said he 
received about seven phone calls from residents opposed to use of the Hughes 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fear in the area that all of a sudden they are going to be robbed, 
raped and murdered and that all kinds of bad things are going to happen to 
them," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, the Hughes campus should be given serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just abandon these youths," Gross said. "There has to be a program 
offered and available to help the kids that want help, or else they will be out 
there on the streets doing things we would rather not have them do. Whether 
Hughes Junior High is an appropriate campus for that, though, remains to be 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
Gross said he is asking the district for more information about what provisions 
will be made for student transportation, security and after-school activities. 
He said the homeowners board will discuss the issue at its meeting tonight.

PARK AGENCY HUNTS FOR NEW FUNDING AFTER PROP. B DEFEAT; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: SANTA MONICA CONSERVANCY CONSIDERS A NEW BOND INITIATIVE AFTER THE 
FAILURE OF A MEASURE THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED $76 MILLION. STAFF CUTS AND 
DEFERRED LAND ACQUISITION ARE POSSIBILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Staggered by voter rejection of a massive bond issue that would have given it 
$76 million in yearned-for revenues, a state agency that buys parkland in the 
Santa Monica Mountains is studying new ways of raising money for itself, 
including a scaled-down bond initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy decided earlier this week to spend 
$88,000 to pay three staff researchers for six months of exploring alternative 
ways of raising more cash. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed the defeat last month of Proposition B, the biggest bond 
measure in county history. The $816-million initiative was designed to finance 
improvements to parks, beaches, museums and other public facilities throughout 
Los Angeles County. The bonds, which required two-thirds approval for passage, 
received only 57%. 
</P>
<P>
About $76 million of the proceeds were earmarked for parkland acquisition by 
the conservancy. The agency, which played a major role in drafting and 
promoting the bond act, also would have been eligible for an additional $30 
million designated for trail planning and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our great hope was Proposition B, which would have carried us on and done 
incredible things," conservancy Chairwoman Carole B. Stevens said. "It came so 
close to winning and it was heartbreaking to lose." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the conservancy will not get $10 million set aside for it in a 
statewide bond issue, Proposition 149, which also went down to defeat in the 
Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said the agency's budget "is 
extremely tight" as a result of the two failed bond measures. Land purchases 
recently approved by the agency's directors but not yet finalized will leave it 
with a deficit of $640,000 next fiscal year, which could lead to staff cuts, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's biggest source of income next year, $10 million from a 
statewide bond issue that passed last June, is already reserved for buying land 
in Fryman Canyon in Studio City, Malibu's Corral Canyon and Sage Ranch south of 
Simi Valley, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically have cleared out the cupboard and emptied the cookie jar and then 
. . . licked all the crumbs from the jar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials had been counting on Proposition B to finance the 
purchase of a number of parcels that may now be snapped up for development, 
Edmiston said. Among them are 250 acres in Hogg Canyon in the Sepulveda Pass 
area east of the San Diego Freeway and 1,600 acres in lower Topanga Canyon, 
west of Fernwood-Pacific Road. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Feldman, a conservancy official who managed the campaign for Proposition 
B, said the conservancy is looking into the possibility of another bond issue 
-- aimed only at Los Angeles city voters -- to generate new funds. The measure 
would raise more than $200 million for a variety of park-improvement projects, 
with up to half set aside for land purchases in the Santa Monicas, she and 
Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it failed countywide, Proposition B ran up 63% of the vote within the 
city of Los Angeles. Edmiston said he believes that a campaign targeting city 
voters could win the necessary two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said city officials are already studying the feasibility of a citywide 
bond initiative for the April ballot. Conservancy officials are working with 
Councilmen Joel Wachs and John Ferraro to include money for mountain parks, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevens, the conservancy's chairwoman, said she doesn't believe such an 
initiative will pass. She noted that although voters in East and South-Central 
Los Angeles favored the countywide bond package by large margins, it lost badly 
in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Given the recession and public anxiety about a possible war in the Persian 
Gulf, local voters are in no mood to boost their property taxes to finance new 
city bonds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said another possibility would be creation of a "benefits assessment 
district," under which a special parks tax could be imposed on property owners. 
The district could be established by a simple majority vote of those affected, 
instead of two-thirds.

LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest letter from Gerald A. Silver about Los Angeles County Proposition C, 
the half-cent sales tax for transit, contains the usual rantings and factual 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition C received over 847,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a "small" percentage of Los Angeles County voters. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach-Los Angeles Blue Line was not $800 million over budget. The 
entire project cost about $850 million. 
</P>
<P>
How do you stop growth? Los Angeles County increased its population by 930,000 
from 1980 to 1988. Should we make everyone leave the county who has been here 
less than 10 years? The city of Los Angeles increased its population by 368,000 
people from 1980 to 1988. This means more cars and more traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The people, as reflected by two ballot measures in 1980 and 1990, have decided 
to try to build a system of transit to at least keep up with the increases and 
to give people an alternative to driving. Is this so awful? 
</P>
<P>
We need solutions that will help people get around. Blaming people for what is 
already a fact does not accomplish anything.

We read today, with a mixture of nostalgia, disgust and outrage, Amy Louise 
Kazmin's article regarding the proposed demolition of the Munch Box in 
Chatsworth in order to build yet another sterile, ugly and unnecessary 
mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia for the many years that we have spent perched on a stool in front of 
the Munch Box, enjoying a meal and watching the world roll by; disgust and 
outrage at the shortsighted individuals in Los Angeles city government and 
private enterprise, working together to rob Chatsworth of one of its few 
remaining local landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Industrializing the West Valley may increase the tax base for Los Angeles, but 
it has brought nothing but congestion, crime and blight to this once pretty and 
peaceful corner of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Have the people in City Hall no sense of place? Have they no regard for their 
working class constituents? This is yet another example of the continued 
erosion of the quality of life in Los Angeles, and in Chatsworth in particular, 
for the benefit of a greedy few.

CRIMINAL, NOT A HUNTER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' article "Police Seek Man Who Killed Doe With a Crossbow" refers to 
the sick individual who committed this horrendous crime as a "hunter." 
</P>
<P>
This man does not fit the definition of a hunter, a man or woman who enjoys 
nature and all that it has to offer. Ninety-nine percent of hunters respect and 
abide by the rules and regulations that govern the sport. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is helping feed the anti-hunting fire, ensuring that the decent men 
and women who enjoy this noble sport are stripped of their privilege to do so.

SOUR NOTE ON BANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article "Warriors on a Musical Battlefield" by Aaron Curtiss focuses on 
the defending division champion, Canyon High School Band. 
</P>
<P>
Having attended the event, I found your article lacking in balance. 
</P>
<P>
The article was obviously intended as local valley interest but failed to 
mention that the event was hosted by the William S. Hart High School Band. I 
watched the students from Hart High School spend the entire day in dedicated 
efforts to host the event and then put on an exceptional marching demonstration 
rivaling the competing bands' performances. 
</P>
<P>
The Saugus High School Band also performed exceptionally well, but the only 
mention of this band was contained in a quote, "If we beat Saugus, we'll be 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
You are obviously aware that student participants in a competition such as the 
Rampage are striving to do their best and are excited by what our newspapers 
publish concerning the event. A more balanced coverage involving all the valley 
high schools would certainly have been appreciated.

PALOS VERDES' BOHNER LEADS WITH ACTIONS, WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Bohner denies there's a secret to the dramatic turnaround of the Palos 
Verdes High football team. "We've been doing nothing different," he said. 
"We're just doing it better." 
</P>
<P>
And Palos Verdes coaches say nobody does it better than Bohner when it comes to 
giving his teammates a lift. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4, 230-pound senior, a two-way starter at tight end and inside 
linebacker, provides an intimidating presence on the field. Just as important, 
though, Bohner has emerged as an emotional leader in the past month, when the 
Sea Kings have transformed themselves from a struggling team into a CIF 
finalist. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (8-5) will play at Temecula Valley (10-3) on Saturday night for 
the Southern Section Division VIII title. Kickoff is 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
A modest Bohner downplays his role in the Sea Kings' turnaround. Asked if he is 
a vocal player, he replied: "I like to think so." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Coach Bill Judy knows so. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tremendous leader," Judy said, "one of the best we've had." 
</P>
<P>
However, it wasn't until Palos Verdes had hit its low point of the season that 
Bohner asserted himself, Judy said. It came during halftime of a Nov. 2 game 
against Redondo. The Sea Kings trailed, 20-0, and were about to drop to 0-3 in 
the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Judy addressed the players in the locker room at Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset that we were standing around (in the game) and getting wiped out," 
he said. "We were getting no second or third efforts. I got into them about 
pride. I was so disgusted with what I was having to tell them, I finally said: 
'Screw it. You guys decide to do whatever you want.' I walked out." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, assistant coach Ken Russell took the four senior captains, 
including Bohner, aside and implored them to demonstrate more leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Bohner went back in there and he talked to them," Judy said. "Boy, he really 
laid into them. He talked about pride, dedication and refusing to lose. It was 
a great little talk. We came out in the third quarter and performed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Russell: "Dave took over at that point. What he said brought tears to my 
eyes. From that point on, he has become the accepted leader of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes lost its fourth consecutive game that night, but the seed was 
planted. Never again would the Sea Kings want for leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"From that time on, there's been a little different attitude and different 
leadership from our seniors," Judy said. 
</P>
<P>
And different results. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes posted its fourth consecutive victory since the Redondo game 
Saturday night by beating top-seeded Cabrillo of Lompoc, 21-7, in a Division 
VIII semifinal at North Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Bohner's contributions included an interception, a 30-yard kickoff return and 
his usual steady play on the offensive line, which has been impressive 
throughout the playoffs. The Sea Kings rushed for 275 yards against Cabrillo 
and did not attempt a pass in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not stop them," Cabrillo Coach Steve Haskins said. 
</P>
<P>
Bohner can take only partial credit for the stellar play of the offensive line. 
He was quick to identify his comrades in the trenches: tackles Brandon 
Himelwright (6-3, 235) and James Pratt (5-10, 215), guards Aaron Rourke (6-2, 
205), Greg Darden (6-1, 180) and Andrew Miller (6-4, 210), center Kevin 
Rounsavelle (6-2, 220) and the other tight end, John Miller (6-1, 175). 
</P>
<P>
The line, like the rest of the team, has blended well over time. 
</P>
<P>
"People are a lot more relaxed now," Bohner said of his teammates. "I think 
there's a lot of unity now. Before, I think people were frustrated with 
themselves. It kind of drove us apart. But we've come together well." 
</P>
<P>
Bohner said the turning point came in the Sea Kings' final Ocean League game, 
against rival Rolling Hills. Needing a victory to have a shot at a playoff 
berth, Palos Verdes fell behind after the first quarter, 14-0, but rallied for 
a stunning 45-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rolling Hills game really brought people together," Bohner said. "Once we 
came together, we performed well." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings carried their new-found togetherness into the playoffs. They 
routed fourth-seeded Santa Paula, 45-18, in the first round and followed that 
with a 21-7 victory over Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
Judy said Saturday's victory over Cabrillo included another fiery pep talk from 
Bohner at halftime. Palos Verdes led at the time, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a zoo in (the locker room)," Judy said. "All of sudden, Bohner 
took over. He said, 'We've got 24 minutes to get to the finals.' The kids 
started to get excited." 
</P>
<P>
Bohner's words might be meaningless if he wasn't able to back them up. An 
All-Bay League pick last season as a tight end, he was the only player named to 
the All-Ocean League first team this year on offense and 
</P>
<P>
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Bohner prides himself on his hard-nosed style. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to knock people over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Judy: "He's very Neanderthal in his football approach. He's the most 
physical ballplayer we have." 
</P>
<P>
Off the field, Bohner displays a different side. 
</P>
<P>
A lover of the outdoors, he enjoys camping and skiing. His 3.0 grade-point 
average and 1,060 score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test demonstrate that he can 
hit the books as well an opposing running back. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very well-rounded," Judy said. "He's not a bookworm and he's not just an 
athlete." 
</P>

Bohner calls the signals for the Palos Verdes defense and frequently makes the 
correct adjustments during games. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a real sense for what's going on out there," Judy said. "He does more 
than just call signals. He's always thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Among the colleges that have contacted Bohner, he said, are Colorado, UCLA, 
Stanford and Oregon. He added that junior college is another option. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Lascola, head of the Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn., rates 
Bohner a major-college prospect. "We like his size," Lascola said. 
</P>
<P>
At Palos Verdes, they measure Bohner by the size of his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what happened at halftime of the Redondo game got to his sense of 
pride," Judy said. "It was almost like he was saying, 'I'm not going to take 
this any longer. I'm going to go out there and knock people down, and you guys 
better do the same.' " 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes seems to be following Bohner's lead.

CARSON'S CRUSADE CONTINUES VS. GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RAATZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is an emotional time for wide receiver Latario Rachal of Carson High, 
which takes on Granada Hills at 7:30 Friday night in an L.A. City 4-A Division 
semifinal at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Rachal is still excited about his five-touchdown performance in a 54-0 
quarterfinal victory over El Camino Real on Friday. And he, like all the Colts, 
is caught up in a crusade to send retiring Coach Gene Vollnogle out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of pressure on us to bring (Vollnogle) a championship in his 
last season," said Rachal, who has a school-record 23 career touchdown 
receptions. "It's not only that we want to do it for him, but we've had a lot 
of the older guys who used to play here talking to us. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying, 'You've got to send him out on top.' We feel like we can't let 
him down." 
</P>
<P>
Rachal said that the Carson (10-1) offense matches up well with the tough 
Granada Hills (10-1) defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Their guys up front and in the middle are strong -- maybe the best we've 
played -- but we're not that impressed with their cornerbacks," said Rachal, 
who set a preseason goal of 1,000 yards and surpassed that mark last week. "We 
think we can get deep on them." 
</P>
<P>
Rachal burned the El Camino Real defense for three scoring receptions and he 
also returned a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a thrill, something that doesn't happen very often," Rachal said. "I 
wasn't expecting all that, especially since I had only returned about three 
punts and three kickoffs all season." 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills Coach Darryl Stroh's offense is led by running back Brett 
Washington (1,550 yards, 23 touchdowns) and quarterback Bryan Martin (1,710 
yards, 19 touchdowns). Stroh said safety Derrick Stewart and linebacker Curt 
Hulshizer are his top defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
In the other City 4-A semifinal, Friday night at Gardena High, Banning (8-3) 
will meet Dorsey (9-2), a team the Pilots beat, 21-0, in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom says that when teams meet for the second time in a season, 
the team that lost the first game has the advantage of additional motivation. 
But Banning Coach Joe Dominguez doesn't totally subscribe to that thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that is a playoff game will have both teams pumped up," Dominguez 
said. "We both have the incentive to get to the City championship, although 
they very well may try to use that loss to create even more motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"They can say, 'We know Banning and how they play now.' But it all comes down 
to who blocks and tackles better." 
</P>
<P>
The game features two of the City's most versatile players. 
</P>
<P>
Banning has Travis Davis, a 1,600-yard rusher who is also a top defensive back 
who had two interceptions last week. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey has Lamont Warren, the 1989 City 4-A Player of the Year at running back 
who is now the Dons' quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
In a regular-season loss to Carson Nov. 9, Dorsey's regular quarterback, Ronald 
Peebles, injured a thumb on his right (throwing) hand and was lost for the 
season, forcing Warren to switch positions. Ironically, the change has seemed 
to spark the Dons' offense, which was struggling as Warren's play at tailback 
was hampered because of a sore ankle.

EL CAMINO COLLEGE LINEMAN JUSTICE IN GOOD CONDITION AFTER SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center said El Camino College 
offensive lineman Jim Justice was upgraded from serious to good condition 
Wednesday, two days after a tumor was removed from his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Yukelson, the hospital's director of public relations, said Justice was 
admitted Friday and operated on Monday morning to remove a tumor the size of a 
Ping-Pong ball from the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
"He's out of intensive care and in good condition," Yukelson said Wednesday 
morning. "He got out of bed and sat up in a chair for the first time today, 
which is indicative of progress." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Coach John Featherstone, who saw Justice Wednesday afternoon, said 
the athlete is still heavily sedated, but appears to be making progress. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in much better spirits and the headaches are gone," Featherstone said. 
"In the next 24 hours they should know what the biopsy will reveal." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barry Ceverha, the neurosurgeon who performed the operation, said if the 
tumor is benign, Justice will be released in three to five days, barring 
complications. Ceverha said the normal recovery process in most cases is four 
to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Ceverha said test results would be known today. The doctor said the growth was 
unrelated to a concussion Justice suffered in El Camino's game against Long 
Beach City College on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Justice, a 6-foot-3, 265-pound freshman, was a Mission Conference 
honorable-mention selection. The 18-year-old prepped at Leuzinger, where he was 
an All-South Bay.

THIRD WORLD NATIONS COMPLAIN THAT TRADE TALKS EXCLUDE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The world's poor countries, which were drawn into international trade talks 
four years ago by promises that they would gain new export markets, are 
complaining now that the talks have degenerated in their final scheduled week 
into a U.S.-European food fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been shut out completely," Mokammel Hague, the Bangladeshi commerce 
secretary, said Wednesday. "We are feeling like schoolchildren waiting for the 
results to come out of the headmaster's room." 
</P>
<P>
The "headmaster's room" is where U.S. and Western European negotiators are 
trying to find common ground on the divisive issue of government payments to 
farmers. The United States wants subsidies slashed by 75% and more, but Europe, 
intent on preserving its family farmers, has offered no more than 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Ministers of about half the countries participating in the talks met until 
shortly after midnight this morning in yet another effort to reconcile their 
differences over agriculture and other issues, but the closed session broke up 
amid emotional recriminations. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the negotiations gave the 12-nation European Community until 
noon today to soften its resistance, according to his spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
But the chairman, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Hector Gros-Espiell, did not spell 
out the consequences of missing his deadline. A spokesman, David Woods, said, 
"You'll just have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Some Third World delegates threatened to keep their signatures off an agreement 
prepared without their involvement by the industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian trade ambassador Rubens Ricupero, saying he was speaking for more 
than 70 developing countries, said they had made a "firm decision to resist any 
attempt to impose a ready-made package put together by a few participants and 
presented at the last minute on a take-it-or-leave-it basis." 
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said Third World countries were fed up with a "lack of adequate 
attention to the areas of their special interests." 
</P>
<P>
Third World countries have substantial stakes in agriculture and many of the 14 
trade arenas under negotiation. Third World textile producers are seeking to 
bring down barriers to their goods in the developing countries, and sugar cane 
producers want Europe to reduce its subsidies for sugar beets. 
</P>
<P>
Many Third World delegates among the 107 nations at the negotiations are afraid 
that the United States and other rich countries want to open Third World 
markets to services and to foreign investment without giving much in return. 
</P>
<P>
One Indian delegate said U.S. negotiators were asking the Europeans to open 
their borders to farm products and asking Third World countries to allow in 
foreign banks and other service providers. "What is the United States willing 
to give up?" he wondered. 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar's trade minister, Solofoson Georges, representing African countries 
at the talks, warned that any final agreement seemed "almost certain to involve 
losses which exceed any possible gains." 
</P>
<P>
"African countries insist on being fully involved in the final stages of the 
negotiating process and would not wish to be presented with a fait accompli in 
the form of a document decided upon by other participants." 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the United States and other industrial countries insist that 
they take the Third World's needs seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've been sensitive to that concern," said Deputy U.S. Trade 
Representative Rufus Yerxa. 
</P>
<P>
Even the name of the talks symbolizes their importance to the Third World. They 
are called the Uruguay Round because they were launched four years ago in that 
South American country's resort town of Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
Wilfried Thalwitz, senior vice president of the World Bank, told the delegates 
that many poor countries had begun discarding their "inward-looking trade 
policy" in favor of greater trade with other countries. Their participation in 
the current trade talks, he said, demonstrated their new commitment to 
international commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called 
trade the surest way for developing countries to lift themselves out of 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Researcher Isabelle Maelcamp of The Times' Brussels bureau contributed to this 
report.

MCI Tells of 900 Service Rules: The nation's second-largest long-distance 
company announced guidelines designed to help protect customers from misleading 
or fraudulent services on 900-telephone numbers, which it plans to start 
offering nationwide on Jan. 1. The company said the consumer safeguards will 
include a $4 cap on each call to child-oriented 900 services; pre-screening of 
programs and advertising and a requirement that adult services be placed on a 
single prefix, when available, to facilitate blocking requests by customers.

ERNST &amp; YOUNG MAY ESCAPE MAJOR DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move by California officials to seek a revocation of the accounting license 
of Ernst &amp; Young may further tarnish the firm's reputation but is unlikely 
to result in major damage to the firm's operations in the long run, industry 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the state Board of Accountancy has recommended that the board 
revoke or suspend Ernst &amp; Young's license to do business in California 
because of "gross negligence" in audits of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan and its parent firm, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But the state agency, which regulates the accounting industry, has never taken 
such strong action against a major firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, that sort of Draconian penalty has not been imposed, and I would 
be very surprised for it to be imposed in this situation," said John C. Burton, 
an accounting professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
Karen J. Scott, the interim managing officer for the state board, filed the 
administrative action against Ernst &amp; Young on Nov. 16. The accusations, 
which Ernst &amp; Young denies, set into motion a hearing procedure before an 
administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
While the staff recommends the revocation or suspension of Ernst &amp; Young's 
license, the hearing could also result in a reprimand, probation or no action 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
Officials charge in the administrative action that Ernst &amp; Young was 
"grossly negligent" by failing to follow proper accounting procedures in audits 
of the 1987 financial statements of Lincoln and its parent firm, American 
Continental Corp. in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"The firm stands behind its work," said Mort Meyerson, a spokesman for Ernst 
&amp; Young. "All standards were followed."

PICKENS TELLS WHO FINANCED KOITO STAKE; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: THE MONEY FOR HIS $1-BILLION, 26.4% STAKE IN THE JAPANESE AUTO 
PARTS COMPANY WAS PROVIDED BY A WELL-KNOWN RAIDER IN JAPAN.

<P>
T. Boone Pickens Jr. was forced Wednesday to reveal who paid for his $1-billion 
stake in a Japanese auto parts maker, muddling his campaign to influence the 
company and win greater shareholder rights in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The money for Pickens' 26.4% stake in Koito Manufacturing Co. was provided by 
well-known Japanese raider and property speculator Kitaro Watanabe, who also 
sold Pickens a chunk of the stock, a lawyer for Pickens said. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe twice tried to force Koito into "greenmail," trying to get the company 
to buy back his stake for a premium over the price he paid. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, as Koito's biggest shareholder, has been fighting for seats on the 
company's board, blaming continued failure on the closed nature of corporate 
Japan. He has taken his battle as far as the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't do much good when he's trying to line up the might of the American 
system . . . and seems to be a front man for a property speculator," said Peter 
Tasker, a senior analyst at Kleinwort Benson International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens has said his goals were long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
But Koito has said Pickens is a greenmailer working in concert with Watanabe, 
who tried the tactic twice in February and in May, 1988, a Koito spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens does have a large equity stake in Koito, which is supposed to give him 
certain rights as a shareholder, Tasker said. The value of Pickens' Koito 
shares are about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A new rule, which went into effect Dec. 1, requires investors taking a stake of 
5% or more in a public company to report within five business days the exact 
number of shares they hold, the purpose of the investment and any agreements 
affecting the holdings, including a buyback clause. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the rule was instituted as part of a U.S. drive to open up Japan's 
corporate world to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens' lawyer would not comment on the terms and cost of the financing, nor 
why the financing was done through Azabu Building Co., owned by Watanabe. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there were so many 'no comments' was a victory for us," the 
Koito spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens will officially submit the information required to the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange and Finance Ministry on Friday, Ishizumi said.

New Bumble Bee Dolphin Plan: The San Diego-based tuna company has offered to 
send representatives of either Greenpeace or the Dolphin Coalition -- an 
umbrella group of environmental groups lobbying for a ban on fishing techniques 
that harm the marine mammal -- to watch its Thai fish-processing operation. 
Earlier this week, Earth Island Institute, in San Francisco, broke ranks with 
most conservation groups by calling for a boycott of Bumble Bee products, 
saying the company was still buying tuna caught in giant drift nets in 
violation of a pledge by Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea and Star-Kist to end 
such practices. Bumble Bee denies the charges.

COAST S&amp;L WON'T MEET CAPITAL RULE NEXT YEAR;

Coast Federal Bank, which has suffered recent losses stemming from real estate 
loan problems and moves prompted by regulators, disclosed Wednesday that it 
will fail next year to meet some key federal requirements for capital. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift, owned by Los Angeles-based Coast Savings Financial, also said that 
-- as a result of recent regulatory examinations -- it will be forced to 
restrict its growth, dividend payments and other activities, moves that in many 
cases it has already taken. Coast also must file a plan with savings and loan 
regulators showing how it will shore up its capital, the financial cushion it 
must maintain as a buffer against losses. 
</P>
<P>
Most industry executives believe that Coast will ultimately meet the federal 
requirements, provided it successfully carries out a restructuring program and 
California's economy avoids a steep fall. 
</P>
<P>
Still, failure to meet some of the standards tarnishes its image with investors 
already wary of thrift and bank stocks. In October, Coast disclosed it was 
suspending its dividend. And Coast's preoccupation with restructuring and 
meeting the standards puts it at a competitive disadvantage with healthy 
California banks and thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one challenge after another," Coast Chief Executive Ray Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast's disclosure comes amid a disappointing effort to bolster its finances by 
selling 27 branches in the San Diego and Central Valley areas. 
</P>
<P>
Coast said it received no bids for the eight Central Valley branches, which 
have $250 million in deposits, and is taking them off the market. It said it 
has received two bids for 19 San Diego branches with $950 million in deposits, 
but at amounts below expectations. Martin said Coast expects to sell the San 
Diego branches to one of the two bidders, whom he declined to identify. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources familiar with Coast said they believe that company executives 
were overly optimistic about the branch sales, especially at a time when the 
federal Resolution Trust Corp., the agency cleaning up the thrift mess, is 
having a virtual fire sale of thrift branches. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Coast will fail to meet one higher capital standard that goes 
into effect Dec. 31 that is tied to the riskiness of an institution's assets. 
That measurement requires thrifts to maintain more capital for riskier assets. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Coast said it does not believe that it will meet other higher 
capital standards scheduled to take effect at an unspecified date next year. 
Part of those standards for thrifts are being raised to match similar bank 
capital standards taking effect next year. 
</P>
<P>
For any thrift, failure to meet all of the standards is bad news, especially 
with the economy weakening. But missing one of the three basic standards is not 
considered an insurmountable obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't meet it it doesn't necessarily mean you are going to the 
guillotine," said Jonathan E. Gray, analyst with the Wall Street investment 
firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Coast is widely viewed as being among a second tier of California thrifts that 
have previously met federal capital standards, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
The top tier includes such large, well-capitalized thrifts as Oakland-based 
Golden West Financial and its World Savings unit, Beverly Hills-based Great 
Western Financial, and Los Angeles-based H. F. Ahmanson and its Home Savings of 
America unit. In the second tier with Coast are such thrift firms as CalFed, 
the Los Angeles-based parent of California Federal Bank, and GlenFed, parent of 
Glendale Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
All thrifts are being hit hard by tougher examinations by two federal agencies 
-- the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
Regulators frequently are pressuring thrifts to set aside money for general, 
unspecified losses that may occur in the future, rather than for specific loan 
problems as has typically been done. Coast is believed to be one of the few 
large S&amp;Ls in California where those examinations have been completed.

shares of UAL common stock. 
</P>
<P>
The filing, covering the quarter ending Sept. 30, disclosed that the subsidiary 
-- Reliance Financial Services Corp. -- paid more than $43.9 million for the 
shares. But the document is not required disclose exactly where or when the 
purchases were made. "As a policy, we don't comment on our investment," said

Labor market conditions worsened in October with no sign of a quick turnaround, 
a leading business research group reported Wednesday in a monthly survey of 
help-wanted advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's help-wanted advertising index fell to 116 in October, 
six points below the September level and 34 points below the year-earlier 
level. 
</P>
<P>
The index's decline substantiated other assessments of growing trouble in the 
U.S. labor market, which has been beset by layoffs and reduced hiring plans 
because of an underlying economic decline that some are calling a recession. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, for example, Manpower Inc., the world's largest temporary help firm, 
reported in a quarterly survey that hiring plans of U.S. companies will plunge 
to "recession depths" in the first quarter of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"The decline in the economy in the fourth quarter affords very little 
opportunity to develop new jobs," Conference Board economist Kenneth Goldstein 
said. "Layoffs continue to climb, as does the national unemployment rate." 
</P>
<P>
The national unemployment level, which moved from 5.2% in June to 5.7% as of 
October, will likely climb to 6.5% in the second half of 1991, Goldstein 
asserted. The Labor Department is scheduled to release its figures on November 
unemployment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board survey showed that advertising volume in newspapers fell 
almost everywhere in the country, particularly in the Southeast, with a 12.8% 
decline, and New England, with a 9.2% decline. Least affected was the Pacific 
region, but help-wanted ad volume there still fell 4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
More disturbing, the Conference Board survey suggested, was a 5.2% drop in 
help-wanted advertising in the Midwest, which has enjoyed relative prosperity 
in recent months because of a manufacturing resurgence and foreign demand for 
U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a significant deterioration in the labor markets of the Pacific 
and the South Atlantic," Goldstein said. "Even more telling -- job advertising 
declines are now firmly set in America's heartland." 
</P>
<P>
The survey assesses help-wanted advertising volume in 51 major newspapers 
across the country every month and is considered a sensitive barometer to 
changes in the supply of jobs.

AIRBUS WON'T GIVE PAN AM WAIVER ON ITS OVERDUE DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Struggling Pan American World Airways said Wednesday that one of its major 
creditors, Airbus Industrie, declined to extend a waiver on an overdue 
$16-million payment. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the New York-based airline said that the debt to the European 
aircraft consortium is secured by aircraft and spare parts but that no action 
against the company is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Starkman, an analyst with the brokerage Paine Webber, said creditors 
"would be loathe" to seize Pan Am's assets and shut down the company. He 
explained that the value of the company's assets has been depressed by the 
current weakness in the airline industry. As a result, any creditor foreclosing 
on Pan Am's debts would probably have to sell its assets at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am said it still is trying to negotiate short-term and long-term waivers 
with Airbus, along with long-term deferrals of its obligations to other 
creditors. The company said it already obtained a new short-term waiver, 
through Dec. 15, from another major creditor, the Pratt &amp; Whitney 
engine-making unit of United Technologies Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The United Technologies waiver also was for a $16-million payment. Overall, Pan 
Am owes the two big creditors $100 million.

ANALYSTS DOUBT IOWANS' PLAN FOR $1.5-BILLION PAN AM BID

Airline analysts were skeptical Wednesday about plans by an Iowa group to raise 
$1.5 billion to buy Pan American World Airways and move its headquarters to 
northeast Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd give this a long shot at occurring," said Robert Decker, an analyst for 
Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He said it would be nearly impossible to raise the money needed for the buyout, 
especially in light of Pan Am's tottering finances. 
</P>
<P>
A Waterloo, Iowa-based investment group proposes to sell at least 300,000 bonds 
in $5,000 denominations to buy Pan Am, according to Pan Am airline Capt. Neil 
Sapp, 51, of Miami. That would be equivalent to borrowing half the annual state 
budget for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday in Waterloo at a luncheon attended by 175 northeast Iowa 
business and government officials, Sapp said the effort should not be taken 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make a solid offer in January," he said. "We're not crazy; 
we're just innovative." 
</P>
<P>
Sapp and Samual Nodarse of Cedar Falls, Iowa, a retired University of Northern 
Iowa professor, formed the Iowa Acquisition Group and said they would buy the 
company on condition that its headquarters move from New York to Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
He said money raised through the sale of bonds would be invested with Iowa 
banks, primarily in certificates of deposit, with the interest used to pay off 
loans from investment bankers. Investors would get interest when bonds mature 
in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Pan Am's headquarters in New York did not immediately return phone 
calls for comment. But industry analysts disagreed with Sapp's prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"In today's market, it would be difficult to raise that kind of money for an 
airline like Pan Am," Decker. "We're in a period where debt markets are 
cautious and conservative.

Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's No. 1 department store chain, said 
Wednesday that it has told its salaried staff members that their pay next year 
will be frozen at present levels. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze, which the company said will be reviewed as conditions warrant, is 
part of a companywide cost-reduction program and affects about 20,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Sears' sales have been under pressure in recent months. The company said in 
October that its third-quarter earnings fell to 53 cents a share, down from 75

POMONA PLANS TO REZONE SITE BEING SOLD BY CHURCH GROUP;

DEVELOPMENT: THE ZONING CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE PROFITS FOR THE 
CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING COMPANY, FOCUS ON THE FAMILY. THE CHANGE WILL ALLOW FOR 
HIGH-RISE CONSTRUCTION.

<P>
The City Council this week gave an early going-away present to Focus on the 
Family, a conservative Christian broadcasting and publishing empire that plans 
to leave Pomona for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The council by a 5-0 vote Monday gave preliminary approval to the 
organization's request to rezone its Pomona property for high-rise 
construction, potentially increasing the sale price. 
</P>
<P>
"They wish to maximize profits from the sale of their property," said Steve 
Tarvin, the city's acting community development director. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's move to Colorado will take place within two years of the 
sale of its Pomona property, Focus on the Family officials said. Pomona will 
lose 725 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The zone change would permit the construction of a building up to 10 stories, 
instead of the current maximum of three stories, on five acres at 861 Corporate 
Center Drive. The vacant lot lies between a pair of two-story buildings that 
house Focus on the Family operations near the junction of the San Bernardino 
Freeway, 57 Freeway and Corona Expressway. 
</P>
<P>
Paul L. Hetrick, vice president of Focus on the Family, a nonprofit 
organization that promotes Christian values through radio, films and 
publications, said the Pomona property must be sold before Focus on the Family 
can build a new headquarters in Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Hetrick said the organization has not set a price on the Pomona property, which 
consists of 13 acres and two large buildings. It also has not listed the 
property with a broker. But the property is valued "in the $20-million range," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how much the zone change would increase the property's value, 
Hetrick said. Partly, he said, it depends on whether potential buyers are 
interested in high-rise construction or want the land for smaller buildings. In 
any event, the change will increase the marketability of the property, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Focus on the Family announced in June that they had outgrown their 
facilities and had accepted an offer from a Colorado foundation for a 
$4-million grant that was contingent upon moving the headquarters to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
If the organization, which has a budget of $65 million a year, had stayed in 
Pomona, Hetrick said, it would have sought permission to build a high-rise 
office building itself on the vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-acre property is part of a 43-acre office park in which four other lots 
already are zoned for high-rise construction. 
</P>
<P>
In giving preliminary approval to the zone change, council members said they 
hope that a major employer will be attracted to the property. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to make a final decision on the zoning matter at its 
Dec. 17 meeting.

Who has the right to the bottles and cans residents place at the curb for

</P>
<P>
The City Council last week voted down and sent back to the city attorney for 
revision an ordinance that would have prohibited trash scavenging. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Patricia Wallach, who earlier backed the measure, spoke against it 
last week. She said some people make a living scavenging. But some residents 
said the scavengers break bottles and invade their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, requested by Webster Disposal Co., which contracts with the city 
for trash pickup and recycling, would have allowed scavenging only with the 
property owner's permission.

<P>
The Arcadia Redevelopment Agency has approved paying $1.1 million for land 
owned by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. 
</P>
<P>
The agency Tuesday voted unanimously to buy the property, at 21 N. 2nd Ave., 
including a small portion of land north of Wheeler Avenue, abutting the 
railroad tracks. The agency also agreed to pay the railroad up to $5,000 for 
removing a side track connected to the main track. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert C. Harbicht said the agreement ends what he called a 
"friendly condemnation" process to acquire the 1.1 acres. The property falls 
under the city's Northwest Corner Project redevelopment area, which will be 
used to build a commercial center.

To thousands of San Gabriel Valley residents, the Singing Christmas Tree is as 
much a part of their holiday celebration as tearing through the paper wrapping 
the gifts under the tree on Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 22nd year for the popular annual concert produced by the Bethany 
Church of Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
An 80-person choir, Voice of Praise Singers, forms the branches of the 
seven-tier, 30-foot tree. The 1 1/2-hour show's visual impact is enhanced by 
1,500 twinkling Christmas lights. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-piece orchestra helps in this holiday serenade that features classical 
Christmas songs such as "For Unto Us a Child is Born" and "Gloria," as well as 
"Joy to the World," "O Come All Ye Faithful" and "Hark the Herald Angels Sing." 
Many of the compositions have been rearranged and given a modern tempo, says 
conductor, producer and director Paul Wright. 
</P>
<P>
For children in the audience, there's a puppet show titled "A Carol of the 
Missing Light." 
</P>
<P>
The Singing Christmas Tree performs at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, 320 S. 
Mission Drive, at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 3 and 8 p.m. Sunday. Tickets 
are $8. For information, call Bethany Church at (818) 282-6109, or stop by at 
21 N. Olive Ave. in Alhambra. Tickets can also be purchased through the 
auditorium by calling (818) 308-2868. MARY ANN SWISSLER

LITTLE SUPPORT FOR RAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday showed little enthusiasm for building a rail station 
in La Verne as part of the planned San Bernardino-to-Los Angeles commuter line. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to allow Councilman Craig H. Walters to explore the 
possibility if he wished, but it forbade city staff members to spend any time 
on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jon Harry Blickenstaff and Mayor Pro Tem Thomas R. Harvey said it would 
cost the city too much to build and maintain such a station. 
</P>
<P>
However, council members Walters and Patrick J. Gatti stressed the importance 
of accessible transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. City Manager Jeffry Allred said a station would not benefit the city's 
budget and could hurt it by taking commercial land off the tax rolls. However, 
he suggested that if the city decides it wants a station, officials could work 
with neighboring San Dimas to find possible sites along Arrow Highway.

QUARRY'S PERMIT RENEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Azusa Rock Co. will be able to continue rock mining at its Fish Canyon Road 
quarry, the City Council decided Monday, over the objections of several 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to renew the quarry's permit, saying it has complied 
with all city conditions. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council required the company to report to the city monthly on its 
efforts to restore parts of the mountain that are not being mined. The council 
also required the company to install sound-absorbing barriers around its 
rock-crushing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The council decision followed a public hearing in which several residents said 
the quarry was a nuisance, creating dust in the air and scarring the 
mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Stephen J. Alexander and Mayor Eugene F. Moses voted against the 
permit. "We have a mountain and it is being destroyed," Alexander said.

<P>
The City Council voted 3 to 2 Monday to approve a development agreement with 
Lewis Homes of California, virtually assuring the company permission to build 
its 186-home project in north La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Preston, community development director, said all remaining city 
approvals are routine. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Craig H. Walters and Mayor Pro Tem Thomas R. Harvey voted in 
opposition. Both said the planned houses would be larger than allowed under the

VONS CHIEF SKIPS POLITICAL RACE -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The More Candidate: The public knows him as a pitchman for fresh meat and 
quality produce, urging consumers to use double coupons and search his stores 
for "more buys." 
</P>
<P>
But some Republican activists thought that William S. Davila, president of the 
Vons supermarket chain, might do as good a job selling himself -- as a 
candidate for the 1st District seat on the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
There was plenty of gossip in GOP circles last week about the possibility of 
drafting Davila, who lives in Arcadia, to fill the post being vacated by 
retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum. But when filing for the Jan. 22 special 
election closed at the end of the week, Davila was not among the race's nine 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Davila, 59, said he heard the rumors too, but that party officials never 
formally approached him to discuss the possibility of his candidacy. And even 
if they had, he said, he would have left them disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any time at this point" to run for office, Davila said. "I'm too 
involved in my work at Vons." 
</P>
<P>
Davila, who is planning to retire in early 1992, said he might be more amenable 
to a political career once he leaves Vons. 
</P>
<P>
"I could become interested in it later," Davila said. "I would like to talk to 
somebody about it. . . . I just might do it." 
</P>
<P>
Davila and other Vons officials denied rumors earlier this year that he is 
being pushed out of his job. They insisted that Davila, who spent nearly 40 
years working his way up from floor sweeper to the executive suite, is retiring 
voluntarily and wants to expand his role in Los Angeles' Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has not focused his aspirations on a particular political post. 
</P>
<P>
Davila backers, who asked to remain anonymous, said their man could have made a 
strong supervisorial candidate for several reasons: His commercials for Vons 
make him highly recognizable to voters; he is Latino in a district that was 
drawn in a federal voting rights case to include a majority of Latino 
registered voters; and his business connections would make him a potent 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Only one Republican, former Schabarum aide Sarah Flores, is among the four 
major candidates for supervisor in the officially nonpartisan race. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), Los Angeles City Councilwoman 
Gloria Molina, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and five less-known 
candidates also filed to represent the district, which stretches from El Sereno 
and Lincoln Heights east to Irwindale and La Puente and southeast to Santa Fe 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
If none of the candidates receives more than 50% of the vote in the Jan. 22 
election, the two top finishers will meet in a Feb. 19 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
'Tis the Season: While the holiday season and shopping occupy many people, the 
political season is under way in Pasadena, where three candidates are vying for 
the District 1 seat held by departing City Director John Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
A candidates forum is scheduled at 4 p.m. Saturday at the Jackie Robinson 
Center, 1081 N. Fair Oaks Ave. Candidates Nick Conway, a management consultant; 
Millie Lee, operator of a drug recovery house, and Isaac Richard, a real estate 
consultant, will face questions from the public and the Black Male Forum, 
sponsor of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Mack, former head of the Pasadena NAACP, has withdrawn from the race 
for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, District 6 Director Kathryn Nack will hold a $35-a-person 
fund-raiser at the Bellefontaine Street home of supporter Judy Morse. Nack, a 
former Pasadena Unified School District board member who has drawn no 
opponents, was elected to the city board in 1987, upsetting incumbent William 
Cathey. 
</P>
<P>
Also facing reelection are District 2 Director Rick Cole and District 4 
Director William Paparian. So far, neither has drawn opposition. The election 
is March 5. JAMES RAINEY and VICKI TORRES

BADER CONSIDERED FOR EQUALIZATION BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Bader, who lost a bitterly contested state Senate election last month 
to incumbent Ruben S. Ayala, is among a handful of prospective nominees under 
consideration by Gov.-elect Pete Wilson for a seat on the State Board of 
Equalization, according to several Republican sources. 
</P>
<P>
The seat is expected to become vacant after current board member Paul Carpenter 
is sentenced next week for his conviction on felony charges in a federal 
anti-corruption case. 
</P>
<P>
Bader, a Pomona Republican who had served in the Assembly since 1982, said he 
is interested in the seat but is uncertain whether he would accept the 
nomination because of doubts that a Republican could win in the heavily 
Democratic board district. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed emotions on it," Bader said. "It's an important job, but on the 
other hand, party registration would make it difficult for a Republican to get 
elected." 
</P>
<P>
The district that Carpenter has represented since 1987 encompasses about 
two-thirds of Los Angeles County, including the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A former Pomona mayor, Bader gave up his Assembly seat to challenge Ayala 
(D-Chino) in a race that attracted statewide attention. Ayala narrowly won. 
</P>
<P>
Bader said he has not spoken to Wilson directly about the board job. But he 
acknowledged that Ernest Dronenburg, a Republican member of the board, sounded 
him out recently about his interest in the appointment, which would require 
confirmation by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Equalization, a five-member panel composed of four members elected 
from districts and the state controller, decides tax cases ranging from 
individual income tax appeals to multimillion-dollar corporate tax disputes. A 
board seat pays $95,052 a year and includes a state-provided automobile and 
personal staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican sources, who asked not to be identified, said names of other 
people that have surfaced for the board post include state Sen. Frank Hill of 
Whittier; Matthew K. Fong of Hacienda Heights, who ran unsuccessfully for state 
controller in November; Sen. Robert G. Beverly of Manhattan Beach; and Oscar 
Wright, a U.S. Small Business Administration regional administrator based in 
San Francisco. All are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Livingstone, Wilson's transition office press secretary, said he could not 
confirm names under consideration. Livingstone said Wilson's attention is 
focused on selecting people for higher-profile positions -- including the U.S. 
Senate seat he must give up before his inauguration as governor next month -- 
and on putting together a state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who after several years in the Assembly won his Senate seat in a special 
election earlier this year, said he was not interested in the board seat. 
</P>
<P>
Fong expressed interest in the slot, saying he wants to sit on the board "to 
make California a more hospitable place for business." Fong, the son of 
Democratic Secretary of State March Fong Eu, said he has lobbied Wilson for the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly said: "My quick reaction is that I would be interested, mostly because 
it is something different. I've been (in the Legislature) a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, who was elected state senator in 1976 after 10 years in the Assembly, 
said that he has not spoken to Wilson's transition staff about the appointment 
and that he is "not actively seeking" it. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he is pleased with his current job, which Wilson helped him obtain, 
but would consider an appointment to the board. He added that his candidacy is 
being promoted by other black Republicans in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the recent passage of Proposition 140, which limits legislative 
terms, jobs on the Board of Equalization were increasingly attracting the 
interest of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Though the post does not carry the prestige and public visibility of a 
legislative seat, historically it has offered more job security. Once elected 
or appointed, incumbents have rarely been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent example of the security of incumbency was offered by Carpenter, 
a former Democratic state senator from Cypress. He easily won reelection in 
November to a second four-year term despite being convicted in September in 
U.S. District Court on four counts of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy. 
Carpenter's reelection was attributed, in part, to the heavily Democratic 
nature of his district. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, he must formally forfeit the seat when he is sentenced Monday.

CAL POLY TO TAKE SAN DIEGO STATE TEAM TO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona men's basketball team will take a step up in competition 
when it plays San Diego State, an NCAA Division I team, in a nonconference game 
at 8 p.m. Saturday at Peterson Gym in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, off to its best start since 1986, will take a 3-1 record into the game. 
San Diego State, which defeated the Broncos, 76-65, in their last meeting in 
1987, started the week at 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos may benefit from the return of All-California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. forward Terry Ross, who has yet to play after suffering a broken hand 
before the season. Ross, who averaged 21.1 points and 11.5 rebounds last 
season, was listed among the top 25 small college players in the nation by The 
Sporting News. 
</P>
<P>
In his absence, the Broncos have been led by 6-foot-1 guard D. J. Norman, 6-7 
forward Eric Mobley and 6-3 forward Ken Scalmanini. Norman is averaging 12 
points, Mobley 11.8 points and 8.8 rebounds and Scalmanini 11.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona also received excellent play from 6-9 center Marcellus Lee in its only 
game last week, a 78-56 victory over Pomona-Pitzer. Lee, a senior who played at 
Loyola Marymount last season, scored 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will meet a San Diego State squad that is led by 6-2 senior guard 
Arthur Massey, who averages 20.5 points, and 7-1 senior center Marty Dow, who 
averages 7.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
After splitting two games in Northern California last week, the Cal Poly Pomona 
women's basketball team returns home for a pair of difficult nonconference 
games Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who are 3-2 after losing to Sonoma State and defeating San 
Francisco State, play host to National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics power 
Wayland Baptist of Texas at 7:30 p.m. Friday and NCAA Division I team St. 
Mary's at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, ranked No. 2 in the NCAA Division II in a preseason poll, has been led 
by 5-10 senior forward Stephanie Coons. Coons, a former Wilson High of Hacienda 
Heights standout, is averaging 15 points and 8.2 rebounds. In a 105-70 victory 
over San Francisco State, she scored a season-high 26 points and had 12 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Two other top players for the Broncos are 5-11 sophomore forward Tami Chick and 
5-6 senior guard Debbie Wagner. Chick is averaging 13 points and Wagner, a 
transfer from Northern Arizona, is averaging 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific men's basketball team, having finished third in the 
eight-team Cougar Classic tournament last week, will take to the road for 
nonconference games tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who are 4-3 after going 2-1 in the tournament, will meet La Verne 
at 7:30 tonight and Christian Heritage at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. La Verne finished 
in a three-way tie for first in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference last season and Christian Heritage reached the National 
Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 final. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa has been led by 6-8 junior center Patrick McMann, who was selected to the 
all-tournament team at the Cougar Classic for the second consecutive season. 
The Cougars defeated Colorado Christian, 79-70, in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars have also been led by 6-8 senior forward Matt Burns and 6-4 junior 
Keith Hollimon.

CAROLING ON THE KEYS; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN, FOSTER PARENTS ENJOY A SPECIAL CRUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The quiet waterways of the Ventura Keys echoed with the voices of singing 
children Tuesday evening as about 20 of Ventura County's foster children and 
foster parents embarked on a special Christmas caroling cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"I am excited because it is fun," said a 6-year-old girl in a bubble gum-pink 
down jacket, braving the chilly sea air for the first boat ride of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"It is better than being home," said a more nonchalant 13-year-old boy, one of 
the few who did not join in the caroling, preferring to listen instead to rock 
music on his headset. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the children, who ranged in age from 15 months to 15 years, huddled 
in a semicircle on the deck of the Sunfish and piped out the lyrics to such 
songs as "Jingle Bells" and "Frosty the Snowman." 
</P>
<P>
They peered raptly at James Cook, the guitarist who was leading them, and 
showed more enthusiasm than actual familiarity with the words. 
</P>
<P>
Those children who didn't sing looked up at the sky and took turns guessing at 
the constellations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the Big Dipper," one child said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nahh," another replied. 
</P>
<P>
They looked to the left and to the right of the boat, marveling at the rows of 
cheery houses decorated with holiday lights. The luxury duplexes, with decks 
and boats parked in the water, were a glimpse into another world for the 
children, many the victims of physical and sexual abuse in the homes of their 
natural families. 
</P>
<P>
A couple and a child emerged from one of the houses, and in the half-darkness 
waved at the caroling children. 
</P>
<P>
On the boat, the children's foster parents stood at the edges of the 
semicircle, sometimes joining in the singing. They said they were grateful for 
the chance to take their foster children out since entertainment is frequently 
squeezed out of their tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Perez, an Oxnard resident who recently adopted her two foster children, 
said her daughters, ages 6 and 7, were thrilled at the prospect of the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been ready since they got out of school," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
The cruise benefits the children in other ways as well, said Sandi Cooper, a 
Simi Valley resident and foster parent to five children. She said the cruise 
helps to reduce the isolation that many foster children experience. 
</P>
<P>
"They are finding out there are other kids in these situations. Oftentimes they 
come and think they are the only one," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
The cruise was the first of four free cruises offered this month by the 
Children's Services Auxiliary, a volunteer organization that helps Ventura 
County foster children and their foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
Eric N. Loos, a Ventura marketing consultant, introduced the idea of the cruise 
to auxiliary members, and together they worked to bring a night of caroling, 
holiday cheer and sea air for the children. Island Packers Cruises, a local 
touring company, donated the cruises, and Cook and his singer wife, Holly, 
volunteered to lead the children in caroling. Loos, a licensed officer with the 
U.S. Merchant Marine, said he wanted to expose the children to the pleasures of 
the sea. In the past two years, Loos has organized a similar cruise for foster 
children in the Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 50 foster families and their foster children will be served by the 
Ventura cruises, said Daryl Woodward, a social worker with the Children's 
Services Division of the Ventura County Social Services Agency. The county has 
more than 650 children in foster care each month, Douglas Miller, the 
division's deputy director, said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cruise, the Children's Services Auxiliary regularly gives 
care bags to new foster children. The bags come complete with a stuffed animal, 
toiletries and pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
The auxiliary also donates $3,000 to $5,000 each year to the Children's 
Services Division to provide for those medical needs not covered by Medi-Cal. 
Braces, for example, are a common need among children, Auxiliary President Joan 
Roberts said. The Auxiliary also helps pay for any special needs foster 
children might have, such as music lessons and field trips, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
The Auxiliary was formed in 1983 and relies on private donations and fund 
raisers.

PROTEST-SIGN PAINTER PLEADS NOT GUILTY

<P>
A Ventura County woman pleaded not guilty Wednesday to three counts of 
violating zoning ordinances for painting signs on her fence and on the side of 
her house to protest an oil-waste dump buried beneath her old neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Lynda Paxton, a former resident of the Oxnard Dunes neighborhood, painted the 
words "Our Home Toxic Dump" on her fence and "Our Own Love Canal" on her house. 
</P>
<P>
Although Paxton moved from the neighborhood in June, 1989, she still owns the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Oxnard took action against Paxton last month because the signs 
violate an ordinance that requires her to get approval from the city's planning 
director before changing the exterior color, material and design of her 
residence, said Assistant City Atty. Charles Wessler. 
</P>
<P>
But Paxton called the situation ludicrous. "Innocent victims are being 
prosecuted criminally . . . when people who defraud, I mean the developer, go 
scot-free," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paxton's signs were designed to bring attention to the oil-waste dump that was 
found in 1985 beneath the 100-parcel subdivision known as the Oxnard Dunes. She 
is among 175 residents who filed a $3.5-million lawsuit in 1986 against 120 
defendants, including developers, real estate agents, oil companies, previous 
landowners and landfill operators. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary hearing on the zoning charges was scheduled Jan. 7. Paxton will 
represent herself. VIVIAN LOUIE

The Moorpark Planning Commission has approved a proposal to amend the city's 
zoning code to allow child day-care centers and schools to operate in 
industrial and commercial zones. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Glen Schmidt said Monday he wanted to commend Moorpark for opening 
opportunities for child care in the city's industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever we can accommodate young folk trying to make ends meet . . . Moorpark 
is taking steps in that direction. I think it's a hell of a good plan." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the city required a conditional use permit for child day-care 
facilities in industrial or commercial zones. Now, those facilities can operate 
under a different permit that is easier to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark City Council initiated the zoning code amendment because the 
previous code did not allow for the operation of schools in industrial zones, 
and there is an industrial business in town that funds a school on-site for 
employees' children. GT Water Products Inc. school serves 12 students from 
kindergarten through 7th grade. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council did not want businesses discouraged from providing 
either day care or school facilities for their employees due to a long and 
costly permit process. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Moorpark Unified School District bought property in an industrial 
park to build a new continuation high school. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

<P>
Michael W. Piper, who has served on the Simi Valley Planning Commission for 10 
years, has been reappointed by the City Council to an unprecedented sixth term. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the job," Piper told the council after his reappointment Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what else I would do on Wednesday nights." Piper said one of the 
primary reasons he reapplied for the job was his desire to work on plans for a 
proposed regional mall in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Piper, who was nominated by Mayor Greg Stratton, the council 
approved three new appointments to the commission. They are Dave McCormick, 
nominated by Councilwoman Sandi Webb; Barbara J. Williamson, nominated by 
Councilman Bill Davis, and Sherida Simmons, named by Councilwoman Judy Mikels, 
who previously served as chairwoman of the commission. Bob Barrett retained his 
post on the five-member panel, which advises the council on development 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Each council member is responsible for the nomination of one planning 
commissioner. The terms of the commissioners are concurrent with the term of 
the nominating council member. 
</P>
<P>
Because Mikels had been Davis' appointment to the commission, he was required 
to select a new commissioner. CARLOS V. LOZANO

<P>
Final touches are being put on plans for Christmas celebrations throughout 
Ventura County, ranging from tree-lighting ceremonies to a parade of lights at 
Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Moorpark and the Moorpark Arts Committee have planned a 
tree-lighting ceremony for 7 p.m. today at the Community Center. After the tree 
is lit by Mayor Paul W. Lawrason Jr., the Westlake Village Voices and the Flory 
Avenue Chorale will entertain. Santa Claus is scheduled to arrive at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A newly formed volunteer Oxnard business group, the Downtowners, and the city's 
Redevelopment Agency will sponsor a tree-lighting ceremony. The ceremony, which 
has been held for 40 years under other sponsors, will be at Plaza Park at 4:30 
p.m. Friday, with Mayor Nao Takasugi lighting the tree. Also planned are 
caroling, Santa's Village and a toy drive for needy children. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo Hospice is launching its fifth annual community event, "Light Up a 
Life," in which the public is invited to remember a loved one who has died by 
making a donation to the organization, which cares for terminally ill patients. 
Those donations will place colored lights on the Tree of Life at Constitution 
Park near Camarillo City Hall. The lighting ceremony will be held during the 
Holiday Festival Program at 6 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 p.m. Saturday, the Oxnard Harbor Board of Realtors is sponsoring a 
Christmas Can tree-lighting ceremony at the Esplanade Shopping Center with 
Takasugi set to light the tree. The organization has already raised $6,000, 
equal to 12,000 cans of food, sponsors said. The Salvation Army is expected to 
be the major benefactor. Donations will also go to the Ventura County Rescue 
Mission in Oxnard and Food Share, which works with about 160 charities in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The Livingston Memorial Visiting Nurse Assn. is sponsoring a tree-lighting 
ceremony at 6 p.m. Saturday at Buenaventura Plaza. Gospel singer Marlene Elias 
will entertain. The association provides in-home support services to terminally 
ill patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m. Saturday, the 25th anniversary Parade of Lights will begin at Channel 
Islands Harbor. Forty decorated boats, many of which will have music and 
animated figures, will be included. Santa Claus will be grand marshal. GERRY

1 COUNT DISMISSED IN ALCOHOL DEATH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An accessory-to-manslaughter charge against a Newbury Park woman accused in the 
alcohol poisoning death of a 14-year-old boy was dismissed Wednesday by a 
Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Priscilla Vernon, 21, had previously been ordered by Malibu Municipal Judge 
Lawrence J. Mira to stand trial on the felony charge and five misdemeanor 
counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Robert T. Altman said there was not 
enough evidence presented during the preliminary hearing to make Vernon stand 
trial on the accessory-to-manslaughter charge arising from the death of Leland 
Scovis of Thousand Oaks, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Scott Gordon said. The 
delinquency charges against her were not affected by the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Leland was the youngest of five teen-age boys on an April 14 camping trip 
chaperoned by Vernon, her fiance, David Campbell, 29, and his brother, Patrick 
Campbell, 23. 
</P>
<P>
During the trip to Leo Carrillo State Beach, David Campbell gave the boys 
alcohol, and Patrick Campbell bet Leland that he could not drink two to three 
inches of alcohol left in a half-gallon jug of whiskey without getting sick, 
according to testimony given during the preliminary hearing in August. 
</P>
<P>
Leland collapsed after drinking the whiskey and his breathing worsened during 
the next two hours, witnesses and authorities said. He was taken by helicopter 
to Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village, where he died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick and David Campbell were charged and later ordered to stand trial on one 
count of involuntary manslaughter, four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor 
and four counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Campbells and Vernon made motions to dismiss the charges, 
asserting that the evidence heard in Municipal Court was insufficient to 
support the findings, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Altman on Wednesday upheld the Municipal Court's decision to try Patrick and 
David Campbell, Gordon said. The trial date has not been set, and the brothers 
remain free on $5,000 bail each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said he disagreed with Altman's decision but that he believes that the 
bulk of responsibility for the death rests with the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said he will decide this week whether to refile the 
accessory-to-manslaughter charge against Vernon, prosecute her on the five 
misdemeanor counts in Municipal Court or drop those charges. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon's attorney could not be reached for comment.

HOSPITAL RESERVISTS CALLED UP FOR DUTY

<P>
An Army Reserve hospital unit of 530 doctors, nurses and other medical 
specialists, whose headquarters is in Ventura, will report for 180 days of 
active duty today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the unit had 24 to 72 hours to report for duty. 
</P>
<P>
"We give consideration depending on where they live," said Army spokeswoman 
Rena Davies. 
</P>
<P>
"Some could live two states away," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, the 6252nd Army Hospital, operates out of Reserve armories in 
Ventura, Irvine, San Bernardino and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
When members of the sections arrive at their armory, they will be sent to Ft. 
Ord in Monterey County, probably beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
There was no information on how many in the unit are from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The unit is designed to operate in a fixed facility, not in a combat zone. 
</P>
<P>
Davies said there was no information on where the unit will be sent. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be sent stateside or overseas to a fixed facility. We do not know if 
they will be sent to Saudi Arabia," she said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

REZONING OF CASTON TRUST SITES DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors delayed a controversial Santa Rosa Valley 
rezoning request for two months Tuesday to study the possible widening of Santa 
Rosa Road and to explore ways to fund the road project. 
</P>
<P>
With two supervisors absent, the board voted 3 to 0 to delay the proposed 
rezoning of the Caston Trust properties -- 12 parcels totaling 332 acres -- 
until Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The properties range from nine to 57 acres, and the owners want to rezone the 
parcels to allow for one-acre home sites, adding more than 900 residents to the 
area. The parcels are near Santa Rosa Road, east of Camarillo between Thousand 
Oaks and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The County Planning Commission recommended denial of the rezoning Nov. 15, 
mainly because Santa Rosa Road and other nearby roads are inadequate to handle 
the additional traffic that would be generated by the new residents. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ventura County voters rejected Measure A, which would have raised 
the county's sales tax half a cent, providing $24 million to improve Santa Rosa 
and Moorpark roads and $30 million to widen California 33. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor James R. Dougherty sought the delay in the rezoning request. He said 
a study of the traffic flow on Santa Rosa Road would determine if the vehicles 
are coming from the immediate area or whether the road has become a major route 
used by others as well. 
</P>
<P>
If it has become a major access route, he suggested that the county might be 
obligated to widen the road. The defeat of Measure A doesn't mean the end of 
road improvements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We fund roads in the county all the time," he said. "We get federal and state 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty said he also wants the study to look at whether the county's land-use 
plan for the Santa Rosa Valley needs to be revised. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley E. Cohen, attorney for the property owners, was angry about the delay 
in his request, which has been in the works since 1987. By the time the request 
is heard, two new supervisors, including slow-growth advocate Maria VanderKolk, 
will be on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume Maria will say she is not in favor of any development," Cohen said.

GREEN WILL NOT RUN BALL BEFORE HIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: ROBINSON HAS AGED HIM ON THE SIDELINES, BUT HIS TIME MAY HAVE COME 
BECAUSE OF FUMBLES BY CLEVELAND GARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Robinson, noted connoisseur of fine running backs, made sure that Gaston 
Green aged slowly before trusting him with anything so important as carrying 
the football for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram coach has gently brought Green out of the cellar now and then during 
the past three seasons, gotten a taste, then sent him back to age, choosing to 
sample others. 
</P>
<P>
This went on so long, the connoisseur just about forgot that his 1988 vintage 
tailback was still there. And Green didn't know what to think, except: What 
about me? 
</P>
<P>
In Green's rookie year, Robinson had Greg Bell and concerns about Green's 
ability to break tackles, as well as his readiness to play in the NFL. Last 
year, Robinson drafted Cleveland Gary, and he never had any doubts about Gary's 
readiness or tackle-breaking ability. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Robinson added another tailback, veteran Curt Warner (since waived), 
then eventually handed the dominant tailback role to Gary, which were two more 
signs that Green's time had not yet arrived -- if it ever would. 
</P>
<P>
"I (messed) him (up) a little bit," Robinson conceded Wednesday. "He wasn't 
going to get a lot of work until I thought he was ready to play. And then when 
I thought he was ready to play, I played somebody else. Well, he couldn't get 
on the field." 
</P>
<P>
In his first two seasons as a Ram, Green carried a total of 61 times for 190 
yards and played in 16 games combined. It took until about midway through this 
season for Robinson to feel comfortable with the idea of working Green into the 
game plan with any sort of consistency -- a conviction that coincided neatly 
with Gary's recent outbreak of fumble-itis. 
</P>
<P>
Green was the team's leading rusher last Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, 
carrying the ball 13 times for 57 yards after Gary fumbled in the first 
quarter, and Robinson promises more action. Gary is still the starter. Gary is 
still the tough runner Robinson admires, but finesse runner Green is in the 
picture now. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Green already has carried 44 times for 194 yards, including a 
31-yard burst that is the Rams' second-longest of the season. He also has 
caught a 16-yard touchdown pass and returned a kickoff 99 yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very enthusiastic about what Gaston Green has done," Robinson said. "Last 
year, I didn't have any doubts that he could play; I just didn't let him get in 
there and play, and the other guy (Bell) had a good season. 
</P>
<P>
"But now I'm playing him, saying 'hey, you've got to play. You've done 
everything you can do to deserve the right to play.' 
</P>
<P>
"And he's a good man. That guy's had some hard times here and has kept 
contributing, hasn't gone in the tank." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Green never felt lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this is my third year here, and I hadn't really gotten the chance -- 
I hadn't really played at all -- so I was wondering when am I going to get a 
chance to play?" Green said. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part, Green said, was sitting while the Rams lost earlier this 
season. Sitting, and wondering if the coaches would ever remember his number 
and ever think to call it. 
</P>
<P>
"My first two years we were winning, so that kind of made it easier," Green 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Robinson is careful not to say it in so many words, his main problem 
with Green is that he is a speedster who doesn't shed tackles very well. At 
UCLA, Green could simply run past people. Not in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said there are three things a runner can do: Slam through a hole for 
the tough four-yard gains, slide through and probably get tackled early for no 
gain, or explode through the hole and keep on going. Gary does the first, Green 
the second and the great runners the third. 
</P>
<P>
"The people that judge backs on breakaways don't have the knowledge to judge 
backs," Robinson said. "The four- to eight-yard runs, the ones that are well 
defended, are what establish a runner. . . . The number of 10-yard runs, that 
doesn't matter. I don't think it has any bearing on whether you're a really 
good back or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very much prejudiced toward (four- to eight-yard runners). . . . I like 
these guys. Those are my guys." 
</P>
<P>
So why play Green now? 
</P>
<P>
"He runs harder," Robinson said. "That's never going to be his forte. But he 
runs harder now than he did." 
</P>
<P>
Green, in his own quiet way, said he could be a tough, tackle-breaking runner 
if the Rams would play him consistently. How can you break tackles from the 
sideline? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like when I get into a game, if I just carry the ball one time, maybe I 
won't do so good," Green said. "But if (I can) carry the ball a lot over the 
course of the game, then I'd start feeling like that." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel, if I can get into the game and get to carry the ball enough, I'd be 
able to do things like that."

POLITICAL SITUATION COOLS U.S.-SOVIET SERIES

<P>
They put together the original Big Red Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Beating them on ice gave this nation one of its biggest collective thrills of 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union have had missiles pointed at one another 
for decades, but the only shots they exchanged came in sports venues. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the great thaw has come to the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
And so, it would seem, has it come to the cold war once waged on ice. 
</P>
<P>
Three Soviet teams are touring North America, playing all 21 NHL clubs in 
something called the Super Series. 
</P>
<P>
But judging by Monday night's game at the Forum, it's just not as super as it 
was in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings beat Khimik Voskresensk, 5-1, in a game that had more yawns than 
yells. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 10,762 made as much noise at the announcement of the final score 
of the "Monday Night Football" game as it did over anything it saw on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings seemed more happy at escaping without injury than beating a Soviet 
team for the first time in four tries. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the Soviet point of view? Khimik Coach Vladimir Vasilyvev talked 
about that Monday through interpreter Aggie Kukulowicz. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Does the Soviet-American rivalry mean as much with the end of the 
Cold War? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Sport is sport. Certainly, before, our people were in a Cold War. But 
now, times have changed. There are cultural and economic exchanges. The 
military people are talking to each other. It's a warmer climate. But in 
sports, we speak a different language. The connotation is different from 
politics. We have pride, the same as on your side. We do not want to let 
ourselves get beat. Politics is politics. Sport is sport. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you surprised that the eight Soviet players who joined the NHL last 
season didn't fare better? 
</P>
<P>
A: (The Calgary Flames' Sergei) Makarov did well, and I knew he would. But you 
have to remember, what these players went through was a 180-degree turnaround. 
They had to leave their country. They didn't know the language. They had 
problems getting their kids in school. They had to adapt to a new country while 
the other players only needed to learn hockey. Like Makarov says, give us a 
year and we'll do much better. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the biggest adjustment Soviet players have to make on the ice? 
</P>
<P>
A: In our system, the coach is No. 1. He does everything. You look at the 
players here, they have influence. Like a (Wayne) Gretzky. Is the coach in 
complete control? Not so much here. That's something our players have to adapt 
to. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There has been a movement away from a violent style in the NHL and toward 
the more wide-open skating style of European hockey. Is is evident to you? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can see it happening. Let's not lose our heads and say the NHL is 
playing quiet. But before, when you would walk in, it was an automatic war. 
They know now that is not the way to win because of the increased speed of the 
game. It's not the European style. They are still playing their own game. But, 
they are playing more combinations, more two-on-ones. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The use of aluminum sticks is catching on in the NHL. Gretzky uses one. Are 
the Soviets also considering the use of aluminum? 
</P>
<P>
A: At this stage, there are no plans. Gretzky could play with anything and be 
good. He could play with a club and be good. 
</P>
<P>
Q: With decreased interest on the North American continent, do you see the 
Soviet-NHL series continuing? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's got to continue because it upgrades the knowledge of all players. We 
both have our own leagues, but playing against the best upgrades the talent. 
There is no other way. Hockey has been helped by our meetings. You have your 
stars. We have ours. But this is good for the coaches, for the trainers, for 
the players and fans. 
</P>
<P>
End of the Road? The Super Series doesn't figure to continue in its present 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, the Canada Cup returns. In 1992, the international competition will 
be held in the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
And beyond that, there is talk of a revamped format for the Super Series, 
involving the top six NHL clubs and perhaps an equal number from abroad -- a 
combination of Western European and Soviet teams. 
</P>
<P>
Add Canada Cup: It will run from late August until mid-September in three 
Canadian cities -- Toronto, Montreal and Hamilton -- and three American cities 
-- Detroit, Chicago and Hartford. Participating players will miss training camp 
and about half of the NHL exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: King Coach Tom Webster noticed some differences in the Soviet game 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"They dumped the puck in much more than they used to," he said. "And they shot 
the puck a lot from high up. Usually . . . they would try to work for a perfect 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Alexander Smirnov, Khimik's team captain, said that is a result of 
the smaller ice surface, but had no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the game faster and more dynamic," he said. "There is no time to get 
bored."

REPLACING LINDSAY ATTACKED BY MAYOR; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL: BRADLEY SAID THE CITY ATTORNEY'S PROPOSAL TO ALLOW A TEMPORARY 
SUCCESSOR IS 'WHOLLY UNSUPPORTED BY LAW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Saying he was "astonished," Mayor Tom Bradley on Wednesday denounced a proposal 
by City Atty. James K. Hahn to appoint a temporary replacement for ailing 
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Hahn, Bradley urged the Los Angeles City Council to disregard 
the city attorney's advice as "gratuitous and wholly unsupported by law." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor did not propose a particular course of action, but said that if 
council members wanted to remove their incapacitated colleague they should 
draft a City Charter amendment that would empower them to do so. Such an 
amendment would require voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hahn issued a 14-page opinion which concluded that the council has 
the power to appoint a temporary replacement for Lindsay without removing him 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion surprised council members, who had been acting on the assumption 
that the City Charter barred such an action and left little legal room to 
maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, 90, a 27-year veteran of the council, has been hospitalized since 
Sept. 2, when he suffered a stroke in his South-Central Los Angeles home. He 
has remained partially paralyzed and unable to speak, a situation that has left 
his 9th District without representation on the 15-member council. His district 
incorporates South-Central and downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's strongly worded letter adds to a growing chorus of criticism of 
Hahn's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I am writing because I was astonished by your recommendation," Bradley said, 
adding that Lindsay has served the city "with dignity and distinction since 
1963." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Lindsay had told him and others over the last year that he had no 
intention of retiring before his term was up or of choosing a successor to be 
appointed to fill out his term. 
</P>
<P>
"For the council to act contrary to that expressed will would do violence to 
the dignity with which Gilbert Lindsay has served," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's "reach for a legal theory" was not supported in the charter and "seems 
uncalled for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hahn said "it appears that the mayor and his staff either 
didn't read the report very carefully or just didn't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
The report "clearly states," the spokesman said, that Lindsay would remain in 
office, and it also urged that the City Charter be amended to allow for the 
removal of any incapacitated council members in the future. 
</P>
<P>
If the council takes Bradley's advice and rejects Hahn's plan, it would be a 
setback for Bob Gay, Lindsay's longtime deputy, who hopes to succeed Lindsay. 
Bradley is known to have serious differences with Gay, according to council 
sources. A delay in filling Lindsay's seat would give challengers time to raise 
money and mount campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Gay could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members came forward Wednesday to say they, too, object to 
Hahn's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds very undemocratic," Councilwoman Gloria Molina said. Echoing the 
sentiments of other council members, Molina said she wanted information from 
Lindsay's doctor about his condition and prognosis so that the council can 
assess whether Lindsay is likely to recover sufficiently to return. Any 
decision on how to proceed "should be made in concert with residents of the 
area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think the rest of the council members can determine for the residents 
of that district without involving them," Molina said. "Otherwise, it's a very 
cold and very calculating and very ruthless process." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi said he also disagreed with Hahn's opinion. "We 
can't appoint anyone to vote," Bernardi said. "There is no provision in the 
charter. . . . If we appoint someone, the other 20 candidates who want his job 
will yowl." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said the seat he filled when he was first elected to the council in 
1961 had been vacant for the previous five months because his predecessor was 
elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all in Lindsay's hands," Bernardi said. "It's his seat and we can't take 
it away from him. . . . Gil Lindsay is going to be the councilman until July 1, 
1993, no matter what we do." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not authorized to do it under the charter," City Councilman Nate Holden 
said. "The charter specifically states that there should be only 15 council 
members, not 16." 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he disagrees with Hahn's contention that appointing a council 
member could be justified under a court decision that allowed the appointment 
of a superior court judge to replace a judge called to active military duty. 
</P>
<P>
The difference, Holden said, is that the state Constitution specifically 
provides that the Legislature can authorize additional superior court judges, 
but that the City Charter says nothing about additional council members. "The 
council can't do anything," Holden said.

TRIAL: PROSPECTIVE JURORS ARE QUESTIONED AS THE ACTRESS AND A FORMER BOYFRIEND 
PREPARE TO DO LEGAL BATTLE OVER 'PASSION' PERFUME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was a grand entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar-winning actress Elizabeth Taylor -- looking thin and rich -- walked 
regally across the width of the Los Angeles Superior Court hearing room to her 
seat at the counsel table as spellbound prospective jurors looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Her brilliant purple suede suit with matching purple handbag and purple 
reptilian high-heel shoes contrasted sharply with the subdued business suits 
worn by two legal teams gathered to do battle in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit 
involving rights to her perfume Passion. She wore four tiers of chunky pearls 
around a neckline that plunged. 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the counsel table sat her adversary, former used-car 
salesman Henry Wynberg, a former jet-set boyfriend who was photographered with 
Taylor in many exotic locations during their two-year relationship in the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The former lovers did not look at one another. 
</P>
<P>
But the 50 potential jurors did a lot of looking. Some ventured only polite 
sideways glances at the woman they had seen in movie theaters and on 
television. Others stared boldly. Taylor, in turn, turned around in her seat 
and looked directly at the jury pool with her violet eyes. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the trial is more than $70 million a year in profits from the 
highly popular line of Passion fragrances and cosmetics that Taylor launched 
with Chesbrough-Ponds in 1987, and which has been a spectacular seller. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor sued Wynberg in 1986, just as she was ready to launch a $30-million 
advertising campaign for Passion. She had signed a cosmetics contract with him 
in 1975 and wanted out of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement gave Wynberg perpetual rights to 30% of the net profits to any 
cosmetics marketed under her name. She also alleged that Wynberg did not live 
up to his end of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Wynberg, in turn, sued Taylor for breach of contract, fraud and 
misappropriation, contending that Passion was a copycat of a fragrance that he 
had developed years earlier. The potential jurors were questioned in detail as 
to whether they "had any experience with Passion perfume, whether they approved 
of Taylor's fund-raising efforts for AIDS-related causes, and whether they had 
known anyone who had alcohol abuse problems. Taylor's attorney, Neil Papiano, 
told the jurors that Taylor had had alcohol problems and had been rehabilitated 
at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Only two women said they regularly splashed on Passion. 
</P>
<P>
The question about AIDS was asked by Papiano because Taylor donates a portion 
of her profits from Passion perfume to the AIDS charities. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Judge Coleman Swart refused to bar Wynberg's past criminal 
record from being introduced at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Wynberg's attorney, state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), sought to 
prevent jurors from hearing about Wynberg's 1977 misdemeanor conviction and 
90-day jail sentence for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Wynberg 
had been arrested on suspicion of fondling a 16-year-old girl during a 
photography session with another man and four Beverly Hills High School girls 
at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Taylor argued that those issues were crucial to proving that she 
was justified in breaking off her business relationship with Wynberg "because 
any reputable cosmetics company would refuse to deal with Wynberg." 
</P>
<P>
Both Wynberg and Taylor are expected to testify at the three-week trial, as 
will a host of chemical and perfume experts who will provide a glimpse of the 
$4 billion-a-year cosmetics industry. 
</P>
<P>
As Taylor left the courtroom through a side door, Irwin Meyer, a Los Angeles 
attorney who was in court on another matter, asked one of Taylor's lawyers to 
get him an autograph. Papiano returned with the postcard signed by the star. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone can carry out an outfit like that," said an enthused Meyer. "It 
brings out the star in her. The shoes were just perfect."

TAGGERS RULE; 
</P>
<P>
THE UNFINISHED CENTURY FREEWAY IS ONE BIG CONCRETE CANVAS FOR GRAFFITI WRITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the ancient Greeks were creating the myth of futility today, they wouldn't 
have poor Sisyphus pushing a rock up a hill throughout eternity. They'd have 
him wiping out graffiti along the Century Freeway construction site. 
</P>
<P>
The interchange where the $2.5-billion highway will one day join the Harbor 
Freeway south of Watts is not half-built, but the concrete walls artfully 
designed by architects in one of the state's premier transportation projects 
are already scrawled with spray paint. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, Pyke, Slick, Acid -- if it's all supposed to communicate something, the 
message is lost to thousands of commuters who crawl along the Harbor at rush 
hour. But the scribbled walls make one thing clear -- graffiti are out of 
control in Los Angeles, and even Caltrans' pride and joy is just a concrete 
easel for gangs and "taggers." 
</P>
<P>
"As the walls go up, the graffiti goes up. These kids are animals," secretary 
Amber Martinez grumbled from the dusty site off Imperial Highway where MCM 
Construction is building the Century-Harbor interchange. 
</P>
<P>
"They write on the rails, they write on the cranes, they write on the poles, 
they write on the trucks, they write on the palm trees. We tried to get the 
state to pay for some of this local 'artwork.' They refused." 
</P>
<P>
Engineers have designed the most innovative and expensive freeway ever built -- 
one that will have a light-rail train running up its middle. Now if they can 
only figure out a way to keep it clean. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden has suggested calling out the National 
Guard to hunt down taggers from sundown to sunup. MCM construction hired a 
full-time security guard to watch the place but somebody stole his car. 
</P>
<P>
At least nine bodies have been dumped at the site in the past four years, 
Caltrans officials said, so catching the hooligans who keep spray-painting 
$56,000 sound walls is not exactly a police priority. 
</P>
<P>
A graffiti-proof coating sheds spray paint when washed with a high-powered 
hosing. But the hose costs almost as much as a sandblaster, about $150 an hour 
for a three-man crew -- too expensive to maintain millions of square feet of 
freeway concrete, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There has been talk of taxing spray cans and using the money to clean up the 
damage done with them. State law already prohibits the sale of spray paint to 
anyone under 18, but shopkeepers say the vandals just steal it. 
</P>
<P>
A recently passed city ordinance will require shopkeepers to store the cans 
under lock and key or in a cabinet accessible only to employees. Aerosol cans 
could be banned altogether by 1996 under a restriction imposed recently by the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District, which some graffiti removal 
experts estimate could cut graffiti by 30% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
But none of that has made a dent in the problem, which Caltrans says would cost 
$2 million to clean up statewide next year. There aren't enough workers or 
money to paint over all the graffiti. Most of it sits along the freeways until 
enough people complain. Inevitably, it's only a matter of days before the 
freeway walls are tattooed again. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at it every day. We're disgusted. But what can we do?" said John 
Mehtlan, Caltrans senior bridge engineer on the Century Freeway project. "We 
don't want our guys running around after the graffiti artists when they could 
have a spray can in one hand and a shooter in the other." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Caltrans is insisting that the walls be cleaned before it will pay for 
the $90-million interchange, and the builders are already squawking. 
</P>
<P>
All that work will cost MCM tens of thousands of dollars, officials say, an 
expense the Sacramento-based firm did not anticipate when it submitted its bid. 
</P>
<P>
"The state says it has to look pretty when we leave. But how long will it last? 
A night or two until they get some more paint," groused MCM's owner, Richard 
Myers. "I don't want to waste the money taking it off. You can't stop these 
people, so why not just leave it?" 
</P>
<P>
If they have to remove it -- and by every indication from the state, they will 
-- project engineer Jerry Hamma is going to insist that the Caltrans inspector 
stand right behind the workers, "because when we come back from lunch, it will 
all be painted again." 
</P>
<P>
"They all say that," Mehtlan said. "And there's an element of truth to it. But 
if they expect to sell a job to the taxpayer, they have to clean it up." 
</P>
<P>
It's 5 p.m., the sun is setting and the smell of cooking wafts up 117th Street 
in South Los Angeles. High above the neatly kept homes, silhouettes of little 
bodies begin to appear on the bridge of what will one day be California's most 
modern and expensive freeway. Soon, the vandalism will begin. 
</P>
<P>
"Something should be done about it. It's our freeway. If the police were around 
more, people wouldn't be spray-painting," says 20-year-old Ken Parker, who 
lives across the street from the construction. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks better of it and waves a hand in disgust. Graffiti, he decides, are 
just part of the Los Angeles landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost natural, that's how I think of it," he says. "There's graffiti 
everywhere."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : POLICE EXAMINE CAMPAIGN RECORDS IN BRADLEY 
PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police detectives probing political fund raising by Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley's aides and appointees examined public campaign records at City Hall on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators and a Police Department spokesman refused to say what they 
were seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"We are investigating and that means we get out and talk to people and look at 
records," said Police Cmdr. William Booth. Other officials said the 
investigators inquired about Bradley campaign records mentioned in recent Times 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last month that some Bradley aides may have misused city 
resources and some commissioners may have run afoul of state 
conflict-of-interest laws while raising campaign money for Bradley. The Police 
Department is conducting a joint investigation with the district attorney and 
the state Fair Political Practices Commission, Booth said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : PROSECUTORS MOVE TO DROP FINES OF BLUE 
LINE RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors on Wednesday took steps to dismiss the $90 fines levied against 
four senior citizens who were ejected from a Blue Line commuter train because 
of a 20-cent mistake on their transfers. 
</P>
<P>
The move came after widespread news reports about the fines. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Romeyan, assistant head deputy of the district attorney's Compton 
office, said the dismissal would be sought "in the interest of justice." 
</P>
<P>
Willard Zahn and three others were charged with fare evasion after the Nov. 19 
incident on the new rail line. The four boarded a bus in Long Beach and asked 
for transfers to the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
After they boarded the train, a sheriff's deputy checked their transfers and 
discovered they had been given 5-cent tickets for transferring between buses, 
rather than 10-cent transfers for switching to the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies removed the four from the train and issued citations carrying $90 
fines for each of them.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : PLAN STUDIED FOR CLEANUP AFTER MAGNESIUM 
FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health and environmental officials were working Wednesday on a plan to clean up 
residue from the magnesium fire that gutted a metal-processing plant Tuesday in 
the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The magnesium, used in the manufacture of automobile and airplane parts, poses 
no immediate danger to people in the area because it is pasted on the rubble 
and not blowing, said Anthony L. Payne of the county Department Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Magnesium can irritate the throat and lungs if it is inhaled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials were still investigating the cause of the fire, which caused 
$1.3 million in damage to Mark Metals Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Mark Valle said employees were cleaning up after cutting some magnesium 
when an electrical short started the blaze in the back of the building. On 
Wednesday, six employees were working outdoor telephones in front of the 
charred building.

GAGE REPORTEDLY WILL TAKE CHANNEL 4 JOB, KEEP DWP PANEL POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Gage, the former deputy mayor of Los Angeles and current head of the city 
Department of Water and Power Commission, will join the on-camera news staff of 
NBC affiliate Channel 4 in Los Angeles, sources told The Times on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gage, who has no background in journalism, will work as a reporter or 
commentator, said Ted Stein, a city planning commissioner who hired Gage away 
from the mayor's office a year ago and made him president of a San Fernando 
Valley construction firm. Gage left Stein's company last month. 
</P>
<P>
A sometimes vociferous critic of the press, clashing frequently with reporters 
during his 2 1/2 years as Mayor Tom Bradley's chief deputy, Gage said Wednesday 
that he had been directed by station management not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC spokeswoman Regina Miyamoto also would not respond to questions about 
Gage's hiring, saying only that the station had no announcement to make. 
</P>
<P>
Gage said he had no intention of resigning from the board. He has been active 
in controversial attempts to make the DWP more sensitive to environmental 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I do fully intend to serve on the commission no matter what my job may be next 
week," Gage said. Asked about the potential of a conflict of interest, he said: 
"I trust that will be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the negotiations said Gage will probably have "a highly 
specialized role reporting on a limited range of issues that have no connection 
whatsoever to the city of Los Angeles or city-related business." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley is "enthusiastic" about Gage continuing to participate on the 
DWP board, Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said Wednesday. He said "the mayor's view 
is that, if KNBC has resolved these issues, the mayor does not have a concern 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
Gage resigned as Bradley's chief deputy in December, 1989, following a 
roller-coaster stint that saw him help revitalize Bradley's political career, 
only to have the mayor plunge into the center of an ethics scandal involving 
personal and political finances. At the time he resigned, Gage said, "I would 
give myself a pretty decent grade in terms of strategy, and I'd probably give 
myself an F in terms of PR." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Gage's public relations problems included frequent heated exchanges 
with reporters covering City Hall. Last year, he ordered a news boycott of the 
now-defunct Herald Examiner -- denying its reporters routine press releases and 
interviews and refusing to return phone calls -- in retaliation for its 
coverage of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Gage also frequently voiced his disgust with Times reporters who covered the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the way you guys are acting at The Times, I've got no reason to sit 
down and be friendly with you (expletive)," Gage said during an interview last 
year following the city attorney's investigation of Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
One Bradley aide noted Wednesday that Gage will now be on the receiving end of 
tirades similar to the ones he unleashed at the press. 
</P>
<P>
"This ought to be an interesting twist for the simple reason that here you got 
a guy who says 'damn the press' in one breath and then huffs and puffs for a TV 
contract," said the aide, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"He is going to find out very quickly that a lot of the things that he did to 
press people are going to be done to him. And he is not going to like it."

TORRES SEEKS SUPER PANEL FOR WATER CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Art Torres announced Wednesday that he has introduced legislation to 
create a regional "super agency" to oversee cleanup of the San Gabriel Valley's 
severe ground water pollution, one of the worst problems of its kind in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, at a South El Monte news conference, Torres (D-Los Angeles) said 
he submitted a bill Tuesday to create an annual $20-million "superfund" to 
finance cleanup of ground water contamination throughout California, including 
the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A key issue in the region's lingering pollution problem is that no single 
governmental agency has the ability to finance or supervise the cleanup, which 
could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said the legislation is needed because governmental and water 
authorities "have been floundering." 
</P>
<P>
Local water agencies, including the newly created Main San Gabriel Basin Water 
Quality Authority, maintain that they could take the lead if they were granted 
additional powers. 
</P>
<P>
Linn E. Magoffin, head of the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, which 
oversees water rights in the valley, said of Torres' super-agency plan: ". . . 
He has gone too far. His bill is a club. He's going to pound people into 
submission. Based on my 40 years in the water business, it's not going to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
But Maxine Leichter, head of the water quality committee of the Sierra Club's 
Angeles Chapter, said the legislation "is absolutely essential." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a task force organized by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner 
(D-Baldwin Park) and Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) recommended such 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens of the San Gabriel Valley deserve this kind of legislation," 
Esteban Torres said. "And I hope (Sen. Torres) will . . . shepherd it through." 
</P>
<P>
But Tanner, who has long discussed the possibility of submitting super-agency 
legislation, on Wednesday said she was stunned. "Totally politically 
motivated," she said of the bills by Torres, who is running for the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
One bill calls for the super agency to be led by a 13-member board to be made 
up of representatives including those appointed by water districts and the San 
Gabriel Valley Assn. of Cities. The superfund would be financed by a tax on 
industries and businesses.

KID STUFF: CROSS-CULTURAL COZINESS; 
</P>
<P>
A CHANCE TO REGROUP AT FAMILY INTERNATIONAL DAY FESTIVITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Irvine Fine Arts Center will do its bit for a positive global warming 
Saturday with Family International Day '90, a free festival designed to boost 
cross-cultural coziness through the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Themed "Creating a Better World Together," the inaugural event will expose 
families to performing, visual and culinary arts from nations around the world 
through shows, demonstrations and hands-on workshops. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., 
children, parents and grandparents can work side by side on Scandinavian 
quilts, catch a demonstration of Mexican straw paintings, see a Japanese folk 
tale come to life or nibble on traditional Thai food in and around IFAC's 
Heritage Park facility. 
</P>
<P>
"This time of year, everything is Christmas, Christmas, Christmas. . . . It 
seems everything is Christian-oriented," said Cathi Decker, special events 
coordinator for Irvine's Cultural Affairs Department, which is sponsoring the 
festival. "We recognized that there's a great diversity of cultures in Irvine 
and the surrounding cities, so we wanted to create an event that would give 
people a better appreciation of other cultures' traditions and art forms. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, the holidays are always so hectic; families are scattered all over the 
place. This gives them a chance to regroup and enjoy time together." 
</P>
<P>
At two hands-on workshops, families can work together on their own Chinese 
brush painting or Scandinavian-style quilt under the direction of two local 
artists. Participation in the two-hour workshops is open to everyone from 
"Grandma to preschoolers," Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer watching to doing, local artists representing six 
different cultures will demonstrate Thai silk-flower making, Mexican straw 
painting, Chinese calligraphy and other regional arts and crafts throughout the 
day. Orranard Intarajit, an IFAC culinary arts instructor, will create and sell 
a variety of Thai specialties, including pad Thai (fried noodles with chicken, 
dried shrimp and peanuts) and tod man (fried fish cakes). International holiday 
baked goods such as Swedish spice cookies, Caribbean-style banana bread and 
German gingerbread will also be sold. 
</P>
<P>
The day's entertainment begins at noon on IFAC's lakeside patio with a 
performance by the South Coast Chinese Culture Assn.'s Little Panda Chorus. 
Ranging in age from 6 to 12, the 35 boys and girls will present a 20-minute 
program of Chinese folk songs and contemporary American tunes. Also fea tured 
that day will be the children's troupe, We Tell Stories. Appearing in 
conjunction with the Irvine Arts Festival, a six-month series of free 
performances and exhibits, the Los Angeles-based children's troupe will present 
"Proud to Be Me," a theatrical lesson in the importance of self-worth through 
the telling of three multicultural folk tales: "John Henry," which celebrates 
the accomplishments of a black folk hero of the late 1800s; "The Burro and the 
Bee," a Mexican legend about the perils of false pride, and "The Two 
Stonecutters," a Japanese story about the dangers of being dissatisfied with 
your lot in life. Students from the Irvine-based Wan Hua Dance Studio will 
complete the lineup with a selection of traditional Chinese folk dances. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the workshops and performances, participants will be invited to 
tour IFAC's current gallery exhibition, "Who I Am Not," a collection of 
photographs and multimedia works intended to dispel stereotypical views of the 
homeless. Artists represented in "Who I Am Not" and companion exhibits include 
residents of the Santa Ana Civic Center, as well as area high school and 
elementary school students. 
</P>
<P>

When: Saturday, Dec. 8, from 10 a.m to 3 p.m.

John Hall, who founded the Cypress Pops Orchestra in 1989, believes that he has 
his finger on the cultural pulse of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to start a pops orchestra because I think it's more conducive to 
Southern California culture, versus a symphony orchestra," Hall, 47, said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much competition in the Southern California area for 
entertainment. . . . I give audiences what they want to hear, not what I want 
to hear. Pops repertory is popular . . . people like to hear light classical 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Hall's orchestra will give a holiday concert at 7 p.m. Sunday at the Cypress 
Community Center. The program will include works by Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Verdi 
and Copland, plus holiday selections and a Neil Diamond medley. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have a mix," Hall said. "That's why we're getting more popular." 
</P>
<P>
Hall looks to the Boston Pops as his model. 
</P>
<P>
"Their literature is a montage of Broadway show tunes, classical overtures, 
waltzes, film and television theme music and, of course, marches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress Pops gave its first concert on March 31, 1989, at a local hotel and 
quickly outgrew that spot. Originally, Hall said, the orchestra was made up of 
27 players "from all walks of life -- some professional, some amateur, and many 
students -- university students -- from Orange County and a few from Los 
Angeles." It now has 55 members. 
</P>
<P>
"We have yearly auditions for the various positions," Hall said. "Membership is 
free-lance musicians and high-caliber university music students." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who is a graduate in trombone and conducting from the Juilliard School in 
New York, has lived in Cypress for the past 5 1/2 years, teaching at Cypress 
College and at Compton Community College and leading the Long Beach Community 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
He turned to conducting, he said, looking to express himself more completely. 
</P>
<P>
"An instrument can be limited. There is only so much literature for the 
trombone. . . . And I always wanted to conduct an orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress Pops Orchestra raised "in excess of $40,000" its first year through 
corporate gifts, a grant from the city of Cypress and private support. "This 
year we anticipated a budget of about $70,000," Hall said. "We're not there 
yet, but we're getting closer." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the orchestra had to cancel a concert scheduled for Oct. 21 in order 
to stay within its means, and management has begun to rethink its free 
admission policy. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, concerts are always free," Hall said. "That will probably 
change next year, but we will have to have board action on that decision. We 
probably will charge for inside concerts and all outside ones will be free." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra usually plays indoors at Cypress College or at the Cypress 
Community Center; outside concerts are at Cypress Green. 
</P>
<P>
Hall takes the financial struggle in stride, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is just the standard procedure," he said. "It takes time to 
initiate an orchestra. We're very patient. . . . I'm really ecstatic about 
where we're going. My basic premise is that our orchestra provides a multitude 
of entertainment that all can enjoy. It means a complete family package." 
</P>
<P>
What: Cypress Pops Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
When: Sunday, Dec. 9, at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Cypress Community Center, 5700 Orange Ave., Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: San Diego Freeway or Garden Grove Freeway to Valley View Street 
exit; north to Orange Avenue; left to the Community Center. 
</P>

ONE TOADYING ROLE MAKES LARRY MILLER A BIG-TIME JERK

<P>
One of the small joys of "Pretty Woman," that improbable box office skyrocket 
about a leggy hooker turned Cinderella, was the appearance of Larry Miller as 
the toadying manager of a snobby Rodeo Drive clothes store. 
</P>
<P>
Miller wasn't on the screen long, but his knack for turning a "yes, sir!" into 
a kowtow of the lowest order plucked the scene away from the movie's big stars, 
Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to Miller's performance was fast and a little surprising. The comic 
who had done his time in the many nightclubs across the country, received some 
notice during several stints on "The Tonight Show," "Late Night With David 
Letterman" and the ill-fated CBS "Morning Program," and had even acted on 
stage, now found himself a genuine celebrity (albeit a small one). 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been working hard and a lot before, but (the film) did have a big impact," 
said Miller, who performs his stand-up act tonight at the Improv in Irvine, 
where he'll continue through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"You reach a point where you've been putting bricks in the wall with each gig, 
and then 'Pretty Woman' comes along. It's gotten me noticed, that's for sure. 
It's like suddenly someone turns around and says, 'Was that house there before, 
a whole house? Wasn't that just an empty lot?' " 
</P>
<P>
The attention has brought big career steps, in both features and television. 
Miller has roles in "The Favor" (starring Elizabeth McGovern and Ken Wahl) and 
"Suburban Commando" (a Hulk Hogan vehicle), both coming out around April. He's 
also signed a deal to star in a sitcom pilot for the Fox Network scheduled for 
a March premiere. 
</P>
<P>
"In the films I play jerks, just like in 'Pretty Woman,' " Miller said during a 
phone interview from his parents' Valley Stream house on Long Island, N.Y. (he 
used to live there but now makes Los Angeles his home). "I play the head of an 
architectural firm, a real jerk, in 'Suburban Commando' and a huge jerk of a 
university professor in 'The Favor.' 
</P>
<P>
"The series is a little vaguer, but it won't be the usual high concept thing . 
. . you know, in the night we're cops but in the day we wear dresses. We'll try 
to distill what's funny about me and the situations." 
</P>
<P>
In the many good reviews that Miller's publicist sent over, what's apparently 
funny about the 37-year-old comedian is his dry storytelling based on a 
relatively ordinary life. Ordinary, but not unexamined. 
</P>
<P>
He likes to dig into things, which results in a style that "is whimsical, an 
affectionate smile at the darker sides of living." 
</P>
<P>
Like when his family gets together for Thanksgiving dinner in Valley Stream. 
"Everything starts out great, with the kids in polo shirts chasing puppy dogs 
through piles of leaves," but then things get iffy. "On his 10th beer, my 
father leans over to Uncle Lou and says, 'You know, I never liked you!' " 
</P>
<P>
Miller goes on, "Outside, it's 'Father Knows Best,' but inside, 'Nightmare on 
Elm Street.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then, giving a new slant to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, he adds: "Time 
seems to go more slowly with your relatives." 
</P>
<P>
This anecdotal approach has prompted some reviewers to liken Miller to Bill 
Cosby, a comparison Miller welcomes. Cosby is his hero, not only for his 
down-home ability to tuck an audience into his back pocket, but for the 
encouragement he gave Miller at an early stage in his career. 
</P>
<P>
"He was playing in Las Vegas and Jerry (Seinfeld, a good friend of Miller) went 
up to talk to him before the show, just a couple of knuckleheaded, young 
comedians. He spent three hours with us, talking about jokes, timing, all that. 
He was the most nurturing kind of teacher, and that meant a lot to both of us."

THE CORNER BAR: A QUIET RETREAT? WELL, NOT QUITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only an idiot would recommend that you go to a mall for the fun of it at this 
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Just call me Stupid. 
</P>
<P>
But I do have your best interests at heart. 
</P>
<P>
First, a disclosure: This type of mall pleasure involves drinking and acting 
superior. It shouldn't be attempted by people who think the holidays are the 
time for goodwill toward man. 
</P>
<P>
Something else to confess: I have never understood nor appreciated the concept 
of bars in malls. They usually serve as kennels for the other half -- those 
non-shopping spouses who are wasting away until closing time, not knowing that 
killing time in malls was the reason that Sharper Image stores were invented. 
</P>
<P>
Most mall bars are also tucked away inside random family-oriented restaurants, 
far from the madding crowds. This wipes out the people-watching factor, which 
could be one of the best reasons to go to a heavy-traffic area to imbibe 
instead of a cloistered bar closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, there is a mall bar that offers sightseeing as a chaser. 
</P>
<P>
Perched a few feet above the slipperly main drag of Crystal Court, across from 
South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, is Gianni, an Italian restaurant with a bar 
that offers a Kodak view of the frantic masses. 
</P>
<P>
Its red and black decor looks like some kind of giant starting flag, signaling 
weary mallers to begin partaking of holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Some advice: Buy all your gifts through mail order catalogues and have those 
guys wrap and deliver them. Then, with a newfound sense of relief, crawl onto 
one of the 10 stools that compose Gianni's cushy bar. Order a Cappuccino 
Americana, a frothy mix of coffee, Kahlua, brandy and Grand Marnier, and watch 
the holiday hustle bustle by. 
</P>
<P>
 Gianni, 3333 Bear St., Costa Mesa. The bar is open 10 a.m to 10 p.m. Monday 
through Saturday and 11 a.m to 7 p.m. Sunday. (714) 540-3365. JANET EASTMAN

<P>
"Island-influenced cuisine" made its debut in Orange County last week with the 
opening of Barbacoa on Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach. This waterfront 
restaurant is yet another endeavor of David Wilhelm (Kachina in Laguna Beach, 
Bistro 201 in Irvine) and his West Coast Restaurant Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The menu: Appetizers of rare blackened Caribbean ahi with papaya and bermuda 
onion relish, and steamed mussels with curry, red chilis and coconut; main 
courses include free range chicken with Jamaican barbecue sauce and wok-seared 
rock shrimp with jade basmati rice. The chef is Dan Worley, most recently of 
Five Feet in Laguna Beach and Five Feet Too in Newport Beach. Entree prices: 
$14 to $20. Reservations: (714) 646-6090. 
</P>
<P>
So we gain one, but lose two: the Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach and Ron's Supper 
Club in Laguna Beach have closed. 
</P>
<P>
And closed at least temporarily are Il Ristorante Bagatta and Koto restaurant, 
both in Newport Beach. "For remodeling" is the word, but calls to the 
restaurants yield no further information. 
</P>
<P>
Reuben's restaurant at 6060 Warner Ave. in Huntington Beach will welcome 
donations to the Toys for Tots drive, beginning Sunday, Dec. 9. That day, the 
restaurant will open at noon and two Marines will come at 2 p.m. to gather the 
toys. A barrel for later donations will remain until Dec. 15. (714) 842-5111.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A CUT ABOVE THE USUAL DINER FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like hundreds of other '50s-style diners spawned during the past decade, 
Lyndy's Restaurant is a good place to get a juicy burger, fries and a Coke, 
along with a taste of nostalgia -- all for a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most other culinary shrines to Marilyn, Elvis and James Dean, 
Lyndy's offers a menu replete with alternatives to the usual diner fare. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not in a mood for a burger, hot dog or milkshake, and didn't get 
enough of Thanksgiving dinner, Lyndy's dishes up a turkey-and-stuffing meal as 
good as any. Turkey being a house specialty, it's served any time of year, in 
the form of full dinners, sandwiches or pot pies -- and, of course, always with 
the sounds of Chuck Berry and Fats Domino on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you walk in craving a burger with a slice of '50s flashback, be sure to 
peruse the daily specials. The revolving menu offers a wonderfully diverse 
selection of dishes, including red snapper, cabbage, enchiladas and potato 
pancakes. One can even order steak, shrimp and barbecue pork chops -- all in 
the same meal, and for less than $8. 
</P>
<P>
This also may be the only '50s diner where one can get a good Irish beer. Both 
Guinness stout and Harp ale (by the bottle) are always available. 
</P>
<P>
The quirky diversity of Lyndy's menu is representative of the evolution of the 
30-year-old adjunct eatery to the motel of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Before undergoing the nostalgia face lift several years ago, Lyndy's had been a 
family restaurant/coffee shop, serving many of the items that appear as 
specials today. With the '50s-style overmake came an expanded menu of burgers, 
fries and shakes. 
</P>
<P>
And the burgers, by the way, are excellent. They start at $2.50, and any 
cheeseburger, bacon burger or other variation can be made a "Big Bopper" -- 
with another patty added -- for an extra $1. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be fooled by the red-sparkled upholstery and '50s artifacts that adorn 
the walls -- the atmosphere, refreshingly, is more relaxed and unpretentious 
than trendy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyndy's Restaurant, 924 S. Beach Blvd. (at Ball Road), Anaheim. Open daily 
from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 761-0234. JOHN PENNER

HUNTINGTON BEACH BUILDS FOR FUTURE AS IT PEERS INTO PAST;

HISTORY: THE OLD PIER'S CORNERSTONE WILL BE PART OF THE NEW STRUCTURE, AND A 
TIME CAPSULE'S CONTENTS WILL BE UNVEILED.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You might call it romancing the stone. 
</P>
<P>
And you could accurately say it is preserving the past. On the old Huntington 
Beach Pier on Wednesday morning, workers gingerly removed the pier's original 
cornerstone, a granite block inscribed: Municipal Pier 1914. The stone was then 
carefully carried off for temporary storage. 
</P>
<P>
The old pier is being torn down, and its 76-year-old cornerstone is scheduled 
to be placed in the new, replacement pier. "This will be a continuity of 
history," said Jerry Person, chairman of the city's Historic Resources Board, 
as he watched the stone being removed. 
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday morning event, however, also featured a continuity of mystery. 
</P>
<P>
To the frustration of bystanders, including a gaggle of news reporters, city 
officials decided to postpone opening a metal time capsule sealed in mortar to 
the top of the cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have ceremonies for the time capsule opening later on," Person said. He 
added that no date has been set for the opening. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the cornerstone came this week as large portions of the old pier 
were stripped away by the contractor, Riedel International. A barge with a 
heavy crane arrived at the pier Tuesday night to start removing many concrete 
pieces, including some that had been sheared off in the 1988 winter storms and 
which have since rested on the ocean bottom. The old pier was shut down in 
July, 1988, after being declared unsafe. The new $11-million pier is scheduled 
to be built and open by summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city is saving the 1914 cornerstone and its time capsule 
as mementos of the old pier. 
</P>
<P>
The metal time capsule is small and rusted. It was sealed to the top of the 
cornerstone in elaborate ceremonies in June, 1914, when the concrete pier was 
completed and dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach News covered the 1914 cornerstone-laying event. The 
headline: "PIER CELEBRATION WAS GIGANTIC SUCCESS -- TWENTY THOUSAND VISITORS 
ENTERTAINED." That was a huge crowd, indeed, for a village that then had fewer 
than 1,500 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1914 newspaper reported what was sealed in the time capsule. "The tin box 
placed in the stone is 3 x 4 x 9 inches and contains a copy of the Huntington 
Beach News under date of June 12; one of the programs of the celebrations, and 
a list of city officials," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Person acknowledged that those humdrum items are hardly the stuff of buried 
treasure. But Person said he wonders if something else, unreported by the 1914 
press, was also secretly sealed in the time capsule. "Some people put personal 
mementos into time capsules back in those days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This week, some of the pier spectators wanted to believe that treasure existed 
inside the old cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday at 3:40 p.m., when the cornerstone was first tugged loose from the 
pier, there was a small crowd watching avidly. One teen-ager in the crowd 
exclaimed: "Diamonds! Rubies!" 
</P>
<P>
But no jewels fell into the sunshine as the old stone broke loose. The metal 
time capsule, however, clearly showed. It was badly rusted, with some holes in 
it. City officials said that any papers inside the capsule might have turned to 
dust. Nonetheless, city bureaucrats decided that the capsule-opening event was 
important enough that more political bigwigs should be invited at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
The event Wednesday morning essentially was a staged re-enactment of the 
stone's actual unsealing on Tuesday afternoon. And the event yet to be 
scheduled -- the formal opening of the time capsule -- will be the third act in 
the city's extended drama involving the cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
City historians said Huntington Beach always has extended ceremonies when 
anything is related to its pier. For example, they noted, the 1914 dedication 
of the cornerstone took an entire weekend. The dedicatory ceremonies featured 
two days of baseball games, high dives, swim contests, band music, prayers, 
sermons and dances. 
</P>
<P>
Color and history are important to this old beach city, Mayor Peter M. Green 
said. "We are very aware of our historical background," Green said. "When we 
asked residents here what they wanted the new pier to look like, they said they 
wanted it to look as much like the old pier as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Langevin, a downtown businessman and member of the Historic Resources 
Board, also waxed philosophic while discussing the city's feeling for history. 
</P>
<P>
"Saving the cornerstone of the pier is very important to the community," 
Langevin said. "Items of this nature give us an anchor to the past. Without an 
anchor to the past, we're a rudderless ship; we don't know where we're going. . 
. . This type of thing allows us to join hands with the people of the past."

CRIME: THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FREES NEILL F. MATZEN. HE LEAVES HOSPITAL 
JAIL WARD AFTER TREATMENT FOR BULLET WOUND FROM SHOOT-OUT THAT KILLED HER 
SPOUSE.

BUENA PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office declined Wednesday to charge tow 
truck operator Neill F. Matzen with the bludgeoning death of a Buena Park 
nurse. 
</P>
<P>
Matzen, 36, of Santa Ana was released from the jail ward of Western Medical 
Center in Anaheim late Wednesday and allowed to go home. He was arrested by 
Buena Park police Monday evening on suspicion of murdering Donna J. Connaty at 
her home on Nov. 24 and had been in the hospital recovering from wounds he 
suffered in a shoot-out with Connaty's husband Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Connaty was killed in that shoot-out, nine days after his wife was 
bludgeoned to death upon her return from work at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange. 
He walked into Matzen's trailer, shouted "You killed my wife!" and then fired a 
shot into Matzen's left arm before running out, police said. He was killed by a 
shot from Matzen's gun in a second face-to-face confrontation outside moments 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick K. Donahue, who has been in close contact with Buena 
Park detectives since Donna Connaty's body was found Nov. 25, said the decision 
not to file charges was made after a review of evidence and interview 
transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to go into the details," Donahue said. Asked if the evidence 
against Matzen was insufficient to prosecute right now, he answered: "There is 
an inference to be drawn, yes." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue refused to say whether Matzen was still the prime suspect in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we want to keep the investigation going," he said. "We feel pretty 
confident about it." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police said that Matzen's killing of Richard Connaty appeared to be a 
case of self-defense and that they do not expect charges to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police were tight-lipped about Donahue's decision not to file 
charges in the Donna Connaty murder, referring all calls to the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said he had talked with police about the possibility of making an 
arrest in Donna Connaty's murder, but he said he wasn't sure if he had 
consulted with them on Monday before Matzen was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really remember," Donahue said. "I don't really advise police when to 
do arrests and not to arrest." 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park investigators said earlier this week that statements made by Cynthia 
R. Matzen after Monday's shoot-out prompted their arrest of her husband. She 
directed police to a lead pipe underneath the Connatys' home that may have been 
the murder weapon and also to three savings account passbooks in the Matzens' 
trailer that belonged to Donna Connaty. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Matzen also told police that she drove her husband to the Connatys' 
house -- ostensibly for a weekend trip to the desert with Richard Connaty -- a 
few hours before Donna Connaty was killed there and picked him up a few hours 
later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest, Neill Matzen told investigators that he went to the 
Connatys' home expecting to meet Richard Connaty there and left behind a note 
asking, "Richard, where are you?" 
</P>
<P>
Then, he and his wife drove to the desert near Barstow and met Richard Connaty, 
who had driven there the previous night with his three children and with the 
Matzens' daughter, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Connaty, who was estranged from his wife and whose involvement in his 
wife's death has not been ruled out, told police that he was concerned that 
Matzen had gone to his house looking for him on Nov. 24, since he knew that he 
had already left, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Matzens were somewhat friendly with Richard Connaty, who often stayed in a 
trailer next to theirs since he and his wife separated in 1989.

But the couple feuded with Donna Connaty, who did not like them, according to 
relatives. Cynthia Matzen filed a small claims suit against Donna Connaty over 
a biting dog that Connaty gave her, and Neill Matzen once served court papers 
on Connaty for a friend filing another lawsuit against her.

WAYNE DESCRIBES ATTACK, COURT FIGHT FOR DAUGHTER

<P>
Aissa Wayne took the witness stand Wednesday at the trial of her ex-husband, 
Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, to describe for jurors the beating she and a boyfriend 
suffered two years ago in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But once that short narration ended, Wayne, the daughter of John Wayne, spent 
the next two hours immersed in cross-examination about the bitter battle that 
she fought with Gionis over custody of their daughter, who was almost 2 years 
old at the time of the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say it was because of that custody fight that Gionis ordered the 
attack on his former wife. His alleged motive was to have Wayne "taught a 
lesson." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I did, there was controversy," Wayne testified. "They were 
constantly coming up with stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, 37, hired private detective Dan Gal to spy on Wayne to see if she was 
spending time with the child with the intent of using the information as 
evidence at a custody hearing. But on Oct. 3, 1988, Gal sent two henchmen onto 
the grounds of the Roger W. Luby estate in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Luby, her boyfriend at the time, had just returned from a health 
club. One of the two assailants beat them up -- Luby's right Achilles' tendon 
was cut and Wayne's face was smashed into the concrete several times -- and 
then tied their hands behind their backs with tape in Luby's garage. 
</P>
<P>
Gal and the two assailants have all admitted their roles in the assault. The 
man who beat them, Jerrel Hintergardt, has already been convicted at a separate 
trial and is serving an eight-year prison sentence. Gal and the other 
assailant, Jeffrey K. Bouey, are awaiting trial, but Bouey is expected to be 
permitted to plea-bargain in exchange for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hintergardt) was calm, deliberate, but loud," Wayne said in describing the 
attack. "He took control immediately." After the beatings, Wayne said, she 
yelled for Luby's "houseman," who got a knife and cut the tape on their wrists. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis and his attorneys claim that Gal acted on his own and that the doctor 
was unaware anything but legitimate surveillance was going on. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Gionis was worried that he was losing the custody 
battle and wanted to intimidate Wayne with the rough treatment. But Gionis 
attorney John D. Barnett contends that Gionis was actually winning the custody 
fight, so he had no reason to want Wayne injured. 
</P>
<P>
To delve into that issue, Barnett has shown jurors monthly charts that depict 
Gal's surveillance of Wayne from March through September, 1988. Gal's reports 
show Wayne spending very little time with the child. 
</P>
<P>
"I dispute that," Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
"So Dan Gal is just a liar?" Barnett asked her. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he is," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Those were welcome words to Barnett. In a pretrial hearing, he acknowledged to 
the court that a major part of the Gionis defense will be to cast doubt on 
Gal's credibility. Gal has told authorities that Gionis instructed him to 
organize the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne lost the custody hearing that followed the assault. But she did regain 
custody after Gionis' arrest. Gionis now has court-monitored visitation rights 
with his daughter, who will be 4 on Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
One controversy is whether Wayne should have taken the girl on a vacation to 
Sedona, Ariz., without the doctor's permission two months before the beating 
incident. It was almost immediately after that incident, prosecutors contend, 
that Gionis decided to teach Wayne a lesson. Wayne insists she thought that the 
vacation was permitted under the court's rules. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne made a public statement complaining that Gionis, who had custody of their 
daughter Tuesday, had the girl in the courthouse hallway. She called it "vulgar 
and inappropriate." She also complained that Gionis was not accompanied by the 
court-appointed monitor who was supposed to be with him and the girl. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Gionis responded to her criticisms, saying only: "She knows I'm 
not going anywhere. She can get a court order about it if she wants."

CITY WON'T APPEAL DAYWORKER RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials have dropped plans to fight in court for a controversial clause 
in an ordinance that prohibited people from going to certain sites to solicit 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The city last year identified three areas that draw the heaviest concentrations 
of dayworkers and added a clause to its anti-solicitation ordinance prohibiting 
people from being within 300 feet of those sites with the intent to solicit 
employment from people in cars. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union sued to stop enforcement of the provision, 
arguing that it was vague and violated freedoms of speech and assembly 
guaranteed under the First Amendment, and an Orange County Superior Court judge 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council in July had voted to appeal the decision. But new information 
presented by City Atty. Thomas Kathe convinced council members that an appeal 
would fail, Mayor Mary Hornbuckle said. She would not say what that new 
information was. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hornbuckle said the council will look at other provisions in the 
ordinance, especially one that established a hiring hall for legal residents to 
find work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is some sentiment for looking at the entire ordinance," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members will look at whether the city has been successful in 
prosecuting suspected offenders and whether the ordinance has alleviated the 
problem of dayworkers gathering in certain areas, especially Lions Park. 
</P>
<P>
Hornbuckle said other cities, such as Encinitas, that adopted similar measures 
have modified them for a variety of reasons, including reducing the city's 
liability. She said Costa Mesa might be held liable if an employer who hires 
someone from the city's hiring hall is found by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to be employing an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not had a case challenging that, but the possibility exists," 
Hornbuckle said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COUNCIL STANDS FIRM ON CLOSING TAVERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a petition signed by 1,035 customers of Henry and Harry's Goat Hill 
Tavern, the City Council voted again this week to try to close the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Peter F. Buffa, examining the petition, noted that only a fraction 
of the signers were Costa Mesa residents. 
</P>
<P>
That shows, he said, that the bar has outgrown its location and "is beyond what 
would be considered a neighborhood bar." 
</P>
<P>
The council last summer voted not to renew the bar's operating license, and it 
denied the owners a rehearing. A Superior Court judge, however, ordered the 
city to allow a rehearing, which took place Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But the bar owners also have a temporary court order barring the city from 
closing the bar. Attorney Alan R. Burns, who represents tavern owner Robert 
Zeimer, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The council's vote this week was unanimous. Councilman Orville Amburgey, who 
had supported the bar in the past, was voted out of office last month. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a string of hearings that began after neighbors complained 
to the city more than a year ago that the bar's customers were too noisy, 
littered the area and urinated and vomited at nearby businesses. They asked the 
city to review the conditions with which the bar's owners had received the 
permit, which is required for a bar within 200 feet of a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Goat Hill Tavern's front door opens onto Newport Boulevard, most 
of its customers use the back entrance, which opens out to a parking lot shared 
by other businesses. Behind the parking lot are apartments and houses. MARY

PANEL BACKS FEES FOR PARKWAY WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city Planning Commission this week endorsed a proposed ordinance that would 
establish fees for new developments along Crown Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Specific amounts were not included in the proposal, which will be discussed at 
the City Council's meeting on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fees collected under the proposed ordinance would be used to widen the six-lane 
parkway, modify traffic signals and build drainage facilities. Also being 
considered is improving the parkway's interchange at Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
The area affected by the proposed fees is bounded roughly by Via Grande and 
Venado Drive to the north, Interstate 5 to the west, Marguerite Parkway to the 
east and Crown Valley to the south. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 18 months, developers receiving approvals for projects in this area 
were required to agree on an interim basis to new fees, said Clint Sherrod, the 
city's director of planning and development. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city must enact the fees by Dec. 31 or those agreements will 
become invalid, he said.

POLICE SEEK HELP FINDING ASSAILANT

<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities were seeking the public's help in identifying a would-be rapist who 
repeatedly stabbed a 32-year-old woman in her apartment on Tuesday evening when 
she spurned his sexual advances, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know who he is," Lt. Richard J. Olson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't found any (witnesses) yet. Chances are, somebody was looking to 
burglarize the place." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was being withheld, was asleep in the bedroom of her 
Knott Avenue apartment at 6:40 p.m. when she heard a knock at the door, Olson 
said. She ignored the knock and fell back asleep. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing she knows, the guy is in her bedroom," Olson said, adding that 
the woman's front door was not locked. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whom she apparently did not know, made sexual advances on the woman, 
Olson said. As she tried to fight him off, he pulled out a knife and stabbed 
her repeatedly, then fled. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who was able to dial 911 and ask for help, was taken to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where she was listed in critical condition, hospital 
spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, investigators combed her apartment and the building looking for 
fingerprints and interviewing neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives were able to briefly talk to the woman on Wednesday and asked the 
public's help in locating a suspect, described as a young man, about 5 feet, 5 
inches tall, about 140 pounds, with a butch haircut. He was wearing a white 
shirt and a denim jacket. JAMES M. GOMEZ

MEDICAL CENTER GETS HEART-STUDY GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what may be the largest research project of its kind, UCI Medical Center has 
received a $1.3-million federal grant to study whether ultrasound exams can 
detect early signs of heart disease in young adults. 
</P>
<P>
UCI cardiologist Julius Gardin, the study's principal investigator, said he 
hopes the five-year project will show whether echocardiograms can find subtle 
changes in the heart that indicate a high risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest, he said, are changes in the heart tissue of young 
adults who smoke, are overweight, have a risk of high blood pressure or have a 
family history of cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We may then be able to advise patients early on, even before symptoms occur, 
about how to prevent further heart damage," Gardin said. With funding from the 
National Institutes of Health, Gardin is working with technicians at the 
university hospital's computerized Echocardiographic Reading Center to analyze 
the results of ultrasound tests of the hearts being performed on 4,000 adults 
of ages 18 to 38. 
</P>
<P>
The exams are not being conducted at UCI, however; they began recently at four 
other sites -- Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, the University of 
Minnesota in Minneapolis, Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and the 
University of Alabama in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago Gardin received a related $1.9-million NIH grant to study risk 
factors for coronary artery disease in older adults, ages 65 to 84. He is 
studying 5,000 echocardiographs in that effort, medical center spokeswoman Fran 
Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Gardin said he hoped the results from both projects will give doctors a sense 
of the natural history of coronary heart disease, telling them roughly how long 
it takes for people with early signs of a problem to develop heart disease or 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
An echocardiogram is a painless, ultrasound exam of the heart in which 
high-frequency sound waves bounced off the heart and surrounding tissue are 
used to depict valves inside the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Coronary artery disease claims more than 500,000 Americans each year -- more 
lives than any other disease, according to the American Heart Assn. LANIE JONES

BOARD SEEKS TO BAR WOMAN WHO RAN AS A NURSE, AND WON

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual legal maneuver, an Escondido-based hospital district board asked 
the state attorney general's office Wednesday for permission to sue to keep a 
home health aide off the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The application by the Palomar Pomerado Health System board is aimed at Nancy 
Scofield, who critics say misrepresented herself on the Nov. 6 ballot by 
listing herself as a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield did so even though she had never been licensed as a nurse. She was a 
home health aide, which has no licensing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
In order for a public agency to sue a public official, it must gain the 
permission of the attorney general's office because the agency then represents 
the people of California. But it is so rare that an agency sues one of its own 
directors that it remains unclear how much the board must prove. 
</P>
<P>
Even the attorney general's office isn't sure who must show what. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't come about frequently, and certainly not lately, and I'm not certain 
to what extent it has occurred in the past," said Rodney Lilyquist of the 
attorney general's San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield's attorney, Timothy Rutherford, maintains that the board will have to 
prove that the listing as a nurse unfairly made a difference in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield placed second in a field of a dozen candidates in an election in which 
the top four finishers won seats. Scofield garnered 34,217 votes, and the 
highest losing candidate received 23,506 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield has insisted that she relied on her community volunteer experience and 
support from local organizations in her campaign. She also has claimed that the 
word nurse is a generic term.

SLOW-GROWTH MAJORITY OPENS FIRE ON FOES

It was a maiden voyage awash in political blood Wednesday as the Oceanside City 
Council's new slow-growth majority fired most of the city's Planning Commission 
and stripped the mayor of an important post. 
</P>
<P>
Just one hour into the majority's first council meeting, Councilman Sam 
Williamson, who is now in the minority with Mayor Larry Bagley, said, "To see 
what's happening here this morning really disgusts me." 
</P>
<P>
First, the majority muscled through a motion to unseat four of the city's seven 
appointed planning commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"We need some fresh ideas and some new people involved in this city," 
Councilwoman Melba Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop was the council's longtime rebellious outsider until voters last month 
elected Nancy York and Don Rodee, creating a majority eager to smash what they 
regard as the developers' hold on Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
One of the ousted commissioners, Nancy Jakovac, wasn't going without a parting 
shot, and told the council, "I will not sit still and let somebody for 
political gain tear this Planning Commission apart." 
</P>
<P>
She blamed the council for passing exemptions to Proposition A, the city's 
growth control law, that made it hard for commissioners to practice balanced 
growth policies. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority said Jakovac, Nancy Boyer, Jack Cassan and Brian Sullivan 
may continue serving until new commissioners are appointed early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Rodee said voters support slow growth, and the commission needs members "with 
that philosophy." But the raid on the commission infuriated Bagley and 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor termed it "a blatant exercise of power" without regard to the fallen 
commissioners' tenure, experience or voting records. 
</P>
<P>
He flatly accused Bishop, York and Rodee of meeting privately to orchestrate 
their political actions, calling it a "clear violation" of the Brown Act, the 
state's open-meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop called the mayor's accusation "ridiculous."

SPANISH BOOKS FOR YOUNG FEATURED AT NEW CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although American children have enjoyed a smorgasbord of literary offerings, 
from Dr. Seuss to Roald Dahl, Spanish-speaking youngsters have been starved for 
books, or sometimes force-fed a diet of political propaganda under the guise of 
children's literature, a north San Diego County educator contends. 
</P>
<P>
Although the situation has improved, American educators have not recognized the 
growing collection of quality children's books written in Spanish, said Isabel 
Schon, professor of reading education and library science at Cal State San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Schon will unveil a literary center that she believes is the largest 
contemporary collection of its kind in the world. The Center for the Study of 
Books in Spanish for Children and Adolescents, on the Cal State San Marcos 
campus, will show educators the types of quality Spanish-language children's 
books that are available, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which will be open to the public, features more than 5,000 
children's books in Spanish and books in English about Latino cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Schon said the center, which will have a bilingual staff, will encourage 
reading among children who speak only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"No country in the world compares to America in the quality and quantity of 
children's books in English," she said. "In the Spanish-speaking world, one has 
to be much more selective." 
</P>
<P>
Although quality Spanish-language books do exist, Schon said, teachers and 
librarians often buy translations of popular English children's books because 
it is easier than looking for good original texts. 
</P>
<P>
"In the States, an overwhelming majority of teachers and librarians say they 
prefer to buy the translations because they know the books, and it's easier to 
read the translation of something, but they ignore the beautiful and authentic 
literature of the Spanish-speaking world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes the center, with its bibliographies and lists of Spanish-language 
publishers, will persuade teachers and librarians otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The center also has a collection of English books on Latino culture, which 
Schon called another much-needed resource. 
</P>
<P>
"I can count them on my hands the number of good books about Hispanic children 
in English," she said, adding that many such books often give the "tourist 
view" of life south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, school librarians have been slow to recognize the need for 
Spanish-language books, Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
"School librarians seem to have more negative attitudes against books in 
Spanish being in either the library or the classroom," she said, citing a 
survey of nearly 500 teachers, librarians and administrators in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"These (librarians) are not professionally trained people, and I want to 
believe it's an attitude of ignorance and these people . . . do not have the 
understanding and awareness needed," Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
"All research shows that (Spanish-speaking students) are going to be better 
readers and students if they start to read in the language they know and 
understand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we give them the books in Spanish, after three years they transfer to 
English, and in six years they are reading like their peers," Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
Several educators interviewed in San Diego County support Schon's position and 
have plans to take advantage of the center. 
</P>
<P>
"We have many students in San Diego that are coming to school with Spanish as 
their first language, and it's very important that we have quality materials in 
literature and language arts available to teach," said Rosalia Salinas, 
director of the statewide California Language Minority project. 
</P>
<P>
"When students come, if they come at an early age, we need to develop their 
reading and writing skills in the language they already speak." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Lindemann, who teaches second-graders who speak limited English at San 
Marcos Elementary School, plans to take her students to the center on field 
trips, since it is within walking distance of the school. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to (take) them over there and have them feel that college is within 
their realm," Lindemann said.

INJURY SLOWED GEORGESON, HE WASN'T STOPPED

<P>
Mark Georgeson shuffles across the Pepperdine University campus and tries to 
remember what it was like to walk without stiffness in his hip. Loping along 
without discomfort is a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson spends seven days a week rehabilitating. He lifts weights, does 
aerobics and treads water in a swimming pool. Still, he hobbles. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball used to be Georgeson's game. He was highly recruited as a senior at 
Marina High School in 1987 and has played with and against some of the best in 
the country. Now, climbing stairs is a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone has a right to be depressed, it's Georgeson. His life and basketball 
career were smashed, destroyed and mangled last Valentine's Day, along with the 
car he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
But Georgeson will have none of that. Pity? Save it for someone who needs it. 
Georgeson says he is the luckiest guy around. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10 months after regaining consciousness in what was left of his Honda 
Civic, Georgeson is happy, content and, he says, better off than before. 
</P>
<P>
He has undergone four surgical procedures to repair damage from the accident. 
But while his mobility is impaired, he's still moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Things never really stopped for me, it was more of a pause," Georgeson said. 
"When you have a dream, like basketball, and then have it taken away, you can 
do one of two things. You can bitch and moan or you can try to put the pieces 
back together." 
</P>
<P>
The pieces are there. The puzzle has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson, a 6-foot-10 center who would have had two years of eligibility left 
-- he averaged 4.0 points in 20 games last season -- remains on scholarship. He 
helps with the team's post players and goes to nearly every game, sitting on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But he has refocused his life, and playing basketball is no longer at the 
center of it. Talking, teaching and helping are his games. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three months, Georgeson has been a volunteer at Camp David 
Gonzalez, which is run by the Los Angeles County probation department. Director 
Bob Stanley says the juveniles who have been sent there have committed 
felonies. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark has a good rapport with the kids here," Stanley said. "Part of that might 
be because of his size. But it is also because of the problems Mark has been 
through. They can relate." 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson became involved with the camp through his fiancee, Stella Berkebile, 
who teaches there. He spends two hours almost every evening working with the 
kids, coaching basketball, teaching English and sometimes just talking. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the going was tough, the kids wary. But gradually, Georgeson has 
reached them by talking about his own experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for someone to get up in front of a crowd and talk about success," 
Georgeson said. "Not everyone can understand that, because not everyone has 
experienced success. But you get up there and talk about anxiety, about fear, 
about losing things and about pain, and every person will listen. Everyone has 
experienced pain, whether its physical or mental." 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson has worked closely with several kids at the camp and even brought two 
of them to a recent Pepperdine game. Georgeson has been so effective with the 
kids that Stanley has offered him a job. But Georgeson turned it down because 
he wants to finish his education. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to graduate next December and said he might accept the job 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had former NFL players come here and other athletes come here to talk to 
the kids, but none has been as effective as Mark," Stanley said. "I wish we 
could get him here full time." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Georgeson is happy to volunteer. His main goal is to organize a 
basketball team -- Camp Gonzalez was recently admitted to the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to open the season Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I've gotten far more from the kids there then they have from me," 
Georgeson said. "I learned that you can always find someone who is worse off 
than you are. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I showed them my scar one time, and this kid lifts up his shirt and 
showed me three scars on his chest from bullet holes. I certainly have been 
much more fortunate than they have." 
</P>
<P>
To get to Camp David Gonzalez, Georgeson has to drive along one of the winding 
canyon roads that lead out of Malibu. It's the same road he took Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson, who had transferred to Pepperdine from Arizona in 1988, was feeling 
pretty good that night. Pepperdine had lost at Loyola Marymount that evening, 
but he was confident the Waves would win a rematch three nights later. 
</P>
<P>
He had rounded a curve when headlights flashed in front of him. It's the only 
thing Georgeson remembers about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up with the steering wheel up in my face," Georgeson said. "I couldn't 
feel my leg. There was a bone coming out of my knee, and I was bleeding from my 
scalp." 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell, a Pepperdine assistant, lived near Georgeson and was a few 
minutes behind. When he came upon the scene, he stopped but didn't realize 
Georgeson was one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
"It obviously had just happened, because the cars were still smoldering," 
Campbell said. "Someone else had stopped, and I told him that I would go for 
help. Mark must have recognized my voice, because I heard him yell, 'Coach.' It 
was then I recognized his car." 
</P>
<P>
Two other drivers stopped and were sent for help. Campbell stayed and tried to 
comfort Georgeson. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach kept saying, 'You're going to be all right; you're going to be all 
right,' " Georgeson said. "They way he said it made it sound like I wasn't all 
right at the time." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't. Georgeson had a broken pelvis, a broken leg, three broken ribs and a 
large gash on the top of his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
The paramedics arrived 20 minutes later. They took the other driver away in a 
helicopter. He later died of injuries sustained in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson was pinned in the car, so they had to free him with the "Jaws of 
Life." It was a slow process because of the way he was situated. After nearly 
an hour, they finally worked Georgeson free and took him to Westlake Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's mom called me about 1:30 a.m. and asked me to drive her to the 
hospital," said Berkebile. "When we got there, they were just getting Mark's 
clothes off. They didn't say that he would make it, and they didn't say he 
wouldn't make it. After six hours of surgery, they finally told us he was going 
to be all right." 
</P>
<P>
For the next 40 days, Georgeson was in the hospital. He had two operations on 
his hip, one on his face and one on his knee. 
</P>
<P>
Berkebile, who attended Newport Christian High School in Newport Beach, refused 
to leave the hospital except to get a change of clothes. She slept on a cot in 
his room and showered in the nurses' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Three nights after the accident, Pepperdine beat Loyola Marymount, 131-123. The 
Wave players wore blue ribbons on their uniforms to honor Georgeson. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the game was over, I grabbed the game ball," Pepperdine Coach Tom 
Ashbury said. "All the players signed it and I took it over to the hospital 
that night. Mark was awake when I got there, but he was in a fog because of the 
medication he was on. I left the ball on the bed." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Georgeson woke up to find the ball and realized Pepperdine 
had won. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of the greatest feelings I've ever had," he said. "It made me 
feel like I had a lot of special friends." 
</P>
<P>
During the next few weeks, cards, letters and gifts were delivered in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson was hampered by a foot injury as a freshman and played only six 
minutes for Arizona before transferring midway through the 1988-89 season. 
Still, he was remembered. There were more than 1,000 letters from people who 
lived in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one letter I know I'll always remember," Georgeson said. "It was 
from a girl who had gone with her family to Kansas City for the Final Four (in 
1988). On the way home, they were hit by a drunk driver, and her father and 
brothers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"The letter she sent me had happy faces on it, and she wrote that I shouldn't 
get down. I broke down and cried. Here was someone who had been thrown 
something a lot worse than me and she was encouraging me." 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson will never play basketball competitively again. Doctors have told him 
that he could possibly play in two or three years, but Georgeson said he won't 
chance it. 
</P>
<P>
"They said I could develop severe arthritis in my hip if I played," he said. "I 
want to have a family and I want to play with my kids in the yard. I don't want 
to be confined to a chair while they grow up. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I've already gotten far more out of basketball than I put into it."

Daniel Niednagel of Dana Hills High School didn't face much competition from 
Orange County runners this season. Sure, he was pushed in some races, but he 
was also first at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel, a senior who was undefeated by county runners, dominated the season, 
winning the Laguna Hills, Dana Hills, and Orange County invitationals. It was 
not that way in 1989, when Niednagel had strong competition from San Clemente's 
Mike Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel won three of four meetings with Farrell, losing by six seconds at the 
Orange County Invitational. After Farrell's graduation, Niednagel wasn't 
challenged in that race this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win, because last year I lost Orange County to Farrell. That was 
one I wanted to get, and that was really fun to win," said Niednagel, The Times 
Orange County boys' cross-country athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel finished in 15 minutes 19 seconds 17 seconds ahead of Saddleback's 
Eddie Salinas, who made up several yards with a furious sprint at the end. La 
Habra's Mark Gonzales, who had been expected to challenge, finished ninth in 
15:48. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational Oct. 20, Niednagel was the top 
county runner, placing fourth in 15:29 in the sweepstakes race behind Arroyo 
Grande's Louie Quintana, the top runner in the state, David Hartman of Canyon 
Country Canyon and Nevada's Bob Ryser. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel won the South Coast League championship Oct. 26 by 200 yards, 
finishing in 15:17. He then qualified for the Southern Section finals, placing 
second in the Division I preliminaries behind Hartman. At the finals Nov. 17, 
Niednagel reached his season goal of qualifying for the state meet by finishing 
third behind Quintana and Hartman. A state meet berth had eluded Niednagel in 
1989 when he finished one place short. 
</P>
<P>
At the state meet Nov. 24 at Fresno's Woodward Park, Niednagel capped his 
season with a third-place finish in Division I. Quintana won the race in 14:47, 
in front of Hartman (15:04) and Niednagel (15:37). Niednagel had the 
eighth-best time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
At the one-mile mark of the three-mile race, Niednagel was tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good, and because the adrenaline is pumping so much in these big races, 
I didn't really start feeling my effort until after the first mile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel said he was pleased with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
"There's personal satisfaction when you meet a goal at the end of the year," 
Niednagel said. "That's what keeps you running, is setting goals and reaching 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel, who has a 3.7 grade-point average, wants to continue running in 
college. Among the schools he's applying to are Stanford, UCLA, UC Irvine, 
Brown University and Biola. He said he would like to attend Stanford if 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always heard good things about the school," he said. "Ever since I was a 
kid, it is one school I've dreamed about going to."

LAWSUIT, REJECTION OF SALE PROPOSAL MARK BATTLE FOR HOLLYWOOD PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle for control of Hollywood Park was active on two fronts Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The track's realty board rejected a proposal by the operating company to 
put the track up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Earlier in the day, the operating company filed a lawsuit against three of 
the track's largest shareholders, accusing them of conspiring to take over 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The realty company's rejection of the sale proposal, by a 7-0 vote, was not 
surprising, because Warren Williamson, chairman of realty, had questioned the 
timing of a sale in an interview last week, and because the realty board 
appears to be controlled by R.D. Hubbard, catalyst in the attempt to unseat 
Marje Everett as Hollywood Park's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park Realty controls the 347-acre Inglewood site where the track is 
located, and leases it to the Hollywood Park Operating Co. 
</P>
<P>
The operating company's lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court's 
Central District of California, names as defendants Hubbard, Tom Gamel and 
Harry Ornest. The suit charges that they violated numerous federal laws and 
acted together to take control of the track. BILL CHRISTINE

STATE ACTION NOT SEEN AS THREAT TO FUTURE OF ERNST &amp; YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move by California officials to seek a revocation of the accounting license 
of Ernst &amp; Young may tarnish the firm's reputation a little more but is 
unlikely to result in major damage to the firm's operations in the long run, 
industry officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the state Board of Accountancy has recommended that the board 
revoke or suspend Ernst &amp; Young's license to do business in California 
because of "gross negligence" in audits of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan and its parent firm, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But the state agency, which regulates the accounting industry, has never taken 
such strong action against a major firm. And the drastic action would cause a 
severe economic hardship for thousands of Ernst &amp; Young employees and 
clients, who would have to find new auditors. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, that sort of Draconian penalty has not been imposed, and I would 
be very surprised for it to be imposed in this situation," said John C. Burton, 
a professor of accounting and finance at Columbia University's Graduate School 
of Business. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the Lincoln case goes, they "haven't done anything wrong yet," said 
Don Murray, an accounting partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche in Costa Mesa. "It's 
just people making allegations in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Ernst &amp; Young faces some serious problems in California and 
elsewhere stemming from audits of thrifts. The firm was created last year from 
the merger of Arthur Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Whinney, both of which had 
substantial practices among financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Their involvement with savings and loans has not enhanced their reputation," 
Burton said, "but to blame all the problems on the accounting firms is unjust." 
</P>
<P>
The California accounting practice is important to Ernst &amp; Young, which is 
probably one of the top three firms in the state in terms of size. The company, 
however, would not release figures on the number of partners, employees or 
revenues generated in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst &amp; Young has 23,000 partners and employees nationwide and 67,000 
worldwide, more than any other accounting firm. Its revenues for the year ended 
Sept. 30 were $2.2 billion nationwide and $5 billion worldwide. It is the 
second largest firm in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Karen J. Scott, the interim managing officer for the state board, filed the 
administrative action against Ernst &amp; Young on Nov. 16. The accusations, 
which Ernst &amp; Young denies, sets into motion a hearing procedure before an 
administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
While the staff recommends the revocation or suspension of Ernst &amp; Young's 
license, the hearing could also result in a reprimand, probation or no action 
at all. The action also names Arthur Young and Francis J. O'Brien, a partner 
who did the work on Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The action is the most ambitious ever brought by the board's staff. Scott said 
it marks only the second time the staff has sought to revoke the license of a 
major firm. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the board took action against KMG Main Hurdman for its audits of 
Technical Equities Corp., a San Jose investment firm in which investors lost 
$150 million when it crashed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The firm turned in its license last year and paid about $1 million to settle 
the case, and several accountants were put on probation. But the action had 
little effect on the firm because it already had merged into what then was the 
nation's biggest accounting firm, KMPG Peat Marwick Main. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst &amp; Young officials said they won't even consider the possibility that 
the severest sanction -- a license revocation -- would be imposed. They said 
they will fight the state accusations vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
The action comes at a time that the work of accountants is being questioned 
nationwide, particularly relating to savings and loans. So far, five of the 
nation's six major accounting firms have been sued by regulators over their 
audits of failed thrifts, said John P. Owen, a Phoenix lawyer for federal 
thrift regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Young is being sued for more than $1 billion in connection with its 
audits of Lincoln, Western Savings in Dallas and several failed Tennessee 
thrifts. Regulators are seeking $560 million alone in the Western case. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions this year, Arthur Young has lost a $5-million jury verdict in 
an Orange County case and a $19-million verdict in a Hawaii case. Both cases 
are on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
California officials charge in the administrative action that Ernst &amp; Young 
was "grossly negligent" by failing to follow proper accounting procedures in 
audits of the 1987 financial statements of Lincoln and its parent firm, 
American Continental Corp. in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that the financial statements showed the company with pretax 
earnings of $26 million when it should have showed an annual loss of $36 
million, according to the filing. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Young's work was used by the company to push about $200 million in 
corporate bonds mainly to elderly deposit customers at Lincoln's 29 Southern 
California branches. The bonds have become worthless since the company filed 
for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989, and regulators seized the S&amp;L the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's collapse is expected to cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion, 
making it one of the most expensive failures ever. 
</P>
<P>
"The firm stands behind its work," said Mort Meyerson, a spokesman for Ernst 
&amp; Young. "All standards were followed."

A New Look: The Doubletree Hotel in Orange is getting a face-lift. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the bathrooms in the 461-room hotel will be renovated at a cost of 
$620,000. And starting in February, the next phase of the project will revamp 
the hotel's junior and grand ballrooms at a cost of $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Manire, the hotel's general manager, promises that guests won't have 
to listen to the pounding of hammers and screech of buzz saws. 
</P>
<P>
"Careful scheduling ensures our guests won't even be aware that the work is 
being done," she said.

NICHOLS INSTITUTE EXPECTS TO BUY LAB IN HOUSTON

Continuing its expansion drive, Nichols Institute said Wednesday that it has 
reached a preliminary agreement to buy MPC Laboratory in Houston for $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The cash acquisition is expected to be completed in the spring of 1991 and will 
bring the total number of medical laboratories in Nichols' network to 15 in 
eight states, said James Whitmer, the company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
MPC serves physicians, hospitals and clinics in south Texas and Louisiana, and 
generates annual revenues of about $11.5 million, Whitmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Nichols has pursued a strategy of acquiring one to three 
laboratories annually to steadily broaden its geographic presence. The 
laboratories that have been acquired provide routine tests for local hospitals 
and physicians and funnel more complex tests to Nichols' more sophisticated 
reference laboratory at its headquarters in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
In the past Nichols has purchased laboratories in California, the Pacific 
Southwest and the Midwest.

Gish Biomedical Inc.'s stock fell 20% Wednesday after the manufacturer of 
disposable cardiovascular products said sales for its second quarter ending 
Dec. 31 would be "closer to $5 million rather than the $5.5 million projected 
by analysts." 
</P>
<P>
Gish's stock, which is traded over-the-counter, closed at $9.875 a share, down 
$2.50. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it was lowering the sales projection for the quarter because 
its distributors are reducing their product inventories in preparation for a 
weakening economy.

PARTNERS BUY CONTROL OF TALLMANTZ AIRPORT LAND LEASE 
</P>

<P>
A flight-school owner at John Wayne Airport said Wednesday that he and three 
partners had bought control of part of the property held by Tallmantz Aviation 
Inc., which sold fuel and airplane repairs at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The price was undisclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lackey, president of Lenair Aviation Inc., said the new owners will focus 
on selling gas and repair services to smaller airplane operators, who Lackey 
says are now underserved at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Tallmantz had run into financial problems and has all but closed its few 
remaining operations, which are run by a court-appointed receiver. 
</P>
<P>
The company didn't own land at the airport but leased it from the county, which 
as early as two years ago complained that Tallmantz was behind in its rent. The 
1.5 acres for which Lackey and partners now hold the lease contain a two-story 
office building and a hangar. 
</P>
<P>
To acquire control of the property, the partners bought a company that held a 
second mortgage on Tallmantz's assets. They also bought out the first mortgage 
from Independence Bank in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
After buying out the bank's stake in the company, the partners foreclosed on 
the property Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bank said that it was owed $700,000 by Tallmantz but that it sold its 
interest in the property at an undisclosed discount. Pan Western said it was 
owed $950,000, according to Lackey. Those costs don't include another $30,000 
Lackey says the partners paid the county in back rent owed by Tallmantz. 
</P>
<P>
The partners will run the new business under the Pan Western name since, they 
say, Pan Western is already approved by county officials to hold the lease on 
the land. County officials couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The other partners, Lackey said, are Al Van Sinden, a generator salesman; Stan 
Ericksen, owner of Western Avionics, an aircraft repair company at the airport, 
and Herm Slutsky, a part owner of Pan Western who will manage the two-story 
office building on the property.

ROCKET MAKER LAUNCHES DEAL WITH NASA

<P>
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. said Wednesday that it has received a 
$140.6-million contract to provide rocket launch services to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach-based company will provide services for the launch of 
three of its Delta II rockets for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration during the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also includes options to provide services for 12 additional 
launches, which could extend the contract to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a logical step in the development of the Delta program," said 
Donald Tutwiler, a McDonnell Douglas executive for the Delta program. 
Previously, McDonnell Douglas supplied its Delta rocket to NASA while the space 
agency provided the launch services. Now the rocket maker will also supply 
launch services for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
The contract calls for the launch of the first satellite, Geotail, aboard the 
Delta II rocket. The next two launches, of the Wind and Polar satellites, will 
be launched on a more powerful version of the Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
The Geotail and Wind satellites are scheduled to be launched from Cape 
Canaveral, Fla., in July, 1992, and December, 1992, respectively. Polar will be 
launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., in June, 1993.

MUSIC: CANADIAN QUINTET KNOCKS PERFORMING ARTS CENTER CROWD ON ITS EAR WITH ITS 
PLAYFUL PROGRAM OF STANDARDS.

The Orange County Philharmonic held its third annual high school night Sunday 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, where it played host to students 
from around the county for a free performance by the Canadian Brass. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some reviews of the performance by the brass quintet from Canada, 
written by some of the teen-agers in attendance: 
</P>
<P>
Attending a concert by a quintet with the intimidating name of the Canadian 
Brass at the prestigious Performing Arts Center Sunday, an evening of comedy 
was not exactly foremost in the minds of the waiting teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the playful way in which the band members reacted to the hyper 
high-school crowd, the audience spent the better part of the hourlong 
performance laughing out loud. 
</P>
<P>
The quintet began the evening playing music as they entered the hall from the 
back and made their way toward the stage. Their first number, "Canzona," was 
played as they dispersed themselves throughout the audience. Such interactions 
made the crowd feel especially close to the band. 
</P>
<P>
While introducing a Christmas medley, Canadian Brass trumpeter Ronald Romm 
talked about the different words that can be used in songs. "For example," he 
said, "Chestnuts roasting in a forest fire . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The craziest part of the evening came when the band performed ballet songs, 
ranging from "Swan Lake" to "The Nutcracker." The twist was that the group's 
members danced, ballet-style, as they played. And the crowd was worked into an 
uproar when trombone player Eugene Watts came out in a tutu and danced in 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
The quintet did show it also has a serious side. French horn player David 
Ohanian played the lead in Adagio for Strings, the theme song from the movie 
"Platoon." The slow, sweeping melody was in direct contrast to many of the 
evening's other songs, such as "Beale Street Blues," during which the audience 
was encouraged to clap along and yell. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, a member of the Canadian Brass would address the audience between 
numbers. Speaking about Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, 
tuba player Charles Daellenbach related what he believed were the most 
interesting parts of the piece. Pointing to the music as if the audience could 
actually see it, he said, "See Measure 115? It's very important. That is where 
I come in." 
</P>
<P>
The evening culminated with the "The Saints' Hallelujah," a mix of "When the 
Saints Come Marching In" with Handel's "Hallelujah" chorus in which trumpeter 
Frederic Mills led the band in its foot-stomping attack.

<P>
The performance of the Canadian Brass was a new and refreshing experience. I 
have been to the Performing Arts Center on several occasions, and Sunday's 
performance was a great opportunity for me to share my love of music with one 
of my best friends. 
</P>
<P>
The communication between artists and audience created a chemistry and made for 
an entertaining show. 
</P>
<P>
Tuba player Charles Daellenbach added humor and character to the show. I 
especially enjoyed the "Tribute to the Ballet," and only wish the performance 
could have been longer. It is rare for me to have so much fun at a classical 
music concert.

The talented clowns of classical music -- the Canadian Brass -- presented a 
spirited welcome to the holiday season Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in wrinkled tuxedos and white Oxford shoes -- their trademark -- this 
crazy quintet strolled through the aisles, flirted with audience members, 
danced around the stage in tutus and encouraged cheering and clapping during 
their performance. 
</P>
<P>
Their booming brass sounds overwhelmed the crowd, and their sarcastic humor 
left all laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Romm explained that the Canadian Brass uses comedy to keep itself and its 
audience from losing appreciation for the music. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that once you've become bored, you've lost them (the audience)," he 
said. "We try everything to avoid that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- STEPHANIE AUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
Hollering and stamping, the predominantly high-school-aged crowd roared, 
whistled and cheered after a particularly rousing performance of Bach's Toccata 
and Fugue in D Minor. 
</P>
<P>
Though by no means a personal slight to B-aa-ch-t, as Daellenbach jokingly 
pronounced the composer's name, the crowd's uproarious reaction was a bit 
unusual. But, hey, no one ever said the Canadian Brass were run-of-the-mill 
classical musicians, either. 
</P>
<P>
The quintet astounded the audience with musical virtuosity and down-home humor. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Brass has achieved worldwide fame as a witty band that performs 
pieces ranging from such classical staples as Vivaldi's Concerto for Two 
Trumpets in C Major to seasonal favorites like "Frosty the Snowman." 
</P>
<P>
Several comic touches, such as their trademark donning of white dance Oxfords, 
leaves an indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a tradition," Romm said. "Once we showed up in Virginia (for a 
performance) and all of the people in the audience had worn white shoes. You 
saw these ladies in nice gowns with them (white shoes) on." 
</P>
<P>
The band's show demonstrated its flair for eclectic programming, but in 
actuality, Romm explained, "Things are very structured." 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean the Canadian Brass plays the same songs over and over again. 
They said a considerable amount of time goes into learning new material. 
</P>
<P>
"We substitute things as they are learned," Romm said. "You just can't allow 
yourself to get bored because then you allow the bad things to creep in." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Brass has helped introduce classical music to an audience ranging 
from seasoned concert-goers to first-timers. It's the audience, in fact, that 
helps inspire the quintet to perform with zeal. 
</P>
<P>
And when the right chord is struck between the two, Romm said, "it's a really 
amazing feeling. There aren't words to describe it."

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: TEENS NEED TO CLEANSE SKIN MILDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preventive skin care for teen-age boys and girls needs to include no more than 
a daily routine of mild cleansing, moisturizing and sun protection -- plus 
regular shampooing for oily hair, said Dr. Ellen Gendler, a New York 
dermatologist. 
</P>

"The single most important criterion of any skin care routine is that it 
neither aggravate an existing acne problem nor bring on breakouts where there 
were none before," Gendler said. 
</P>
<P>
Wash your skin morning and evening with a cleanser designed to provide a rich 
lather without drying. Limit exfoliants or scrubs to twice a month since they 
can be irritating to acne-prone skin. For oily skin, use a mild, low-alcohol 
toner. If you are using acne medication, however, a toner can aggravate your 
skin. For dry skin, apply a greaseless moisturizer that won't clog pores. And 
use a sun block of at least SPF 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Although most people are aware of the danger of prolonged exposure to the sun, 
few realize that the greatest damage comes from exposure before the age of 20," 
Gendler said.

APPRECIATE CLASSIC CARS? MARKET'S ON A ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Town &amp; Country 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 10 to 15 million people worldwide call themselves car collectors -- from 
the bidder who paid $10.8 million for a Ferrari at auction to the kid who buys 
a '59 Cadillac sedan because it's on the album cover of his favorite heavy 
metal band. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the list, according to an article in the current issue of Town 
&amp; Country, are former Los Angeles Times publisher Otis Chandler; Ken 
Behring, owner of the Seattle Seahawks, and Ralph Englehart, owner of Las 
Vegas' Imperial Palace Casino. Ralph Lauren, Reggie Jackson, Jay Leno and Bill 
Cosby are also collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the activity in the car-collector field is in cars that cost less than 
$50,000, however, and at this less expensive end of the market, the prices are 
appreciating as rapidly as they are at the seven-figure end. 
</P>
<P>
At present, Ferrari prices appear to have peaked, while less expensive 
Maserati, Alfa Romeo, Cisitalia, Abarth, Lamborghini and Iso models have picked 
up speed. At the moment, anything red and Italian is hot. Even such obscure 
models as the Iso Rivolta have gone from $5,000 to $50,000 in less than 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
What powers car-collecting trends? Most collectors crave an automobile that was 
popular when both they and it were young. The age of envy appears to be 14. 
</P>
<P>
Right now baby-boomers in the 26- to 45-year-old age group are driving up the 
prices of cars built between 1960 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, collector cars on average have done better than virtually any 
other investment but not every old car is a smart investment. 
</P>
<P>
High-quality blue chips such as Duesenbergs will always be in demand, while 
there are high-risk automobiles that are currently overlooked but ought to be 
in great demand in the future. 
</P>
<P>
All experts agree that vintage racing cars in all price ranges are the hottest 
collector-car category today and will be for the foreseeable future. A group of 
experts offer these tips on car collecting: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't buy a car to restore. Restoring an old car is more difficult and 
often more expensive than restoring an old house, and it's easy to get ripped 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't buy a 99-point car. Car collectors rate the condition of their cars 
on a 100-point scale, with the highest 99 points. The difference between a 
99-point and a 90-point car may be minor, but the difference in price will not 
be. And a 99-point car can be maintained in pristine condition for only a year 
or two before it starts to deteriorate from oxidation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Save 10% for expenses. Every old car needs something. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go topless. Convertibles are more expensive to buy but appreciate faster. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy from the Sun Belt. Most cars from inland California or the Carolinas, 
from Arizona and Texas, usually have not been exposed to road salt or coastal 
condensation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy originals. A Ferrari with a Chevy engine might be cheaper, but it's not 
as good an investment as a car with all the proper parts. Most collectors, 
especially Corvette and Porsche owners, are almost fanatical about having 
matching serial numbers for the chassis and engine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy classic car insurance. One great saving in collector cars is insurance. 
As long as you own at least one car for each member of the household to use as 
everyday transportation, you can insure your collector car for surprisingly 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Study up. Becoming knowledgeable in this market is a lot more fun than 
studying cocoa futures. Classic Motorbooks, Box 1, Osceola, WI 54020, 
catalogues thousands of books about automobiles.

O.C. ARTS ADD $260 MILLION TO ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
SUPPORT: MORE MONEY IS GENERATED BY THE ARTS IN OTHER CITIES. THEN AGAIN, OTHER 
CITIES OFFER MORE TO THEIR ARTISTS. 
</P>

<P>
Nonprofit arts organizations generated nearly $260 million in economic activity 
in Orange County in 1989, according to a study released Wednesday by the Orange 
County Business Committee for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Comparative studies showed that more activity was generated in two metropolitan 
areas of roughly comparable size, San Diego ($270.4 million) and Boston ($499 
million). The studies further showed that Orange County artists and presenters 
receive the lowest rate of support per capita. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County study, prepared by Chapman College economist James L. Doti, 
was based on written questionnaires returned by 37 of the county's 113 arts 
organizations. Together, nonprofit arts organizations employ 3,881 people, 
making the arts the county's ninth largest non-government employer, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Doti said the $260-million figure was composed of $50.8 million in direct 
spending, including salaries and operating expenses; $146.7 million in indirect 
spending, the amount of money arts organization employees and vendors, in turn, 
spend in the county; and $62.3 million in indirect audience spending, mainly 
purchase of meals, drinks, transportation, etc., beyond the cost of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
In the comparison, the county was found to have the highest level of private 
donations per capita, $7.91, compared to $7.66 in San Diego and $6.88 in 
Boston. However, the county ranked lowest in per-capita government support, 
$1.21, compared to $3.34 in San Diego and $3.20 in Boston. Taken together, the 
private and government support levels ranked Orange County third at $9.11, 
compared to $11 in San Diego and $10.08 in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Doti explained this ranking by saying that arts organizations in the other two 
areas were "more mature" and have been able to build broader bases of support 
and larger endowments. He also cited the presence of more museums in the other 
metropolitan areas, many of which are directly supported by the government. 
</P>
<P>
About 54% of those responding here said that private donor support had a 
"significant" influence on programming. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County also ranked third in the number of annual paid admissions to 
nonprofit arts institutions, at less than one visit per person, compared to 
1.75 visits in San Diego and 2.69 visits in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
According to Doti, San Diego and Boston were chosen for comparison "since the 
same statistical methodology was used in economic impact of the arts studies" 
in those cities, making it "possible to compare the survey results." 
</P>
<P>
Funds for the $10,000 study were contributed by Pacific Bell, Arnel Development 
and the Orange County Register, with additional support from Security Pacific 
Bank, Doti and Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
The Business Committee for the Arts' goal is "to stimulate business support of 
an involvement in the arts," though this support tends to be in the form of 
free legal and accounting services as opposed to hard cash. The committee 
operated on an annual budget of $142,076 in 1989, according to documents 
submitted to the IRS. Of that, $111,500 was spent on salaries for the director 
and her secretary, and operating and travel expenses. The committee's largest 
expenditure of the remaining funds was for an annual dinner for its members.

<P>
THEATER: 'ENCORE,' MOLLY HARDY'S TRIBUTE TO HER PAL, JIM BOYER, FEATURES 
SEVERAL OF THE AIDS PATIENT'S SONGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Molly Hardy tried to control herself but couldn't. The sobs kept coming as she 
recalled Saturday's performance of "Encore," the play Hardy wrote as tribute to 
her friendship with a man who has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to tell you, it was incredible," she whispered, then hesitated. "I 
don't know how to describe it. The audience stood and applauded Jim for five 
minutes. They responded to the play and to Jim, all the laughing and crying . . 
. it was like a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy was talking about Jim Boyer, a songwriter she has been close to for eight 
years and who is in the disease's critical stages. He traveled from San Diego 
on Saturday night to watch "Encore," which features several of his songs, in 
its premiere at the Orange County Coalition of the Theatre Arts' tiny stage in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how important this was to him," Hardy said. "He was acknowledged for 
what he is and the artist he is. Jim's time is limited, and this was all so 
perfect. . . . I care about him so much." 
</P>
<P>
"Encore" takes much of its inspiration from the experiences shared by Hardy, a 
straight, happily married 40-year-old San Clemente woman, and Boyer, a gay, 
36-year-old musician who lives in San Diego with his companion of 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy and Boyer met in 1982 as students at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo 
and soon after collaborated on her one-act drama, "Heaven's North of Here," 
which centers on a teen-age suicide victim. Hardy asked Boyer, a business major 
at the time, to contribute a few songs. 
</P>
<P>
The one-act attracted the attention of schools, churches and youth groups, 
which often asked the two to stage it for local children. Boyer and Hardy found 
themselves traveling around the country together, performing and leading 
post-show discussions about teen suicide. 
</P>
<P>
They developed a closeness that came from ongoing personal contact and genuine 
affection for each other. It was a relationship that both pleased and confused 
Hardy, who conceded that she had something of a crush on the mysterious Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very attractive, but there was this side of him that was aloof and, of 
course, I found that attractive," she remembered. "There was never any sexual 
tension between us, and that surprised me. Not because I wanted anything to 
happen -- I didn't because I have a good marriage -- but it was odd that there 
wasn't any of it at all." 
</P>
<P>
According to Boyer, interviewed by phone from his San Diego home, Hardy also 
didn't know much about his private life, which perplexed her even more. He was 
reluctant to tell Hardy about his homosexuality for fear that it would hurt the 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then there were few people who knew I was gay," he said. "Molly couldn't 
figure out why I never dated (women). Finally, she just asked what was going 
on. I hesitated at first, but then I told her my story. From that point on, our 
relationship really became ingrained. The sexual thing was removed, and we 
became so in tune with each other." 
</P>
<P>
After learning that Boyer had been found to have acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, Hardy wanted to get involved, so she helped him start a support group 
in San Diego. The experience was gratifying but also disturbing because of the 
pain that group members had, she said. 
</P>
<P>
An important scene in "Encore," in which straights and gays with AIDS talk 
about their frustrations, was drawn from her observations. Hardy took the 
play's title from the acronym for the group's motto, Encouraging Nurturing 
Caring Open Relationships with Everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy began working on "Encore" in the spring and promptly asked Boyer to 
contribute his awareness of AIDS and a series of songs. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer described his involvement, and Hardy's love, as a "godsend." 
</P>
<P>
"It helped in getting away from the depression. . . . Molly has been 
instrumental in trying to keep me out of the pit, this deep pit that comes from 
having a disease like this. She told me to get off my butt and do something," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many people who have been so good to me. I have a family 
that is 100% supportive and a wonderful lover. . . . Molly is one of the most 
supportive. It's a gift to have people like that around you." 
</P>
<P>
As for "Encore," Boyer hopes audiences receive a simple message: "What I want 
is people to not only get an understanding of AIDS but of human relationships. 
Through Molly and I, you can see how people can really care about each other. 
There can be hope to create lasting bonds between people, no matter who they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 "Encore" plays Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. through Dec. 30 at the Orange 
County Coalition of Theatre Arts, 729 W. 16th St., Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10. 
Information: (714) 361-9401.

'MARRIAGE' WEDS DURANG'S EARLIER THEMES;

<TEXT>
<P>
There was some uneasy seat shifting and a few frowns at the opening of 
Christopher Durang's "The Marriage of Bette and Boo" at Saddleback College on 
Friday. But nobody walked out, unlike at Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse during the 
recent run of Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there were a few post-performance titters -- one woman turned to her 
husband and said, "Silly, wasn't it? But why did they have to make such fun of 
religion?" A faint echo of the near-hysterical protests that accompanied 
"Sister Mary." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Durang does sprinkle a bit of acid over rigid Catholic dogma 
(especially the notions of sin and guilt) in "Bette and Boo," but it's a mild 
dousing compared to "Sister Mary," which, for the record, is more a criticism 
of intellectual tyranny than a thoughtless slap at religion. 
</P>
<P>
"Bette and Boo" borrows from "Sister Mary" (first produced in 1979) and another 
of Durang's better comedies, "Baby With the Bathwater," his 1983 satire about 
parenthood and family. At its best, "Bette and Boo" (1985) gives us the boldly 
caustic sendups of contemporary society Durang is known for. At its worst, 
however, this is a redundancy -- a rehash of themes he explored more cogently 
in the earlier plays. 
</P>
<P>
At Saddleback, director Lynn Wells shows she grasps Durang's quirky style, 
which distorts the commonplace for both effect and message. Wells communicates 
Durang's disturbed energy and brings in a nice touch or two of her own -- the 
clear masks in the family portrait scenes give an appropriately alienated feel 
-- but the pacing was unsteady Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As with much of Durang's work, the surface plot is simple, the interior dark 
and tangled. Bette (Sue Elizabeth Torrent) and Boo (Jerry Groble) get married 
and move in the right direction, at least at the outset. They have a son, Matt 
(Michael Gene Brown), and dream of domestic bliss. Then things get odd. Then 
they get ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Bette keeps having more babies, all stillborn. Boo drinks constantly. Matt 
(much like the son in "Baby With the Bathwater") seems dysfunctional, a product 
of their craziness. The couple's parents are nuts, menaces, idiots; sometimes 
all three: Boo's dad, Karl (Carlos Romero), mentally pistol-whips his wife, 
Soot (Linda Yeazel), who is a giggling mutation of motherhood. Bette's folks 
aren't much better. Her sisters are goofy too. 
</P>
<P>
With this array of cockeyed characters, you'd better have refined acting or you 
risk missing the subtleties of Durang's arguments against traditional mores. 
Unfortunately, it's a mixed bag at Saddleback; the strongest portrayals are 
offered by the relaxed, snide Romero, the unnervingly perky Yeazel and Joseph 
Bass as a harried comedian of a priest. 
</P>
<P>
But Torrent makes the mistake of approaching Bette as merely a cartoon cutout 
(maybe she was impressed by Wally Huntoon's cardboardish, iridescent set) 
without much resonance. There's more to the character than stark, unlayered 
emotions; Bette is sensational but not superficial. As for Boo, Groble needs to 
vivify the role. The way he is now, it's unclear how we're suppose to feel 
about him.

MUCKENTHALER RENOVATION DELAYED;

Faced with budget problems, the Fullerton City Council on Tuesday voted to 
solicit a second round of construction bids for renovating the outdoor theater 
at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center and essentially shelved a planned upgrade 
of the center's dining area, according to a city official. 
</P>
<P>
The delay jeopardizes the theater's 1991 summer season, according to Wes 
Morgan, superintendent of Fullerton's Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ruling out a summer season, but if there is one, it will have to be 
shortened," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Normally the season runs for 12 weeks between June and August and includes 
three productions. 
</P>
<P>
Originally planning to renovate both the 200-seat dining area and the theater, 
city officials closed the hillside area for the refurbishments this past summer 
with hopes to reopen it in May. But the initial construction bids called for 
double the $700,000 that was budgeted, Morgan said, leading the officials to 
reevaluate. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal at this point is to (start soliciting) bids in January, begin work in 
February, spend about four months renovating the theater, hopefully be done by 
June, and be able to run a season in July and August," Morgan explained. 
</P>
<P>
He and others acknowledged that a lot depends on whether a troupe would be 
willing to participate in a truncated season. The Fullerton Civic Light Opera 
has been negotiating with city and Muckenthaler officials for use of the 
theater. CLO general manager Griff Duncan said Wednesday that the company would 
not be put off by a short season. "But we need a firm completion date" to 
prepare properly, he said.

KOREAN FIRM MAY ATTEMPT TO BUY ORION FILM STUDIO; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: SAMSUNG GROUP REPORTEDLY HAS A PLAN FOR $300-MILLION BUYOUT, 
$500-MILLION CASH INFUSION.

<P>
The giant Samsung Group of Korea may become Hollywood's next foreign buyer. 
</P>
<P>
The $35-billion-a-year conglomerate, which has interests in consumer 
electronics and other areas, has quietly made inquiries about purchasing Orion 
Pictures Corp., according to several individuals familiar with the approach. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung formulated a plan in recent weeks under which it would pay roughly $300 
million for the studio, or some part of it, and would provide a cash infusion 
of up to $500 million to beef up Orion's sagging movie and television 
operations, the individuals said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't immediately clear whether the Korean company was interested in 
purchasing all of Orion's approximately 22 million outstanding shares or 
whether it might simply seek to purchase the 70% stake owned by billionaire 
investor John Kluge. 
</P>
<P>
An Orion spokesman declined to comment, and a Samsung spokesman said he wasn't 
aware of his company's interest in Orion. 
</P>
<P>
An outright purchase of Orion would put a fifth large film company under 
foreign control. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., a Japanese electronics firm on which 
Samsung has long modeled itself, last week agreed to acquire MCA Inc., the 
parent of Universal Studios, for $6.59 billion. Columbia Pictures is owned by 
Japan's Sony Corp., 20th Century Fox Film Corp. is owned by Australia's News 
Corp., and MGM-Pathe Communications Co. is controlled by Italian investor 
Giancarlo Parretti. 
</P>
<P>
Orion, plagued by a losing streak at the box office, in October retained 
Salomon Bros., a New York investment banking firm, to seek new funds for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Samsung simultaneously began looking for a way to match its 
videocassette recorders and other electronic "hardware" with a producer of 
entertainment "software," much as Matsushita and Sony have done. 
</P>
<P>
Several people said the Korean company within the last week approached Orion 
through the Hollywood law firm of Bloom, Dekom &amp; Hergott, but a partner 
with the firm denied any involvement with Samsung. 
</P>
<P>
Seoul-based Samsung is one of Korea's so-called chaebol -- huge, family-run 
concerns that often have interests in widely varied businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Founded by Tokyo-educated B. C. Lee in 1938, Samsung was initially a food 
export company. It eventually developed huge insurance and electronics 
operations, largely through self-conscious imitation of Matsushita and other 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune magazine identified Samsung earlier this year as the world's 
20th-largest industrial concern, with bigger sales than such better-known 
companies as Honda, Volkswagen and Boeing. One reason for Samsung's low profile 
in the United States has been its practice of supplying televisions, microwave 
ovens and VCRs to be sold under brand names owned by Sears, J. C. Penney and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Orion, with $485 million in sales last year, is much smaller than major studios 
such as MCA's Universal or Time Warner's Warner Bros. But the New York-based 
company has made its mark by granting unusual autonomy to directors and other 
filmmakers since it was founded in 1978 by Arthur Krim, Eric Pleskow and other 
executives who quit United Artists Corp. in a dispute with Transamerica Corp., 
which owned it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The company's main asset is its 800-title film library, which includes 
"Platoon," "Amadeus," "RoboCop," "Hannah and Her Sisters," and the "Cagney 
&amp; Lacey" TV series. The company does not own a studio lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves," an Orion film about American Indians directed by and 
starring Kevin Costner, surprised much of Hollywood by turning into a 
box-office hit despite its three-hour length and risky subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
But the company has suffered from repeated movie disappointments and has 
invested heavily in one-hour TV dramas. These traditionally require a 
substantial investment by the studio when they are filmed and don't return a 
profit unless they remain on the networks long enough to justify the sale of 
reruns in syndication. Orion placed "WIOU," "Unequal Justice" and "Lifestories" 
on the networks this year. 
</P>
<P>
MCA's senior managers, in selling to Matsushita, struck a deal to remain in 
place for at least five years. Orion's Krim might not seek the same assurances 
from Samsung, however. The 80-year-old executive has reportedly tired of the 
rigors of running a film company. 
</P>
<P>
The sale could also lead to the departure of Woody Allen, Orion's most 
prominent filmmaker. Allen, who is close to Krim, has been courted by Walt 
Disney Co. for several years. Disney was responsible for Allen's only recent 
projects outside Orion -- "New York Stories" and the upcoming "Scenes From a 
Mall." Disney reportedly believes that Allen, whose films rarely draw large 
audiences, would be a prestigious addition to its roster. 
</P>
<P>
A sale for $300 million would apparently point to a per-share price in the area 
of $15 -- which might leave little profit for Kluge. He has purchased his stake 
since 1987 for prices that reportedly ranged between $14 and $19 a share, 
though he exercised warrants to buy 4.3 million shares at $6 each only a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
With a total debt of about $375 million, Orion has been under pressure to find 
new funding. The company recently picked up some financing by selling foreign 
distribution and other rights to Columbia Pictures under a long-term contract. 
Samsung would probably seek to negotiate an end to that arrangement if it were 
to go ahead with a formal bid for Orion, one person familiar with the studio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Orion's stock closed unchanged Wednesday at $13 a share in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. The stock has taken a roller-coaster ride this year, trading 
as low as $6.875 and as high as $23.75. It sold for $7 a share as recently as 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts have said they expected a higher price for Orion. In a Feb. 
22 report compiled by the InvesText research service, for instance, a Smith 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst predicted that a sale might bring as 
much as $30 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Matsushita's purchase of MCA for much less than expected is widely believed 
to have set lower benchmarks for company sales in a period when financing for 
takeovers has been tight. 
</P>
<P>
Since the MCA sale, Hollywood has been rife with rumors that other big Japanese 
electronics companies such as Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Corp. were exploring 
possible entertainment investments. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, though, Samsung matches any of them when it comes to global 
ambition. As Lee Kun-hee, the company's chief executive, told Forbes magazine 
in a 1988 interview: "I have a dream to build Samsung into a world-class 
company, a genuine multinational."

DEMOCRATS OUST KEY COMMITTEE HEADS IN HOUSE

<P>
In one of the biggest shake-ups since the "Watergate Congress" of 1974 dumped 
several key committee heads, House Democrats Wednesday toppled two senior 
committee chairmen accused of being ineffectual and out of touch with 
rank-and-file members. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), the 77-year-old chairman of the Public 
Works and Transportation Committee who championed development of the ports of 
Los Angeles and Long Beach, was rejected by a 152-100 vote of the Democratic 
Caucus. Rep. Robert A. Roe of New Jersey was chosen to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), 75, was ousted from his post as chairman of the 
House Administration Committee by a far narrower 127-125 margin. To succeed 
Annunzio, Democrats elected Charlie Rose of North Carolina, the panel's 
third-ranking member, who defeated second-ranking Joseph M. Gaydos of 
Pennsylvania on a 158-64 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The ousters, which came as a shock to the two veteran lawmakers as well as to 
the House Democratic leadership, followed last-minute challenges mounted by 
disgruntled, leading members of their committees. 
</P>
<P>
Their downfalls appeared to send a strong reminder to other Democratic chairmen 
that they must respond to rank-and-file concerns and not run their committees 
like the all-powerful House barons of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The outcome reflected a combination of frustration within the committees and a 
sense that the caucus had to assert itself for change," said Rep. Leon E. 
Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) after Anderson and Annunzio were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason was offered by Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), who led the effort 
to defeat Anderson and Annunzio on grounds that they were not able to lead 
their committees properly. 
</P>
<P>
"These committees handle our extremely important efforts to rebuild America's 
sagging infrastructure and to fashion a much-needed reform of the campaign 
finance system," Obey said. "We need to have people running these committees 
who are up to the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
In a close race to succeed Anderson, Roe defeated Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San 
Jose) by a vote of 121 to 107. Mineta, backed by a majority of the Democrats on 
the public works panel, had led the fight to unseat Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Roe, who was second in seniority on the public works panel, will have to give 
up his chairmanship of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee when 
he replaces Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from tradition, the Democratic Caucus leadership decided to 
choose replacements immediately in a night session Wednesday rather than wait 
until the new Congress convenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a third chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), 74, of the House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, was seriously challenged but 
retained his office on a 163-89 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), who organized the losing campaign against 
Gonzalez, said that he was acting on behalf of himself and other Banking 
Committee members who believe that the chairman has dominated the panel but 
failed to develop a legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"Chairmen are not on a personal ego trip but have to run the committee well," 
Vento said. "Members of the caucus are not going to sit back and take it. This 
should send a message to all House chairmen." 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of apparent desire for turnover among aged or ailing 
leadership, House Democrats cast 47 negative votes against Rep. Morris K. Udall 
of Arizona, the 68-year-old Interior Committee chairman who suffers from 
Parkinson's disease. They also cast 46 negative votes against 77-year-old 
Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee 
chairman who has been ill frequently and uses a wheelchair to move through 
congressional corridors. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of Anderson and Annunzio was the biggest caucus revolt since the 
Watergate class of incoming congressmen joined with incumbent Democrats in 1974 
to remove three long-entrenched chairmen from the Agriculture, Armed Services 
and Banking committees. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's votes, Democrats had not removed a committee chairman since 
1985, when Rep. Melvin Price (D-Ill.), who was then 80 years old, lost his job 
as head of the Armed Services Committee and was replaced by Rep. Les Aspin of 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is: If you're a committee chairman, don't limp," said Rep. Pat 
Williams (D-Mont.). 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, whose Republican opponent in November accused him of slowing down and 
growing stale, declined to comment on his defeat as chairman of the committee 
he has headed since March, 1988, when he moved up because of seniority to 
succeed the late Rep. James J. Howard (D-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
Some fellow Democrats said privately that advancing age and quadruple-bypass 
heart surgery in 1988 seemed to have taken their toll on Anderson's mental 
alertness and physical vigor. Others said he relied too heavily on staff aides 
to do his work. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Democratic members of the House before the ouster, Anderson's 
challengers said that nothing could be more difficult than to seek his removal, 
adding: "Nevertheless, we . . . have reluctantly and regretfully reached the 
conclusion that we need new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a quiet politician, has built a reputation for hard work on behalf of 
home-state projects, including the Los Angeles and Long Beach port complexes, 
the Harbor Freeway and the expansion of Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In another change, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) was elected to a seat on 
the House Appropriations Committee.

2 WOMEN DIE WHEN HIT BY TRAIN AT DEPOT

<P>
As more than two dozen commuters watched in horror, two women died after they 
were struck Wednesday by a freight train as one tried to rescue the other, who 
had stumbled while crossing the tracks at the Del Mar Amtrak station. 
</P>
<P>
Usha Waney, 47, of La Jolla fell as she rushed to cross the tracks after 
hearing a warning signal at a nearby road crossing and mistakenly thought it 
marked the arrival of her Los Angeles-bound passenger train. She was killed 
instantly when the 2,000-ton train hit her. 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Halpern, 44, of Encinitas died of her injuries in a hospital Wednesday 
afternoon. She and her husband were frantically trying to pull Waney from the 
train's path when the women were struck. 
</P>
<P>
Waney was among half a dozen people who began running toward the tiny red-brick 
depot from a parking lot on the west side of the tracks about 6:35 a.m. when 
they heard the crossing bells warning of a coming train, San Diego County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Waney, a clothing designer on a business trip to Gardena, tripped while 
carrying her loaded briefcase across the tracks at an unauthorized but heavily 
used shortcut, less than 6 feet from the platform area, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Then she rose briefly to her knees as Halpern and her husband, Lee Kaiser -- 
who were among the group rushing from the parking lot -- dashed back to the 
tracks to help. 
</P>
<P>
"She was crouched there on the tracks, and they ran out to help her," Deputy 
Carlos Medina said. "But they only got her halfway off. The train just came by 
and cut her in two." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses say that Halpern fell toward the train as she attempted to assist 
Waney, while Kaiser fell away from the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Volsky, a 43-year-old Del Mar real estate agent who stood on the platform, 
said several commuters witnessed the split-second drama but were frozen by the 
rush of the oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
"We all saw her fall," he said of Waney, who only recently had expressed 
concern to her husband about the dangerous crossing. "You wanted to dash out 
and help her, but the train was coming. You just froze, you just froze." 
</P>
<P>
Waney's body was pulled beneath the braking locomotive, which hit Halpern 
before coming to a stop about 150 yards up the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Halpern was flown by Life Flight helicopter to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La 
Jolla, where she died about 4:40 p.m. of massive internal and head injuries. 
Kaiser was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Volsky recalled watching Waney fall as the lumbering train struck. 
</P>
<P>
"The lady who was killed was wearing a white blouse and blue pants," he said. 
"When she fell under the train, the white blouse turned to red from her blood. 
It was just terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The train dragged parts of Waney's mutilated body across a 100-yard section of 
track -- scattering her shoes, purse, clothing and papers from her briefcase -- 
as witnesses dressed in business suits cried out and turned their heads in 
horror, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the air was filled with the victim's blood-spattered papers, 
apparel samples and the sound of the big engine's brakes. The briefcase was 
sliced in two by the wheels of the train. 
</P>
<P>
"All you could hear were the horrible screams from people on the platform," 
Volsky recalled. "After the woman was hit, people got down on the platform and 
started to pray instead of doing anything to help her. Those screams are still 
in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Allan Royster of Poway, who also stood on the platform, said of Waney: "I will 
never forget her face. She realized it was too late but the other people stuck 
right by her. . . . They were trying to help her." 
</P>
<P>
The accident delayed northbound rail traffic for three hours and the next 
southbound train for 30 minutes, authorities said. Northbound-bound commuters 
at the scene were taken to their destinations by bus. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths of Waney and Halpern were the fifth and sixth involving trains and 
people on foot in San Diego County since early October. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, a Carlsbad grocery clerk was killed by an Amtrak train as he carried 
a bicycle along a trestle near Basilone Road in the North County. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 13, a woman was struck in Encinitas by another passenger train as she 
sat on the tracks smoking a cigarette. Eight days later, two migrant workers 
were killed by an Amtrak train in Leucadia as they reportedly sat on the tracks 
playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Martin, a spokesman for the Santa Fe Railway in San Bernardino, said that 
the company's freight train had just rounded a blind curve just south of the 
depot at about 45 m.p.h. when the engineer saw a woman on the tracks about 250 
yards ahead and blew his whistle. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got four powerful locomotives and 43 freight cars traveling down those 
tracks -- the whole train weighs more than 2,670 tons," he said. "The engineer 
tried to stop the train -- did the best he could. 
</P>
<P>
"But you've got steel wheels on a steel rail. You can't stop a train like that 
on a dime. Still, he's very upset about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
A cabdriver who was parked at the station said he heard no train whistle before 
the accident. "I didn't hear any whistles at all. I'm sure of it," said the 
driver, who identified himself only as Greg. 
</P>
<P>
"You knew it was a freight train coming, though. It had this heavy rumble. 
There's no mistaking a freight train." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the one freight train running daily between San Diego and Barstow 
usually makes its run during the night, but a recent renovation project had 
forced the trains to run during the day. 
</P>
<P>
The $45-million LOSSAN Rail Corridor Rehabilitation Project is in the fourth 
and final phase of a four-year plan to replace worn tracks in San Diego and 
Orange counties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The crews do their work at night, when the passenger trains aren't running," 
Martin said. "As a result, we've had to run the freight trains when we had the 
best window of time. This one was running about 13 minutes in front of a 
northbound passenger train. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tragic, there's no doubt about it. But this is a main rail line that's 
been open for 108 years. And trains run up and down it 24 hours a day. People 
just shouldn't be surprised that there are trains on that line. So, no, we 
don't plan any scheduling changes because of this incident." 
</P>
<P>
The danger at the tiny depot, which overlooks the ocean in downtown Del Mar, 
lies instead at an unsanctioned track crossing used by scores of passengers 
each day to reach the station from a private parking lot nearby, Martin said. 
(There is also a parking lot next to the depot on the east side of the tracks.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crossing right in front of the depot that sits on the end of a long 
fence," he said. "People use it out of convenience to get from the private 
parking lot to the public depot." 
</P>
<P>
Several regular train commuters said the crossing is used by scores of 
passengers each morning, many of whom park their cars and must run to the depot 
when they hear the whistle of the approaching northbound trains. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate that crossing," said one train traveler. "I've seen dozens of people 
run a foot race to get across the tracks in time. Because they know, if they 
don't make it, you can't get on the train. 
</P>
<P>
"If they just put a door on the west side, people wouldn't have to rush." 
</P>
<P>
Volsky added: "It really scares me because I knew I had just crossed the tracks 
at that crossing only 10 minutes before. We all do it. And now this happens." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe's Martin said rail passengers who use the informal crossing do so at 
their own risk: "It's like speeding on the freeway -- you're not supposed to do 
it, but people so it all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"But this thing is not a public crossing in any way, shape or form. If people 
are going to use it, good luck to them. The present alternative is to walk 
around to the nearest crossing just south of the platform. That is still the 
safest thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
John King, owner of the adjacent Seagrove Parking, acknowledged that the 
crossing is extremely dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our crossing," he said. "We just have a bicycle rack there for people 
to use. We don't tell them to use it, so it's not our problem. It belongs to 
the railroad or the city of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"I think someone should put a fence up there, or this is going to happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Councilman Rod Franklin said the sticky issue remains as to who bears 
responsibility for the crossing. "Obviously, this issue is going to go to court 
someday soon," he said, "and the question is going to come up: 'Who created 
this path?' 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is the people who used it day after day rather than walking around 
to the official crossing. The city owns the sidewalk people are supposed to 
use. I just can't answer the question of liability. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something two lawyers and a jury are going to have to hash out 
sometime." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have long claimed that something needs to be done to protect 
pedestrians along the rail corridor -- which now sees 16 passenger trains and 
one freight each day, a number that may rise to 26 by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, however, have resisted proposals to fence off the 44-mile stretch 
between Oceanside and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Mar station was the site of an accident in the mid-1970s when a train 
struck a bus that had stalled on the tracks in the fog. The bus driver and a 
small girl were killed. 
</P>
<P>
But there will be an eventual solution for the Del Mar station, officials say. 
The depot, built in 1906, is scheduled to be closed and replaced within the 
next couple of years when a commuter rail station is built along the tracks 
north of Del Mar in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Waney, a production manager for San Diego-based Beeba's 
Creations, was to have taken the 6:49 a.m. Amtrak train on her way to Gardena 
to inspect a production facility there, according to a company official. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Maskovich, a corporate officer, said Waney had worked for Beeba's for 
more than 13 years and had coordinated international and domestic production of 
the firm's sportswear garments. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Hashu, who is also employed at the firm, said late Wednesday that 
his wife had recently mentioned the crossing as a dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
Maskovich added: "We all thought that depot was such a pretty place with its 
ocean view." 
</P>
<P>
She said Waney apparently did not know the couple who tried to save her life. 
"They were strangers who were all crossing the track at the same time," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman just jumped out in front of an oncoming train to try and save 
Usha's life. It's just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Halpern's organs were being removed Wednesday night, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. Halpern, who had a Ph.D, was a researcher at the Regional Cancer Center 
in La Jolla, Deputy Coroner William Leard said.

ISRAEL WARNS IT WILL 'HURT' IRAQ IF THREAT COMES 
</P>

<P>
Israel's foreign minister warned Wednesday that if U.S. talks with Iraq result 
in a heightened Iraqi threat to Israel, his country will take the matter into 
its own hands and make the enemy "hurt." 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone thinks that through some maneuver in the name of peace, he will be 
able to continue to threaten with the aim of surprising Israel, he will find 
that Israel is ready with its might to destroy his security, to hurt him until 
he is sorry and regrets his action," Foreign Minister David Levy declared in a 
speech to the Knesset (Parliament). 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is taking nothing for granted and will make its own decisions," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The comments marked an end to Israel's low-profile approach to the Persian Gulf 
crisis. They represented a clear expression of growing fears that Iraq's Saddam 
Hussein may withdraw from Kuwait with his army and weaponry intact. Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir is scheduled to visit Washington next week and is 
expected to reiterate Israel's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Levy's comments followed by a day his effort to press the United States not 
only to expel Iraq's army from Kuwait but also to destroy Hussein's military 
might. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Levy summoned U.S. Ambassador William A. Brown to argue that by 
Israel's reckoning, Washington has explicitly committed itself to the 
dismantling of Iraq's developing nuclear potential. He further cautioned that 
if Baghdad's existing chemical and conventional arsenal remains intact, "it 
would be a problem for Israel and a problem for the entire world," reported a 
Foreign Ministry official familiar with the talks. 
</P>
<P>
The official insisted that, despite reports in Israeli newspapers, Levy was not 
implying a preemptive Israeli attack on Iraq. "That is taking the implication 
too far," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Levy statements came amid gloomy Israeli appraisals of President Bush's 
proposal to open talks with Iraq, an offer that Baghdad accepted Wednesday. 
Although Bush insisted that he intends only to impress on Iraq the risks of 
staying in Kuwait, Israeli officials compared the decision to Western Europe's 
efforts to appease German dictator Adolf Hitler before the start of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Science and Technology Minister Yuval Neeman likened Bush to Neville 
Chamberlain, the British prime minister who abandoned Czechoslovakia to Hitler 
in return for an illusory "peace in our time." 
</P>
<P>
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, a leading Cabinet hawk, demanded that the United 
States remove Hussein from power. 
</P>
<P>
"For Israel, for the Middle East and for the world, it would have been much 
better if the United States would not have stepped into the Persian Gulf if the 
end of the crisis would be that Saddam Hussein stays in power," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed that Iraq be de-clawed. 
"Stability and peace in the Middle East are very hard to envision if Saddam 
Hussein remains with the weapons of mass destruction, the war machine that he 
has, and is building," he said. "How (the weapons) can be neutralized is 
something that has to be looked at right now." 
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu indicated that Israel might take its own action if the United States 
wavers. "What has guided us throughout is, of course, support for the 
American-led international effort to reverse Iraqi aggression, but equally, of 
course, our concern and our resolution is to defend Israel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has threatened to attack Israel if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf. 
Last spring, Hussein warned that he would "burn half of Israel" with chemical 
weapons in case of an Israeli attack. 
</P>
<P>
In his comments to Brown, Levy suggested that now is the best time to hit Iraq 
because it is unlikely that an alliance such as the one now in place in the 
gulf can be renewed in the future. Levy had summoned Brown after receiving a 
letter from Secretary of State James A. Baker III explaining Bush's offer to 
open talks with Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is threatened by name, and we are taking a risk by adopting a low 
profile. In the event of danger, we must defend ourselves," a Foreign Ministry 
official argued. The official added that Israel took Bush's recent comments on 
Iraq's nuclear potential to mean that the United States is committed to 
destroying it. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers found Levy's performance ominous. The influential Haaretz 
newspaper commented: "These remarks, coupled with the statement to Ambassador 
Brown, express a new Israeli policy toward the gulf crisis, following the 
invitation to Iraq to negotiate with the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hints that Israel might take on Iraq alone, military officials have 
said that Israel lacks the capability to do the job, at least using only 
conventional weapons. 
</P>
<P>
One military official told reporters Wednesday: "Israel will never have the 
kind of arsenal that the United States has in place in the Persian Gulf -- 
cruise missiles, B-52 bombers; nor do we surround Iraq on three sides, in 
Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the gulf, like the Americans do." 
</P>
<P>
Israel possesses nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. Government 
officials insist that the country would never be the first to "introduce" them 
in the region.

2 WOMEN DIE AFTER BEING HIT BY TRAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Two women died after they were struck by a freight train at the Del Mar Amtrak 
station as one tried to rescue the other, who had stumbled while crossing the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
While about two dozen commuters watched helplessly, Usha Waney, 47, of La 
Jolla, was struck as she rushed to cross the tracks, apparently because she 
mistakenly believed that the warning signal at a nearby road crossing marked 
the arrival of her Los Angeles-bound passenger train, authorities said. She 
died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Halpern, 44, of Encinitas, was hit as she and her husband made a 
frantic effort to rescue Waney, who reportedly was dazed when her head hit a 
rail, investigators said. Halpern died in a hospital Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Waney was among a group of people who began running toward the tiny red-brick 
depot from a parking lot on the west side of the tracks about 6:35 a.m. when 
they heard the crossing bells, San Diego County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego clothing designer who had planned a business trip to Gardena, Waney 
tripped as she hurried across the tracks at an unauthorized, but heavily used, 
short cut fewer than six feet from the platform area, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Then she rose briefly to her knees as Halpern and her husband, Lee Kaiser -- 
who were among the group rushing to beat the train -- dashed back onto the 
tracks to help. 
</P>
<P>
"She was crouched there on the tracks and they ran out to help her," said 
Sheriff's Deputy Carlos Medina. "But they only got her halfway off. The train 
just came by and cut her in two." 
</P>
<P>
Joel Volsky, 43, a local real estate agent who was standing on the platform, 
said several commuters witnessed the split-second drama but were frozen by the 
rush of the oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
"We all saw her fall," he said of Waney. "You wanted to dash out and help her, 
but the train was coming. You just froze. You just froze." 
</P>
<P>
Waney's body was pulled beneath the braking locomotive, which hit Halpern 
before it stopped about 150 yards up the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Halpern was airlifted by helicopter to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla 
where she died of massive internal and head injuries. Kaiser was not seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
"All you could hear were the horrible screams from people on the platform," 
Volsky said. "After the woman was hit, people got down on the platform and 
started to pray instead of doing anything to help her. Those screams are still 
in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Northbound rail traffic was delayed for three hours and a southbound train for 
30 minutes, officials said. Los Angeles-bound commuters at the scene were taken 
to their destinations by bus, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Waney and Halpern were the fifth and sixth pedestrians killed by trains in San 
Diego County since early October, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Martin, a spokesman for the Santa Fe Railroad in San Bernardino, said the 
company's freight train rounded a blind curve just south of the depot at about 
45 m.p.h. when the engineer saw the woman on the tracks about 250 yards away 
and blew his whistle. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got four powerful locomotives and 43 freight cars traveling down those 
tracks -- the whole train weighs more than 2,670 tons," he said. "The engineer 
tried to stop the train, did the best he could. 
</P>
<P>
"But you've got steel wheels on a steel rail. You can't stop a train like that 
on a dime. Still, he's very upset about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the one freight train running daily between San Diego and Barstow 
usually makes its run overnight but that a recent renovation project had forced 
the trains to run during the day. 
</P>
<P>
The $45-million LOSSAN Rail Corridor Rehabilitation Project is in the fourth 
and final phase of a four-year plan to replace worn tracks in San Diego and 
Orange counties, he said.

BERKELEY MAYORAL ELECTION MAY HANG ON COURT RULING

A judge will decide if "better late than never" holds true in the runoff 
election for mayor of Berkeley, where a smattering of last-minute absentee 
ballots may determine the political orientation of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Although incumbent Mayor Loni Hancock appeared Wednesday to lead challenger 
Fred Weekes, her margin of victory was narrow enough that the outcome could 
hang on absentee ballots that are the focus of a court fight. 
</P>
<P>
The runoff was forced when Hancock, a leader of the city's liberal Berkeley 
Citizens Action Party, got 49.9% of the vote Nov. 6, narrowly missing the 
50%-plus-one requirement. The liberal Democratic coalition has dominated city 
politics for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome could be determined by Alameda County Superior Court Judge Howard 
Schwartz, who will hear arguments Friday on whether absentee ballots that 
arrived after the polls closed on Tuesday should be counted. 
</P>
<P>
The election code says that absentee ballots can be counted only if received by 
Election Day. But opponents of Hancock say that as many as 3,000 of 8,000 
requested ballots weren't mailed out until last week, reaching voters as late 
as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't know the number of ballots involved for a while," City Clerk Marie 
McKetchnie said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock led Weekes, a city councilman, by only 590 votes in unofficial results 
of Tuesday's election. But Weekes, a moderate Democrat who wants to eliminate 
"ideological practices" from City Hall, asked the judge to allow the counting 
of mail-in ballots postmarked before the polls closed but not received until 
after Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a large number of uncounted ballots out there," Weekes said. "I 
don't know how large, but it could change the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
With all 116 precincts reporting, Weekes trailed Hancock 16,682 to 16,092 but 
led 2,403 to 1,624 among early absentee ballots, which usually favor more 
conservative candidates. Depending on the judge's decision, remaining absentee 
ballots could change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hancock, who during the campaign promised to continue 
Berkeley's liberal tradition, was confident that the mayor would remain in 
office given her edge. 
</P>
<P>
"If the absentee ballots split in the same ratio as the earlier absentee 
ballots, there is no way Mr. Weekes can win the election," said Malcom 
Bernstein, treasurer of the Hancock campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock, 52, is the most prominent member of the Berkeley Citizens Action 
Party, which was born in the fervor of the 1960s anti-Vietnam War, youth and 
civil rights movements. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition lost control of the council and the rent board in the November 
election. Hancock's defeat could mean the end of the group's dominance.

WILSON FINDS DILEMMAS IN SENATE CHOICE; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN 1992 AND A LITMUS TEST SET BY THE 
GOVERNOR-ELECT ARE SEEN AS FACTORS LIMITING HIS OPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before a glittering audience of financial backers, Gov.-elect Pete Wilson cut 
quickly to the much-debated subject of his replacement as U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably a thousand people who can serve admirably," he told 
Republicans in Beverly Hills on Tuesday night. "But there are not too many who 
are eager or ready or able to undertake what is actually going to be involved, 
which is doing the job at the same time that you are running to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
One month after he won the governorship and the right to pick his own Senate 
successor, Wilson is sifting through the names of candidates and said he plans 
to announce his selection in two to three weeks. Rumors are flying fast and 
furiously, but Wilson has limited discussion to a coterie of tight-lipped 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans, however, are finding it hard to come up with a list from 
which Wilson can pick, given the parameters the governor-elect has set. The 
dilemma, they say, once again points to the party's weakness in statewide 
races. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the kind of bench that I think we need," said Steven A. 
Merksamer, longtime party activist and former chief aide to departing Gov. 
George Deukmejian. "I'm not sure it's going to be easy for Pete to find someone 
who reflects his views entirely." 
</P>
<P>
While there is some disagreement about that, other Republicans concur that the 
party is facing the same problem it confronted two years ago, when Gov. George 
Deukmejian announced he would not run for a third term. The solution then, 
after much hand-wringing, was the emergence of Wilson, who ran in an all but 
uncontested GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
The limited options faced by Wilson derive from two colliding circumstances -- 
the need to run an almost constant transcontinental campaign for the seat and 
the litmus tests set by Wilson himself. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's appointee will have to stand for election in 1992 -- right around the 
corner in the political lexicon. The appointee also will face election in 1994, 
when the seat was to come up if Wilson had kept it. In short, the appointee 
would have to run twice in four years, at an estimated cost of $10 million to 
$15 million each time, while building a defendable record as a freshman 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an effective brand-new senator is an extremely difficult job," said 
former congressman Ed Zschau, who challenged Sen. Alan Cranston in the 1986 
Senate race. "On top of that, in your spare time, you have to run statewide in 
California, an extraordinarily difficult job. You're put in a position of doing 
two different jobs from a standing start." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters is Cranston's announcement last month that he would not 
seek reelection, leaving his seat open in 1992 as well. That seat has proved 
much more alluring to many candidates because the winner would not have to run 
again for six years. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to go for the six-year seat," said state Republican Party Chairman 
Frank Visco. 
</P>
<P>
Making the pick more troublesome are the ground rules Wilson set for his 
successor -- an ideological moderate, an advocate of abortion rights and the 
death penalty and someone who can hold on to the seat for the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The position on abortion rights, in particular, may be hard to fulfill. Many of 
the party's potential candidates -- for example, U.S. Rep. David Dreier of 
Covina -- have a more restrictive view of abortion rights than Wilson. The 
governor-elect opposes federal funding for abortions but favors a woman's right 
to choose an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Rebecca Q. Morgan of Los Altos Hills, who has withdrawn from 
contention for the Senate seat, said that in a recent telephone conversation 
Wilson seemed intent on keeping his pledge to appoint someone who shares his 
moderate views on abortion rights. He also pressed the point of electability, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But others say Wilson may have to trade off some of his pledges to satisfy 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"He may well have to make some modifications," said one senior Republican 
campaign activist. "This isn't like the 'Dating Game' where . . . the potential 
field is millions of people." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and his advisers have refused to release a formal list of names under 
consideration. But among the field of presumed candidates, both Morgan and 
Zschau have asked that they not be considered, and others have spread the word 
that they are not particularly interested in an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Intimates of U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills, said to be among those 
being considered by Wilson, have spread the word that she would like to stay 
with the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Jerry Lewis of Redlands is close to Wilson, but this week he won a 
hard-fought race for the third-highest leadership post among House Republicans. 
Those familiar with his thinking have said Lewis would prefer to remain in 
Congress, where he is among those in line to replace House Minority Leader 
Robert H. Michel of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have my resume," Lewis said of Wilson earlier this week. Lewis 
would not specifically rule out interest in a Senate bid. Republicans and other 
political analysts suggest Wilson has three general options: 
</P>
<P>
* He could pick an elected official, who would have a leg up on creating a 
fund-raising base and the political acumen required in the job. A concern is 
that few Republicans have shown an ability to win statewide; most state offices 
are held by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans suggest that Wilson could chose from those who ran 
well-considered, if unsuccessful races -- for example, Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who lost to incumbent Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu in November. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said this week that she has not been contacted by Wilson. "Unless it 
were offered, I probably wouldn't even think about it," Flores said. "If it 
were offered, I'd weigh the pros and cons." 
</P>
<P>
* Another alternative is someone in the public policy arena familiar with the 
requirements of politics but not an officeholder. Hills' name is most often 
mentioned in this category, along with that of Condoleezza Rice, director of 
Soviet and East European affairs on the Bush Administration's National Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said she talked to Wilson about Rice, a black woman who before her NSC 
appointment taught at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
But Rice passed up an opportunity to run for Congress in 1986. Some Republicans 
are wary of placing someone who has never run for office in the position of 
running what amounts to a transcontinental, four-year marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge hurdle," said a Republican campaign activist. "This person faces 
four years of campaigning and fund raising. Until you've done it, I don't think 
people know the toll of energy and particularly cross-country travel." 
</P>
<P>
* Others, however, suggest that a policy expert -- or someone outside the 
political world entirely -- could win points for being a fresh face in an era 
where incumbency does not always play well with voters. Some Republicans cite 
Peter Ueberroth, president of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee 
and a registered Republican, as an example of a political outsider. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to carry all those rocks in the bag," said Zschau, who in his 
race with Cranston was battered over votes he cast in Congress. "The longer 
you're in office, the more record is there to attack." 
</P>
<P>
No matter who is appointed, Republicans already are worrying whether intraparty 
warfare will break out in the 1992 primary and help hand the seat back to the 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Several Republicans, in comments about the Senate appointment, suggested a 
comparison between the fate of Wilson's choice and that of Thomas Hayes, the 
appointed incumbent state treasurer who was defeated by Democrat Kathleen Brown 
in November. Many Republicans blame his loss on a contested primary in which 
Hayes was forced to spend $1 million to defeat fellow Republican Angela 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
At his $1,000-a-plate Tuesday night fund-raiser, Wilson pressured his backers 
to support his ultimate selection. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends, when you are relieved of the responsibility for supporting my 
efforts, please pick up the cudgels for those who will follow," he said.

MCA WON'T DONATE YOSEMITE BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
PARKS: LEW R. WASSERMAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE FIRM, WHICH HAS BEEN BOUGHT BY A 
JAPANESE COMPANY, SAYS OPERATIONS WILL BE SOLD TO AN AMERICAN BUYER.

<P>
Little more than a week after selling his entertainment empire to a Japanese 
firm, MCA Inc. Chairman Lew R. Wasserman rejected a request by the U.S. 
Interior Department on Wednesday to donate the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. 
"to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
The Curry Co., an MCA subsidiary, operates and owns a multimillion-dollar 
interest in most of the restaurants, stores and lodgings at Yosemite National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
In refusing the Interior Department's request, Wasserman reiterated to park 
officials that the Curry Co. will be sold to an American buyer within 12 months 
as part of the overall $6.6-billion purchase of his entertainment conglomerate 
by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Japan's largest electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement, Wasserman said, reflects the interests of the National Park 
Service, park visitors, "and, importantly, our stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. had asked Wasserman and Matsushita 
Executive Vice President Masahiko Hirata in a letter Tuesday to donate the park 
operation to the Park Service. Hirata has not yet replied and a company 
spokesman would not comment on the request. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a dramatic gesture would be recognized as a remarkably generous and 
public-spirited demonstration of the MCA/MEI commitment to the values of 
Yosemite National Park and what they stand for in the minds of the American 
people," Lujan wrote, enclosing a memorandum from National Park Service 
Director James Ridenour outlining the advantages of such a donation. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped for better news," said Park Service spokesman George Berklacy, 
responding to Wasserman's rejection. "Obviously, any sale or transfer has to 
involve the National Park Service. Secretary Lujan and Director Ridenour will 
continue to work with the two companies to strike the best possible deal in the 
interest of the American public and Yosemite National Park." 
</P>
<P>
In the memo sent to MCA and Matsushita, Ridenour said the current Park Service 
contract with the Curry Co. to run the park concession is unduly favorable to 
the firm and will become less lucrative when the agreement expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour, in an interview Wednesday from Washington, said MCA seemed inclined 
early on to donate all or part of the company to the government or to a private 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the turnaround, Ridenour said attorneys for the corporations 
indicated that the value of the Curry Co. was "made part of the deal with 
Matsushita, so there are expectations" of making money when it sells. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the company's worth range from $50 million to $300 million. The 
company owns about half of the buildings in Yosemite Valley, but the land is 
owned by the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
MCA's decision was not unexpected, Interior Department officials said, but 
Lujan and Ridenour decided to make the formal request anyway in hopes of 
rekindling the corporation's initial interest in making a donation. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the Park Service's concerns about a foreign-owned concession in 
a national park, MCA and Matsushita last month agreed to place the Curry Co. in 
escrow until an American buyer could be found. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the profits of the company are to be donated to the National 
Park Foundation, a quasi-governmental group that funnels private money into the 
Park Service. The money flow will stop if the Park Service fails to approve the 
new buyer within 30 days after it is submitted for review. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is a generous gift which will further the work of the 
(National Park Service)," Wasserman said in a written reply to Lujan on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman said the New York investment banking firms of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. 
and Allen &amp; Co. Inc. will assist in the sale of the Curry Co., and Bank of 
America will serve as the escrow agent. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service has not been the only party interested in receiving the Curry 
Co. as a donation. 
</P>
<P>
The Yosemite Restoration Trust, a San Francisco-based group created in part by 
environmentalists, met with MCA officials last week to describe their operation 
in hopes of buying the company or receiving part of it as a donation, according 
to sources close to the group. 
</P>
<P>
The Restoration Trust was formed to try to obtain the concession contract when 
it expires. If successful, the group has pledged to reduce development in 
Yosemite and return the profits to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Curry Co. President Edward Hardy also is widely rumored to be interested in 
forming a corporation to buy the company. Curry officials, however, say that 
there is no active effort by any employee to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour said he does not know what the Park Service will do next other than to 
try to get more revenue for the parks out of the new concession contract. 
Interior officials are still thinking strategy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get any good ideas, give them to me," the park director said.

<P>
With the deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait now less than six weeks 
away, the American political and military Establishment, like the nation at 
large, appears divided over the central policy question facing President Bush: 
</P>
<P>
Can economic sanctions force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait if 
the United States has the patience to wait 12 to 18 months? Or should the 
nation give up on sanctions and prepare for war as soon as next month? 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his aides, in a series of bellicose statements over the last week, 
have made their position clear. 
</P>
<P>
"By waiting, we will be risking, in effect, a victory for Saddam Hussein," 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to go on forever," Bush said in a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But after a week of congressional hearings, waiting is precisely the policy 
advocated by many leading congressional Democrats and a sizable number of 
Middle East experts and retired military officials. 
</P>
<P>
That split accentuates the risk that Bush faces in deciding whether to launch a 
war against Iraq. For if a war goes poorly, critics already will have 
established a strong position to second-guess the President's judgments. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a war, we're never going to know whether they (the sanctions) would 
have worked, are we?" said Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee and Bush's most powerful critic. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Bush is really as close to pulling the trigger as his rhetoric implies 
is unknown. The Administration's impatient statements may be, at least in part, 
an attempt to scare Hussein out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But it is clear that the Administration and its critics disagree sharply on 
fundamental questions -- most important, whether economic sanctions can force 
Hussein to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal view" is that "he can ride them out," Secretary of Defense Dick 
Cheney told the Armed Services panel Monday. "There's no guarantee," he added, 
that even in five years, "sanctions will force him out of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, flatly told the committee that "the issue is not whether an embargo will 
work but whether we have the patience to let it take effect." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for everyone from the President to citizens at home trying to 
decide whom to believe, the question of the embargo's effectiveness appears to 
have no scientific, verifiable answer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all operating on the basis of assessments we cannot prove," former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said in his congressional testimony. ". . 
. we are talking here, for everybody, of 51-49 types of decisions." 
</P>
<P>
A second disagreement surrounds U.S. objectives. Crowe and his predecessor as 
head of the joint chiefs, retired Air Force Gen. David C. Jones, both suggested 
that Americans should settle for prodding Iraq out of Kuwait even if that means 
leaving the rest of Hussein's military apparatus in place. 
</P>
<P>
But a much broader set of goals is advocated by some Administration officials, 
many non-governmental members of the Washington political-military policy 
Establishment and leaders of several Middle Eastern countries. 
</P>
<P>
Those goals, they say, should include depriving Iraq of its chemical weapons 
stockpiles and its ability to obtain nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush embraces those objectives -- a question he has left vague -- war almost 
certainly cannot be avoided, Jones testified. "I foresee no circumstances in 
which Iraq's leader would accept such conditions, except at the point of a 
gun," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show the public is even more deeply split than specialists and 
policy-makers. Roughly one-quarter to one-third of those responding to polls -- 
particularly women, blacks and low-income Americans -- appear to oppose any 
U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf at any time. The experts and 
policy-makers, overwhelmingly male, white and upper-income, include few voices 
renouncing force altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Among Americans who agree that the United States must ensure an Iraqi 
withdrawal from Kuwait, by force if necessary, polls show considerable 
disagreement about how quickly a U.S. move should come and its final 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the most controversial question involves time: Which side gains more 
by waiting? 
</P>
<P>
Nunn and many of his fellow Democrats and their supporters argue that having 
imposed a nearly leakproof economic quarantine on Iraq, the United States 
should now sit back and wait, perhaps until the winter of 1992. By that time, 
Bush will be facing reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies already have absorbed the major cost of the 
embargo on Iraq -- higher oil prices -- and now face little extra cost for 
waiting, James R. Schlesinger, the former secretary of defense and former CIA 
director, told the Armed Services Committee. "In effect, we can leave Iraq in 
isolation until it comes to its senses," Schlesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions have had a severe impact on the Iraqi economy, reducing 
overall non-military production by 40%, he noted. And by cutting off nearly all 
Iraqi oil exports -- normally worth roughly $1.5 billion a month -- the embargo 
is draining that nation's reserves of foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The probability that the economic sanctions will result in a satisfactory 
outcome is very high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials accept the numbers but disagree with Schlesinger's 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
"Many industries have largely shut down" in Iraq because of shortages of spare 
parts and crucial raw materials, William H. Webster, the current CIA director, 
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, however, "we see no indication that Saddam is concerned at this 
point that domestic discontent is growing to levels that may threaten his 
regime, or that problems resulting from the sanctions are causing him to 
rethink his policy on Kuwait," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although sanctions are hurting Iraq's civilian economy, they are affecting 
Iraq's military only at the margins," Webster added. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials argue that "waiting is not without cost as an option," 
as Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified. They 
have mounted a major effort to convince Americans that a long pause would be 
bad policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we really prepared to let our hostages in Iraq sit there for the next 18 
months?" Vice President Dan Quayle demanded in a weekend CBS-TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
". . . That is not going to be the policy of this Administration -- to say 
we're prepared to wait for another 18 months."

MOSCOW SENDS PLANE TO IRAQ TO GET ITS WORKERS;

EXODUS: THE SOVIETS ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS BAGHDAD'S DEMAND FOR PAYMENT FOR 
TERMINATED CONTRACTS.

The Soviet Union on Wednesday welcomed Iraq's announcement that it will allow 
all 3,300 Soviet workers in the country to leave and expressed its willingness 
to discuss an Iraqi demand that compensation be paid for broken labor 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are going to be costs, we are prepared to bear those costs because we 
feel that the security and well-being of our citizens should come first," 
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly I. Churkin said. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, a Soviet diplomat said an IL-86 wide-body jetliner, which can carry 
as many as 400 passengers, is expected to arrive today to pick up the first of 
the homeward-bound Soviets, most of whom were employed in Iraq's oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday evening, more than 200 exit visas had been approved by Iraq's 
Interior Ministry for the departing Soviets, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision reportedly taken by Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council to allow 
the Soviet exodus was explained Tuesday by a government spokesman in Baghdad as 
an attempt to stop the Soviet Union from making "deals" to secure the safety of 
its nationals. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, along with the United States, voted last week in the U.N. Security 
Council to authorize the use of military force if Iraq does not withdraw from 
Kuwait, and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned that the Kremlin 
would send troops to the region if Soviet citizens in Iraq were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Americans, Western Europeans and Japanese detained in Iraq, several 
hundred of whom have been positioned as "human shields" at strategic locations, 
Soviet nationals have not been held as hostages. But like other foreigners, 
they were barred from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
During the last visit by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to Moscow, Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev insisted on the immediate return of the workers. 
Therefore, Churkin told a government news briefing, word of Iraq's decision 
evoked satisfaction in Moscow. Officials had initially reacted Tuesday with 
skepticism and caution. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union "proceeds from the fact that our people can now leave Iraq and 
return home without hindrance," Churkin said, reading from a Foreign Ministry 
statement. He expressed hope that Iraq's "political assurances" will not remain 
mere words but will be translated into action. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet spokesman moved to play down speculation that his country might 
moderate its position on the Persian Gulf crisis in exchange for the safe 
return of its citizens, saying, "Our attitude will not change at all." 
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein's government had previously refused to let key foreign 
personnel leave until they had completed their contracts, but it regarded 
recent Soviet actions and expressions of concern about the Soviet workers as 
tantamount to threats. 
</P>
<P>
One point of uncertainty remained, however. According to the Iraqi News 
Agency's announcement Tuesday, the Soviet workers will be free to go as soon as 
Moscow agrees to compensate Iraq for the early termination of their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement read by Churkin makes no reference to such a 
deal having been made, however. Churkin said only that Moscow is willing to 
discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet representatives are prepared to resolve those questions in Baghdad," he 
said. It was not immediately clear whether the Iraqis would consider that 
sufficient. Churkin also said he did not know how much the compensation might 
be.

BUSH DENIES IRAQI TALKS SIGNAL A DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: PRESIDENT GIVES BAGHDAD'S AMBASSADOR THE COLD SHOULDER AT RECEPTION IN 
BUENOS AIRES.

President Bush said emphatically Wednesday that the coming U.S.-Iraqi talks, to 
which Iraq now has given formal approval, do not "have anything to do with 
concessions" on the demand that Iraqi forces withdraw unconditionally from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
With reports from the Middle East suggesting that a deal may be in the works, 
Bush said he sees no reason for optimism. He said he knows nothing of one 
report in particular -- that Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait and that the emir 
of Kuwait would return to power if Iraq is given improved access to the Persian 
Gulf and control of a disputed oil field on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
Another report, from Cable News Network, said an Iraqi official had said that 
in the coming talks, all issues will be on the table. Asked if this suggests a 
softening in Iraq's position, Bush replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not optimistic. I see no evidence that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein is 
ready to comply fully without condition to the U.N. resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
The resolutions, passed by the U.N. Security Council during the four months 
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, call for a total, unconditional 
withdrawal. They authorize economic sanctions to exert pressure on Iraq, as 
well as the use of force, if necessary, after Jan. 15, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
With U.S. and Iraqi officials preparing for the face-to-face meetings, the 
President said, "I don't view these talks as having anything to do about 
concessions that stop short of full implementation of the U.N. Security Council 
resolutions." Bush has invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to Washington 
and has agreed to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad to meet 
with Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq said unofficially Saturday that it will take part in the talks. But 
Washington received no formal acceptance until Wednesday, when the State 
Department announced that it has been told officially that Aziz will go to 
Washington and that Hussein will receive Baker in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke at a news conference at Casa Rosada, the presidential palace in 
Buenos Aires, with Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem at his side. Bush is 
making a weeklong visit to Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Venezuela and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
During a reception for diplomats at Casa Rosada, Bush responded coldly to 
Iraq's ambassador to Argentina, Sahib Hussain Tahir. Bush exchanged a few words 
with each of the other ambassadors to whom he was introduced, but as the Iraqi 
approached, the President gave him a stern look, shook hands with him briefly 
and said nothing beyond "hello." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's approach to the question of negotiations reflected what has been his 
policy throughout the crisis -- that he will not negotiate over the occupation 
of Kuwait. But with the U.S.-Iraqi talks approaching, and the Jan. 15 date 
looming, questions about paths to possible solutions have been given renewed 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday in Uruguay, Bush insisted that he is not in a "negotiating mood." 
</P>
<P>
Discouraging the continued speculation that the meetings might open the way to 
an agreement that would end the confrontation between Iraqi troops and an 
allied force led by the still-growing contingent of 240,000 U.S. troops, Bush 
said Wednesday that the talks will be "confined by, or put it this way, 
mandated by the United Nations Security Council resolutions, period." 
</P>
<P>
The President also scoffed at suggestions that Hussein should be given some way 
to "save face" in a withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
"When naked aggression takes place, it's not a question of finding face for the 
aggressor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was also asked what the United States has done for Argentina in exchange 
for Argentina's decision to send a destroyer and a frigate to join the 
international force arrayed against Iraq.

Iraq formally accepted President Bush's proposal for top-level talks, with Bush 
to meet Iraq's foreign minister in Washington and Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III to meet with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein warned that the United States should come to negotiate, not "like a 
policeman delivering an order." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, however, said his mission will be to outline the choices: Withdraw from 
Kuwait or "risk disaster." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said he's "not optimistic" that the talks will resolve the 
crisis.

Soviet soldiers on Wednesday unloaded an emergency food shipment of Israeli 
watermelons, tomatoes and oranges that Israeli leaders say is a gesture of 
thanks for allowing thousands of Soviet Jews to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops shook hands with Israelis on the airport tarmac after 10 tons of 
produce was unloaded from an Israeli passenger plane. 
</P>
<P>
The shipment, destined for a Moscow hospital, was organized by the 
quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which helps settle Jewish immigrants in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 767 of the national carrier, El Al, then returned to Tel Aviv via 
Bucharest, Romania, where it picked up another cargo of 250 Soviet Jewish 
immigrants bound for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
A record number of 150,000 Jews from the Soviet Union have arrived in Israel 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The food shipment is a gesture of gratitude to the Soviet government for 
permitting Jews to return to their homeland," said Jewish Agency spokesman 
Yehuda Weinraub.

Rep. Edolphus (Ed) Towns, a liberal Democrat from Brooklyn, N. Y., on Wednesday 
was elected chairman of the Black Caucus for the 102nd Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"It's official. 
</P>
<P>
You can give me your condolences," Towns joked after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
He will succeed Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley). 
</P>
<P>
Towns, 56, elected to a fifth term in the House last month, said the caucus 
will meet early in the new session and discuss its goals. 
</P>
<P>
"The civil rights bill will be something we will push very hard very early in 
the Congress," he said. The bill was defeated this year when the Senate fell 
one vote short of overriding President Bush's veto. 
</P>
<P>
Towns noted that the caucus will have 26 members next year, the most since it 
was founded in 1970. In addition, it will have its first Republican 
representative: Gary Franks of Connecticut.

PANEL WOULD LIST SECOND-HAND SMOKE AS CARCINOGEN 
</P>

Second-hand cigarette smoke should be declared a known cause of lung cancer and 
workplace smoking policies should reflect that hazard, according to a panel of 
scientists that concurred Wednesday with two Environmental Protection Agency 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
The professional advisory board agreed with a draft EPA report which concluded 
that cigarette smoke causes 3,800 lung cancer cases a year in nonsmokers. In 
fact, the panel said, the EPA had understated the dangers of respiratory 
illness among children whose parents smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific board's approval gives credibility and backing to future efforts 
by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- the federal agency with 
the power to regulate smoking in workplaces -- to ban or restrict smoking in 
businesses and offices. 
</P>
<P>
"OSHA regulates hazards in the workplace, and that would include whatever 
impact smoking has," OSHA spokesman Doug Fuller said. The agency is currently 
gathering data in preparation for issuing regulations on indoor air quality, 
Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, the evidence suggests there is more risk than previously 
thought," said Morton Lippmann, chairman of the 16-member advisory board asked 
by the EPA to review its conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, he cited the dangers to children and said that the EPA 
should try to determine whether parts of the human body other than the lungs 
are affected by passive smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry criticized the EPA draft report. Brennan Dawson, vice 
president of the Tobacco Institute, charged that the EPA data is incomplete as 
well as unreliable because the studies involved did not show enough association 
between cancer in nonsmokers and second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The American Lung Assn., American Cancer Society and American Heart Assn. all 
declared Wednesday's statement a victory and predicted a spate of state laws 
restricting smoking in public and private workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Du Melle, chairman of the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, predicted that 
the board's support will spur more states to develop smoking restrictions in 
workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition plans to push for state requirements that day-care centers be 
smoke-free in light of the long-lasting affects of second-hand smoke on 
children.

ANOTHER JET CATCHES FIRE AT DETROIT AS PROBE CONTINUES; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: BLAZE ON THE WING OF A NORTHWEST PLANE IS PUT OUT QUICKLY AND NO ONE 
IS INJURED. THE CAUSE OF MONDAY'S FATAL COLLISION HAS STILL TO BE PINPOINTED.

<P>
As federal investigators continued to study Monday's fatal runway collision of 
two passenger jets, a small fire erupted on the wing of another Northwest 
Airlines jetliner Wednesday morning at Detroit's Metropolitan Airport. The 
blaze was quickly extinguished and there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is conducting the investigation 
of the collision that occurred in dense fog and killed eight persons and 
injured 21, said it was still too early to pinpoint the cause of Monday's 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
However, evidence indicates that one of the planes got lost in the fog and 
strayed into the path of the other, which was speeding down a runway on a 
takeoff run. 
</P>
<P>
The new incident Wednesday occurred at about 6 a.m. as Northwest Flight 582, a 
Boeing 727 heading from Seattle to Newark, N.J., was taxiing toward a terminal 
gate during an interim stop here. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest spokeswoman Christie Clapp said residual fuel in an auxiliary power 
unit apparently ignited, starting a blaze in the plane's right wing. 
</P>
<P>
Ground crews snuffed out the flames at the gate, and Wayne County fire crews 
lathered the plane with foam to prevent any flare-ups. 
</P>
<P>
The 69 passengers and 6 crew members used normal exits to leave the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's incident occurred less than 48 hours after Northwest Flight 1482, a 
DC-9 bound for Pittsburgh, Pa., with 40 passengers and a crew of 4, lost its 
way while taxiing across the airport in the fog. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial transcripts of conversations between the cockpit crews and air 
traffic controllers show that when the tower asked the DC-9 where it was, the 
co-pilot said he wasn't sure, but it "looks like we're on (Runway) 21-Center." 
</P>
<P>
The controller then said to "exit the runway immediately, sir." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, William Lovelace, told investigators he never heard his co-pilot, 
James Schifferns, report that they had strayed onto the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Lovelace, who was steering the aircraft, said that had he realized that, he 
would have "gone for the weeds" immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Controllers in the airport tower said that when they heard Schifferns' report 
that he might be on the active runway, the tower supervisor shouted an order to 
"Stop all aircraft!" 
</P>
<P>
But the controller handling the runway traffic said it was too late -- that 
moments earlier he had cleared Northwest Flight 299, a Boeing 727 heading for 
Memphis with 153 aboard, to begin its takeoff run. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, the two planes collided. 
</P>
<P>
The 727 sustained little damage, and none of those aboard were injured. But the 
DC-9 caught fire, and the Wayne County coroner's office said Wednesday that the 
eight who died succumbed to burns, impact injuries and toxic fumes from the 
inferno that swept through the cabin of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the dead were passengers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Ellen Blankenship, 37, a mother of two from Windsor, Ont., who was the 
general manager of information systems for the H. J. Heinz Co. of Canada, Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mauro Bottigliome, 23, a native of Caracas, Venezuela, who had been working 
in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kingsley A. Brown, 30, of Pittsburgh, where he served as a management 
consultant for McKinsey &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Burke, 30, of Houston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thomas Kopriva, 50, of Germantown, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Daniel Loughnane, 44, of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred Zitto, 59, of Germantown. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth fatality was Heidi Joost, 43, of Dearborn, Mich., who had served as 
a flight attendant with Northwest for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
John Lauber, the NTSB member heading the investigation of Monday's accident, 
said runway and taxiway lights and identifying signs were being studied 
Wednesday to determine if they might have contributed to the confusion of the 
DC-9 crew. Records indicate that pilots have complained of confusion in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Airport is not equipped with ground radar, and controllers must 
rely on pilots' position reports when visibility is too restricted to see 
aircraft on the ground. That was the case on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lauber said reports indicate the fog conditions were fluctuating rapidly at the 
time of Monday's accident, but National Weather Service records indicate that 
visibility was one-fourth of a mile -- the minimum required for takeoffs -- 
both immediately before and after the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest says all the crew members in Monday's accident were highly competent 
and fully qualified, but questions have been raised as to whether the DC-9 crew 
was adequately experienced -- individually or in tandem -- to handle Monday's 
difficult weather conditions at Metropolitan Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Lovelace, 52, the captain, has 20,000 hours of experience as a pilot. However, 
Monday's flight was only the 13th time he had been at the controls of a 
Northwest jet since returning from a five-year medical leave for kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
Co-pilot Schifferns, 43, had only 150 hours' experience as a Northwest pilot 
after a 20-year career as an Air Force pilot and flight instructor.

THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF NORMAN COUSINS 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Depressed over a recurrence of breast cancer, Flo Porter picked up the 
telephone one day in 1980 and called Norman Cousins. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised that he had a listed phone number," the Los Angeles woman 
recalled. "I told him I was 36. I had just had a mastectomy. I had two small 
children, and I was fearful of dying." 
</P>
<P>
Cousins invited her to his house. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked me in the eye and gave me his undivided attention," Porter said of 
their one-hour meeting. "He emphasized that it was important to have a good 
attitude; that it didn't matter what the statistics were on my chances to live. 
It changed my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
Cousins' ability to promote healthy attitudes in the face of sickness is now 
legend. He died of heart failure at the age of 75 Friday at a hotel in Westwood 
where he had gone to meet a friend for tea. 
</P>
<P>
While health experts had long suspected that negative emotions seemed to cause 
patients to fare worse, Cousins pondered the flip side of that relationship for 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He came here already convinced that if negative feelings made it harder -- 
something that had been known pragmatically for 2,000 years but only recently 
documented -- then positive attitudes and feelings should improve your chances 
of coping with illness," said Dr. L.J. West, a professor of psychiatry and 
bio-behavioral science who helped recruit Cousins for UCLA in 1978 as an 
adjunct professor. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't just thinking of survival rates but of improving the quality of life 
for people with illness." 
</P>
<P>
While Cousins did not invent the idea that emotions can influence health, he 
popularized the concept for patients worldwide and rallied scientists who saw 
credibility in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"In a certain way, he legitimized it," said Dr. Michael S. Goldstein, chairman 
of the department of community health sciences at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the field has a name -- psychoneuroimmunology, the study of how 
psychological factors, the brain and the immune system interact to influence 
health. Although it's an area of growing scientific interest, some health 
experts remain unconvinced of an association between attitude and health. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the evidence for it is growing," said Dr. David Spiegel, an 
associate professor of psychiatry and bio-behavioral science at Stanford 
University. "But there are major bodies of evidence that are ignored by medical 
community," such as studies that show elderly people with strong social 
relationships live longer than people the same age without social support. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins believed in the concept first and pursued scientific validation of it 
later. 
</P>
<P>
A journalist and longtime editor of Saturday Review, Cousins began his hunt for 
a way to cope with illness when he was stricken with a crippling disease in 
1964. He sought conventional medical treatment for the ailment, a degeneration 
of the connective tissues in his body, but soon decided what he needed most was 
to be cheered up. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong prankster and humorist, Cousins spent hours each day watching funny 
TV and movie clips. He also began taking Vitamin C in large amounts. Within a 
few months, his symptoms began to recede and he returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by his recovery, Cousins, who was highly regarded in the publishing 
world for his sharp intellect and humanitarianism, also took his message to a 
large audience of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
"I was greatly elated by the discovery that there is a physiological basis for 
the ancient theory that laughter is good medicine," Cousins wrote in an 
article, "Anatomy of an Illness (as Perceived by the Patient)," published in 
the Dec. 23, 1976, New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The article became the basis for the first of 25 books Cousins wrote on 
emotions and healing and led to his appointment to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins' 1983 book, "The Healing Heart: Antidotes to Panic and Helplessness" 
(Norton), followed his recovery from a heart attack. His last book was "Head 
First: The Biology of Hope" (1989, Dutton). 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, Cousins was ubiquitous. He wrote, lectured before medical students, 
assisted in clinical research and worked furiously to raise funds for basic 
research in immunology. 
</P>
<P>
"Here was a man of 65 who had retired from publishing," West said. "We thought 
he would teach and write and would be a delightful and valuable scholarly 
person to have on the faculty. We never reckoned that he would also be a demon 
fund-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
But Cousins had the greatest impact on individuals struggling with illness. He 
promoted a positive attitude and encouraged patients to participate with their 
physicians in the treatment of illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Norman was the first one to really expound . . . on the fact that the 
individual could play an important part in the fight for recovery along with 
his or her physician," said Harold Benjamin, founder of the string of 
nationwide Wellness Community centers, which provide support groups, counseling 
and informational resources to cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
"He also constantly spoke to physicians and health-care professionals about 
their obligations to deal with people as human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Cousins was the honorary chairman of the Wellness Community and often delivered 
the keynote address at the opening of a new center, speaking with a kind of 
energy and sincerity that sent hopes soaring, Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an inspiration. When he came to the Wellness Community to speak to our 
people, he changed their lives. They saw a man who himself had been afflicted 
by a life-threatening illness and who had come through it. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was not a guru-like hope" that Cousins engendered, Benjamin said. "It 
was a hope based on thoughtful, well-considered knowledge of the psychology and 
the physiology." 
</P>
<P>
But Cousins' message also irritated some. To some physicians, it appeared that 
he was promoting something that had not yet been scientifically proven. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the publication of his book "Anatomy of an Illness" (1979, 
Norton), Cousins was criticized for suggesting that laughter could cure 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
"He would say that is absurd," Benjamin said. "What he did say is that pleasant 
emotions enhance physical well-being: laughter, love, success, camaraderie are 
all pleasant emotions. The more we can get of them, the better off we are." 
</P>
<P>
Cousins never espoused forsaking conventional medical treatment, another 
criticism that was sometimes pinned on him, Benjamin said. Instead, he 
encouraged patients to enhance their treatment with psychoneuroimmunological 
techniques, such as guided imagery, a process in which a cancer patient, for 
example, might imagine medication destroying cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
While Cousins was eventually able to distance himself from the laughter 
anecdote, he remained concerned that his messages would be misconstrued or 
simplified. Some critics charged that by suggesting an individual could have an 
influence on his or her own health, Cousins was placing "the burden of cure" on 
the patients with incurable illnesses and a burden of shame on them should the 
techniques fail. 
</P>
<P>
"This was never like what he had in mind," West said. "What he did try to tell 
them was that there is an important relationship between mind and body. 
Everyone has to die sooner or later, but the important thing is how you live 
and to get the most out of life." 
</P>
<P>
Medical professionals who listened closely to Cousins, said West, "could hardly 
argue with his message, no matter how conservative they were." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Cousins relished the opportunity to participate in clinical research 
that tested the relationship between emotions and health. He readily admitted 
that his own cure from disease did not prove anything scientifically. And 
although he had no formal science training (he did, eventually, receive an 
honorary medical degree from Yale University School of Medicine), Cousins 
delved into research and devoured complex information. 
</P>
<P>
During his first few months at UCLA, West said: "I pointed out to him if he 
wants to convince physicians about something, the anecdotal method is not 
enough (even though) he knew you could learn a lot from single cases and can 
extrapolate to others. It was not long before I was able to provide him with 
opportunities to show him how studies can work in clinical research. He 
embraced that and went beyond it." 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, Cousins assisted with a study that explored the effects of positive 
emotions on 75 patients with malignant melanoma. All the patients received the 
same medical treatment, but half also received information and counseling to 
promote emotional well-being. Researchers then studied the patients' level of 
depression and level of interleukin cells, a measure of the body's natural 
defense against disease. 
</P>
<P>
By the third month, the patients receiving emotional support showed less 
depression and increased interleukin levels, while the control group subjects 
became slightly more depressed and had no increase in interleukin. 
</P>
<P>
In similar work, Spiegel has shown that women with metastasized breast cancer 
who received counseling on coping and emotional well-being lived an average of 
18 months longer than those who did not receive the psychological therapy. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institutes of Mental Health recently granted Spiegel $1.5 million 
to repeat his study on breast cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a few years ago a proposal like that would have been laughed out of 
the study section," Spiegel said of the board that selects projects for 
funding. "People are now saying, 'OK, it's a fair question. Lets study it 
impartially.' " 
</P>
<P>
Other studies, however, have contradicted these findings, and relatively few 
specifics are known about how emotions might influence health, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be a lot of differences of opinion on that," he said. "There is a 
lot of disagreement about those pathways (of influence)." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, a positive state of mind might trigger some action in 
the immune system to fight disease. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said: "Maybe your state of mind leads you to do things 
that help. Perhaps happier people run more or happier people don't smoke." 
</P>
<P>
It is also unclear whether attitude and emotions can have a greater effect on 
preventing disease than on curing disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The many outstanding questions only motivated Cousins to raise more money for 
research and advocate more study, his colleagues say. His cheerleading cast a 
sense of value and urgency on the field.

MAGAZINES / BOB SIPCHEN: HOW MANY BODIES IN MIDEAST WAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many American soldiers are likely to die if a ground war breaks out in the 
Middle East? 
</P>
<P>
1,200? 
</P>
<P>
20,000? 
</P>
<P>
32,000? 
</P>
<P>
48,000? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, each of those figures has been presented as a reasonable estimate of 
American casualties in a one-month ground war in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But if you haven't heard those figures, you're not alone. According to an 
article in the December Washington Monthly, the American media have been remiss 
-- at least until recently -- in asking basic questions about Operation Desert 
Shield, such as, "How many Americans are likely to be killed?" and, "How many 
American deaths are justified in stopping Saddam Hussein?" 
</P>
<P>
This apparent phobia about figures dates back to the moment Hussein invaded 
Kuwait, Washington Monthly editor James Bennet writes in "How They Missed That 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the first days of the crisis, the notion of sending any troops, let 
alone the more than 400,000 now predicted to be deployed in the Mideast by 
year's end, seemed virtually unthinkable. In fact, the four news outlets the 
monthly has tracked since the invasion -- ABC's "Nightline," with Ted Koppel, 
the Washington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times -- all quoted 
sources who dismissed out-of-hand the idea of deploying American troops to 
fight a ground war. 
</P>
<P>
As rumors of possible troop deployment began to leak, rising from an initial 
ceiling of 50,000 to 100,000 to 250,000, the press continued to print official 
denials, Bennet reports. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 10, the New York Times quoted "one of the handful of a senior policy 
planners in the administration," who called the last figure "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
An Aug. 11 editorial in the Los Angeles Times -- the monthly gives this paper 
better marks than the other media surveyed, but is nevertheless critical of The 
Times' coverage of potential casualties -- called the suggestion of 250,000 
troops being sent to Saudi Arabia "mind-boggling." The Times editorial 
predicted: "Hundreds of Thousands of American fighting men are not going to be 
put into the ferociously hostile environment of Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the deployment did occur. But, according to Bennet, the same media 
that had at first reported why economic sanctions alone, or a naval blockade, 
or at most a massive air strike were the best options for resolving the crisis, 
failed to seriously question the wisdom of the rapidly escalating troop 
buildup. Nor did they adequately discuss potential casualties. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a Brookings Institution analyst presented on Sept. 5 a model 
suggesting that American and Saudi forces would suffer 32,000 to 48,000 
casualties in a war lasting just one month, but only the Los Angeles Times 
reported it -- and then on page 6. 
</P>
<P>
John Mueller, the author of "War, Presidents, and Public Opinion," is quoted in 
the monthly piece as saying that support for Presidents eroded as casualties 
mounted in Korea and Vietnam. If 20,000 soldiers were killed in the Middle 
East, it would be "catastrophic," he says. "That would be vastly more than were 
suffered in Korea in the first year. . . . I can even imagine impeachment." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Bennet points out, even now no pollster has asked the blunt question: "Is 
it worth 20,000 to 30,000 casualties to get Hussein?" 
</P>
<P>
As testimony on Capitol Hill increases, more publications are focusing on 
Bush's policies in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In its Dec. 10 cover story, Time attempts to paint a picture of "What War Would 
Be Like." But even at this late date, the weekly seems reluctant to discuss the 
potential body count. 
</P>
<P>
In the main essay, oddly titled "If War Begins," the magazine states that in 
the first days of war, "100 or more lost U.S. aircraft would be a fair 
estimate." It also quotes analysts who "figure the U.S. must anticipate the 
destruction of 100 to 200 tanks, each with a four-man crew and an equal number 
of Bradley Fighting vehicles, each carrying a dozen solders." 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't until the penultimate paragraph that an actual estimate of U.S. 
casualties is quoted: 1,200 to 3,000 dead and 7,000 to 16,000 wounded in the 
first 10 days of fighting. And that figure, from a retired colonel, seems 
optimistic, given that in the previous paragraph British officers say they 
would expect to lose 2,000 soldiers from their relatively tiny force of 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Media reluctance to focus on this gruesome topic may be spurred by fears of 
being labeled unpatriotic. In another Time article in the package, for example, 
special correspondent Michael Kramer writes: " . . . Baghdad undoubtedly took 
further comfort from the parade of skeptics counseling delay before (Georgia 
Sen.) Sam Nunn's Senate Armed Services Committee last week." 
</P>
<P>
But patriotism and quiescence do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. The problem, 
as Bennet sees it, is not so much in President Bush's policy per se, but rather 
in the suspect manner in which the decisions about the crisis have been made 
and presented to the American people. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to oppose the American troop deployment in the Middle East to 
worry about the singular absence of public debate -- in the House and Senate, 
in the major papers, on TV -- during those first few weeks," Bennet writes. 
"You just have to believe that good debate makes good policy." 
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
The human inhabitants of Botswana's Kalahari desert call that vast expanse "the 
great thirstland." For an animals' eye perspective of this magnificent turf, 
turn to photographer Frans Lanting's work in the December National Geographic. 
Some of his images -- the bullfrog staring out from a huge rainwater pond, the 
drinking impalas -- are charming. Some -- the skinned Zebra, the snacking 
crocodiles and lions -- are gruesome. But they are all captivating.

HARBOR LIGHTS AND HOLIDAY PARADES; 
</P>
<P>
BOATS: THE CHRISTMAS PROCESSIONS HAVE BECOME A TRADITION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
-- FROM MORRO BAY TO DANA POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
Irving Fisher gets into the holiday spirit each year by putting a few lights on 
the 47-foot sailboat Double Coupon that he moors in Marina del Rey . . . a few 
thousand lights, that is. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000 lights are encased in plastic tubing, which makes it easier for 
Fisher, his wife, Lil, and their crew of 29 family members and friends to 
string them up. 
</P>
<P>
But the lights, powered by an 8,000-watt generator, are just the beginning. 
Next come the props and the rented costumes. After a week of planning, the 
actual decorating takes as much as two days. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got it down to a science now," says Fisher, 64, who has been 
participating in boat parades for more than a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
And when the boat is fully decorated, Fisher enters it in the Marina del Rey 
Christmas Boat Parade, hoping to win one or more of the many prizes given to 
the most impressive boats. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas boat parades have become a popular tradition in Southern California. 
Almost every harbor holds one in December and all are open to public viewing. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of lighted boat parades came to Southern California in 1908. An 
Italian gondolier in Newport Beach and some of his fellow small-boat operators 
piloted a gondola and eight canoes, all lit with Japanese lanterns, into the 
harbor to celebrate the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
The summer parades were canceled in 1949 because of the traffic congestion they 
caused. But the parades in Newport surfaced again years later, this time during 
the winter holidays. Today, the Newport Beach parade is one of the largest with 
as many as 200 boats participating. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the Newport Beach parade has helped spawn others. When Marina 
del Rey harbor was created, some people who had been mooring their boats in 
Newport moved to the new marina and the parade tradition moved with them, 
according to Marina del Rey parade spokeswoman Willie Hjorth. Marina del Rey is 
holding its 28th annual parade this year, and regularly draws up to 75,000 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the boat parades are one-night affairs, many drift into a second 
night, and Newport Beach stretches the celebration over seven consecutive 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
The decorations also vary. Some boaters, happy just to participate, will simply 
string up some lights and treat the parade as a good excuse to throw a party. 
Others, like Irving Fisher, who lives in Sherman Oaks, strive to create a 
stunning visual effect in an effort to capture a prize. After winning the 
Marina del Rey parade sweepstakes award in 1965 and 1987, for example, Fisher 
won a yet another award last year by setting up a mock film set on the front of 
his boat while a woman played an electronic organ in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher says that by using the same lights each year, he doesn't go overboard on 
decoration expenses. But some corporate entries will spend thousands of dollars 
hiring to create an extraordinary floating entry, says Hjorth. 
</P>
<P>
You can watch boat parades from just about anywhere. Prime viewing may be from 
a blanket on the grass at Burton Chace Park in Marina del Rey to grandstand 
seating in Newport Beach. In Dana Point, spectators even buy tickets to ride on 
a parade boat. 
</P>
<P>
But wherever you watch from, be sure to arrive a good while before the boats 
sail. Parking on land is at a premium. Here is a roundup of upcoming holiday 
boat parades: 
</P>
<P>
* Morro Bay -- The 34th annual parade begins at 7 p.m. Sunday. The procession 
of about 30 boats will start from Tidelands Park and proceed along the 
Embarcadero waterfront to Target Rock, and back. Best viewing is anywhere along 
the waterfront. Organized by the Morro Bay Recreation and Parks Department, 
Morro Bay Harbor Department, and Morro Bay Yacht Club. Information: (805) 
772-1214. 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Barbara -- About 60 boats are expected in the fifth annual parade Dec. 
16, 6 to 8 p.m. The boats will parade down the coast, east of the harbor, and 
then back to Stearn's Wharf. The east side of Cabrillo Boulevard and Stearn's 
Wharf are among the best viewing spots. Information: (805) 969-5217 or 
564-5519. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
* Oxnard -- Limited to 40 boats, the 25th annual Parade of Lights in Channel 
Islands Harbor starts at 7 p.m. Saturday. The boats circle the harbor at least 
twice with Santa Claus as grand marshal. A good place for spectators is the 
promenade in front of the Harbor Landing shopping center or anywhere on the 
west bank, off of Harbor Boulevard. Information: (805) 984-3366. 
</P>
<P>
* Marina del Rey -- Television producer David ("Roots") Wolper will serve as 
the grand marshal of the parade, set for 5:30 p.m. Saturday. A group of 
small-boat owners called the Pioneer Skippers Boat Owners Assn. organizes the 
120-boat procession in the marina's main channel. Best public viewing areas are 
at the north and south jetties (accessible from Pacific Avenue and Vista del 
Mar, respectively), Burton Chace Park on Mindanao, Fisherman's Village on Fiji 
Way, and Aubrey Austin Park at the end of Via Marina.

QUOTES FROM COUSINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norman Cousins was disturbed that his use of laughter as a metaphor for 
positive emotions might be oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to think they can make any problem disappear just by 
ha-ha-ha-ing it away." 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized that a good attitude could improve the life of someone coping 
with disease, even if it couldn't cure disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is what we do while we're alive. The great tragedy of 
life is not death, but what dies inside us while we live." 
</P>
<P>
 Cousins implored physicians to consider the patient's emotional state and 
promote an optimistic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you treat just the disease without treating the emotional devastation 
caused by the disease, you're only treating half a patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Cousins chided Americans for being overly concerned with their weaknesses and 
downplaying their strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are becoming a nation of sissies and hypochondriacs, a self-medicating 
society easily intimidated by pain and prone to panic. We understand almost 
nothing about the essential robustness of the human body or its ability to meet 
the challenge of illness."

'PRETTY WOMAN' STILL A KNOCKOUT

That was quick. "Total Recall" was just on top of the Billboard magazine rental 
chart for one week. "Pretty Woman" moved back to the top after a week at No. 2. 
But it may not reign too long, since the competition from all those macho 
action movies is pretty stiff. Still, "Pretty Woman," the only movie in the Top 
10 with strong appeal to female renters, is striking a blow for the power of 
women -- and romance -- in the rental market. "Bird on a Wire," featuring Mel 
Gibson and Goldie Hawn, moved up four notches to No. 5. Brimming with No. 1 
potential, "Bird" may not be strong enough to breeze past this crop of 
contenders. "Cadillac Man," starring Robin Williams, is off to a fast start -- 
cruising up to No. 8 in just two weeks. "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (No. 7) 
is causing a lot of talk within the industry because some video stores are low 
on rental copies due to fanatical fans buying them up -- even at the $90 price 
tag. With the title on moratorium, new copies aren't available. 
</P>
<P>
* "Another 48 HRS.," starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, is another of last 
summer's movies that was expected to crack the $100-million mark at the box 
office but didn't. It settled for a "paltry" $80 million. But Murphy is such a 
big name in the rental market that this one -- No. 6 after two weeks -- has a 
good shot at the top spot.

MARKET CHANGES FOR ANIMATION ART CELS; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTIONS: RECENT L.A. AND N.Y. SALES SHOW TOP PRICES FALLING BUT THERE IS A 
HIKE IN MID-PRICE PURCHASES. 
</P>

<P>
Recent auctions of artwork from animated films in Los Angeles and New York City 
indicate that top prices are falling but that the number of buyers for 
mid-priced works is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, at an auction at the Burbank Hilton, the highest prices were paid 
for three cel and background set-ups from Disney features: Snow White kissing 
Dopey goodby at the end of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) brought 
$22,000, well within its pre-sale estimate of $20,000 to $30,000; Cinderella 
surrounded by the mice from the 1950 film sold for $19,800, slightly below the 
estimate of $20,000 to $30,000; and Bambi standing in a snow bank from the 1942 
film fetched $15,950, somewhat above its estimated price of $9,000 to $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
All but 20 of the 271 lots sold, for a total of $509,630. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank sale followed the pattern set at a Nov. 28 auction at Christie's 
East in New York, with the exception of gaveled prices versus estimates. A cel 
and background of Alice talking with the Caterpillar from the 1951 Walt Disney 
feature "Alice in Wonderland," sold for $82,500, twice the pre-sale estimate of 
$30,000 to $40,000. A cel and background set-up of Mickey and Minnie Mouse from 
the 1935 short "On Ice" brought $46,200 -- eight times its estimate of $5,000 
to $7,000, but a set-up of Mickey leading the musicians from the 1935 classic 
cartoon "The Band Concert" sold for $55,000, matching the presale estimate of 
$50,000 to $60,000. Of the 349 lots offered, more than 80% found buyers, for a 
sale total of $1,035,925. 
</P>
<P>
The sale prices represent a substantial decline from May, 1988, when a buyer at 
Christie's paid $286,000 and $181,500 for two cel and background set-ups from 
the 1934 black-and-white Disney cartoon "Orphan's Benefit." 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting good, strong prices in all areas of the market," said Joshua 
Arfer, director of animation and collectibles at Christie's. "Some prices might 
have been exceptionally high in the past because certain collectors were 
willing to go higher to get certain items for their collections, but we started 
getting more realistic prices about a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
"More people are moving into the middle ground," said dealer Howard Lowery, who 
conducted Monday night's auction. "They start out with pieces that may sell for 
a few hundred dollars, then, as they become more knowledgeable, they expand 
their collections with pieces in the $2,000-to-$5,000 range. I think Monday 
night's sale indicates that despite bad news and a leveling off in prices, 
people want to continue building collections of animation art." 
</P>
<P>
Other sales scheduled: On Wednesday, Lowery's Burbank gallery will host the 
first American exhibit and sale of artwork from the Will Vinton Studio, the 
creators of the commercials featuring the animated clay figures of the 
California Raisins. The exhibition will include cels from the Saturday-morning 
television series starring the Raisins ($70 to $240), limited-edition 
sculptures ($890 to $2,950) and clay figures that appeared in some of Vinton's 
films ($2,500 to $10,000). 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 15, Sotheby's will auction 283 lots of cels and backgrounds from the 
1989 Disney hit "The Little Mermaid" in New York. Estimated prices range from 
$1,000 to $1,500 for images of the minor characters, Scuttle and Flounder, to 
$10,000 to $15,000 for a three-cel and background set-up of Eric and Ariel 
driving through the forest.

CRITIC AT LARGE: ANJELICA HUSTON: THE TRIUMPHS OF A LATE-BLOOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is now customary but true to say that Anjelica Huston lived for years in the 
large shadows of two men: her powerful father, John Huston, and her companion 
for 17 years, Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
Her father had, with kind intentions, cast her at age 15 as the co-star of "A 
Walk With Love and Death." It was too much too soon. The film failed badly and 
the critical pummeling she received was enough to make professional dog-walking 
seem an attractive career alternative. But she gamely worked in the theater to 
restore her confidence, understudying Ophelia in a production of "Hamlet" in 
London, where she appeared, and New York, where she didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was pretty enough to be a movie actress," she said at lunch a 
few days ago. "I didn't want to be the subject of a critical onslaught again. 
I'd been humiliated by all of that. It would've been a mistake to do anything 
else at the time, although it might've been different if Maerose had come along 
then," she added with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
(She prays that Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, Sofia, acting in "The 
Godfather Part III," will not inherit anything like the same critical 
targeting, simply or in any degree because she happens to be Coppola's child.) 
</P>
<P>
John Huston is gone, but not before he launched her extraordinary, 
late-blossoming career by casting her as Maerose, the don's tough daughter in 
"Prizzi's Honor." 
</P>
<P>
The long relationship with Nicholson terminated abruptly and permanently with 
the revelation that he had fathered a child with another woman. Anjelica Huston 
is on her own, and it isn't half bad. 
</P>
<P>
Her newest film, "The Grifters," directed by Stephen Frears from a novel by Jim 
Thompson and a script by Donald E. Westlake, opened Wednesday and Huston is 
again a revelation. Blond and haggard, she plays a tough survivor in a tough 
world, working the race tracks for a major bookie, keeping a distant eye on the 
son she bore illegitimately at 14, conning everybody as the first line of 
defense against being conned herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the film seven or eight times," Huston said, "and it was only at the 
end of a cast and crew screening the other night that I felt for the first time 
what a conniving woman Lily was. 'Ooh, what a dreadful woman,' I thought to 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
But, Huston said, that was the skill of the late novelist Jim Thompson: 
"finding the sympathy in unsympathetic people, humanizing the dark side." The 
film indeed offers three of the least sympathetic characters, plus some 
unappetizing side dishes, that you are apt to encounter. 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of Huston's work is that you come away with some understanding and 
a touch of pity, if nothing higher, for this woman who is both victim and 
victimizer, the conning and the conned, in a kind of endlessly repeating loop. 
</P>
<P>
Huston has by now developed a line in women who may be strong but who are as 
well loners and sometimes losers and who, always, are thoroughly realized 
individuals, comprehensible if not invariably sympathetic. When they are not 
particularly sympathetic, the characters earn a grudging and often amused 
admiration for their mastery of the arts of survival. Maerose Prizzi 
established a high standard and the beginnings of a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Dead," her father's beautifully melancholy last film, she was a woman 
living, it seemed, for the memory of a lover dead too young. She was a study in 
another kind of survival, the existence that outlives the life. 
</P>
<P>
She was yet another kind of loser in Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors," 
the mistress discarded and then murdered when her jangly, ever wilder 
importunings got out of hand. In Paul Mazursky's "Enemies, a Love Story," she 
was a survivor again, of the world at its genocidal worst. 
</P>
<P>
The "Enemies" role was hard, a long leap from the woman she was to the woman 
she was playing, accent and all. They rehearsed a month. "But I didn't know 
until the night before we filmed my meeting with Ron (Silver) just how I'd play 
it. The experience of Auschwitz can't be taken lightly, and I was scared of my 
gall in claiming it as my own." 
</P>
<P>
But then she made an obvious but not so obvious actor's perception: "You forget 
you don't have to provide everything. I was intimidated until I took the onus 
off myself. I let Ron carry it. I could look in his eyes and take it from him." 
</P>
<P>
Lily was difficult as well. "She's not necessarily someone everyone will love 
but she's a fantastic role, and that's what I care about. That's the fun." It 
was a hard shoot, a relatively short schedule and modest budget, done all on 
locations in workdays that were often 15 and 16 hours long. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a quality in Stephen's work," she said. "The scenery seems to fall 
away and his characters are right in your face. He seems so vague for someone 
who knows precisely what he wants to do. He's dumb like a fox." 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Huston had a development deal at Lorimar but decided it was not for 
her. "There's a pitfall. Actors tend to develop ideas around themselves, and 
that's not always the best way to go. And I realized that I like to be a tool, 
someone who can understand what the director wants, be an interpreter. When 
you're a producer, you're embroiled in things that aren't helpful to you as an 
actor." 
</P>
<P>
After the succession of critically celebrated roles that began with Maerose and 
has also included "Gardens of Stone," "A Handful of Dust," "Witches" and a fine 
cameo in television's "Lonesome Dove," Huston can pick her shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I can be in control of my own destiny," she said, "and that's what I've always 
wanted to be. I like to ask myself, 'Can I really do this? Can I fulfill this?' 
You try to stretch, and those are the parts that are the most satisfactory in 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
Presently she is acting in a film version of "The Addams Family," with Raul 
Julia, Judith Malina and Christopher Lloyd (from "Back to the Future") as 
Fester. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a romp," she said. "We are shooting for 16 weeks. It better be a romp."

CBS PUTS 'UNCLE BUCK' ON HOLD; NBC CANCELS 'WORKING IT OUT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
CBS has put "Uncle Buck" on indefinite hiatus and NBC has canceled its comedy 
"Working It Out," network and production company spokesmen confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC also said that it has ordered additional episodes of its first-season 
comedy series "The Fanelli Boys" and "American Dreamer," and that a "Dark 
Shadows" miniseries will air Jan. 13 and 14 as a precursor to a "Dark Shadows" 
prime-time series. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Conway, one of the executive producers of the CBS series "Guns of Paradise" 
-- formerly titled simply "Paradise" -- also confirmed that CBS will put the 
series back on the air sometime in January. Conway said that the Western series 
would return with a new title because "after two years, people still thought 
'Paradise' was a show starring Richard Chamberlain, set in Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Tim O'Donnell, an executive producer of "Uncle Buck," said that CBS has ordered 
a full season of 22 episodes of "Buck," and predicted that the show would 
return before February in a different time slot. He said both the producers and 
CBS agreed that the recent decision to move the show from its former 8 p.m 
Monday time slot to 8 p.m. Fridays -- trading slots with the Burt Reynolds 
comedy "Evening Shade" -- had hurt "Buck's" ratings, since the Friday slot pits 
the kid-oriented show against ABC's popular comedy "Full House." 
</P>
<P>
CBS did not say what will take "Uncle Buck's" place on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did NBC offer immediate word on what will replace "Working It Out," a 
comedy with Jane Curtin that had been airing Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. The show 
had suffered low ratings; last week it attracted only 13% of the available 
audience and ranked 71st among the week's 94 prime-time programs.

NURSE TO START HOME FOR KIDS WITH AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: CITY WILL SELL GRAFFITI-COVERED DUPLEX TO A WOMAN WHO RUNS SIMILAR

The City Council last week agreed to sell a 53-year-old nurse a 
graffiti-covered duplex that she wants to turn into a home for children with 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The city built the duplex with federal funds for low-income residents. But 
after prospective buyers inspected the building and its crime-infested block on 
Cerritos Avenue, only Yvonne Henderson made a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson told council she hopes to open the home to five children by this 
winter. She plans to purchase the $140,000 duplex with donations and wages she 
earns as a nurse. Henderson said she is working on an application for a state 
license to open the foster home. 
</P>
<P>
She runs another home, called Ebony Haus, where 10 men and women with AIDS 
live. Most of them are minorities and poor. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson sees a growing need for homes for children with AIDS. "These are the 
innocent little lives," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who is a grandmother, said she will find one aspect of the project 
for children particularly difficult. "It will be hard to watch the children 
go," she said. "But I tell myself, I can't play God. All I can do is try to 
make the children more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
More help is sorely needed, according to local doctors, social workers and AIDS 
activists. Currently, only one group foster home for children with AIDS 
operates in Los Angeles County. And Long Beach hospitals report a small but 
growing number of newborns infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
At least four infected babies were born to drug-addicted mothers at St. Mary 
Medical Center this year, according to Dr. Roger Takla, director of 
neonatology. They were sent to foster families. Previously, hospital staff only 
read about such cases, in cities such as New York. "It's everywhere now, even 
Long Beach," Takla said. 
</P>
<P>
A nurse with the city's biggest pediatric AIDS treatment program reports an 
"explosion" in the number of patients she sees. "In the last three months, 
we've picked up six babies, and that's just a small piece of what's to come," 
said Linda Siemers, coordinator of Memorial Miller Children's Pediatric HIV 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The program's caseload has grown from a couple of children a few years ago to 
about 35 now, Siemers said. Half of them live with foster families. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Audra Deveikis, head of the program at Miller, said that in the past, most 
pediatric victims were hemophiliacs who contracted the disease through 
transfusions of tainted blood. But the vast majority of recent cases have 
contracted AIDS from their mothers, who are drug addicts or who have sexual 
partners who are addicts or bisexual. 
</P>
<P>
These women are often so sick that they can't take care of themselves, let 
alone their children. Some mothers of pediatric AIDS victims are already dead. 
</P>
<P>
Some foster families are afraid to take on AIDS children. Many of the newest 
babies are minority children. They have enormous medical needs and are almost 
sure to die. 
</P>
<P>
One county social worker, who asked not to be identified, estimated that seven 
of 10 potential foster families reject her when she calls around trying to 
place an AIDS baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody really wants these kids," Siemers said. "We need a lot more foster 
homes. Anything that improve their life while they are in this terminal illness 
is worth whatever it costs."

AIDS LAUNDRY PLANNED; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: ORGANIZERS SAY VOLUNTEERS WILL PICK UP, WASH AND RETURN CLOTHES FOR 
FREE FOR PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE.

<P>
AIDS activists from Northeast Los Angeles and Hollywood plan to establish a 
free laundry service for people with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Bee's, expected to be in operation by January, would be only the second 
program of its kind in the country, organizers claim. The proposed operation is 
modeled after Auntie Helen's Fluff 'n Fold, a nonprofit service in San Diego 
believed to be the only self-sufficient laundry service for people with AIDS or 
AIDS-related complex. 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Bee's most likely will operate from a rented building in Silver Lake or 
Hollywood, organizers said. Volunteers each week will pick up the laundry of 
about 500 men, women and children with AIDS, wash it at the building and return 
it for free, said Miki Jackson, a free-lance graphic artist and community 
activist who will serve as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
A thrift store at the front of the building, small fund-raisers and private 
donations will pay for the service, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as someone is healthy and well and able, they should do their own 
laundry and be responsible for their life," she said. "But when they are too 
challenged and too ill, we want to be there to do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
At least 3,450 people in Los Angeles County have AIDS, according to the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control. Many have more laundry needs because of night 
sweats, diarrhea and other problems associated with the disease, said Dr. 
Martin Finn, AIDS program medical director for the county's Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
And although people with AIDS are encouraged to try to live a normal life at 
home, they may lose the energy or ability to do their laundry, Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get down to it, it's pretty hard to live when you don't have your 
laundry cared for," Finn said. "The illness, and its various ramifications, 
results in the use of a tremendous amount of laundry, so I don't think one can 
underestimate how important it is to meet this need." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and several others -- including Morris Kight, a prominent gay activist 
who founded the Gay and Lesbian Services Center in Hollywood -- started 
planning the service in September after touring Auntie Helen's in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
That facility was founded in 1988 by Gary Cheatham, who quit his job as a 
computer analyst when he tested positive for the HIV virus, the precursor to 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Auntie Helen's operates out of a rented building and washes 1,400 loads each 
month for about 200 people, Cheatham said. A thrift store in front pays for 
about 75% of the operation's $12,500 monthly expenses, with biweekly yard sales 
and private donations making up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The operation's three trucks, eight washing machines and eight dryers were 
donated, Cheatham said. About 70 volunteers do the washing and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Although some AIDS service groups have "buddy systems" in which a volunteer may 
wash clothing for an individual with AIDS, Auntie Helen's is believed to be the 
only self-supporting, citywide program in the country specifically dedicated to 
washing laundry, Cheatham said. 
</P>
<P>
The service also loans medical equipment, such as wheelchairs, and gives its 
clients clothing, linens and household goods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Los Angeles service will operate in nearly the same way -- it will 
wash laundry and eventually will provide medical equipment and clothing -- but 
it will require twice the number of washers and dryers to serve twice the 
number of people, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Bee's initially will serve about 500 people under the corporate umbrella 
of the U.S. Missions, a nonprofit shelter in Hollywood that feeds senior 
citizens and the homeless. Eventually, it will become an independent, nonprofit 
organization serving up to 1,000 people, Kight said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Missions already has donated office equipment and two businessmen donated 
$1,000. But organizers still are soliciting donations of washing machines, 
dryers and cars. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers want to have the service running by January. They have decided 
to send out an Aunt Bee's Christmas card to solicit donations and support, 
Kight said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's facility is widely considered a success, he said. A Los Angeles 
service probably will be more difficult to establish, Cheatham and Jackson 
agreed. San Diego has at least 900 residents with AIDS, compared with Los 
Angeles' 3,450, federal statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
Also, most San Diego users of the service live in the area of the UC San Diego 
Medical Center, which has an AIDS clinic, but Los Angeles residents are spread 
throughout the county -- making pickup and delivery of clothing potentially 
more difficult, Jackson said.

EL RANCHO REGAINS TITLE IN ACADEMIC CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There was a drummer whose academic strength lay in fine arts and language, a 
saxophone player who knew more about space exploration than most adults, and a 
drama student for whom speech and interviewing skills were second nature. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there were 10 El Rancho High School students with enough smarts to 
carry on the school's tradition of excellence in the Southeast Region of the 
1990 Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in the last three years, El Rancho High School students 
have won the Southeast Region of the county decathlon, the nation's largest 
academic contest. The group of 10 students last month beat out competitors from 
20 other high schools in the challenging contest that included such questions 
as: "What country made the mechanical arm for the space shuttle?" "What was 
George Bush doing when Nixon resigned?" and "Who was the fifth Beatle?" 
</P>
<P>
El Rancho High School won the Southeast Region in 1988, and last year placed 
second to Cerritos High School. In overall county standings this year, the El 
Rancho team placed 14th out of 83 schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited," El Rancho Principal David Verdugo said. "We compete against 
some schools with outstanding reputations. . . . The results speak for the 
entire school." 
</P>
<P>
The team members are juniors Joanne Szeto, Matthew Walker, Sheila Panganiban, 
Demosthenes Spiropoulos, Mai T. Le and Federico Moran, and seniors Ernesto 
Carreon, Marisol Pugliese, Jay Boyette and Michael Weinholt. 
</P>
<P>
The team members attributed their victory to hard work, team spirit and plain 
common sense. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is logic," said Weinholt, who was the region's top scorer in the 
scholastic category. 
</P>
<P>
According to rules of the decathlon, teams must consist of three students each 
with A, B and C grade averages. The A students are known as honor students, B 
as scholastic and C as varsity. The 10th team member is an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
The academic decathlon was started in Orange County in 1968. It went statewide 
in 1979, and in 1982 became a national competition. This year's winner of the 
Los Angeles County competition, West High School of Torrance, will compete at 
the state decathlon in Riverside next March. 
</P>
<P>
Decathlon competitors are given written and verbal examinations on subjects 
including economics, language, literature, fine arts, mathematics, science and 
history. Students also must give prepared and extemporaneous speeches. In the 
last and by far the most intense phase of the contest, individual students are 
bombarded with questions in front of a gymnasium full of students, parents and 
teachers. This year's theme was space exploration and the decades of the 1960s 
and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Preparation at El Rancho began last May, when the team members were drafted. 
Some students were selected by their teachers, others volunteered. The crucial 
test to determine whether a student had the mettle to compete in the decathlon 
came when school let out for the summer. It was then, coach Doug Anderson said, 
that team members had to meet at the school at 6:30 every morning for more than 
two months to study for the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
For many students, the idea of giving up the leisurely morning sleep of summer 
to study for an extracurricular test is repugnant, but decathlon team members 
said it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it helps us become more well-rounded," Le said. 
</P>
<P>
The students also said that in studying for the decathlon, they learned to 
think under pressure and that the intense preparation sessions helped them more 
than regular classes to learn. 
</P>
<P>
There are more practical reasons for their commitment, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks good on (high school) transcripts," Spiropoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the team's goal was to beat Cerritos High School. Next year, they 
said, they hope to become one of the top 10 scorers in the county.

BEVERLY SAID TO BE UP FOR TAX POST;

<P>
APPOINTMENTS: PETE WILSON IS CONSIDERING THE STATE SENATOR FOR BOARD OF 
EQUALIZATION JOB, GOP SOURCES SAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran state Sen. Robert G. Beverly is among a handful of prospective nominees 
under consideration by Gov.-elect Pete Wilson for the State Board of 
Equalization seat representing Long Beach and southeastern Los Angeles County, 
according to several Republican sources. 
</P>
<P>
The seat is expected to become vacant after current board member Paul Carpenter 
is sentenced next week for his conviction on felony charges in a federal 
anti-corruption case. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, a Manhattan Beach Republican whose Senate district includes parts of 
Long Beach, said: "My quick reaction is that I would be interested (in the 
board seat), mostly because it is something different. I've been (in the 
Legislature) a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, who was elected state senator in 1976 after 10 years in the Assembly, 
cautioned that he has not spoken to Wilson's transition staff about the 
appointment and that he is "not actively seeking" it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Beverly acknowledged that Ernest Dronenburg, a Republican member of 
the board, sounded him out recently about his interest in the nomination, which 
would require confirmation by both legislative houses. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Equalization, a five-member panel composed of four members elected 
from districts and the state controller, decides tax cases ranging from 
individual appeals of income tax bills to multimillion-dollar tax disputes 
involving corporations. Board members make $95,052 a year; as a legislator, 
Beverly makes $52,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The district Carpenter has represented since 1987 encompasses the southern and 
central portions of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican sources, who asked not to be identified, said that along with 
Beverly, others being considered for the board post are state Sen. Frank Hill 
of Whittier; Matthew K. Fong of Hacienda Heights, the defeated GOP candidate 
for state controller; former Assemblyman Charles Bader of Pomona, who lost a 
bid for a state Senate seat last month, and Oscar Wright, a U.S. Small Business 
Administration regional administrator based in San Francisco. All are 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Livingstone, Wilson's transition office press secretary, said he could 
neither confirm nor deny names under consideration. Livingstone also said 
Wilson's attention is focused on selecting people for higher profile positions 
-- including the U.S. Senate seat he must give up before his inauguration as 
governor next month -- and on putting together a state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said he was not interested in the Board of Equalization seat. 
</P>
<P>
Bader said he is interested in the seat but might not accept it if offered 
because of political considerations. "It's an important job. But on the other 
hand, party registration would make it difficult for a Republican to get 
elected" to the seat in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The district's registered voters are overwhelmingly Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Fong expressed interest in the slot, saying he wants to sit on the board "to 
make California a more hospitable place for business." Fong said he has lobbied 
Wilson for the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Wright could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the recent passage of Proposition 140, which limits legislative 
terms, jobs on the Board of Equalization were increasingly attracting the 
interest of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
While the post does not carry the prestige and public visibility of a 
legislative seat, historically it has offered more job security. Once elected 
or appointed, incumbents have rarely been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent example of the security of incumbency was offered by Carpenter, 
a former Democratic state senator from Cypress. He easily won reelection in 
November to a second four-year term despite being convicted in September in 
U.S. District Court on four counts of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, he must formally forfeit the seat when he is sentenced next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly said that if he is named to the post, he would anticipate running for 
it in a future election. Despite the Democratic tilt of the district, Beverly 
maintained he would have a good chance of holding onto the seat, saying, "It's 
not a heavily partisan office." 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Beverly's name often has surfaced as a potential 
gubernatorial appointee for everything from judgeships to state treasurer. But 
in these previous cases, it was widely thought that Beverly enjoyed his Senate 
job too much to leave the upper chamber.

<P>
Betty Wilson, a member of the Beverly Hills Unified School District Board of 
Education since 1983, was installed as board president at an organizational 
meeting Tuesday. Peggy Goldwyn, a board member since 1987, was named vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who attended the Beverly Hills schools, said her goals are open 
communication, developing students' English language skills -- especially 
students whose native language is not English -- and district funding. She said 
that passing a parcel tax must be a priority. A parcel tax to raise money for 
the district fell four votes short of passage in June. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Frank Fenton said at the meeting that he will not seek 
reelection when his second term on the board expires in 1991. He said he has 
always supported term limits, especially for local offices. He added that he 
was dismayed when no challengers ran for the board in the fall of 1989 and said 
he hoped his early announcement "will provide the parents of this district time 
to select some great candidates."

AUDUBON PROGRAM TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A National Audubon Society educational program designed to teach Westside 
schoolchildren about natural history and the environment will be launched today 
at the Ballona Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The first group of about 60 students from the Broadway Elementary School in 
Venice are to visit the wetland area near Playa del Rey this morning, according 
to Audubon project director Melanie Ingalls. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas Partners, developers of the Playa Vista project, is sponsoring 
the educational program for fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders. Students from 
the Los Angeles, Santa Monica-Malibu and Culver City school districts will take 
part in the program called Audubon Adventures, Ingalls said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservation group will also develop an interpretive program for visitors 
to the nearly 270-acre wetlands located south of Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
The area is home to more than 200 species of birds at some point each year, 
including the endangered California least tern and the Belding's savannah 
sparrow. Other endangered species such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons 
have been seen in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas recently reached agreement with another environmental group, 
Friends of Ballona Wetlands, to protect and restore the wetlands. The agreement 
to settle a longstanding lawsuit also removed a major obstacle to construction 
of the multibillion-dollar Playa Vista project. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed project, one of the biggest in Los Angeles history, is planned for 
670 acres west of the San Diego Freeway between Marina del Rey and the 
Westchester Bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for construction of a new city-within-a-city with 11,750 residential 
units, 5 million square feet of office space, 2,400 hotel rooms, 720,000 square 
feet of retail space, 2,400 hotel rooms, 25,000 parking spaces and a new marina 
with 750 boat slips. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report on the development is being prepared.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has designated Gary Audet, director of municipal services, to 
be the staff project manager for the design development phase of the 
construction of the new city hall. 
</P>
<P>
Audet will act as the liaison among the project's architect, CHCG Inc.; the 
construction manager, Jones Construction Management, and the city. 
</P>
<P>
His duties will include coordinating decisions and recommendations by other 
city staff for the building design during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
The architect is scheduled to present preliminary plans for the city hall 
complex to the council in two weeks. The plans will show basic floor plans and 
describe overall building functions. It will be the job of Audet and others to 
work out office layouts, select many of the finishing materials and decide on 
aesthetic details. 
</P>
<P>
A City Hall Advisory Team composed of Mayor Steven Gourley, City Councilman 
Mike Balkman and other key department heads will also help make design 
decisions.

<P>
DELAY OF HOTEL OK SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malibu's unofficial City Council will ask the California Coastal Commission to 
delay approval of a luxury hotel overlooking the Pacific Ocean until after the 
community becomes a city. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the council on Tuesday approved asking for the delay, 
saying the community should help to decide the future of the 300-room, 
$65-million hotel that the Adamson Cos. wants to build. 
</P>
<P>
The state panel last month approved the final grading plans for the 27-acre 
hotel site near Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
The panel approved the hotel in principle five years ago, but stipulated that 
the hotel must be served by a sewer system before it is allowed to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that Los Angeles County's proposed sewer system for Malibu might not 
win the commission's approval, Adamson wants permission to build its own waste 
treatment facility. The firm's request was to have been heard by the panel next 
week but was delayed until at least January after the commission staff said it 
needed more information.

We sometimes fantasize about dancing with unbounded freedom, the kind of 
exuberant movement seen in a Jules Feiffer character sensing the approach of 
spring, or Snoopy atop his doghouse when he senses the approach of dinner. 
Instead, our style more resembles that of a friend's young son, who, when the 
music starts, looks like a wayward sumo wrestler (minus 400 or so pounds) as he 
squats, bounces and plants his left foot, then the right. 
</P>
<P>
But at least he laughs. We don't even smile. Call us uptight. Which is why we 
can appreciate the Synapse Dance Theater, Santa Monica College's student modern 
dance ensemble, which will present original works Dec. 6-11 in the college's 
Studio Stage, 1900 Pico Blvd. For performance times and ticket information, 
call (213) 452-9214. R.D.

ADMINISTRATOR REPORTEDLY RESIGNS AT REQUEST OF THREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald Downing, Hawaiian Gardens city administrator, has resigned, reportedly 
after being ousted by three City Council members. They are the same three who 
recently forced H.M. (Lennie) Wagner to give up the mayor's post and Domenic 
Ruggeri to step down as vice mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Both remain on the council. 
</P>
<P>
There was no formal announcement about Downing's resignation. Wagner said she 
learned about it through a memo left in her City Hall mailbox from now-Mayor 
Rosalie Sher. Ruggeri said Downing was asked to resign during a special meeting 
of the council. Ruggeri said he and Wagner did not attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Downing was named administrator in November, 1988, after serving three months 
as assistant administrator. He could not be reached for comment. His 
resignation letter is dated Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wagner and Ruggeri, the three council members who reportedly 
demanded the resignation were Sher, Kathleen Navejas and Esther Flores. Navejas 
said that was not true and that she would not discuss the resignation because 
it was a personnel matter.

STUDENTS SKIP CLASS, MARCH AGAINST STRICTER DRESS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 students opposed to a new anti-gang dress code skipped class and 
demonstrated Monday at Downey High School, leaving one window broken and 
several trash cans overturned, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was mostly peaceful and orderly, but one student threw a rock 
and broke a window in a vacant school building, Assistant Principal Allen Layne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have identified the student, who will be suspended, Layne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight other students already have been suspended for one to three days for 
carrying signs with profanity and for exhibitionism -- two girls lifted their 
blouses in protest during the demonstration, Layne said. The rest of the 
students, who missed their fifth period classes, will receive detention. 
</P>
<P>
The new anti-gang element of Downey High's existing dress code took effect 
Monday. It bans hats, except for those with the school logo, a certain type of 
baggy pants and web belts. It also prohibits students from wearing shirts that 
are buttoned only at the top. 
</P>
<P>
The student protesters complained that the new rules were overly broad, 
covering non-gang attire as well. School officials met Monday and Tuesday with 
student leaders. As a result, most web belts will be permitted, Layne said. The 
students were assured that the dress code would be enforced on a case-by-case 
basis, strictly against gang-related attire.

TRANSIT BOARD TO CONSIDER RAISING BUS FARE TO 75 CENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach Transit's directors are scheduled to raise bus fares for the first 
time when they meet Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the increase is necessary in part to make up for a staggering 
increase in the cost of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Adults would pay 75 cents, an increase of 15 cents. Student fares would 
increase 10 cents to 50 cents, and senior citizens would pay 35 cents, an 
increase of 5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials say the cost of diesel fuel has more than doubled to nearly 
$1.10 a gallon. City buses use about 2 million gallons of fuel a year. "At the 
current rate, our fuel costs are going to increase by over $1 million this 
year," General Manager Laurence Jackson said.

SURVEY SEEKS OPINIONS ON SWITCHING TO SHERIFF'S DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bell Gardens city leaders are asking residents whether they want to keep their 
police department or contract with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
According to a financial study by city staff members, the city would save $2 
million in law enforcement services by contracting with the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of running the Bell Gardens Police Department for 1990-91 will be 
$4,979,358. If the city had contracted with the Sheriff's Department for 
1990-91 the cost would have been $2,956,290, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are being asked in a survey distributed in the December issue of the 
City Hall newspaper, What's Happening, to say yes or no to the proposal. The 
survey also asks residents how they think the potential savings should be 
spent. The choices include more drug enforcement, gang suppression, senior 
citizen housing, single-family housing and the prosecution of slumlords. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Claude Booker said the City Council has not discussed contracting 
for law enforcement services, nor has the Sheriff's Department been contacted. 
He said that before they discuss the issue, city leaders want to gauge 
residents' response. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the public understands that they will pay $2 million more to keep 
the Police Department and they still want it, we will probably keep it," he 
said.

LYNWOOD STICKS WITH PLAN FOR CHANGING TO YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE DISTRICT SAYS OVERCROWDING LEAVES IT NO CHOICE. SOME PARENTS 
CONTINUE PROTESTING THE CHANGES.

LYNWOOD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite continuing opposition from some parents and students, the Lynwood 
Unified School District is moving forward with plans for year-round schools to 
relieve overcrowded classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
A year-round system is scheduled to start July 1, 1991, in five of the 
district's 13 schools. All schools will eventually go year-round except the 
adult school and the continuation school for troubled youngsters, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have decided to set a year-round schedule at Lynwood High, the 
district's only high school; Hosler Junior High, and the three largest 
elementary schools -- Roosevelt, Rogers and Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
All five schools house hundreds more students than they were built to 
accommodate. A total of 3,400 students attend Lynwood High, which was built to 
hold fewer than 2,000 students, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district's school board had approved year-round plans last April for the 
three elementary schools, but decided in October to expand the program to 
include the high school and junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary schools were selected for the year-round program last March, but 
the board postponed final action for a month after hundreds of parents and 
children protested the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Willard Hawn Reed said some students at the high school staged a 
brief walkout one day in October in opposition to the year-round system. He 
said he and board member Rachel Chavez met with students to hear their 
complaints. An estimated 300 reportedly participated in the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
"People are objecting mainly because they are opposed to change," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Audrey Clarke said district officials have been meeting with 
parents, teachers and administrators since September in an effort to work out a 
suitable plan. "We still have parents who are protesting, but not as vehemently 
as in the past," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents continue to object to the year-round system because it would be 
disruptive to families, especially those with children attending school at 
different times of year, said Matilde Zapien, a leading opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made to accommodate those parents by making sure their 
children attend school at the same time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have not decided how they might divide the school year, but 
are leaning toward a plan in which students would attend classes for three 
months, then would have a vacation of about one month. Under year-round 
schooling, one group of students would be on vacation while the others would 
attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
The board has appointed Roosevelt Principal Bernice Jacobs to coordinate the 
year-round program. A successor will be named at Roosevelt when Jacobs begins 
her new duties after the first of the year, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have been forced to schedule year-round schools to 
accommodate growing enrollment in the 15,000-student district. Enrollment has 
increased 400 to 600 students in each of the last five years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the state Department of Education fined the district $360,000 for 
placing students in overcrowded classrooms. Inspectors found that the district 
constantly violated the state's average limit of 30 students per classroom. All 
of the violations occurred in the elementary grades. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the district tried to implement year-round schooling at five of its 
elementary schools, but a group of parents won a preliminary injunction halting 
the plan the day before the program was to start. The court ruled that the 
district had not given sufficient notice of the year-round plan. 
</P>
<P>
The school board has been reluctant to take up the issue until recently, Reed 
said.

MAN TO STAND TRIAL OVER WIFE'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Canada Flintridge man who may have unwittingly given police the key to his 
own arrest has been ordered to stand trial in Victorville Superior Court for 
the murder of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
A trial date is scheduled to be set on Dec. 13 for Donald Miralle, 46, who is 
accused of strangling his wife, Tessie, 49, on Sept. 12, then dumping the body 
in a remote desert region and setting it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County Municipal Judge John B. Gibson on Tuesday ordered Miralle 
to stand trial for murder after a two-day preliminary hearing in Victorville. 
The judge said the couple's history of marital problems and evidence found near 
Tessie Miralle's body point to her husband as a prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys for Miralle argued at the hearing that the evidence against 
their client is flimsy and said they will appeal the judge's ruling to the 
Superior Court within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Tessie Miralle was a prominent businesswoman in the affluent community and 
active in charitable affairs. She disappeared Sept. 12 after she had gone to 
her husband's civil engineering office in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
Her burning body was found Sept. 13 by a passing motorist in a remote area of 
the high desert west of Victorville. However, San Bernardino County sheriff's 
investigators said they had no clue to the identity of the body until Miralle 
contacted county authorities Sept. 24 at the urging of a friend, who was 
concerned about the missing woman and had heard about the discovery of a body 
in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Miralle provided the county coroner with his wife's dental X-rays, which were 
used to identify her charred body. He was arrested Oct. 3 after he attended his 
wife's funeral with the couple's three teen-age children. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence presented during the preliminary hearing indicated that the victim's 
wrists had been bound with tape before she was choked to death with a cord or 
rope. Investigators said they do not know where the murder occurred. The body 
had been placed in a blue plastic trash barrel, doused with lighter fluid and 
set afire with a long cannon fuse, experts testified. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors presented evidence that Donald Miralle had purchased 100 feet of 
cannon fuse from a mail-order military supply catalogue in 1988. Criminologists 
also testified that tire tread marks and footprints found near the body matched 
brands of tires and tennis shoes owned by Donald Miralle, although they could 
not say the exact tires and shoes matched. 
</P>
<P>
They alleged that Miralle traded the tires in on new ones with a Pasadena 
dealer and disposed of the shoes, which police never found, shortly after the 
murder. The tires have been recovered, but the shoes have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys A. Brent Carruth and Barry Post attempted to show that the 
victim had made loans and sold jewelry and in doing this may have made enemies 
with motives for killing her. They also challenged the evidence that 
authorities said identifies the body as that of Tessie Miralle. 
</P>
<P>
Although the judge said "there is precious little hard evidence in the case," 
he said the circumstantial evidence against Miralle is significant. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified that Miralle traded in the new tires on his Chevrolet 
Suburban, got rid of tennis shoes that were only three months old and ordered 
his wife's car telephone turned off before anyone knew about the murder. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified caller attempted to get the tires back from the tire dealer the 
day after Miralle was questioned by deputies. Workers at the dealership said 
the tires already had been picked up by police when they were contacted by the 
caller. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Miralle, 19, the couple's oldest daughter and a student at UC Santa 
Barbara, testified during the hearing that her mother telephoned her during the 
week of Sept. 10 and asked her to return home because of family problems. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Miralle tearfully explained that her father, younger brother and sister 
were at home when she arrived late on Sept. 12 but that her mother was missing. 
She said she reported to police that her mother was missing the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest daughter also said her father told her several days later that he 
had ordered her mother's mobile phone turned off. She said she called to have 
the service restored, because she was concerned that her mother needed the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators said the mobile telephone and other valuables were still 
in Tessie Miralle's unlocked maroon Jaguar when it was found Sept. 26 parked 
near Monrovia High School. The keys were in the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said Tessie Miralle hired a private investigator earlier 
this year to determine if her husband was seeing another woman. No other woman 
was identified during the hearing. However, prosecutors said letters allegedly 
written by Tessie Miralle to her husband accused him of infidelity and 
threatened a costly divorce and property settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Miralle and Donald Miralle Jr., 16, both testified that their parents had 
argued for some time and said the parents told them they planned to divorce. 
But all three of the children protested to deputies that their father was 
innocent when he was arrested at their home in October. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Miralle posted $500,000 bail to return home to his children 
during Thanksgiving. The two oldest children, who were called by prosecutors to 
testify in Victorville, declined to be interviewed. They live with a 
housekeeper, a cousin of Tessie Miralle, who also was a witness at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Elwood of San Bernardino County on Tuesday told 
the court that prosecutors have had trouble meeting with the Miralle children 
since their father returned home. She asked that the court make special 
arrangements for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson declined the request, however. "We are dealing with a situation here 
where their mother is dead and their father is on trial for murder," he said. 
Any further emotional stress on the children "is too much."

HILLSIDE PLAN GETS TENTATIVE OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a year of study, the La Canada Flintridge City Council this week approved 
in concept strict new rules on hillside development that would require new or 
remodeled residences to be designed to blend in with the size and character of 
housing in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations also would preserve the wooded, natural terrain in the hills by 
limiting grading and preserving prominent land forms, such as ridges, knolls, 
valleys and creeks. 
</P>
<P>
Council members asked Monday for some modifications in the language of the 
proposed ordinance, which is expected to be formally introduced Jan. 7 and 
adopted Jan. 28, said Craig Ewing, community development director. It would go 
into effect 30 days later. 
</P>
<P>
The council also extended for three months a moratorium on hillside development 
imposed a year ago in order to block new construction until rules are adopted.

THE MANY FACES AND STYLES OF SANTA CLAUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1963, La Habra Heights resident Claire Spothelfer received her first Santa 
Claus. It was a little German doll given to her by her husband's aunt in the 
early years of the Spothelfer marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Little did Spothelfer know that what started with the German Santa would grow 
to become a collection of approximately 500 Santas from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It just sort of grew like Topsy," Spothelfer said. "People started giving me 
Santas for gifts and one thing led to another." 
</P>
<P>
Spothelfer has Santas of wood, Santas of fabric, musical and ceramic Santas -- 
more Santas than she could possibly display in her home. 
</P>
<P>
Her personal favorites are a small cloisonne Santa made in China and given to 
her by a dear friend. The other, she said, is a dime store Santa Claus with a 
music box that she gave to her daughter when she was 5 months old and 
celebrating her first Christmas. The daughter is now 27. 
</P>
<P>
Spothelfer's collection is on display through Dec. 16 at the Whittier Museum, 
6755 S. Newlin Ave. Hours are 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, and 9 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Tuesday through Friday by appointment only. For appointments, call 
945-3871.

CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS ECOLOGICAL AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is sponsoring a conference Friday on the 
future of Los Angeles County's Significant Ecological Areas, or SEAs -- plant 
and wildlife habitats that are under strong development pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The daylong conference is meant to bring together planning officials, wildlife 
experts and citizen activists to discuss the future of the 61 SEAs, more than 
half of which are in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys and 
the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many people out there that either don't know what an SEA is . . . 
or what protections they're supposedly afforded," said Carolyn Barr, a project 
analyst with the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, an affiliate 
of the mountains conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to "get all the players together to share that kind of information" 
and figure out "what each player can do" to assure the SEAs' survival, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The individual SEAs were designated in the county's 1980 General Plan. They 
were chosen for their value as habitat for native plants and animals, or as 
strongholds of threatened species. Others were selected as the finest remnants 
of natural settings once common in Southern California.

The General Plan did not bar development in SEAs but said building in the areas 
should receive special scrutiny and be compatible with the natural resources. 
The county also committed itself to trying to buy the most threatened SEAs, but 
no acquisition program was ever started. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, some SEAs have been nibbled by development, while others have 
been spared by their remote location. But with other open space dwindling, 
housing and commercial projects, roads and even garbage dumps are being planned 
for SEAs.

Barr said she hopes the conference will attract up to 200 participants, and 
give birth to a coalition of park planners and citizens to work on SEA 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
The conference will begin at 9 a.m. at the Sooky Goldman Nature Center in 
Franklin Canyon Park, in the mountains north of Beverly Hills. Access to the 
center is via Beverly Drive. Registration fee for the conference is $15.

<P>
BASKETBALL: JERSEY NO. 42 SHOWED UP IN A RECENT 49ERS GAME EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 
RETIRED 17 YEARS AGO. ITS OWNER IS A LITTLE MIFFED AND THE UNIVERSITY IS 
EMBARRASSED.

When Ed Ratleff, considered the greatest basketball player in Cal State Long 
Beach history, had his uniform retired in a ceremony before his final home game 
in 1973, he thought it was his forever. 
</P>
<P>
But now, for the second time, he has learned that someone else has been wearing 
his old number, 42. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Henderson, a freshman playing his first college game, had No. 42 on his 
back during the 49ers' 95-68 loss to Arizona last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's happened before," said Ratleff, a popular figure in Long Beach since his 
days as a two-time All-American. He tried to shrug off the oversight this week 
but his voice was tinged with disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's one of the reasons they have problems over there," he said. 
"They seem to do things wrong over and over again. If you weren't there (at the 
1973 ceremony) it doesn't mean anything, I guess. But I'm not upset, they can 
do what they want to. It's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also issued No. 42 to a player 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They could put it on the gym wall so people could see that it's retired," 
suggested Ratleff, a member of the university's athletic Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Corey Johnson, Coach Seth Greenberg and Sports Information 
Director Shayne Schroeder said they were unaware that Ratleff's number had been 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, a center who did not play in the 49ers' first two games this season, 
would have worn No. 35 against Arizona, but Greenberg said the student manager 
failed to pack that uniform for the flight to Tucson. So, while going scoreless 
in 10 minutes, Henderson wore the only extra uniform, which bore No. 42. 
</P>
<P>
That uniform had been assigned, according to the media guide, to freshman Mike 
Atkinson, who has been redshirted. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have been informed," said Greenberg, who said he called Ratleff to 
apologize. "We just didn't know. There was nothing there to remind us. I am 
amazed we don't have anything in the gym with his number on it. I'm going to 
speak to Corey. When our SID doesn't know, then something needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Greenberg, both of whom came from the University of Miami (Fla.), 
have been at Cal State Long Beach since 1987, and Schroeder has been at the 
university about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if there are other former 49ers whose numbers have been retired, 
Schroeder said: "From what I gather, just Eddie's." 
</P>
<P>
"I've had people call me about it," said Ratleff. "They can't believe it 
either. I'm sure it's an oversight, but there never should have been one." 
</P>
<P>
The school apparently has no formal procedure for honoring athletes by retiring 
their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Steve Janisch, the assistant sports information director, the only 
other numbers the university has retired are No. 38, worn in 1969-'70 by 
football player Leon Burns, and No. 15, worn by LaTaunya Pollard, who played 
basketball from 1980 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no mention in any of the 49ers media guides that these numbers 
have been retired. Nor are there reminders around the school or in the 
University Gymnasium. Unlike many colleges, Cal State Long Beach has no special 
room in which to display athletic trophies and uniforms of former star players. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll look into it and make something happen," Johnson said. "The hard part is 
fulfilling promises you don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
The athletic director added that he is surprised that more bits of sports lore 
haven't been lost because of the frequency with which the athletic department 
offices have been moved around. Several are housed in temporary trailer-type 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Ratleff, now a 40-year-old insurance broker in Long Beach, was a 6-foot-6 guard 
for the 49ers from 1971 to 1973, their glory years under Coach Jerry Tarkanian. 
Ratleff played on the U.S. Olympic team in 1972. He is second behind Michael 
Wiley on the 49ers career scoring list with 1,820 points and holds school 
records for career scoring average (21.4) and points in a game (45). 
</P>
<P>
After a five-year career with Houston in the NBA, he held assistant coaching 
jobs with both the Cal State Long Beach men's and women's basketball teams. In 
1987 he had hoped to become the men's head coach, but the job was given to Joe 
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think because I didn't get the job, I have bad feelings for 
the school, but it isn't true," Ratleff said. "I just do my thing. I have a 
job, and at night it's not one of my priorities to see Long Beach State play 
basketball. But I still cheer for them." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Donlan, senior associate athletic director, said that a 49ers basketball 
player, whose name he could not recall, entered a game in 1980 wearing a No. 42 
uniform that had been inadvertently ordered. 
</P>
<P>
"You could hear people murmuring," Donlan said. "(But) none of us knew about it 
because we weren't there then (in 1973). We discontinued (the uniform) right 
then and there." 
</P>
<P>
Donlan, who came to Cal State Long Beach in 1974, said such a mistake could be 
made because of the change in coaches and equipment managers over the years, 
and because Long Beach has never displayed uniforms with retired numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate," he said. "I don't blame him for being miffed a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
But Ratleff insisted, "I'm not upset with anybody. Seth called me and said they 
won't use it again. But if they want to use it, fine. I think I still have one 
of my old uniforms . . . if they want to use that one, they have my blessings." 
</P>
<P>
It was evident, though, that his feelings have been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only (first-team) All-American they've ever had," he said. "I guess to 
them that doesn't mean very much." 
</P>
<P>
Others Honored 
</P>
<P>
Besides Ed Ratleff, two other Cal State Long Beach athletes have had their 
uniform numbers retired, according to university officials: 
</P>
<P>
* No. 15, LaTaunya Pollard, a basketball player from 1980 to 1983, who is the 
49ers' career leader in points with 3,001. 
</P>
<P>
* No. 38, Leon Burns, an All-American football tailback in 1969 and 1970, who 
is the 49ers' career leader in rushing yards with 2,809.

DESOTELL GETS NO KICK FROM ALL-LEAGUE PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ribet Academy's football coach took exception recently to what he perceived to 
be a bad call, only this time the referees weren't the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
Ric Desotell could not hide his displeasure with his Heritage League 
counterparts' decision to leave Ribet kicker Kate Stoll off the all-league 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll was selected all-league last season when she scored five points on 
conversion kicks for the Fighting Frogs, who compete in the Southern Section's 
Eight-Man Small Schools Division. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Stoll increased her production by scoring six points. 
</P>
<P>
Ribet was the only team in the Heritage League that attempted conversion kicks 
and field goals, Desotell said, and Stoll, a senior, was the only kicker in the 
league who scored any points. 
</P>
<P>
All of that would seem to make Stoll a shoo-in for postseason honors. 
</P>
<P>
But Stoll was left off both the first and second all-league teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The other kickers just made it for their kickoffs," Desotell said. "I found 
that astounding." 
</P>
<P>
Nine in a row: The Glendale College football team closed out its season by 
running over Citrus' top-rated defense during a 23-16 victory in the Southern 
California Bowl last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, which won nine consecutive games to finish 9-2, gained 437 yards 
against a defense that had been allowing only 227.2 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Bobby Webster gained 142 yards in 30 carries and scored the go-ahead 
touchdown on a two-yard run with 1 minute 11 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros rushed for more than 300 yards against the Owls (8-3), who were 
surrendering 90.2 rushing yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale went undefeated after opening the season with losses to Pasadena and 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing about it is they never stepped backward," Glendale Coach Jon 
Cicuto said. "Coming in (to the bowl game) with a two-week layoff, I was 
concerned our timing would be off, but they played hard and pretty 
disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
Forty Vaquero players will return next season. Off-season weight-training 
workouts will begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a pretty decent nucleus coming back but the key to our success will be 
their work ethic in the off-season," Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Onward and upward: Several Glendale players will make recruiting trips to 
four-year schools this weekend, Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver David Nattoli and kicker Martin Boskovich will visit Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Cotie McMahon and tight end Greg Thompson are scheduled to fly to 
Utah State and defensive back Derrick Mitchell and defensive lineman Keith 
Poche are headed for Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive linemen Keith Moffet and Travis Peterson will visit San Jose State 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Still hot: Former Franklin High quarterback Santiago Alvarez did not miss a 
beat when he stepped up to the junior college level this season. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, The Times' Glendale back of the year last season when he passed for a 
state record 4,015 yards and 54 touchdowns, was the starting quarterback for 
East Los Angeles College this season. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was selected offensive player of the year in the Foothill Conference 
after passing for 2,419 yards and 19 touchdowns for the Huskies, who finished 
3-7. 
</P>
<P>
Fast start: The La Canada High boys' basketball team got off to a strong start 
by winning the Saugus tournament last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore center Richard Mandeville scored a game-high 19 points as the 
Spartans defeated Camarillo, 63-54, for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Jeff Lord averaged 22 points a game in the tournament and was named most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Awards time: The Glendale College men's basketball team won the consolation 
championship of the Antelope Valley tournament last Friday to improve to 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Crosby scored 18 points for the Vaqueros and Enoch Mack added 15 points 
and eight rebounds.

MOUNTED VOLUNTEERS PATROL ARROYO SECO; 
</P>
<P>
HORSEBACK UNIT: SIXTEEN MEMBERS HELP PASADENA POLICE BY WATCHING ISOLATED AREAS 
THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PATROL BY CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Every lawman needs a partner, and Don Zimmerman's is a 17-year-old buckskin 
quarter horse named Skeeter. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, 78, is a member of the Pasadena Volunteer Equestrian Unit, an unpaid 
and unarmed group of riders selected by the Pasadena Police Department to 
patrol on horseback through isolated stretches of the Arroyo Seco that are 
difficult or impossible to patrol by car. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically they're reserve police, but non-sworn, who can write citations and 
are trained with Mace," said Lt. Gregg Henderson of the Pasadena Police 
Department, who, with now-retired Lt. Wesley Rice, was instrumental in getting 
police reserve status for the unit in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arroyo Seco, the unit's 16 members give warnings and citations to people 
with unleashed dogs, mountain bikers on the horse and hiking trails, and 
transients living outside the authorized camping areas. Police have caught 
drunken and disorderly visitors and even flashers after the riders radioed in 
their descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
The unit's presence alone serves to discourage activities such as 
spray-painting graffiti on rocks and trees, said Patrick Phillips, 32, a 
three-year member who patrols areas in the northern Arroyo Seco such as Oak 
Grove Park and Devil's Gate Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our main objective is to sort of police, not so much with guns and 
clubs but with eyes and ears," Phillips said. "We're out there to create a 
presence and to try to deter any activities that would make the arroyo 
undesirable." 
</P>
<P>
Members are issued a hat, shirt, belt and saddle blanket bearing the 
blue-and-gold emblems of the Pasadena Police Department, but receive no other 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Each equestrian patrols the Arroyo Seco an average of 30 hours a month during 
spring and summer, when public use of the arroyo peaks. 
</P>
<P>
The unit seeks recruits who are at least 21 years old, know how to ride and 
have access to a horse, although some unit members will share their mounts, 
said Lt. Betsy Bour, the unit's highest-ranking volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants should call the administrative section of the Pasadena Police 
Department. They must complete an interview and submit to a thorough background 
check. 
</P>
<P>
Horses must also prove that they are qualified for the work. "Some horses just 
don't do well on the trail at all," Bour said. "Some horses have done only ring 
work, and out on the trail every blowing branch scares them." 
</P>
<P>
Human members of the unit say the patrols give them a lot of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy riding with the group. It's good exercise," said Zimmerman, a retired 
tool-and-die maker from San Gabriel. "And you feel like you're providing a 
service to the community, (and) at the same time enjoying it. . . . Most of the 
people are glad to see us coming. They appreciate us being there."

BUSH SAYS FREEDOM FOR HOSTAGES ISN'T ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTIAGO, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush today welcomed Saddam Hussein's dramatic promise to free 
American and other hostages but insisted that "the man must leave Kuwait 
without reservation, without condition" before the Persian Gulf crisis can end. 
</P>
<P>
And on Capitol Hill, Secretary of State James A. Baker III embraced the 
announcement from Baghdad but echoed Bush by saying that nothing short of a 
complete withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of its government will end the 
4-month-old standoff. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a welcome and significant development, but we do want to see it 
actually happen," Baker told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. " . . . It 
seems to me no coincidence that this comes just one week . . . after the 
international community has authorized the use of force." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, in a message for broadcast by the Voice of America, 
advised U.S. citizens in Iraq and Kuwait that it is making preparations for 
their evacuation as soon as they are permitted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Until that time, stay where you are, stay in touch with the U.S. Embassy and 
monitor the VOA closely," it said. "We will let you know as soon as we have 
more information." 
</P>
<P>
Bush stressed that no deal with Hussein is in the works -- or would be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no secret negotiations, direct or indirect with Iraq over this 
question," Bush said. "None. And there will be none." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the Iraqi decision to release the hostages from Kuwait is 
"credible" and stressed that "no single hostage should have been taken in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
Bush is in Chile as part of a five-nation swing through Latin America, but his 
attention was forced back to the gulf crisis with word of Hussein's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to get diverted from the full implementation of the United 
Nations resolutions in order to give him some face-saving way out of something 
he shouldn't have gotten into in the first place," Bush said, again rejecting 
Iraq's calls to link resolution of the current crisis with the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. 
</P>

A confrontation between two women who had the same boyfriend ended with one 
woman shot to death in a Mission Hills house and the other under arrest, Los 
Angeles police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Reyez, 22, was arrested this morning at her North Hollywood home and was 
being held on suspicion of murder in the Wednesday night shooting of Reina 
Quinones, 20, of Southeast Los Angeles, Detective Al Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said Quinones was shot about 8 p.m. in a house in the 10100 block of 
Bevis Avenue. Quinones was visiting the owner of the home, Venancio Nevarez, 
31, when Reyez entered the home, became upset at finding Nevarez and Quinones 
together and opened fire with a handgun. Quinones was hit once in the upper 
body and died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Police said both women were romantically involved with Nevarez. After the 
shooting Reyez fled, and Nevarez told investigators that he did not see who 
shot Quinones, Ferrand said. But further investigation led to the arrest of 
Reyez about 9 a.m. today, he said.

The Soviet defense minister said 35,000 young men have evaded the draft this 
year, most in republics where independence movements have fostered 
anti-military sentiment, the official Tass news agency reported today. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 4,300 deserters from the army are at large, aided in 
their flight by local authorities, Tass quoted Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov 
as saying at a conference of military officials held Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two thousand soldiers died in the first 11 months of 1990, and a quarter of 
those were suicides, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said in a report on the 
same conference, citing figures given by Col. Gen. Nikolai Shlyaga, the head of 
the main political directorate of the armed forces.

President Hussain Mohammed Ershad resigned today after ruling the country for 
eight years, handing power to an interim leader chosen by the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Ershad, a former army general who took power in a 1982 coup, had faced seven 
weeks of often violent nationwide protests against his government. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he promised to step down as soon as a replacement was named. 
Earlier today, Ershad lifted the state of emergency in effect since Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he administered the oath of office to Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Shahabuddin Ahmed, a political independent nominated by the country's 
opposition parties as caretaker vice president. Then he signed a letter of 
resignation, making him acting president.

An Italian military jet crashed in flames into a suburban high school today, 
killing at least 12 people and injuring 70, officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
Students jumped out of windows of their two-story, red brick school to escape 
the smoke and flames, witnesses said. Others trapped on the top floor were 
rescued by firefighters on ladders. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers found one teen-age girl uninjured under the plane's wing and continued 
to dig for bodies four hours after the mid-morning crash. Bologna prosecutor 
Mario Forte said he expected the death toll to remain at 12. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said all the dead were believed to be students. Many of the injured 
suffered serious burns. About 200 students, ages 14 to 18, were in school at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the pilot bailed out and the plane crashed minutes later into a 
classroom of the school, smashing a 12-foot-wide hole in the wall on the second 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this plane in flames coming down slowly, it seemed to level off and then 
it turned suddenly and crashed into the school," a witness told state RAI 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Students rushed in panic to escape as flames and smoke swept through the 
building, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"The upper floor was full of flames and students who were immersed in the smoke 
were jumping out," a young woman said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Macchi 326 trainer, came down in Casalecchio di Reno, three miles 
outside of this central Italian city, and crashed into the Gaetano Salvemini 
technical high school. 
</P>
<P>
Air force Gen. Carlo Brandini said the plane was on a mission to test radar 
effectiveness for anti-aircraft readiness. The aircraft took off from 
Villafranca military airport near Verona, 55 miles north of Bologna, and was 
scheduled to return there. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, 2nd Lt. Bruno Viviani, "reacted according to regulations," the 
general said. Brandini said the jet's only engine had developed some sort of 
problem and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Viviani suffered fractured vertebrae and was questioned by a 
prosecutor in the hospital, the Italian news agency ANSA said.

Eleven years after the Islamic revolution forced women under veils and banned 
social contact between the sexes, President Hashemi Rafsanjani is championing a 
freer attitude toward sex and social interaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We imagine that it is good if we suppress ourselves, endure frustrations and 
be patient in our sexual desires. 
</P>
<P>
This is incorrect. It is wrong," Rafsanjani said last week at Friday Prayers, 
an important forum for political statements. 
</P>
<P>
"God has created certain needs in the human being, and he does not want them 
left unanswered," he said in his address at Tehran University. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is it improper for a lady to marry twice in her lifetime? Or to have a 
temporary relationship -- a temporary marriage -- with someone else?" 
Rafsanjani asked. 
</P>
<P>
Sigheh, or temporary marriage, according to Iran's dominate religion, Shiite 
Islam, can be verbally contracted between two consenting adults. They take a 
temporary "vow" before engaging in sex. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to make the idea of sigheh as loose as possible, Rafsanjani said in 
his sermon that "some people imagine that for a temporary marriage we have to 
find a (cleric). 
</P>
<P>
"None of this is necessary," he said. "They can make a contract for themselves, 
if they want to be together for a month or two."

A top co-defendant in the Manuel A. Noriega case today pleaded guilty to giving 
drug payoffs directly to the deposed Panamanian leader. 
</P>
<P>
Luis del Cid, a former lieutenant colonel under Noriega, entered his plea this 
morning before U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, capping almost a year 
of plea negotiations with the government. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I transported the money, but, well, I am repentant of having done so," 
Del Cid told the judge. "What I was doing was following orders of a superior 
officer." 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid acknowledged making at least three separate cash transactions for 
Noriega. He admitted the government's contention that he gave Noriega $100,000 
in cash from drug pilot Floyd Carlton Caceres in November, 1982. He also 
delivered an envelope with $150,000 cash from Carlton and later picked up a 
suitcase stuffed with cash -- all of which was delivered to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid was an aide to Noriega at the time of their capture after the U.S. 
invasion in 1989. Prosecutors have charged that he acted as a liaison and money 
courier between drug traffickers and Noriega.

British food and beverages group Grand Metropolitan PLC said today its profits 
surged 25% last year, helped by a turnaround at its Burger King fast food 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Pretax profits for the year ended Sept. 30 jumped to 919 million pounds ($1.76 
billion) from 732 million pounds ($1.41 billion). Revenues edged up to 9.39 
billion pounds ($18.12 billion) from 9.30 billion pounds ($17.95 billion). 
</P>
<P>
Burger King, acquired as part of the $5.8-billion takeover of Minneapolis-based 
Pillsbury Co. two years ago, doubled its operating profits, to 125 million 
pounds ($249 million) from 76 million pounds ($150 million). 
</P>
<P>
Burger King's weak performance had been considered the key factor behind 
Pillsbury's takeover, and skeptics believed it might also undermine Grand Met.

Britain's recession is starting to alarm economists, who fear the 
government-induced slowdown to quash inflation may become one of the worst 
slumps in decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a deep and prolonged recession. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of cumulative gross domestic product loss, it could be the 
second-worst recession since the Second World War," said Peter Spencer, an 
economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Economists are increasingly questioning the government's claim that the 
recession will be modest. Recent economic indicators and business surveys all 
show economic activity at its lowest level since the 1980-81 recession, 
Britain's worst slump in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys show the need to repay large personal and business debts built up 
during the 1980s, and slower growth among some of Britain's key trading 
partners points to a long slump.

The Moscow International Stock Exchange hopes to begin trading in a limited 
number of government bonds in January, Russian Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov 
said today.

<P>
The government of Russia, the largest and richest of the 15 Soviet republics, 
was among 20 organizations and individuals that founded the exchange last 
month.

<P>
"We would like to take in the first place a very primitive step," Fyodorov said 
of the decision to start by trading bonds before gradually introducing 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian-supported exchange is smaller and separate from the Moscow Stock 
Exchange founded in November by 187 companies. The Moscow Stock Exchange has 
not yet set an opening date but has ambitious plans to open offices in the New 
York, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Singapore stock exchanges.

Top German sports officials said today that drug testing will be radically 
stepped up in all sports, following allegations of massive doping by German 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Hansen, president of the German Sports Federation, outlined a 12-point 
program to combat drug use following a more than three-hour meeting of sports 
officials in the German capital. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen told a news conference that the federation would not wait for 
international recommendations to fight the use of drugs, but would seek to play 
an active role in cleaning up German sports. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a prominent judge was appointed to head an independent commission 
that will investigate published allegations that many top stars in former East 
Germany, as well as some track and field athletes from former West Germany, 
regularly took performance-enhancing drugs. Heinrich Reiter, the 60-year-old 
president of the federal social court, will head the commission.

STOLEN MONET, 8 OTHER WORKS ARE RECOVERED

Clues from Japan led police to a stolen masterpiece by Claude Monet that gave 
its name to Impressionism, a French police chief said today. 
</P>
<P>
Monet's "Impression Sunrise" and eight other Impressionist works were taken 
from a Paris museum five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
All nine were recovered from a villa on the French island of Corsica on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mireille Ballestrazzi, head of France's art theft police squad, said more than 
12 suspects were being held. One was handed over to a judge, who will decide 
whether to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether those arrested included the hooded bandits who raided 
the Marmottan Museum in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Ballestrazzi said she found the first clues three years ago during an 
investigation in Japan, where experts feared the works could have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
"We got some testimonies that led us to Corsica step by step," she said in a 
television interview. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Monet's 1872 masterpiece -- a misty dawn in Normandy that gave its 
name to the Impressionist movement -- the nine recovered paintings included two 
by Auguste Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
Two were slightly damaged.
