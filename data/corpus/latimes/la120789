The Internal Revenue Service is investigating whether voter registration groups 
that received millions of dollars solicited by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
violated their tax-exempt status by engaging in partisan activity, law 
enforcement sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
IRS auditors in Los Angeles are looking into allegations that the ostensibly 
nonpartisan groups placed undue emphasis on registering more Democrats than 
Republicans. Possible violations would be civil, not criminal, said the 
sources, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The main group, the Center for Participation in Democracy, has been operated by 
Cranston's son, Kim, in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, who has come under fire for soliciting contributions from the owner 
of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, reacted angrily to a reference 
to his son in a New York Times report saying that the groups were being 
investigated by "federal law enforcement authorities." 
</P>
<P>
"It makes my blood boil to see attempts to smear my son and drag him into the 
mud," Cranston said in a statement that he read at a news conference in Los 
Angeles. "I know personally from Kim of the exquisite pains he took to ensure 
that registration drives he was associated with were legal, proper and 
bipartisan." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston called on FBI Director William S. Sessions to find out who had leaked 
word of the inquiry. Cranston's attorney, William W. Taylor III, suggested in a 
letter to Sessions that the anonymous sources were "motivated . . . by 
political rather than law enforcement objectives." 
</P>
<P>
It had been reported earlier that the FBI is conducting a separate criminal 
review of intervention by Cranston and four other senators on behalf of Lincoln 
S&amp;L owner Charles H. Keating Jr., who contributed heavily to their 
campaigns as well as to the voter groups. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston solicited $850,000 from Keating on behalf of three voter registration 
groups at about the same time that the senator met with federal officials in 
1987 to discuss regulatory actions involving Lincoln. Cranston has also 
received $47,000 in direct campaign contributions from Keating. 
</P>
<P>
The other senators who participated with Cranston in the sessions with 
regulators -- Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) -- received a total of about 
$475,000 in contributions from Keating. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether the five senators performed favors in exchange for 
Keating's donations is being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee, at 
the request of Common Cause, a citizens' lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
The government seized Lincoln last April, more than two years after regional 
S&amp;L regulators had advocated a federal takeover. Its financial collapse 
will cost taxpayers an estimated $2 billion or more, making it the most costly 
thrift failure ever. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has raised a total of more than $7 million in recent years for six 
voter registration groups, of which five are tax-exempt. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS inquiry focuses on indications detailed by The Times in October that 
the five tax-exempt groups backed by Cranston might not have lived up to their 
nonpartisan label. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews, public records and even some of the working documents of the groups 
showed that special pains were taken to register voters who would be likely to 
vote Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
IRS officials have said that it is permissible for groups to concentrate 
registration activities in certain areas as long as people are not pressured 
into signing up with one party over another. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has acknowledged that his groups targeted areas likely to produce 
large numbers of new Democratic voters, but he has insisted that potential 
Republican voters were not turned away. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1986 letter soliciting funds for the first of his tax-exempt groups, 
Cranston cited "keeping my Senate seat in the Democratic column" as the first 
of four issues of "great national significance" at stake in the 1986 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Terrie Monaghan, a former business manager at the Center for Participation in 
Democracy, said that leaders of the group "got upset if too many Republicans" 
were registered. 
</P>
<P>
Center leaders expected that Democrats would make up about three-quarters of 
the names that each worker collected, said Monaghan, herself a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Pope, a member of the group's board, said that about 70% of the 233,000 
voters that the group registered last year were Democrats, with the rest 
divided among Republicans, independents and those who refused to state their 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Cranston, a top aide to California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, was on vacation 
Wednesday and could not be reached for comment on the IRS inquiry. 
</P>

Staff writers Keith Love and Kenneth Reich in Los Angeles contributed to this

MAKING AIR TRAVEL SAFE FOR BABY; 
</P>
<P>
PRESSURE IS MOUNTING TO MAKE INFANT SAFETY SEATS MANDATORY ON JETLINERS. 
AIRLINES ARE EAGER TO PROMOTE FAMILY TRAVEL BUT FEAR A REVOLT FROM PARENTS.

<P>
The death of an infant in July's airliner tragedy at Sioux City, Iowa, has 
revived an emotional debate about the safety of the 9,000 babies who fly on 
U.S. airlines each day. 
</P>
<P>
Though accidents are rare and most infants fly on laps without mishap, babies 
who do so are especially vulnerable in a crash. The force of gravity builds in 
a crash, turning a tiny child into an 100-pound weight, making it almost 
impossible for a mother's arms to hold a child. The Federal Aviation 
Administration allows infants under 2 to sit on laps and fly free, but safety 
experts contend that infants who travel that way are not safe. "There is no way 
to secure a child in your lap," said Richard Chandler, who investigated crash 
survivability for the FAA for 18 years, and is now retired. 
</P>
<P>
The final moments of United Airlines' ill-fated Flight 232 dramatically 
illustrate Chandler's contention. 
</P>
<P>
As the crippled jet approached Sioux City's airport, passenger Gayle Notgrass 
slipped a pillow under her baby's head and covered him with a blanket. It was a 
poor cushion but the best she could do. 
</P>
<P>
She put her sleeping 23-month-old son on the floor, as a flight attendant had 
instructed, and clutched his legs and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Three rows ahead of Notgrass, Lori Michaelson struggled to keep 11-month-old 
Sabrina on the floor. It was hard to grip the baby, who was crying and trying 
to stand up. 
</P>
<P>
Farther back in the plane, Sylvia Tsao wrapped her legs around 23-month-old 
Evan and tucked his head between her knees. Anxious to keep him close, she bent 
over and pushed her face down on his head. 
</P>
<P>
A voice yelled, "Brace, brace!" and then, Tsao remembered, "the world seemed to 
end." The right wing of the doomed McDonnell Douglas DC-10 touched the ground, 
and the plane cartwheeled across farms near the airport, breaking apart. 
</P>
<P>
Notgrass lost her grip on her baby; he flew from her hands and bounced against 
a wall like a tennis ball. Miraculously, she caught him. The Michaelson and 
Tsao infants sailed from their mothers' arms like tiny missiles and disappeared 
into the smoke-filled plane. 
</P>
<P>
Notgrass was able to get out of the plane with her baby. The Michaelson baby 
landed in an overhead bin and was rescued by a passenger who heard her cries. 
Tsao tried frantically to reach her baby, but another passenger guided her from 
the fiery wreck. The baby died, along with 111 other people. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Sioux City tragedy, the FAA faces pressure from consumers 
and Congress to make air travel safer for infants. The issue has taken on 
greater significance in light of new crash studies that show infants are at 
risk, and airline fare promotions that encourage families to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the drive for improved infant safety is the Los Angeles Area Child 
Passenger Safety Assn., which wants the FAA to require automobile safety seats 
for infants on aircraft. In June, the association petitioned the agency for a 
safety seat rule, triggering a legal process that forces the FAA to review its 
infant safety policy. Rep. Jim Lightfoot (R-Iowa) has threatened to introduce 
legislation to require the seats if the FAA fails to act. 
</P>
<P>
Infant safety threatens to spark a debate within the Department of 
Transportation, which oversees the FAA. The FAA's sister agency, the National 
Transportation Safety Board, has said it may recommend infant safety 
improvements to the FAA when the Sioux City crash investigation is complete. 
The NTSB has favored safety seats in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Resistance by Parents 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has not indicated how it will act. One FAA official who is actively 
involved in studying infant safety said she is not sure that parents want to 
use safety seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has indicated to us in the past that they want the option of not 
buying a ticket for a child under age 2," FAA cabin safety specialist Donnell 
Pollard said. "They like that freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Pollard said there is no doubt about what she would do. "If I had a child, I 
would use a safety seat." 
</P>
<P>
A mandatory infant seat rule faces resistance from the airline industry, which 
favors voluntary use of safety seats. Airline executives are concerned that 
mandatory seats would put airlines in the rental business, since not all 
parents own automobile safety seats. The industry also fears a consumer revolt 
if parents are told they must buy tickets for infants who now fly free. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Northcott, a safety expert for United Airlines, said the industry 
recognizes that infant safety needs improvement, but the problem is a tricky 
one. "We are not moving slowly for the sake of being slow." 
</P>
<P>
Though rental car companies, such as Hertz and Avis, have provided infant 
safety seats for years, the airlines say it is more difficult for them to do 
so. Rental car companies are able to keep safety seats in stock because the 
cars, along with safety seats, are usually returned to the same location where 
they were picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Safety a Sensitive Topic 
</P>
<P>
Airline passengers presumably would be more likely to drop off a rented safety 
seat at their destination. This means airlines would have to haul safety seats 
back to the airports where demand is greatest. 
</P>
<P>
Northcott was among the few airline executives willing to discuss infant 
safety, a sensitive topic because airlines depend on a safe image to sell 
tickets. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Pan America World Airways and 
Trans World Airlines declined to talk about safety seats. They referred 
questions to the Air Transport Assn., an industry group that is studying the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over infant safety is not new, but it has gained strength with a new 
study that shows the value of safety seats. 
</P>
<P>
Just a month before the Sioux City disaster, an FAA crash test showed that 
baby-sized dummies strapped into automobile safety seats survived simulated air 
crashes. Baby dummies that sat on laps were crushed by their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA tests support the findings of a 1981 Harvard University Medical School 
team. Using crash data from 1976 to 1979, the Harvard researchers found that 
infants traveling on laps were five times more likely to die in air crashes 
than adults using seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile safety seats would have saved three of the five infants killed in 
so-called survivable air accidents during that period, the Harvard researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard report came in the wake of a 1978 United Airlines crash near 
Portland, Ore., that killed three children and drew attention to a need for 
infant restraints. In 1982, however, the FAA rejected a proposed rule requiring 
infant seats, saying that it would cost the airlines too much compared with the 
relatively few lives that would be saved. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the FAA has allowed automobile safety seats to be used on aircraft, 
but does not require them. The agency has left it up to the airlines to decide 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Safety advocates say the FAA is too permissive when it comes to infant safety. 
"The government is implying by its behavior that there is no risk," said 
Stephanie Tombrello, director of the Los Angeles Area Child Passenger Safety 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that infant safety seats are not required on airliners gives parents a 
false sense of security, she said. "Most people think that if the seats were 
necessary, they would be required," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most safety experts agree that the special seats used for babies in cars 
provide the safest way for infants to travel. The safety seat holds the baby in 
place with a shoulder harness and a lap belt and is attached to the aircraft 
seat with a seat belt. FAA tests show that a safety seat can protect the baby 
in forces 16 times as powerful as gravity -- more than an aircraft seat itself 
is built to withstand. 
</P>
<P>
Crashes are not the only concern about infant passengers on airliners. Sudden 
and severe turbulence aloft is also a danger. When United Flight 90 slammed 
into a violent air pocket over Kansas in June, a 4-month-old infant was thrown 
from its mother's arms into a coat rack. The baby's neck was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Adult arms can't always handle a child," said United's Northcott, who always 
uses a safety seat for her 1-year-old during plane trips. "Anyone who says 
anything else is massaging what we already know." 
</P>
<P>
Lap babies are at risk because the increased forces of gravity experienced 
during a crash make an infant feel heavier and harder to hold. Retired FAA 
accident investigator Chandler said that even moderate turbulence -- the sort 
that upsets food trays -- can loosen a mother's grip on her child. The force in 
moderate turbulence, he said, is similar to dropping 115 feet -- child in arms 
-- on the Magic Mountain amusement park's high-speed Colossus roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
It is even trickier to hold a baby in a rough landing, when the increased force 
of gravity can instantly transform a tiny, 20-pound infant into a 100-pound 
weight. "Imagine that someone dropped a 100-pound sack of flour in your lap," 
Chandler said. "Could you catch it?" 
</P>
<P>
Though Flight 232 passenger Notgrass, of Pine Bluff, Wyo., was able to catch 
her baby, the other two mothers traveling on the plane with infants were not. 
</P>
<P>
"Infants', toddlers' and young children's safety should no longer be ignored as 
if they do not count," Tsao, of Albuquerque, later told federal investigators. 
"If these kids need aircraft safety seats, then parents must be warned that 
they should put kids in them!" 
</P>
<P>
Major airlines say they permit safety seats approved by the FAA, but their 
policies are not widely known -- even by airline employees. When The Times 
called reservation agents for 13 U.S. airlines, most agents had to look up the 
policy or ask a supervisor. Some gave incorrect information. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the gate agent," said a reservation clerk for Continental Airlines, 
when asked if car seats are allowed. "Some gate agents accept them and some 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
No Clear Seat Policy 
</P>
<P>
An Eastern Airlines reservation agent said incorrectly that the seats are 
allowed on airliners only if they can be folded up, but she discouraged their 
use. "Why would you want to do that? You can carry the baby on your lap for 
free." 
</P>
<P>
A United Airlines reservation clerk, when questioned, wrongly advised: "They 
banned car seats. You have to put them in with check-in baggage." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles safety advocate Cheryl Kim said some parents are told by airline 
workers to store car seats in overhead bins. Other parents report that they 
have been allowed to use car seats for their infants -- but not during takeoffs 
and landings, the most hazardous parts of a trip. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield mother Carolyn Sherman paid $398 for an extra round-trip ticket to 
assure her 16-month-old daughter a seat on a flight to New York in August. Even 
so, airline workers told her to check her safety seat with her other baggage. 
</P>
<P>
"When you tell them you bought a . . . (ticket for the baby), they are 
incredulous. They don't believe you." Sherman eventually was allowed to use the 
car seat, but that did not end the hassle. Flight attendants later refused to 
bring baby Courtney a meal. "I had to show her ticket to everyone, again and 
again," Sherman recalled in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was trying to transport heroin," said Tombrello's sister, 
Vanessa Merton, who took her 2-year-old son with her on a European trip last 
spring. Merton said a Pan Am ticket agent would not let her use a car seat for 
her son until she put up a fuss. "It's only people who make pests out of 
themselves that get to use the seats." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Transport Assn. recently endorsed voluntary use of safety seats, 
saying: "Infants and children are much safer in an approved restraint." But the 
industry says mandatory safety seats pose big problems. Northcott said airlines 
feel pressure to provide the seats, since many parents -- especially foreign 
travelers on connecting flights -- do not have them. 
</P>
<P>
Northcott said airlines might also have to supply the seats to assure that they 
are in good condition. She said some parents might be satisfied to have their 
infants use a broken or worn safety seat in the family car but that a damaged 
seat would not be acceptable to the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Headache for Airlines 
</P>
<P>
Providing the seats would create a tremendous logistical headache for airlines. 
"How many seats should we keep in which cities, and where should we store 
them?" asked Northwest Airlines safety expert Carol J. Grewing. "Should we 
charge a fee for their use? Should we require parents to make a reservation for 
the safety seat? It is a major complication for the airlines to address." 
</P>
<P>
It would also cause airlines to take a close look at air fares. The airlines 
are loath to give away seats, but they do not want to prevent families from 
flying. Industry executives interviewed said airlines might have to consider a 
new special fare for infants if safety seats become mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Airline executives say the expense of an extra ticket is one reason why few 
parents use the safety seats. 
</P>
<P>
"I think many parents hesitate because of the extra cost," Grewing said. She 
recalled that she had recently advised a neighbor to put her 1-year-old child 
in a car seat during a flight but had met with resistance. "She wrinkled her 
nose and said she didn't want to pay for the baby's seat." 
</P>
<P>
Car seats have other drawbacks, Grewing said. The seats are bulky and heavy -- 
"hard for parents to lug around an airport, along with a baby and other 
luggage." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Transport Assn. has asked the FAA to come up with a car seat that is 
lightweight and easier to handle. The industry also wants a narrower seat that 
could be slid more easily into compact airline seats. Some car seats are so 
bulky that they block aisles. 
</P>
<P>
But safety advocates say that the FAA should not wait until engineers come up 
with a better seat. "The youngest and most dependent of us are the least 
provided for," said Sioux City social worker Jerry Eaton, who became a safety 
activist after he counseled the Tsao family. 
</P>
<P>
"Flotation devices, oxygen masks, seat belts -- they are all designed for 
adults," Eaton added. "There is nothing for children."

</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: EGON KRENZ RESIGNS AS CHIEF OF STATE AND MANFRED GERLACH IS 
APPOINTED TO THE POST. THE GOVERNMENT APPEALS FOR CALM IN THE TENSE NATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany named a non-Communist head of state for the first time Wednesday 
as the government struggled to "stabilize this country step by step." 
</P>
<P>
Manfred Gerlach, 61, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, was appointed 
acting chief of state after the sudden resignation of Egon Krenz, the former 
Communist Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a political and economic crisis and we're trying to get out," 
government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to cooperate with all political forces, political movements and 
groups to stabilize this country again step by step," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But tension and distrust clearly have been mounting in recent days with 
widespread charges that Communist leaders amassed fortunes in hard currency 
through shady deals that included smuggling weapons and art. 
</P>
<P>
Fears that angry citizens might storm military installations prompted the 
government to issue an urgent appeal Wednesday for "calm and restraint." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of East Germans tried to overrun offices of the hated security police 
earlier this week in Leipzig and were held back by opposition groups who formed 
a human chain. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried Wednesday night by the official ADN news agency, the 
government reported "increasing signs" of planned attacks against army bases. 
</P>
<P>
No specific incidents or other details were provided, but the statement 
included a thinly veiled warning that the soldiers are "armed and trained" to 
counter any "attack from outside." 
</P>
<P>
Army officers issued a statement, addressed to citizens and soldiers, saying: 
"Such intrusions could cause danger for the security of the German Democratic 
Republic. Illegal entry to weapons, munitions and fuel will be blocked." 
</P>
<P>
The military leaders expressed "concern for securing peace" and pledged to work 
with Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces to secure peace in Central Europe. "Only 
together can we preserve the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic and 
protect our country from anarchy and chaos," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Meyer said that "everybody is worried about the growing 
tension. In any such situation, there are groups which try to create terror and 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Krenz, 52, was further evidence that the rudderless 
Communist Party is sinking. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said Krenz "made a lot of mistakes" since replacing Erich Honecker as 
party chairman and head of state in October. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, was unceremoniously expelled from the party Sunday and is under 
house arrest for alleged misuse of office. 
</P>
<P>
"Krenz was very hesitant about deciding things, and there was pressure both 
within and outside the party," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was choosing the wrong people. He would choose people for the Politburo who 
had been rejected on the regional level in their own districts," Meyer said. 
"That happened two or three times." 
</P>
<P>
Krenz has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. The former Dresden party 
boss acknowledged that he lacked public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"My years of membership in the Council of State and Politburo under the 
leadership of Erich Honecker diminished confidence in my policy for the renewal 
of socialism," Krenz said in a statement carried by the official news agency. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was resigning "in the interest of stability." 
</P>
<P>
Krenz warned of "anti-socialistic forces" in East Germany and called for a 
joint effort to repel them. "In this hour of greatest danger, all those who 
love this country must stand together out of patriotic duty," said. 
</P>
<P>
The position of chief of state is a largely ceremonial post, and the only key 
position that Krenz still held after the entire Communist Party Politburo and 
Central Committee resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach said he would serve until Parliament can elect a permanent president. 
No date for that has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach, a lawyer, quickly took up the cause of free elections and other causes 
pressed by opposition leaders as the Communist Party unraveled over the last 
several weeks. He demanded that the party give up its monopoly on power and 
permit greater openness. 
</P>
<P>
But he also made it clear in a television interview that "we are a party of 
socialists in a socialist system. The task before us now is to define what 
socialism means and how we can make it meet the needs of the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Communist-dominated Parliament ended the guarantee of the 
party's leading role in society, and last weekend, the entire party Politburo 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the party is now in the hands of a 25-member working group, which 
is drafting a new program and constitution. 
</P>
<P>
With Krenz's resignation, the group announced it will hold an emergency party 
congress Friday, a week earlier than it had planned. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything hangs on that party congress," said a spokesman for the working 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The government, headed by Prime Minister Hans Modrow, has sought to distance 
itself from the tainted Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow, himself a Communist Party member, enjoys some measure of popular 
support and has not been implicated in the corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"His image is squeaky clean," said one Western diplomat speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Meyer said there is "a very clear separation now between 
the party, state and government." 
</P>
<P>
He said that under Honecker, "Everything was together and the party more or 
less decided what the government had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Modrow's government includes 11 non-Communists and 16 Communists. Previously,

After years of East German government corruption and mismanagement, hard-line 
Communist Party leader and President Erich Honecker was forced to resign Oct. 
18. He was replaced by Egon Krenz, a party member described as a moderate. But 
he proved unpalatable to the nation's ever more militant reformers and stepped 
down Wednesday. Manfred Gerlach, leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, became 
acting head of state, the first non-Communist ever named to the post.

MANILA REBELLION ENDS; GOVERNMENT DENIES DEAL 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of mutinous soldiers, singing, boasting and draped with belts of 
ammunition, marched back to their barracks early today, abandoning the besieged 
financial district and ending a bloody weeklong coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The dawn withdrawal came hours after Aquino declared a state of emergency 
throughout the Philippines to stem the deepening political and economic crisis. 
She assumed broad powers to censor radio and TV broadcasts, to take over public 
utilities and to speed the flow of food, fuel and other basic commodities. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials, denying any deal with the insurgents, called the rebel 
march a "surrender." But a rebel leader insisted that his commandos had 
"achieved some victories" and that their march was not a surrender. The 
commandos carried an arsenal of bazookas, grenade launchers and assault rifles. 
Others drove armored personnel carriers emblazoned with rebel insignia. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Abraham Puruggunan, the rebel commander who held the luxury 
Inter-Continental Hotel during the battle of the Makati financial district, 
insisted that the rebels were "voluntarily returning to barracks." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not surrendering," he told reporters as national television broadcast 
what appeared more a march of triumph than a defeated mutiny. "I repeat, we did 
not surrender." 
</P>
<P>
Behind him, several rebels held their hands up in a time-out sign, a visual 
warning that the rebellion that plunged Aquino's government into its worst 
crisis may yet resume. 
</P>
<P>
Government commanders appeared surprised by the size of the large rebel force 
as the buoyant and chanting soldiers marched two miles to their barracks at Ft. 
Bonifacio, headquarters of the Philippine army and marines. 
</P>
<P>
The chief government military negotiator, Brig. Gen. Arturo Enrile, said the 
government made no concessions to the right-wing rebels who had besieged 
Makati, turning the high-rise district into a free-fire zone. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, finally, reason prevailed," Enrile said of tense night-long 
negotiations. He said the government agreed that the rebels "would be treated 
humanely, justly and fairly." 
</P>
<P>
"Since they did this, they should be man enough to suffer the consequences," 
Enrile said. Asked if another coup attempt is likely, he replied, "I can only 
cross my fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Another negotiator said that the government would probably court-martial 20 to 
30 officers who launched the coup late last Thursday but that enlisted men 
would be pardoned. In previous coup attempts, rank-and-file participants were 
let off with sentences ranging from 30 push-ups to Bible study classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The siege is over," said Malacanang Palace spokesman Adolfo Azcuna. "We are 
happy this is finally resolved." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the economy and political fabric of the country is still intact," 
Azcuna said. "The fundamentals are still there. The people are determined to 
join hands to rebuild from the damage." 
</P>
<P>
Rebels continued to hold the Mactan Air Base in Cebu province, about 325 miles 
south of Manila, but they are expected to follow the lead of the rebels in 
Manila. Cebu is the economic success story of Aquino's administration, with the 
busiest port, heaviest exports and fastest-growing employment center. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who had fled or been evacuated from the fighting were warned to avoid 
the neighborhood of towering hotels, offices and condominiums until bomb 
experts could comb the buildings for booby traps or forgotten ammunition and 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be bombs there," a TV announcer cautioned, warning that it could 
take two days to clear the area. 
</P>
<P>
Many buildings had shattered windows and were pocked with bullet holes, but 
damage appeared surprisingly slight, given the tens of thousands of rounds of 
machine-gun fire, grenades and 90-millimeter recoilless rifle shells that were 
fired during four harrowing days of urban guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"The group that held this are very highly trained," explained Lt. Col. 
Edilberto Adan, who assisted in the negotiations. "They conserve their 
ammunition. They have good aim. They are very careful not to damage property. 
They are the best in the army." 
</P>
<P>
National television broadcast hours of rebel interviews and claims of victory. 
At one point, a television announcer referred to the mutineers as "rebels, 
rather I mean reformists." 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the broadcasts violated Aquino's state of emergency, which 
specifically banned "the airing of rebellious/terrorist propaganda, comments, 
interviews, information and other similar and/or related materials." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials insisted that the constitutionally sanctioned state of 
emergency was considerably different from the martial law that Aquino's 
predecessor, Ferdinand E. Marcos, imposed in 1972 as a pretext for arresting 
thousands of opponents and keeping himself in power. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's late husband, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., was the first and most notable 
victim of Marcos' martial law. He spent eight years in solitary confinement. In 
August, 1983, he was assassinated as he returned from exile in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not martial law," Labor Secretary Franklin Drilon said of the current 
situation. "There's no curfew, there's no suspension of the writ of habeas 
corpus (a safeguard against illegal detention). Congress will continue. We will 
continue to enjoy our rights. It only empowers government to check those who 
may not be delivering basic services." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the government will also enforce new price controls on rice, 
flour and other basic commodities and arrest shop owners who have more than 
doubled the prices of pork and other foods since the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement Wednesday came shortly after an estimated 400 rebellious army 
Scout Rangers who had besieged the Makati district released more than 600 
Americans, British, Swiss, West Germans, Japanese, Australians and other 
foreigners trapped there since Saturday in international hotels, luxury 
condominiums and high-rise offices. 
</P>
<P>
Despite sporadic sniper fire, a cease-fire that went into effect at 6 a.m. 
Wednesday held through the day and into the night as a loyal senior officer met 
with the rebel field commander, Lt. Col. Rafael Galvez, to work out the 
agreement to end the siege. Galvez had insisted publicly that the rebels would 
not surrender until Aquino resigns. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them their demands are non-negotiable as far as the government is 
concerned," said Enrile, the government negotiator and commander of the 
Philippine Military Academy. "And they more or less did not contradict me. Not 
that much anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Enrile said the renegade soldiers "would like to be able to prove their point," 
and that he had told them they had already proved it. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had mentioned Aquino's ultimatum Saturday that all rebel forces 
must "surrender or die," Enrile smiled and paused, then replied: "We have not 
taken that up. They have not taken it up. And I have not taken it up." 
</P>
<P>
There were indications Wednesday before the agreement was announced that at 
least one group of rebels was willing to surrender. And four young rebels shed 
their rifles and fatigues and tried to slip out of the battle zone by joining 
foreign tourists being evacuated. The four were stopped at a police checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The release of all foreigners defused a tense stalemate during which U.S. 
officials privately expressed growing unease at Aquino's apparent inability to 
stop the fighting in Makati's high-rise canyons. At least 77 people died in the 
attempted coup. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. Embassy official insisted at a press briefing Wednesday afternoon 
that Washington's confidence in Aquino is unshaken. He attempted to put the 
best possible face on the week's events. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the sixth coup attempt," he said, "and it's got to tell you that the 
government has the ability to survive this kind of challenge." 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino's call for U.S. help -- specifically the U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom 
jet fighters that pinned rebel planes on the ground last Friday, ending a 
string of rebel successes -- continued to draw fire from Aquino's critics. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows the U.S. government has the power to install and maintain a 
president," said Aquino's former defense secretary, Juan Ponce Enrile, now a 
harsh critic. "They removed Marcos and installed Aquino. She is perceived as 
their creation." 
</P>
<P>
Even the U.S. Embassy official conceded that the cost of the crisis is likely 
to increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The investment community is going to look at this and take a pause," he said.

EVIDENCE GROWS FOR MAJOR QUAKE IN NORTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
New evidence reinforces a growing concern that the Pacific Northwest is likely 
to be hit by an earthquake that will be far more powerful than the region is 
prepared for, scientists reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of scientists from a wide range of institutions have collected evidence 
that indicates that major quakes killed giant trees along the Washington coast 
several hundred years ago and plunged some areas below sea level. Other 
research shows that strain accumulating along the Oregon coast is likely to 
lead to a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been so few quakes there in recent years that many people have 
been lulled into a false sense of security, scientists say, despite the fact 
that new evidence indicates that the Pacific Northwest may be in for a 
megaquake like the one that struck the coast of Chile in 1960. The Chilean 
temblor, with a magnitude of 9.5, was the most powerful in recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "the state of preparedness is abysmal" in Oregon and Washington, said Craig 
Weaver of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, which has experienced significant quakes in recent decades, is a 
little better prepared than Oregon, scientists told the American Geophysical 
Union here Wednesday, but both states have many buildings that scientists say 
would not fare well in a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon has not had a major quake in more than 250 years, according to a study 
released Wednesday by UC Berkeley and the University of Oregon. Yet there is a 
"tremendous buildup of elastic strain" in the geological formations along the 
Oregon coast, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
The report warned that cities such as Portland and Salem, Ore., are "severely 
unprepared" for the great quake that many scientists now believe has struck 
that area in the past and should be expected in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Northwest is a "subduction zone," meaning one of the giant tectonic 
plates that make up the Earth's outer crust is diving under another. As the 
Pacific Plate inches under the North American Plate, it creates the volcanoes 
that dot the region, including Mt. St. Helens, which erupted nearly a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, scientists had thought that the Pacific Plate slid so smoothly 
beneath the North American Plate that the process did not produce giant 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists have discovered layered geological formations that suggest 
violent earthquakes in the past. The evidence consists mainly of layers of 
saltwater fossils interspersed with layers of plant fossils that could only 
have existed above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
That suggests that the coast has dropped and then been pushed back up several 
feet over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
The most plausible explanation for that, insisted U.S. Geological Survey 
geologist Brian Atwater, is a series of "very great earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists reported additional evidence Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
David Yamaguchi, a forester with the University of Colorado's Institute of 
Arctic and Alpine Research, said he has found "strong evidence" of a sudden 
drop in a 60-mile-long stretch of coastline in southern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi said tree-ring samples from dozens of dead western red cedars show 
that the trees died suddenly in the late 1600s, most likely after their roots 
were submerged in saltwater when the land suddenly dropped. 
</P>
<P>
In subsequent years, the land on which the dead trees stand was slowly pushed 
back up, and today, the trees dot the coastline like dead sentries from a 
violent epoch. 
</P>
<P>
Other evidence gathered by the UC Berkeley-University of Oregon team points to 
"a tremendous buildup of elastic strain" along the coast of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
That strain "most likely gets released as a major earthquake off the Oregon 
coast every 300 to 400 years," the scientists reported. 
</P>
<P>
They based that conclusion on the fact that coastal regions north and south of 
the town of Tillamook have risen an average of about a quarter-inch a year more 
than the town itself over the last 50 years. That tenfold difference means that 
the crust in the area is being deformed severely, and the most likely result 
will be a major earthquake in which the strain is released, according to the 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances are very high that a great earthquake will occur" in that area, 
said geologist Paul Vincent of the University of Oregon. "As to when, that's 
hard to predict." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is convinced. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Sykes of the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory said he fears that his 
colleagues "have jumped the gun" in claiming that the evidence shows a history 
of giant quakes. 
</P>
<P>
Sykes said the Pacific Plate is very young where it subducts beneath the North 
American Plate and it "deforms plastically rather than snagging and breaking" 
as it slips beneath the North American Plate, suggesting that the buildup of 
strain in that region is not sufficient to trigger a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists, however, insist that the similarities between the Pacific 
Northwest and other violent subduction zones are quite strong and thus the 
prospects for major quakes should be regarded as equally strong. 
</P>
<P>
The Geological Survey's Atwater recently spent four months in Chile, studying 
the scars left by the 1960 quake, and he returned more convinced than ever that 
great quakes should be expected in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
He said he found many remnants of the Chilean quake that are similar to what he 
has seen in Washington and Oregon, including layered beds that prove the area 
has repeatedly plunged downward and then been uplifted.

RESEARCHERS ISOLATE GENETIC KEY TO MEMORY, LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers at La Jolla's Salk Institute have found the gene for one of the 
most sought-after chemicals in the brain, a protein that plays a key role in 
early learning and memory. 
</P>
<P>
That protein, called the glutamate receptor, is intimately involved in the 
transmission of signals from one brain cell to another and is thus crucial to 
normal functioning of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Inborn defects in the glutamate receptor can produce epilepsy, while brain 
injuries such as stroke and trauma can trigger malfunctions in the receptor 
that cause permanent brain damage. The isolation of the gene for the receptor, 
reported in today's Nature, may make possible the design of new drugs to combat 
these medical problems and, in the longer term, may lead to drugs that enhance 
memory and learning. 
</P>
<P>
"This discovery is extremely important," said neurobiologist Charles F. Stevens 
of the Yale Medical School. It is the culmination of an intense race to isolate 
and identify the receptor, he said, and the beginning of a new race to develop 
ways to take advantage of the knowledge 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to be working in their labs day and night to follow up on 
this," Stevens said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long recognized that there are four major receptor systems in 
the brain that are involved in the most rapid communications between cells. The 
receptors are all proteins that are embedded in the external membranes of the 
brain cells. When they bind to specific messenger molecules, they trigger 
chemical changes within the cell. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the receptor systems, the so-called GABA and glycine receptors, are 
suppressive, shutting brain cells down so they don't transmit a signal. Such 
systems are involved, for example, in blocking off pain and in modulating 
muscle movements. 
</P>
<P>
The other two systems, the acetylcholinergic and glutamate receptors, are 
excitatory, stimulating a brain cell to send a message on to other brain cells, 
a process known as "firing." They are crucial in learning and memory and in 
computational and recognition processes. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists had previously isolated the genes that code for the other three 
types of receptors, but the gene for the glutamate receptors has proved elusive 
-- presumably because this receptor's structure is substantially different from 
that of the other receptors. The new discovery thus means that neurologists now 
have all four types of receptors available for study and potential 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least half a dozen different types of glutamate receptors in the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
One type of glutamate receptor binds very tightly to a chemical called kainic 
acid. Defects in this type of receptor cause the convulsions that characterize 
epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
Neurobiologist Stephen Heinemann and his colleagues at Salk report today that 
they have isolated and cloned the gene for the glutamate receptor that binds to 
kainic acid. They have shown that when kainic acid binds to this receptor, the 
receptor opens a pore or gate that allows electrically charged calcium ions to 
enter the cell. That influx creates an electrical potential that stimulates the 
cell to send a message on to another cell. 
</P>
<P>
Another type of glutamate receptor binds to a chemical called NMDA. This 
receptor triggers a strengthening of communication links between brain cells 
that is thought crucial to the storage of memories. The NMDA receptor is also 
the site where PCP, the street drug also known as "angel dust," binds to the 
brain to stimulate hallucinations. 
</P>
<P>
The NMDA receptor also plays a crucial role in brain damage when stroke or 
trauma occurs. When the oxygen supply to brain cells is cut off by such an 
event, glutamate leaks out of the cells. Acting through the NMDA receptor, that 
overabundance of glutamate causes the cell to fire repeatedly -- to the point 
where the cell self-destructs. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical companies are extremely interested in learning the structure of 
the glutamate receptors, according to Heinemann, because the knowledge should 
make possible the design of drugs that could interfere with the destructive 
processes by binding to the receptor without causing the cells to fire. 
</P>
<P>
Heinemann said in a telephone interview that, with the knowledge they have 
gained about the structure of the kainic acid receptor gene, they are well 
along the way toward isolating the genes for the other glutamate receptors, 
including the NMDA receptor gene. 
</P>
<P>
Heinemann and his colleagues isolated the kainic gene and the receptor from the 
brains of rats because those animals are relatively easy to work with. Previous 
studies with the other three classes of receptors have shown that the rat 
receptors are very similar to their human counterparts, Heinemann said, and 
that information gained from them is directly applicable to humans. 
</P>
<P>
Two other groups of researchers involving scientists from Salk also report 
independently in today's Nature that they have isolated the genes for other 
brain proteins that bind kainic acid. In both cases, however, the proteins they 
observed -- one from chickens and one from frogs -- are much smaller than that 
observed by Heinemann. And in neither case does the protein appear to have a 
role in communication among brain cells, because the proteins do not cause a 
pore to open in the cell membrane. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely, Stevens said, that these two kainic-acid-binding proteins may be 
involved in previously unknown physiological reactions. But the simultaneous 
appearance of the three papers, he wrote in a commentary in Nature, suggests 
that "something about Southern California must be good for research on 
excitatory amino acids." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW THE GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR WORKS 
</P>
<P>
The glutamate receptor, which is involved in the learning process and memory 
formation, allows brain cells to communicate by converting a chemical signal 
into an electrical signal. 
</P>
<P>
1-When one brain cell or neuron is about to send a message to another, it 
releases a molecule of glutamate, an amino acid. 
</P>
<P>
2-The glutamate molecule binds to the glutamate receptor on the second brain 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
3-This opens a pore or gate that allows electrically charged calcium atoms to 
flow into the cell. 
</P>
<P>
4-The change in the electrical charge within the second brain cell stimulates 
it to send a message on to the next neuron in line by releasing another 
glutamate molecule.

OSCAR-WINNING SONGWRITER SAMMY FAIN DIES AT AGE 87 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sammy Fain, among the last of that select breed of tunesmiths who peddled their 
songs from the backs of trucks and in the dingy hallways of New York City's 
legendary Tin Pan Alley, died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Academy Award-winning songwriter (for "Love Is a Many Splendored 
Thing" and "Secret Love") was 87 when he died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Prolific and pleasant, Fain kept at his piano until shortly before his death, 
adding to a library of song that brought him admission to the Songwriters Hall 
of Fame in 1971. His dozens of tunes, many of them for films, included such 
evergreen melodies as "I'll Be Seeing You," "Katie," "Let a Smile Be Your 
Umbrella," "Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine," "I Can Dream, 
Can't I?," "Dear Hearts and Gentle People," "You Brought a New Kind of Love to 
Me" and "When I Take My Sugar to Tea." 
</P>
<P>
Films he scored or wrote for include "Footlight Parade," "Hellzapoppin," "I'll 
Be Seeing You," "Anchors Aweigh," "Alice in Wonderland," "Calamity Jane," "Love 
Is a Many Splendored Thing," "A Certain Smile," "Tender Is the Night," "Myra 
Breckinridge," "The Rescuers" and others. 
</P>
<P>
In all, he was nominated for nine Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
He also collaborated on four Broadway musicals in the 1950s and 1960s, 
including "Flahooley," "Ankles Aweigh" (revived in 1988), "Christine" and 
"Something More." 
</P>
<P>
Born Samuel Feinberg in New York City, he attended school there and taught 
himself the piano and composition as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
Fain became part of a unique group of early 20th-Century American songwriters 
such as Irving Berlin who were gifted with an abundant talent for simple 
melodies that remained popular decades after the tunes first were heard. 
</P>
<P>
While his success wasn't instantaneous (he worked for several Tin Pan Alley 
song publishers before establishing an independent reputation), it proved 
lasting. 
</P>
<P>
His collaboration with lyricist Irving Kahal produced the first of his hits, 
"Nobody Knows What a Redheaded Momma Can Do." 
</P>
<P>
With Kahal he also wrote "Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella," "Wedding Bells Are 
Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine" and "When I Take My Sugar to Tea," all 
immensely popular hits. 
</P>
<P>
His other lyricists over the years included Bob Hilliard, Paul Francis Webster, 
Sammy Cahn, E. Y. Harburg and Alan and Marilyn Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
Fain came to Hollywood as one of the country's rising young composers in the 
early days of sound films when producers were grinding out musicals with 
abandon. 
</P>
<P>
His first recorded film credit was "It's a Great Life" in 1929 and his last was 
"The Rescuers" in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote songs for Dick Powell ("By a Waterfall"), Mae West ("Now I'm a Lady") 
and Maurice Chevalier ("You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me.") 
</P>
<P>
He and Kahal were reunited on Broadway in 1938 for a long-forgotten flop called 
"Right This Way" but the score contained two of Fain's greatest songs, "I'll Be 
Seeing You" and "I Can Dream, Can't I?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'll Be Seeing You" was used as a signature song by the cabaret singer 
Hildegarde throughout her career while "I Can Dream, Can't I?" was a wartime 
hit for the Andrews Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several years Fain could be seen about Los Angeles playing for 
former radio or film stars or fellow songwriters at their various meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Frail but enthusiastic, he dressed in the latest styles and would offer up his 
long-ago melodies in a reedy, infectious voice and always with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
His awards included several from foreign governments, including Italy and 
France. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year he was presented a special award from the American Society of 
Composers, Authors and Publishers for being "one of America's premier composers 
of popular songs." 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Cahn, a decades-long colleague and collaborator with Fain on "Peter Pan" 
and its enduring song "You Can Fly, You Can Fly, You Can Fly," said his old 
friend leaves "not just a few but a staggering medley of hits, songs that are 
readily identifiable to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
And then he added, "You know, old songwriters never really die because their 
songs keep them alive forever." 
</P>
<P>
Fain is survived by a son, Frank, of New York City. Funeral arrangements were 
pending.

LINE TO ASSUME SENATOR'S SEAT BEGINS TO FORM

While Sen. Joseph B. Montoya sits in a courtroom, charged with political 
corruption, at least two fellow Democrats are eyeing his seat in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) will run against Montoya "whether 
he's acquitted or not" in federal court, sources close to Calderon said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, 39, would not comment on reports he will challenge Montoya. However, 
the lawmaker acknowledged that, if Montoya steps aside, he will campaign for 
the 26th Senate District seat. Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), 60, 
said she, too, is interested in the Montoya Senate seat and will probably jump 
into the contest if Montoya drops out. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya -- standing trial on 12 counts of extortion, bribery, racketeering and 
money laundering -- said Wednesday that he has not "heard or seen anything" 
about Calderon's plans. Motioning toward the federal courtroom packed with 
spectators, Montoya added: "I've got this." 
</P>
<P>
Repeat History 
</P>
<P>
If Montoya is challenged by an Assembly member in the Democratic primary, it 
would repeat political history. In 1978, then-Assemblyman Montoya successfully 
challenged Sen. Alfred H. Song (D-Monterey Park), who was a target of an FBI 
investigation into political corruption. Charges were never filed against Song. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, 50, has asked for a trial as quickly as possible, saying he wanted to 
clear his name so that he can campaign for a fourth Senate term. When he ran 
for reelection three years ago, Montoya drew no opponents. 
</P>
<P>
A Democrat would be heavily favored to win because registered Democrats 
outnumber Republicans 2 to 1 in the district, which straddles the San Gabriel 
Valley and parts of Southeast Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
One legislative source close to Calderon said the assemblyman decided to enter 
the race after reading a memorandum written by federal prosecutors which said 
that Montoya repeatedly demanded "fees for service" -- campaign contributions 
and honorariums -- in exchange for his support for legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Democratic sources said Calderon has been lining up support, talking 
to contributors and forming a campaign organization in preparation for a 
contest against Montoya. "If the seat opens up, I will run for the Senate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, elected to the Assembly in 1982, gained a high profile last year as 
one of the dissident "Gang of Five" Democrats who attempted to topple Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). A year ago, Calderon lost a bid to 
replace Brown as Assembly leader. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said she would not consider challenging Montoya: "I think Joe right now 
is going through an awful lot, and I hope everything works out for him." But if 
Montoya drops out of the race, she said, she would most likely enter. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tanner said the large amount of money required to run for Senate 
"turns me off," adding, "I am not really the greatest fund-raiser in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
With Tanner and Calderon looking toward higher office, several candidates are 
already being mentioned as their possible successors. For instance, Carmen O. 
Perez, an aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, said she would be 
interested in Tanner's seat but would not challenge the assemblywoman. 
</P>
<P>
In Calderon's 59th District, Diane Martinez, president of the board of the 
Garvey school district and daughter of U.S. Rep. Matthew Martinez 
(D-Montebello), said she is campaigning for the seat because she assumes 
Calderon is running for the Senate. Also, Montebello City Councilman Arnold 
Alvarez-Glasman said he is considering entering the contest if Calderon leaves 
the Assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec, warning that Czechoslovakia faces the danger of 
anarchy, said in a nationally televised address Wednesday that he will propose 
a new government today. He threatened to resign if the Communist Party and 
opposition forces do not accept his choices. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot bear responsibility for the further development of the situation" if 
the government does not have "public confidence in the sincerity of our 
intentions," Adamec said. "In that case, I have only one honorable way out -- 
to ask the president of the republic to release me." 
</P>
<P>
He said the country faces a choice of "stability or disruption of the national 
economy, democracy within the framework of the legal order or chaos and 
anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
Adamec has threatened to resign before, but close associates say he is now near 
exhaustion, isolated and deeply frustrated by the conflicting demands he faces 
as the man in the middle between his hard-line fellow Communists and the 
increasingly powerful opposition. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the few Communists who has retained some credibility with opposition 
groups, Adamec has been an important bridge between the two sides. His 
resignation would deepen the nation's political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In less than three weeks, Czechoslovakia has gone through a stunning 
transformation, compressing political changes that have taken its East European 
neighbors months and, in some cases, as in Poland, years. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's shocked by how fast the system has collapsed," said Jan Urban, a 
leading strategist for the opposition Civic Forum. "It shows very clearly how 
rotten, how weak, the system was." 
</P>
<P>
But the rapid change has left both sides unprepared to assume the burden of 
governing at a time when Czechoslovakia faces fundamental economic change. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, as part of negotiations to organize a new government, Communist 
Party chief Karel Urbanek held an unprecedented meeting with Civic Forum's 
leader, the playwright Vaclav Havel. Leading members of the opposition group 
said that Civic Forum is prepared to enter a new government. 
</P>
<P>
"By this weekend, we will have Civic Forum ministers," Urban said. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum has resisted being drawn into the government, insisting that it is 
not a political party. Last week, the group refused to give Adamec a list of 
names for government ministries. Now, the rapid pace of events is moving Civic 
Forum into a more traditional political role, causing deep misgivings in some 
of its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party does not want to give up power," Urban said. "It wants us 
to take responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The move, he said, could trap Civic Forum into taking blame for government 
action it cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand this," he said, "but do we have a choice?" 
</P>
<P>
The next government is widely expected to be forced to take difficult and 
unpopular steps to right the economy, which has deteriorated during years of 
Communist mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec's new government will be the second he will have proposed this week. 
Sunday, he put forward a government consisting of 16 Communists and five 
non-Communists, and the opposition denounced it as insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Communist and opposition leaders have conducted intense 
negotiations to produce a new list. The process has been extraordinarily 
difficult, according to people involved. 
</P>
<P>
Communist leaders have recognized the need for new officials. Party Chairman 
Urbanek said at Wednesday morning's negotiating session that he wants the 
Communists to be represented in the government by young and competent people, a 
party spokesman said, and Civic Forum members confirmed this account. 
</P>
<P>
Urbanek also assured Civic Forum that the Communists realize "the deeply rooted 
mistrust" with which they are regarded. They also understand that "the party 
must transform itself radically to become one of several forces with equal 
participation in Czechoslovak political life," Havel told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But Urbanek conceded, Havel said, that he faced considerable resistance from 
conservative provincial and regional party leaders at a recent meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to explain to them for three hours that the Communist Party does not 
favor a monopoly of power," Havel quoted Urbanek as saying, "but some of them 
did not want to understand." 
</P>
<P>
After years in which the Communists put top priority on conformity, suppressed 
internal dissent and blocked advancement of non-party members, finding 
acceptable people has become a major challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Policies adopted after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 ended the last taste of 
reform here "made selection of the best of the best more difficult," Adamec 
said in his speech. "Not a few talents did not get either education or 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
In the circumstances, finding talented people who are not politically tainted 
has become a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
"We could form the sort of incompetent government we have now in an hour," 
Urban said. "We have to form a competent government. That's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
If a new government is formed, it is expected to begin putting into effect Jan. 
1 plans for economic reform. At least initially, these steps are likely to 
cause unemployment and higher inflation as resources are shifted to areas of 
urgent need and away from costly subsidies for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Political figures, involved in organizing new parties to compete in free 
elections that are expected in the spring, are not eager to take responsibility 
for such actions, said a Western diplomat.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA: CIVIC FORUM TAKES OVER A BUILDING THAT HAD HOUSED THE SOVIET 
FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY.

<P>
Civic Forum activist Jaroslav Koran's eyes sparkled as he stood in Wenceslas 
Square and admired "his" building. He described the way he sees it in his 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Near the second-floor windows is a big television screen with a loudspeaker 
broadcasting history in the making. From a balcony above, Civic Forum leaders 
are addressing the crowd, and they can be seen half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
Koran envisions a simple sign on the building: "Just two letters, 'O' and 'F' " 
-- Civic Forum's initials in Czechoslovak. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted this building," he said. "I decided on it, and I got it. I think it's 
the best building we could get." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Koran, the organization that has led the "polite revolution" moved 
Tuesday from borrowed quarters in the basement of a downtown theater into what 
had been the offices of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Society. 
</P>
<P>
It was an often-chaotic scene, with students lugging stacks of newspapers and 
society membership certificates out of the building as volunteers moved 
partitions and furniture in. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they need me," a young woman munching a sandwich said as she tried to 
direct traffic. "And it's so exciting!" 
</P>
<P>
Rita Klimova, the former wife of a former Communist Party official who now acts 
as official English-language interpreter at Civic Forum press conferences, 
said: "We're hassling over who gets what room. We made up a beautiful 
organization chart, but the rooms don't seem to be built that way." 
</P>
<P>
Koran said the building on Wenceslas Square -- "a kind of showcase for the 
whole Civic Forum" -- is the first of two the city is turning over to the 
mushrooming democratic movement. 
</P>
<P>
It will get another in January, he said, and this one, in a quiet neighborhood 
near the British Embassy, "will be the place for the brain trust of Civic 
Forum, probably a place to deal with some foreign visitors as well." 
</P>
<P>
The six-story building on Wenceslas Square has about 50 offices, and the other 
building is about the same size, Koran said. And there may be a third for a 
press center. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's move was a symbolic watershed, the day this loose collection of 
armchair revolutionaries took on the trappings of permanence. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is working for free so far," Klimova said. "All we've gotten is free 
sandwiches. Within the next few days we hope to establish a clearer situation: 
Who gets paid and how much, or if it's necessary to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Koran exemplifies the way Civic Forum has been run. He was chosen to negotiate 
with city officials for property not because of any special expertise -- he 
translates books for a living -- but because there was a job that needed doing 
and he was free at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
One of his previous tasks was negotiating the return to Czechoslovakia of 
Jaroslav Hutka, the exiled singer and songwriter. Next, Koran said, he may be a 
delegate to a meeting with the premier of the Czechoslovak republic. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the 50 hours of negotiations over a building for the movement, 
Koran needed to retrieve some information from a Civic Forum computer, but he 
was not familiar with the process. A volunteer came to his aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you Koran the translator," he asked? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Koran replied, "and what's your profession?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a janitor." 
</P>
<P>
Koran said the negotiations were complicated by Civic Forum's pressing need to 
leave the theater, where rehearsals for a new production are about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Koran skirted questions about how he managed to get the offices of the 
Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Society, which is reputed to be the haven of 
some of this country's most conservative and dogmatic Communist Party members.

MUTINEERS' POLITICAL CHIEF STILL DEFIANT EVEN AS COUP UNRAVELS

<P>
The scene at the posh suburban home of a rich, anti-government businessman 
Wednesday night was an inside glimpse of a coup gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
Renegade Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, self-styled political leader of the sixth 
unsuccessful coup attempt against Philippine President Corazon Aquino, was 
snacking on pickled eggs and Blue Nun wine and sending perhaps his final taunt 
to his former classmate -- the man who was hunting him. 
</P>
<P>
"Surrender?" Abenina laughed into the phone when he got through to the office 
of Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano. "You tell Montano he can surrender to me." 
</P>
<P>
Montano is the chief of the Philippine Constabulary, the man who commanded the 
government effort to mop up the coup that turned into a siege of Manila's 
financial district by right-wing military rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Defiant, but deceiving. Negotiations were already under way for the surrender 
of nearly 400 crack troops who had laid siege to Makati. Today, the rebel 
troops returned to their barracks, leaving only the top leaders and the 
supporters of the mutiny at large. 
</P>
<P>
As the coup neared its end Wednesday night, the rebel leaders put on their best 
face for a reporter taken to interview the renegade general in his hide-out. 
</P>
<P>
Abenina, unaware of how soon the end would come, conceded that his operation 
had "stalled." He had lost all contact with his fellow coup plotters and, more 
important, with the field commander of the rebel troops who were occupying 
Makati's high-rise office towers and luxury condominiums and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Rafael Galvez, the highly decorated rebel commander in Makati, was 
negotiating on his own after having unilaterally reversed a decision by his 
senior rebel officers to hold Americans who were trapped inside the district. 
</P>
<P>
But even at that late hour, Abenina used the interview for what promises to be 
the next phase of the rebels' campaign to bring down Aquino's government -- a 
propaganda battle -- a contest so important that Aquino used her emergency 
powers Wednesday to ban broadcasts of rebel "propaganda, comments, interviews 
and other similar materials." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels' strategy, their logistical support and the key personalities behind 
their coup attempt also were evident during the visit to Abenina's hide-out. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the end of the Makati siege, Abenina said, the group plans to 
continue the campaign to destabilize the government. He contended that "some 
small (rebel) units" already have entered Manila to "blow up some government 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
"But the government's real weakness now is we have people in their offices," 
Abenina asserted, refusing to identify the rebel infiltrators. "They were 
involved in the action, but they were never identified. Now, these are the 
people who will weaken them." 
</P>
<P>
Abenina also said that the rebel general holding strategic Mactan air base in 
the central province of Cebu would continue to hold out even after the Makati 
surrender. But the rebel general is expected to follow the lead of the Manila 
rebels and give up. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, the air base commander, had a spotless record 
before joining the coup effort. So did most of the junior officers who took 
over the Makati financial district in Manila. At 32, army Maj. Abraham 
Puruggunan, who secured the rebel base in Makati's luxury Inter-Continental 
Hotel, is the youngest soldier ever to achieve his rank. 
</P>
<P>
Abenina named only three of the underground officers who were the key planners 
of the rebellion -- himself, renegade army Lt. Col. Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan 
and Brig. Gen. Jose Zumel, a mutinous officer who was loyal to the late 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Honasan, Abenina said, was in charge of logistics and field operations during 
the initial coup attempt on Nov. 30 and the subsequent siege. Zumel, he said, 
organized rebel support units in rural areas of Luzon Island north of Manila. 
And Abenina said his own responsibility was political organization and, of 
course, propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Honasan has figured prominently in every Philippine coup, including the one 
that brought Aquino to power.

The gun, the infernal gun, has been sitting in a safety deposit box for 22

The old man who has kept it all these years goes to the bank every now and then

the black .38-caliber Colt Cobra pistol that killed Lee Harvey Oswald. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Ruby used the gun to kill the man who assassinated President John F. 
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. And America watched it all on television. There he 
was, the stocky guy with the Cavanagh hat, lunging toward Oswald in the 
basement of the Dallas police department. Then came the shot, the looks of 
horror on the faces of the policemen who surrounded Oswald. It is a scene 
seared into the memories of Americans old enough to have watched it on that 
Sunday long ago. 
</P>
<P>
The man who has had the gun all this time is Jules Mayer, who was appointed 
executor of Ruby's estate after the one-time strip joint owner died of cancer 
in 1967. Now Ruby's brother, Earl, wants the gun -- which Mayer says could be 
worth $250,000 -- and has filed suit to get it. A hearing on the case will be 
held Friday in a Dallas probate court. 
</P>
<P>
And what this all really seems to be about is two men who dislike each other a 
great deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they hate each other," said James Simons, the lawyer for the Ruby 
family. "I think it's a contest of wills between two old men. Nobody wants to 
give any ground. It's a stalemate." 
</P>
<P>
The story of Jack Ruby's gun, as well as the few other things he left behind, 
dates back to 1950. It was in that year that Ruby, whose life ran to the seamy 
side, decided to write a will. And in it, he named Mayer the executor and his 
sisters and nephew the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Roll forward to 1961, when Ruby bought the Colt Cobra in a Dallas pawn shop for 
$75. Roll forward again to Nov. 24, 1963, when Ruby muscled his way through the 
crowd at the Dallas police station and left his grim mark on history. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby died three years later in a Dallas hospital -- the same one at which 
Kennedy and Oswald also died -- and it is at this point that the stories begin 
to diverge. As Earl Ruby tells the story, his brother decided to change the 
will two months before his death. Earl said he was to be appointed the executor 
of the estate and that Jack had called Mayer and told him to tear up the old 
will. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a problem. Jack Ruby lapsed into a coma before the will could be 
properly signed. And Mayer, whether he was told to or not, did not tear up the 
old will. 
</P>
<P>
What Ruby had left behind could be put into a shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
There was the gun, of course, and the hat. There was the suit he wore on the 
day he killed Oswald, a diamond-studded watch, a silver and diamond ring, two 
pairs of swim trunks, a shower cap, an athletic supporter and a letter written 
to a woman. Other than that, Ruby left behind only his 1960 model car, which is 
said to be in storage somewhere in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
After Ruby died, Mayer took possession of the estate. William Alexander, the 
deputy district attorney who prosecuted Ruby, turned the gun over to Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Mayer) said he thought he could sell that gun to pay off debts and wind up 
the estate," said Alexander in a recent interview. "It should have been settled 
a year or two after the time the will was probated. Realistically, the estate 
should have been closed." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't. The years drifted by and, despite several attempts by Earl Ruby 
to settle the estate, Mayer kept control of it. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bargmann, Mayer's attorney, said the Rubys had so clouded the issue of 
ownership that Mayer couldn't have sold the gun if he wanted to because 
potential buyers are fearful of not having clear title to the pistol. But to 
discover why Mayer didn't attempt to settle the dispute and the estate, "you 
will have to ask Mr. Mayer," Bargmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Mayer, who is at least 80 years old, is not returning calls 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Ruby is, though, and he uses words like "shyster" to describe Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack was in jail for more than three years and Mayer never called, never 
visited and he was only a few blocks away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Earl Ruby filed suit, only to be further enraged by the fact 
that Mayer was claiming in excess of $50,000 in legal fees for his work since 
Jack Ruby died. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't do anything in 25 years," said Ruby. And as for fees Mayer is 
asking, Ruby said the amount is more than was paid for the lawyers and 
psychiatrists at his brother's original trial. Included in that were the 
services of famed, and expensive, trial lawyer Melvin Belli. Bargmann said his 
client is entitled to a reasonable fee. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the Internal Revenue Service has demanded $96,000 from the Ruby 
estate, though Simons said no claim was made until news reports circulated that 
the gun used to kill Oswald might bring a handsome price from a collector. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first position is that it's too late, that the statute of limitations has 
run out and that the IRS is not entitled to anything," Simons said. 
</P>
<P>
The actual value of the gun and other things is a matter of conjecture. Mayer 
has claimed in the past that the gun is worth $250,000, but Bargmann also said 
that while several people had expressed an interest in the gun, they weren't 
exactly knocking down doors to get to it. 
</P>
<P>
It was left to Alexander to sum up the irony of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This big fight is over a gun that is worth more than Jack Ruby ever had in his 
life."

JUSTICES GRAPPLE WITH 1ST 'RIGHT-TO-DIE' CASE; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: CONSERVATIVES DOUBT CONSTITUTION APPLIES. MISSOURI DECISION 
COULD UNDERCUT STATE RULINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time, the Supreme Court grappled Wednesday with a disturbing 
question that thousands of family members, doctors and nurses face each year: 
Under what conditions can a profoundly ill or comatose person be allowed to 
die? 
</P>
<P>
Since a 1983 auto accident, Nancy Beth Cruzan has lain unconscious and been fed 
through a surgically inserted tube. Her parents are asking that the tube be 
removed and that their daughter, now 32 years old, be allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Missouri have sought to block her death, asserting the state's 
"unqualified interest . . . in preserving life." 
</P>
<P>
During an unusually philosophical and wide-ranging argument, the justices 
peppered both sides with questions and, as usual, provided only clues as to how 
they would decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The court's conservative members, who frown on newly minted constitutional 
rights, expressed doubts that the Constitution gives persons an unquestioned 
"right to die." 
</P>
<P>
However, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the fifth and pivotal member of the 
conservative majority, appeared to be seeking a narrower ruling that would 
balance the interests of parents and the state through a court proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
In several comments, O'Connor suggested that even though Cruzan's parents 
deserve a chance to speak for the wishes of their unconscious daughter, a judge 
should make the final decision on whether terminating her treatment reflects 
the "best interest" of the patient. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruzan case has attracted intense interest because her family's plight is 
both tragic and, as a result of medical advances, relatively common. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan's life was saved by the quick action of paramedics and emergency room 
doctors, but she suffered irreparable brain damage from the car crash. Like 
about 10,000 Americans, she is characterized as being in a "persistent 
vegetative state," with no hope of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, studies have estimated that of the 1.3 million persons who die each 
year in medical centers, 70% expire after a decision is made either to halt or 
not to undertake extraordinary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the 1976 case of Karen Ann Quinlan in New Jersey, state courts 
across the nation have declared that the Constitution provides a right to be 
free from unwanted medical care. Typically, these rulings have relied on high 
court statements about a "right to privacy" in matters such as birth control, 
marriage and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has never addressed the issue of whether a person has a right 
to die. A broadly written decision in the Cruzan case, if fashioned by the high 
court's conservatives, could undercut all those state court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
However, a narrow decision could be limited only to Missouri. That state's 
Supreme Court, in breaking with other state courts, said that the young woman 
cannot be allowed to die unless her parents could furnish "clear and convincing 
evidence" that she wishes all treatment to end. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cruzan once had told friends that she would not like to exist on 
life-sustaining equipment in a hospital but the Missouri court said that 
evidence was not enough. Citing the same "right-to-life" philosophy that was at 
issue in the Missouri abortion case before the high court in the last term, the 
state judges said that they prefer to "err on the side of life" and keep the 
comatose woman alive. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a lawyer for the Cruzans told the Supreme Court that state 
officials have intervened in the tragedy and blocked the wishes of the young 
woman and her family. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether the state is going to decide this, or the person's 
family is going to make the decision," said William Colby, a lawyer from Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert Presson countered: "This is not a 
situation of the state intruding into someone's privacy. The question is: How 
do you decide for someone who can't decide for herself?" 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's top courtroom lawyer, Kenneth W. Starr, urged the 
justices to avoid a clear ruling on whether the Constitution creates a "right 
to die." Rather, he said, the court should give the states "wide latitude" to 
make their own policies in this area. 
</P>
<P>
Despite obvious disagreement among the justices, they appeared to be in accord 
on some points. The conservative members of the court -- Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia -- seemed to agree that a suffering or 
terminally ill patient has a right to die if she had earlier stated -- perhaps 
in writing -- her wish not to have extraordinary medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the court's liberals did not object to the notion that the 
state could use a judicial proceeding to make sure that the decision to end 
medical treatment was in the "best interest" of the unconscious patient. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the argument, O'Connor kept probing for a middle ground, asking if 
the Constitution requires the state to let the nearest relative decide whether 
an unconscious patient can be allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
If the relatives need not make the decision alone, the state could create a 
judicial forum to hear evidence and decide whether a patient's medical 
treatment or food can be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Left unmentioned Wednesday was the fact that a judge had considered Nancy 
Cruzan's plight during a trial. After hearing testimony from her family, her 
friends and a series of medical experts, Judge Charles Teel Jr. said that the 
young woman had no hope of recovery and would have wanted to die. In May, 1987, 
he issued an order allowing her feeding tube to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Supreme Court, on a 4-3 vote, ignored the judge's conclusions and 
overruled his order. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court likely will issue a ruling in the case (Cruzan vs. Missouri 
Dept. of Health, 88-1503) in the spring.

FALLOPIAN TUBE IMPLANT LEADS TO BIRTH OF GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A baby was born this week at an Orange County hospital after what is believed 
to be the first implant of a frozen, fertilized egg in a woman's Fallopian 
tubes in the United States, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, a healthy 8-pound, 3-ounce girl, was born Monday, said Dr. Lawrence 
B. Werlin, director of fertility services at Hoag Memorial Hospital 
Presbyterian. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, a 37-year-old Mission Viejo resident who was not identified, also 
is doing well, added Werlin, who implanted the embryo taken from the woman's 
27-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
Werlin initially transferred unfrozen eggs, which had been fertilized with 
sperm from the older woman's husband, directly to the mother's womb. That 
attempt failed to result in pregnancy. Later, using a frozen fertilized egg, 
Werlin placed the egg in the woman's Fallopian tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Werlin said the significance of the birth is that in vitro fertilization may 
now have a higher success rate. In vitro fertilization involves having a 
woman's egg fertilized by a man's sperm in a laboratory dish. In some cases, 
the fertilized eggs are frozen for later use.

OPPOSITE LIVES GROW FROM SOUTH-CENTRAL ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES and JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge David W. Williams, 79, grew up poor on 109th Street 
in South-Central Los Angeles, raised in an era when it was still not allowed 
for blacks to buy homes west of Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Winrow, 22, until Wednesday lived on 118th Street in South-Central, a 
little more than a mile away from where the judge was raised. An A student 
before dropping out of high school from "sheer boredom," Winrow was the 
youngest in a poor family of nine children. He was born in an era when blacks 
could move anywhere they liked, but few, including Winrow, could escape the 
poverty that surrounded them. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the two men, separated by two generations but sharing similar 
roots, were brought together in Department 23 of U.S. District Court in 
downtown Los Angeles. In his courtroom, Williams -- bound by a federal 
multiple-offense law that forced his hand -- dispatched Winrow to prison for 
the rest of his life, without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
While of judicial interest as the first use of the mandatory sentence law in 
California, the courtroom paradox also raised fundamental and troubling 
questions about who fails in society, who succeeds, and why. 
</P>
<P>
Named a student of the year in 8th grade at Ralph Bunche Junior High, Winrow 
was known as "the smartest kid in the neighborhood" -- a child who it seems 
could easily have attended college and followed a career. 
</P>
<P>
Winrow's family, which emotionally insisted upon his innocence Wednesday, said 
he had a chance to make it in life, but circumstances were always running 
against him. Relatives, reacting to the harshness of the sentence, found it 
hard to believe the judge was a product of South-Central himself. 
</P>
<P>
"If that judge had ever been on this street, then he'd know what it was like," 
said Vincent Scott, one of Richard's six brothers. "(Williams) didn't grow up 
here. If he grew up in this neighborhood, how could he judge my brother?" 
</P>
<P>
Today, East 118th Street and 109th Street mirror one another; both are lined 
with trees and modest homes. And children in both neighborhoods today have a 
high school dropout rate of nearly 50%. Gang graffiti mars industrial buildings 
that stand where grassy fields once were. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, long a resident of Bel-Air, is intimately familiar with 
South-Central's troubles, having presided over 4,000 criminal cases arising 
from the Watts riots of 1965, and watching jobs move out and crime go up in the 
area in more recent times. But he remembers a more nostalgic time, when he 
practiced law on Central Avenue "and people could stroll down the street 
without any premonition of danger." 
</P>
<P>
As Williams remembers, "the whole society was different" in South-Central in 
the 1920s and '30s. Social pressure was so great that if a boy got in trouble 
with the law, his family would pack up and move away. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhoods were good, and if a kid was arrested the shame of it would 
drive a family out," he said in an interview. "Now the question (in the 
South-Central area) is which families have not had a son arrested." 
</P>
<P>
No matter how bad the environment, Williams said, it does not provide an excuse 
for criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I blame the young people of my own race for not getting an education and for 
taking the easy way and for trafficking in drugs and joining gangs," Williams 
said. "But there is blame to share, because our young people were not denied a 
chance for a job like they are today." 
</P>
<P>
At Winrow's house on Wednesday, such sociological musings seemed off the mark. 
A member of the family had been sent off to prison for a long, long time, and 
those left behind did not seem to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
The family, so emotionally distraught over the sentence handed down by 
Williams, did not clearly understand that their brightest star would spend the 
rest of his life in prison. His mother, Lavern, believed the sentence would 
last only 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's too stiff a penalty for a young man," she said, speaking softly 
and holding back tears. If Winrow was guilty, then he should get "time to think 
about it, yes. But not 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Though a reporter attempted to explain that it was a life sentence, the family 
was unshaken in its belief that Winrow would be free in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking her head sadly, her voice fading, the mother said, "I don't feel he 
deserved 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow had three prior convictions on narcotics violations when he was arrested 
last December in a raid at his East 118th Street home and charged with 
possessing 5.5 ounces of cocaine. Prosecutors identified him as a member of the 
Mona Park Crips. 
</P>
<P>
But family and neighbors all claimed he did not sell drugs and never joined a 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard was not a dangerous person," said Renee Scott, 28, his sister. "He was 
not a bad boy. These (gang members) around here, true, he knows them, but he 
was never a gangbanger." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his mother said, the family used a relative's home address so that 
Richard could qualify to attend Locke High School and avoid the gang pressure 
at a closer school. But he dropped out after junior year because of "sheer 
boredom," according to one brother. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to use him as an example for all these other guys around here," 
Renee said angrily. "They didn't do him right." 
</P>
<P>
But Williams said that Winrow's gang and drug activities had been clearly 
proven. He also noted that Winrow's attorneys -- two from Las Vegas and one 
from Los Angeles -- are "high-priced lawyers . . . who handle large drug cases. 
No little kid from Watts is going to come up here with that kind of high-priced 
representation without a lot of financing behind him." 
</P>
<P>
The sentence he handed down Wednesday nevertheless troubled Williams, who said 
he hopes the case will prompt a review by Congress of mandatory sentencing laws 
that preempt a judge's ability to decide. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us judges feel we are made to be like robots who cannot decide for 
themselves, but this is the law, and it's my job and it's up to Congress to do 
something about it. . . ," Williams said. "Let's put it this way: Today was the 
first time in 35 years as a judge that I have had to give anyone a life 
sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow's grieving family and friends couldn't fathom that he will not be coming 
home again. 
</P>
<P>
"Life without parole?" said Betty Williams, 23, a family friend and former 
neighbor. "That's his whole life wasted."

Disclosing for the first time the human cost of its military involvement in 
Angola, the Cuban government announced that 2,016 Cubans have died in the 
African country since its forces were sent there 14 years ago. A spokesman for 
the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C., gave that figure in 
announcing that the remains of all Cubans who died carrying out international 
missions in Angola and elsewhere have been returned to Cuba in recent days. In 
1987, Brig. Gen. Rafael del Pino Diaz, who defected to the U.S., said about 
10,000 Cuban troops had been killed in Angola since 1976.

900 SUSPECTED DRUG SMUGGLERS IN IRAN COULD BE EXECUTED

Iran said Wednesday that 900 suspected drug smugglers face the gallows in a 
year-old narcotics crackdown in which more than 1,000 men and women already 
have been executed. 
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a senior 
official as saying that 14,000 people, including 569 Afghans, have been 
arrested since March for major drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's anti-drug campaign could eventually dam up what has become a major 
narcotics pipeline into Western Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights organizations have condemned the large number of executions in the 
ruthless crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
But a campaign that cuts the volume of heroin flooding into the West could help 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani's efforts to end Iran's isolation and restore 
relations with the West.

Nearly 1 billion adults in the world can neither read nor write, the head of 
the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said. In ceremonies 
launching International Literacy Year, Federico Mayor, director general of 
UNESCO, said the number of illiterates has begun to decline for the first time 
in history. However, the education of women is still lagging, he said, and they 
make up most of the world's illiterate population.

Arab nations withdrew their bid to have the PLO recognized by the United

threat to cut off contributions to the world body. A face-saving compromise was 
played out on the floor of the General Assembly to spare the sponsors the

The New York City Council has approved legislation to protect the health and 
safety of more than 12,000 city workers who use video display terminals. The 
bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law of its kind in a 
major city, according to the New York City Video Display Terminal Coalition of 
labor unions and occupational safety and health groups. The bill mandates that 
VDT operators at city agencies be given a 15-minute break when they are 
required to work at a terminal for more than two consecutive hours. Under the 
law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions -- including pregnancy -- 
would be allowed to obtain transfers.

Alaska has asked the Justice Department to prosecute Exxon Corp. for federal 
crimes and to seek full damage payments, in addition to fines, without letting 
the company plea bargain to avoid culpability in the Alaska oil spill, 
according to court documents. In testimony before a state Superior Court 
pretrial hearing in Anchorage for fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, 
Larry Weeks, Alaska's chief prosecutor, said that the state wants a federal 
court order requiring Exxon to pay full restitution for the worst spill in U.S. 
history. Weeks said that Exxon should be held accountable legally and 
financially for the spill of 11 million gallons of crude oil.

The jury in the Miami manslaughter trial of officer William Lozano, accused of 
firing on a motorcycle and killing two black men, adjourned for the day at 6 
p.m. after two men and four women deliberated for nine hours. Rumors swept the 
city that the Latino policeman, whose actions last Jan. 16 set off three days 
of rioting, had been found innocent or was about to be found innocent, court 
officials said. Dade County's highest-ranking state judge went on live 
television to deny the rumors and call for calm. The jury, which got the 
racially sensitive case after almost seven weeks of testimony, was due to 
resume deliberations today.

A man who lost his family in the worst alcohol-related road accident in U.S. 
history said in court Wednesday that he wants an apology from the driver who is 
being tried on 27 counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know if he's hurting as bad as I am," Lee Williams said of the 
defendant, Larry Mahoney. "I want him to tell me he's sorry. This is the second 
Christmas I've spent without my daughters." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' wife, Joy, and daughters Kristin and Robin died in the fiery 
collision between Mahoney's pickup truck and a church bus in Carrollton on May 
14, 1988. Williams has since married the bus driver's widow. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney, 36, a chemical plant worker from Worthville, is charged with 27 counts 
of murder and 55 lesser offenses. He faces life imprisonment if convicted in 
the trial, which began Nov. 8 in Carroll County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was the last of 24 survivors of 26 of those killed to be called to the 
stand by Assistant Atty. Gen. Paul Richwalsky, special prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who had to pause several times during his testimony to regain his 
composure, said that a life sentence was the least punishment Mahoney should 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is for Mr. Mahoney to go to prison and stay there for the rest of 
his natural life," said Williams, who has been the unofficial spokesman for 
several families who lost relatives in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Taylor, the nurse in charge of the emergency room at a hospital in 
Louisville to which Mahoney was taken after the accident, testified Wednesday 
that he had been unconscious and was suffering from a collapsed lung when he 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Analyses of whole blood and blood serum taken from Mahoney found alcohol levels 
of 0.18 and 0.24. Kentucky law defines intoxication as 0.10 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses had testified that the pickup Mahoney was driving hit the bus, 
which was loaded with 67 people, and then another car when traveling the wrong 
way on Interstate 71.

FRANCES BAVIER; WON AN EMMY AS 'AUNT BEE'

<P>
Frances Bavier, an Emmy Award-winning actress remembered by millions of fans as 
the devoted Aunt Bee on "The Andy Griffith Show," died Wednesday night at her 
home here. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bavier was released early this week from Chatham Hospital, where she was 
being treated in the coronary care unit. 
</P>
<P>
A native of New York City, Miss Bavier attended Columbia University and was a 
graduate of the American Academy of the Arts. She had more than 20 years of 
stage experience, including stints in vaudeville and on Broadway, where she 
appeared in such productions as "Kiss and Tell," "Point of No Return" and "The 
Lady Says No." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bavier became famous for her television role in the popular show starring 
Andy Griffith as a Southern sheriff, which she continued in the short-lived 
series "Mayberry RFD." She won an Emmy for the role in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy Griffith" was near the top of the ratings from October, 1960, to 
September, 1968, when Griffith left the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Many episodes focused on her and she was essential to the success of the 
show," said John Meroney, founder of the Andy Griffith Show Appreciation 
Society. "When she started on the show she was 57 and had more experience going 
in than any of the other cast members. She was the only one from a large city 
and the fact that she could portray Aunt Bee showed the depth of her talent." 
</P>
<P>
A private person, she had refused media requests for interviews for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"She was never big on doing interviews. But in my conversations with her she 
was always open and willing to talk about her days on the Andy Griffith Show, " 
Meroney said.

BROWN FIELD DEVELOPMENT LIMITS BACKED; 
</P>
<P>
AIRPORT: COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY THE LAND MUST BE SAVED IN CASE IT BECOMES THE 
CITY'S NEW AIRPORT. OFFICIALS ARE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT A LONG-AWAITED STUDY 
WON'T RECOMMEND A SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVE TO LINDBERGH FIELD.

Hoping to preserve Brown Field as the future home of a commercial airport, a 
San Diego City Council committee Wednesday agreed to impose a 120-day 
moratorium on construction at both ends of the general-aviation airstrip on 
Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,400 acres covered by the building freeze is land the city would need if 
it were to construct two parallel, southwest-to-northeast runways that a 
private consultant hired by two development companies believes could 
accommodate major air carriers. The expansion is envisioned as part of a 
"multiple airport" solution that relies on dividing airline traffic between 
Lindbergh and Brown fields. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, officials said Wednesday that the long-awaited, $350,000 
airport relocation study due to be released next week by the San Diego Assn. of 
Governments will not recommend one potential commercial airport site over 
another, a fact that took some officials at San Diego City Hall and the County 
Administration Center by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the report will say construction of a new airport at any of the three 
main locations under consideration -- Otay Mesa, Miramar Naval Air Station and 
property east of Miramar -- is technically feasible. Sandag will make its 
recommendation later, according to a Sandag official. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected a recommendation . . . it's a surprise to me" that there isn't 
one, said Councilman Bob Filner, who has pushed for a "multiple airport" 
solution to crowding at Lindbergh Field or relocation of the airport to 
Miramar. "I thought the report would include a recommendation narrowing it to a 
single site to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who wants a commercial airport moved to Miramar, said 
he too had expected the report to suggest one location over the others. But 
Bilbray said that, as a practical matter, unless the City Council is committed 
to stopping development from encroaching on Brown Field in Otay Mesa, the 
report's conclusion leaves only Miramar as a viable alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to eliminate the excuse of us continuing to dance around this issue," 
Bilbray said. "By the lack of action the decision is being made." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts, who says the remedy to San Diego's airport problems 
lies in a multiple-airport solution, said he wasn't surprised that the Sandag 
report won't recommend one specific site. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the elected officials have to do," he said. What the report means, 
Roberts said, is that the differences among the three main locations "are not 
so great to pick one over the other." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a political question that only elected officials are in a position" to 
decide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from builders, the council last month lifted a year-old 
moratorium on construction around Brown Field, allowing residential, commercial 
and industrial projects on all of Otay Mesa to proceed. Many city officials 
believe that canceling the moratorium virtually killed any possibility of a 
huge binational airport along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, contending that expansion of Brown -- and the multiple-airport 
solution -- would be impossible if land to the northeast and southwest is 
developed, Wednesday proposed the moratorium until Sandag can complete a 60-day 
review of consultant P&amp;D Technologies' conclusions about the city-owned 
airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
"It is to preserve the opportunity to put an airport there, a greatly expanded 
airport, should the city decide that is a site," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and Filner, who represent districts encompassing Lindbergh and Brown, 
respectively, formed an uneasy alliance this summer by proposing the 
multiple-airport solution, which they believe could also include the use of 
Montgomery Field and Palomar Airport in Carlsbad for commuter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Left unspecified by the agreement is whether Lindbergh or Brown would become 
the city's dominant airport. Each councilman believes that the primary facility 
should be located in the other's district. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium proposed Wednesday, which includes Brown Field itself, covers a 
roughly diagonal swath that would be needed for parallel 12,000-foot and 
8,000-foot runways under the P&amp;D Technologies plan. It covers areas that 
would be affected by airport noise of 65 decibels or more, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
A large parcel to the southwest of Brown is slated for about 7,000 homes in 
Otay Mesa planning documents, but rugged terrain, the city's environmental 
protection ordinance and landslides probably would make it difficult to build 
anywhere near that many residences, according to Alan Jones, a former planner 
who is now Filner's top aide, and Gail Goldberg, the city's long-range planner 
for Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
A large parcel owned by the Baldwin Co. northeast of Brown is slated for 
commercial and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' proposal drew no opposition from Filner or Brown Field area property 
owners. It requires approval of the full City Council, but with six of the 
council's nine members sitting on the Rules Committee, Wednesday's unanimous 
vote virtually guarantees its passage. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been awaiting the Sandag report before beginning deliberations 
on an alternative to increasingly congested 471-acre Lindbergh, which now 
handles 11 million passengers annually and is expected to serve 35 million by 
the middle of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The report was funded by the Federal Aviation Administration at the San Diego 
City Council's urging and has been more than a year in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Koerper, Sandag's special projects director who is overseeing the report, 
confirmed that the report won't recommend one site over another, but said that 
shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who has been following the progression 
of the report through Sandag. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an informational report . . . (that) brings everyone up to date (about 
what's occurred) in the last 14 months," he said, noting the report is in the 
midst of being printed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study will include much detail and information such as ground 
access times to the three sites and economic considerations, Koerper said "we 
will reserve our judgment" about choosing a recommended location until two 
other evaluations are complete. 
</P>
<P>
The first involves an $18,000, 60-day study just initiated at the request of 
the City Council to examine whether expansion of Brown Field is technically 
feasible. The other involves a request made in October by a group of South Bay 
legislators -- including Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and state Sen. Wadie P. 
Deddeh (D-Chula Vista) -- that the joint use of Miramar as a military and 
civilian airport be reevaluated.

JUDGE LIFTS ORDER BARRING STORY ON DUFFY SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Wednesday lifted the extraordinary order he had issued 
last week preventing The Times from publishing information about security 
measures at the home of San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Jeffrey T. Miller said at a brief hearing that Duffy failed to meet the 
"very heavy burden" of showing that speculative threats to the safety of the 
sheriff outweighed a "prior restraint" on freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for The Times and other legal experts hailed the ruling as the proper 
one and said that Miller should have never issued the order in the first place. 
Duffy, however, said he was "appalled" and contended that the ruling "without 
question" will further threaten the personal safety of himself and his wife, 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the ruling, Duffy and his wife, both visibly 
enraged, lashed out at the judge, The Times and the media in general. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike Benjamin Franklin rolling out flyers on a hand-operated printing press, 
criticizing the king of England, these huge corporations control the country 
and are completely unregulated by anyone except their own stockholders," Duffy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"An unbridled, unfettered, unaccountable news media that pursues the Nielsen 
ratings and circulation figures for profit motives is a serious threat to all 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Miller, he said, lacked courage and "took the safe way out." 
</P>
<P>
The Times was "utterly stupid" to inquire about county-owned security items at 
his house because there simply aren't that many there, Duffy said. He 
illustrated his point by dumping a shotgun, a handgun, a bulletproof vest, 
two-way radio and batteries on a table and said that was it. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy told the assembled reporters that they were lucky the guns were unloaded 
because he didn't want to be "tempted here" to use them. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy also had a warning for would-be housebreakers. "I want any son of a bitch 
to think twice," Duffy said. Then, pointing at his wife, seated beside him, he 
said, "This lady sleeps with a gun under her pillow. And she knows how to use 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said the way drug dealers in Colombia and Peru "solve the problem" is to 
"kill the judges and the police chief and the prosecutor," and suggested that 
he and Linda may be at risk from "Colombians and Peruvians, illegal aliens, who 
come here dealing in drugs, who bring that culture with them of killing the 
executive officers in the criminal justice system and the judges." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the hourlong news conference, he lectured the nearly 20 reporters 
and television camera operators in attendance: "You should report on my 
official conduct as the sheriff. But what happens inside my house is none of 
your God-damned business. And that's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said he was unsure whether he will appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began last Thursday when Times reporter Richard A. Serrano asked 
the Sheriff's Department for information about the existence of a "safe room" 
in Duffy's house that might contain weapons and other county equipment, such as 
radios. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of an emergency -- either personal or in cases of widespread civil 
disorder -- the sheriff purportedly could go into the room and still be in 
contact with deputies, Serrano said in a sworn statement filed in connection 
with the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
When Serrano made his initial inquiries, he had not yet written an article for 
publication, said a lawyer for the paper, Los Angeles attorney Rex S. Heinke. 
Serrano was "just looking into various questions," Heinke said. 
</P>
<P>
But, since the paper refused to agree to avoid publishing information about any 
security measures, Duffy's lawyer, Janet B. Houts, said she had no choice but 
to go to court. Miller issued an order late last Thursday directing The Times 
to refrain from publishing information regarding the "nature, layout or 
configuration of security measures" in the Duffy home. 
</P>
<P>
After a hearing Friday, Miller substituted the word "location" for "nature" but 
let the rest of the order stand pending Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Heinke filed legal papers this week in which he argued that the order was an 
infringement of the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court consistently has 
held that, only in the most "extraordinary circumstances" may newspapers be 
prevented from publishing stories, Heinke said. 
</P>
<P>
Houts maintained that Duffy's "right to privacy" regarding any security 
measures at his home outweighed any press freedom issues. Further, the many 
cases holding that restraints on the press are illegal didn't count as 
precedent, she said, because no court had decided a case quite like this one. 
</P>
<P>
Houts reiterated those arguments Wednesday in court. But Miller, noting he 
agreed with the presentation of the law outlined by attorneys for The Times, 
said that Houts' arguments were insufficient to warrant keeping the restraint 
in place any longer. 
</P>
<P>
"A person's privacy has never justified a prior restraint on the press," he 
said. "This should especially be the case where the individual is an elected 
public official." 
</P>
<P>
The Times is "delighted" with the ruling, Heinke said, adding, "It's clear, as 
the judge ruled, that prior restraints are presumptively unconstitutional and 
can only be obtained in extraordinary circumstances, for example troop 
movements during a war, and this is nothing like that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts also praised Miller's turnabout. "Quite frankly, the amazing 
thing was that it was ordered in the first place, and that it lasted this 
long," San Diego attorney John Allcock said. "I think it was pretty obviously a 
clear First Amendment violation, and it never should have been entered in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
Miller did not say at the hearing what prompted him to issue the initial order. 
Asked about it in the hallway outside his courtroom about 10 minutes after the 
hearing ended, he said, "I can't comment on the case." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, in a written statement released at the press conference, said he thought 
originally that Miller had "the courage to make new law." Instead, Duffy said, 
Miller "took the safe way out of a very intimidating lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Duffy said he was left wondering what his next step 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
"What is a person to do? What is any citizen to do? You seek relief from the 
courts. In this case we got no relief from the courts. We're out there, hanging 
out there, so of course I'm more at threat and so is my wife more at threat." 
</P>
<P>
The true "loser in court," however, was not just him and not just his wife, but 
anyone whose "safety and privacy are threatened" by "powerful 
multimillion-dollar profit-making" news organizations, Duffy said in his 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supposed to trust you people," Duffy told reporters, "so that you will, 
hopefully, in your own opinion, if you don't think it's a hot news story, you 
won't print it. Until something happens to me or my wife -- then, of course, 
you'll have a big story. And that I guess is what you really want." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Duffy, a county probation officer, closed the conference on a similar 
note. "Thanks for being there, after the fact, when the paramedics are there 
and the ambulances are there," she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't come and say, 'Gee, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean this to happen.' 
Because it's not going to wash."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 CHARGED IN COUNTERFEIT OPERATION FOR ID 
CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five people, including four illegal immigrants, were arraigned this week before 
a U.S. magistrate on charges of counterfeiting thousands of identification 
documents, immigration officials said." 
</P>
<P>
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents arrested the five on Monday and 
seized thousands of Social Security cards, INS and California Department of 
Motor Vehicle forms, plus $20,000 in cash and three handguns. 
</P>
<P>
Acting INS Los Angeles District Director Robert Moschorak said immigration 
agents, armed with search warrants, conducted the crackdown on a ring that 
operated at 11th and Alvarado streets. Moschorak said alien registration cards, 
plus a Social Security card, were being sold on the streets for up to $50, 
while counterfeit employment authorization cards were being sold for $300 to 
$500.

CARS CROSSING BORDER GET SMOG WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Customs officials at the San Ysidro border crossing are used to telling 
northbound drivers what they can and can't bring into the United States, but 
there's one thing they can't keep out: choking exhaust fumes that bring tears 
to inspectors' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
For four hours Wednesday, however, inspectors got a little relief as California 
Highway Patrol officers cracked down on the worst smog-belching vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Six CHP officers and five Customs officers manned a joint inspection station, 
an experiment designed to deter visibly polluting vehicles from crossing the 
border. Of the 182 cars pulled over for emitting excessive exhaust, 112 were 
given citations, according to Lt. Ken Ahacic. Of those, about half were from 
Mexico, where vehicle-emission controls are less stringent than in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes to get stopped and get citations," said Ahacic, who conceded 
that, for the Mexican drivers, the citations will be unenforceable "to some 
degree. But, if it's done on an ongoing basis, it would be a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
As yet, there are no plans for such a long-term program. And even Wednesday's 
smog check was informal -- tickets were issued to vehicles that appeared to be 
in violation, but no actual emissions tests were performed. Some unlucky 
drivers, stopped for emission violations, also received tickets for lack of 
insurance and mechanical problems, Ahacic said. 
</P>
<P>
But Customs officials, who had requested CHP's intervention in an attempt to 
improve working conditions for their inspectors, were hopeful that Wednesday's 
pilot checks will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Customs inspectors have complained of headaches, coughing, sneezing 
and nausea they believe results from breathing fumes emitted by the hundreds of 
vehicles they inspect each day. 
</P>
<P>
Their suspicions were recently confirmed by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, which found that Customs officials are exposed to an unhealthy 
amount of exhaust fumes each day, according to Bobbie Cassidy, a Customs 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy said the fumes "impair an inspector's ability to think and function, 
and down the line that could result in serious health problems. . . . We're 
trying to do something to alleviate that -- to get people to fix their cars." 
</P>
<P>
Ahacic agreed that something needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big problem for the people who work there, as well as for Southern 
California as a whole," he said, adding that CHP officers may be called upon to 
do similar inspections in the future. "There's a good possibility that we'll do 
this on an ongoing basis."

more spot checks.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of seven escapees from the crowded County Jail in Chula Vista have been 
recaptured, the Sheriff's Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners, among 123 in Module 3A, designed for 24 inmates, broke out of 
the South Bay jail Tuesday by covering their clothed bodies with hand lotion 
and squeezing through a 6-inch window opening. Using tied-together bed sheets, 
they then shinnied down 80 feet to flee, spokesman Jerry Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials were notified that the inmates had escaped when they received 
calls at 6:27 p.m. from parents who said their children playing near the 
complex on South 2nd Avenue saw inmates wearing blue uniforms. A lockdown was 
ordered a minute later, spokeswoman Lorraine Truitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the jail along with Chula Vista police searched the area by car 
and saw the fugitives, Truitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose S. Urquieta, 34, and Antonio L. Gonzalez, 22, both serving time for auto 
theft were captured that night and taken back to the jail, Truitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining five have not been captured, Truitt said Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials blamed the escape on the crowding and understaffing. The jail, 
intended for 192 prisoners, houses 882. 
</P>
<P>
Still at large late Wednesday were Manuel A. Canpasco, 30, serving time for 
possession of narcotics; Porfilio Cruz, 24, held for parole violation; Gerardo 
Cortez, 22, awaiting trial on charges of possession of stolen property; George 
Fernandez, 20, held on burglary charges and violation of probation, and Martin 
C. Wiggins, 25, held without bail on parole violation and two counts of 
burglary.

SO WHO'S NEXT IN EASTERN EUROPE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public opinion, which for four decades and more was denied open expression in 
Eastern Europe, has now emerged as a major political force. Suddenly, in 
countries where any sign of political dissent could be expected to bring down 
the full repressive wrath of the state, mass protests are not only being 
tolerated but actually listened to. 
</P>
<P>
In East Germany, the unpopular Egon Krenz, successor to the deposed and now 
arrested neo-Stalinist hard-liner Erich Honecker, has been forced to quit his 
largely ceremonial post as president. Last week, after only a few weeks on the 
job, Krenz resigned as boss of the once all-powerful but now rapidly 
disintegrating Communist Party. In Czechoslovakia at the same time, a 
government named just days ago is about to be replaced because of public fury 
over its domination by Communists. This time, promises Premier Ladislav Ademic, 
the pro-democracy Civic Forum movement will be consulted before a new 
government with a large component of non-Communists is named. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's Communists plan to hold an emergency congress Friday to choose 
new leaders and to try to salvage some measure of credibility. This desperate 
effort comes as public disgust mounts over disclosures that both party and 
government are riddled with corruption. No one in the West will be surprised to 
learn that the masters of a nominally egalitarian society in fact lived as 
luxuriously as any plutocrat made rich by the sweat of the working class. But 
in East Germany, where the life styles of the rich and infamous were a closely 
held secret, the revelations have brought genuine shock and outrage. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Communists hang on in East Germany and Czechoslovakia? It would be 
uncharacteristic for those who have held absolute power for so long simply to 
slink away into the political wilderness. Yet so discredited and demoralized 
have the parties become, so unimaginably swiftly have events progressed in this 
last, particularly remarkable week, that such a retreat begins to look not only 
plausible but increasingly likely.

SYNAGOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Readers taking a close look at the photographs (Religion, Nov. 25) of Sukwon 
Kim examining his work on the Korean Philadelphia Presbyterian Church's 
restoration project may have wondered why the characters on the Ten 
Commandments in the top photo were in Hebrew, not Korean. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the Korean congregation (at Fourth and New Hampshire), 
worships in a former synagogue, the home of Sinai Temple from its dedication in 
1926 (not 100 years ago, as indicated in the caption) to 1961, when Sinai moved 
to its current location in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The building, designed by architect S. Tilden Norton, is City of Los Angeles 
Historic Cultural Monument No. 91. As the Western outpost of the Conservative 
movement in Judaism, it housed the first classes of the University of Judaism 
in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Sinai's first building, dedicated in 1909 at 12th and Valencia, 
and the oldest extant synagogue structure in Los Angeles, has been the home of 
the Welsh Presbyterian Church since 1925. It was also designed by Norton and is 
Historic Cultural Monument No. 173. The Welsh congregation has lovingly 
preserved the building through the years and is now engaged in a construction 
project to comply with earthquake code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
We are indebted to these congregations for keeping alive visual reminders of 
our city's rich multicultural heritage.

U.S. AID WOULD NEED TO STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The case of Jennifer Jean Casolo, a church worker from Connecticut who was 
recently arrested in El Salvador and charged with aiding leftist guerrillas, 
rightly commands the world's attention today. But her case is just one of a 
growing number of troubling instances in which the right-wing government there 
seems to be singling out religious workers for harassment, intimidation and 
even death. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo, who was working for a Texas-based ecumenical religious group, was taken 
into custody after police said they found a cache of weapons buried in the back 
yard of her home in San Salvador. She could have put the matter behind her by 
accepting deportation to the United States, but has chosen to plead innocent 
and stand trial. Casolo's fellow religious workers are convinced the government 
is using her case to discredit them, and with them local clergy who criticize 
the government's policies and its human-rights record. Some of Casolo's friends 
think she was framed. Normally, such allegations would seem naive or even 
paranoid. But the way religious workers in El Salvador have been treated 
recently, the suggestion is reasonable, even if it's not a proven fact. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's massacre of six Jesuit priests and two women bystanders renewed 
the sense of shock felt around the world at the sheer scope of El Salvador's 
bloodletting. The murders remain unsolved, and the government has not been able 
to refute an eyewitness account that uniformed men carried out the killings -- 
a report that fed widespread suspicion that the murders were the work of a 
right-wing death squad tied to the military or the ruling Arena party. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been many other distressing, if less dramatic, incidents. Dozens 
of Lutheran and Episcopal church workers have been detained by Salvadoran 
authorities in recent days and expelled from the country. The practice has 
become so persistent that nine U.S. religious bodies have charged the 
government of President Alfredo Cristiani with a "deliberate and calculated 
campaign to intimidate and harass" them. 
</P>
<P>
If that's what is happening in El Salvador -- and the accumulation of incidents 
and evidence suggests it may be -- it must stop. U.S. taxpayers have enough 
problems already with supporting a government that may be implicated in the 
murder of priests, even if such incidents can be explained away as isolated 
atrocities committed in the chaos of war. But if the campaign against church 
workers turns out in fact to be official Salvadoran government policy, this 
would be so intolerable that U.S. aid would need to end at once.

DEATH AS A GOOD CAREER MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Devine's logic doesn't make sense. Maybe talking to the leaves in Maine has 
something to do with it; a liberal dose of California smog just might clear his 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
He says Judas Iscariot made a "good career move" when he hanged himself with a 
halter from the limb of a tree. We were taught that Judas was a perfect example 
of a coward. Perhaps if he (Judas) had admitted his error and tried to make 
amends he would not have gone down in history as someone to be despised. 
</P>
<P>
As for the cruel description of Bette Davis "dressed like an aging whore" on 
the David Letterman show, Devine states, "Her face was a monument to booze, 
disease and cigarettes." If he had done his homework, Devine would know she had 
overcome a stroke and bout with breast cancer. I think she showed exceptional 
courage during her long ordeal. If she chose to dress up in a red dress with 
glass beads, then I say go for it, Bette. I'm sure when Ms. Davis stood outside 
the "great fake mother-of-pearl gate," she didn't have time to say, "What a 
dump," because I bet she heard "Well done, my good and faithful servant."

BIRTH OF A LATINO POLITICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum -- who may wind up in a fight for his political life 
because of a lawsuit that alleges that Latinos have been gerrymandered out of 
representation on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors -- has decided to 
identify himself as Latino, on the ground that he is the grandchild of a 
Mexican woman who married a German miner. 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean that during his next campaign we can expect an "Ich bin ein 
Latino" speech? 
</P>
<P>
Look, if Schabarum wants to be successful in helping voters view him as they 
never have before, he might take a few pages from the book of former Los 
Angeles City Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, who saw his district transformed in a 
1972 reapportionment with a sudden infusion of Latino residents. Snyder changed 
from a combative, political conservative (not unlike Schabarum) to a combative, 
Spanish-speaking populist. Soon Snyder was making Horatio Alger speeches about 
growing up as "a barefoot kid from the barrio." While not a Latino, Snyder 
often told Eastside audiences that "mi corazon es (my heart is) Latino." That, 
and his ability to deliver city services to his district, was enough to 
outweigh his innumerable personal and political missteps and keep him in office 
for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
As for Pete Schabarum, after years of antagonizing many in the Latino 
community, it seems a longshot that his heretofore underpublicized ethnic 
heritage will help him much with the many Latino voters who want better 
representation of their interests. 
</P>

ETHICS REFORM IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was hopeful when I read about the ethical reforms proposed by a mayoral 
commission (Nov. 21-22) to apply to Los Angeles city elected officials. I was 
dismayed to read that members of the City Council are expected to come out 
against the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Electoral positions of public trust should have attractive enough salaries to 
encourage people to serve, let them maintain an appropriate life style, and put 
their children through college. 
</P>
<P>
There should be no augmenting of that salary, however. If a person cannot get 
by on the stated salary, he shouldn't run for that office. No outside 
employment, lobbyist gifts, free passes, gift vacations or trips or honorariums 
should be allowed -- period. No exceptions should be permitted, and that also 
means the abolition of political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
If rules such as these had been in effect by 1988, Mayor Tom Bradley's 
reputation would still be intact. If these reforms are enacted, perhaps we will 
not have to read the conflict of interest stories or other tales of petty greed 
reported all too frequently in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council won't enact these needed regulations or the mayor declines 
to sign such a bill into law, then a ballot initiative should be passed to try 
to keep our city officials semi-honest. 
</P>

<P>
I walk along the Los Angeles River every day from Glendale Boulevard to Los 
Feliz Boulevard; either early morning or at sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years the river has become beautiful. There are all kinds of 
water fowl and birds living in this section of the river. 
</P>
<P>
It is so peaceful, and hard to believe it's so near the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Please spend that $100,000 to clean up the river where thoughtless people have 
thrown all kinds of trash, stuck in the middle of the river.

I am not alone. A lot of people enjoy their walks along this "living" river.

SOMEONE IS PUSHING THE L.A. BUBBLE; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO INSURANCE: GILLESPIE'S LATEST MOVES SET THE STAGE FOR A SHOWDOWN WITH THE 
COURT, WHICH HAS GUARANTEED INSURERS A PROFIT. THE ODDS FAVOR THE COURT. 
</P>

By WILLIAM C. GEORGE, William C. George was chief consultant for the Assembly 
Finance and Insurance Committee for nine years. He is now assistant chief clerk 
in charge of bill analysis for the Assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the last episode of California's long-running soap opera "The Implementation 
of Proposition 103," the state Supreme Court issued an opinion upholding the 
initiative, but substantially rewriting it. The justices' primary change was to 
strike down the rollback of rates to November, 1987, levels and to set aside of 
the automatic, additional 20% cut. 
</P>
<P>
More important in the long run, the court upheld the insurance companies' right 
to earn "a return . . . commensurate with returns on investment in other 
enterprises having corresponding risks." The court then returned the issue to 
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, having made its intent clear: 
California insurance companies have the right to earn a fair rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
After public hearings, hours of testimony and pages of evidence, the 
commissioner Tuesday issued her new rules, which incorporate two dramatic 
changes. First, she abolished "simple" territorial rating, which had allowed 
insurers to levy different premium rates on drivers, according to their home 
ZIP codes. Second, she limited future premium rate increases for good drivers 
to the increase in the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rating factors mandated by Proposition 103, she will also 
allow what she called "optional factors." They look a lot like 
territorial-rating factors. For example, an insurer can take into account 
auto-theft rates, repair- shop costs, physician rates, accident frequency and 
the number of uninsured vehicles in the policyholder's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said these "optional factors" would not be allowed to account for 
more of the premium than any of the three factors mandated by 103 -- an 
individual's driving record, the number of miles driven annually and years of 
driving experience. She said this, even though she acknowledged that many 
experts agree that the optional factors can account for more of the added costs 
than the three mandated factors. This inconsistency is a result of the terms of 
the new statute. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie hinted strongly that she expects her new regulations to be challenged 
in court, and she's probably right. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 report from the Department of Insurance illustrates why. The department 
surveyed the state to see if different cities had different experiences with 
claims and costs. It found that the average claim cost for bodily injury and 
property damage per insured vehicle in California's 10 largest cities was $157. 
The lowest was Sacramento, at $130, and the highest was Los Angeles, at $308. 
</P>
<P>
The study also looked at claim frequency, which it defined as the number of 
claims divided by the number of insured vehicles, times 1,000. The state 
average was 16.4 claims, with Sacramento again the lowest, at 14.6, and Los 
Angeles again the highest, at 32.4. 
</P>
<P>
Frequency of uninsured motorist claims was 5.7 statewide, with San Diego the 
lowest at 4.9 and, again, Los Angeles the highest at 12.0. 
</P>
<P>
The same report said that if territorial rating were abolished and premiums 
based on a statewide flat rate, "about two-thirds of the vehicles insured would 
incur increases . . . (averaging) . . . approximately 22%." 
</P>
<P>
In other words -- according to the report, and based on the minimum limits it 
assumes -- two-thirds of the state's insured vehicles would have had to pay, in 
1988, an additional $325 million to subsidize the remaining one-third in order 
to maintain the insurance companies' premium income. To make this even clearer, 
picture California as a giant water bed with an air bubble called Los Angeles 
and the water being insurance rates. If you push down on the air bubble, the 
level in the rest of the bed rises. 
</P>
<P>
Now view these facts in light of Gillespie's determination to limit insurance 
rates and the Supreme Court's decision to protect insurance company earnings. 
Something will give, and it probably won't be the court. 
</P>
<P>
Let's put it this way. If you thought that voting for Proposition 103 meant 
that $325 million was going to come out of the hides of the insurance 
companies, the Supreme Court has proven you wrong. Because the justices 
protected insurance companies' fair rate of return, the $325 million will have 
to come from somewhere else. Probably from the two-thirds of California's cars 
that aren't in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, California's insurance companies long ago computed what the 
abolition of territorial rating would mean on their fair rate of return and 
calculated whether their return was in danger of becoming unfair. If this has 
been their conclusion, look for them to return to California's courts and 
perhaps to the federal courts if there is a federal issue. 
</P>
<P>
Stay turned for further developments in the saga of how Ralph Nader and Harvey 
Rosenfield fooled the people into thinking they could vote their way to lower 
auto insurance premiums.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT WAS AN ERA IN WHICH HONESTY WASN'T ALWAYS THE BEST POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Discussing the New York Jets' victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 
III, which he "guaranteed" victory before the game, former Jet quarterback Joe 
Namath told Mike Lupica in Esquire magazine that such boldness was more 
extraordinary then than it is now. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the times," Namath said. "I can remember when (Muhammad) Ali told 
everybody he was going to beat (Sonny) Liston that first fight, and everybody 
thought he was nuts. We can laugh about it now, but at the time I came along, 
honesty was unheard of in sports. You gave your honest opinion about things, 
and it just automatically rubbed people the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
Add honesty: Football coaches always have been reluctant to praise the ability 
of their teams, lest they inspire an opponent to greater effort. But Bob 
Shannon, coach at East St. Louis (Ill.) High, believes if you've got the 
talent, flaunt it. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year's team wasn't very good," Shannon said of a 13-1 squad that was 
runner-up in the state playoffs. And this year's team? "This is a typical 
championship-caliber East St. Louis team," he said before the playoffs began. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers beat Thornton, 55-8, to win the Class 6-A championship. They 
finished 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Since baseball's most-valuable-player awards began in 1931, each 
winner has been back with his club the next year. Three MVPs were with new 
clubs two years after winning the award. Who were they? 
</P>
<P>
Nadia's theme: The story of Nadia Comaneci's romance with Konstantin Panait, 
the married man who helped her defect from Romania, was good fodder for New 
York's tabloids Wednesday. The Daily News played it on Page 1 with the 
headline: "Naughty Nadia, Romanian gymnast flips for married roofer." The New 
York Post put the story on its gossip page under the heading: "Nadia leaps into 
arms of married man." 
</P>
<P>
Greasing the skids?In an attempt to display a light touch, Mike Lynn, general 
manager of the Minnesota Vikings, recently showed up in the locker room wearing 
a Popeye hat. He served the players fried chicken, saying it was a substitute 
for spinach. "One of the things players have mentioned to me is that the only 
time they see me is when I'm disciplining them or negotiating a contract," Lynn 
said. "So I am going to be more visible when we're not in confrontational 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
Into the frying pan: Dave Gavitt, commissioner of the Big East, on the genesis 
of the ACC-Big East Challenge this week: "Look, basketball needs sizzle in 
December, too. And the teams need it. They don't like to play the U.S. 
Internationals all the time leading up to the league schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Add ACC: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: "If all his 
indiscretions in the handling of the basketball program at North Carolina State 
didn't get Jim Valvano canned, the slapdash show the coach hosts on ESPN 
should." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Orlando Cepeda, MVP with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1967, played 
for the Braves in 1969; Chuck Klein of the Philadelphia Phillies was the MVP in 
1932 and joined the Cubs in 1934; Rod Carew was MVP with the Minnesota Twins in 
1977 and played for the Angels in 1979.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whoever thought no mas would become part of the English language? . . . 
</P>
<P>
And little did Roberto Duran realize he was setting himself up for a 
$7.6-million payday nine years later when he surrendered to Sugar Ray Leonard 
in the eighth round at the Louisiana Superdome on Nov. 25, 1980. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Sugar Ray had won a lopsided decision in the second fight, there wouldn't be 
nearly as much interest in Leonard-Duran III as there is today. In fact, there 
probably wouldn't even be a fight. Without the desire to clear his good name, 
Roberto might have faded away long ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
My guest expert, Don Chargin, is picking Duran by decision. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Duran wants this more than Leonard does," says Chargin, who is approaching his 
sixth decade in boxing as a promoter, matchmaker and manager. "Leonard has lost 
his speed and is getting hit too much. Duran isn't what he was, either, but he 
got his weight down early and is capable of one last great effort.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
Leonard and Duran will need no introductions, but there have been longer 
rivalries. Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta met six times, including twice 
within 21 days in 1943. Archie Moore never got tired of looking at the same 
guy. He fought Howard King and Jack Chase six times each and Harold Johnson 
five times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among those wearing gloves -- well, at least one -- in the Mirage Hotel stadium 
at Las Vegas tonight will be ringsider Michael Jackson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How much longer can the Dodgers keep fooling themselves? They need a center 
fielder and simply will have to give up some pitching to get one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago, the Toronto Blue Jays drafted a little-known Dominican 
outfielder named George Bell from the Philadelphia Phillies. Three days ago, 
the Phillies drafted a little-known Dominican outfielder named Sil Campusano 
from the Blue Jays. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among those waiting for Mark Davis to sign is another free-agent reliever, 
Craig Lefferts. He doesn't pitch quite as well as Davis but runs to the mound a 
lot faster. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis can't be too happy about the Joe Carter deal. The Cincinnati center 
fielder wanted to go to San Diego. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only the World Series champion Oakland Athletics could shrug off the losses of 
Dave Parker and Tony Phillips. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers still get no respect at the Forum, where they drew the smallest 
crowd of the season for a Laker game Tuesday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was a preview of coming attractions, though, when Danny Manning traded 
baskets with Magic Johnson during a lively stretch of the fourth quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tony Campbell already has scored more points this season with the Minnesota 
Timberwolves than he did all last season with the Lakers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen aren't supposed to play tough defense, but UCLA guard Mitchell Butler 
held Washington State's Bennie Seltzer without a point in the second half after 
he scored 15 against other defenders in the first half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and Stanford each has won 23 national team championships in the 1980s. And 
now their women's volleyball teams are alive for one last title. Both are 
entered in the NCAA West Regionals Friday and Saturday at Pauley Pavilion. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The trainer of Caltech is more royally bred than the 3-year-old colt expected 
to be entered in the Hollywood Turf Cup Sunday. One of Eduardo Azpurua Jr.'s 
forefathers was president of Venezuela. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Montalbano has been named head golf pro at Riviera Country Club. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Boxing and wrestling are out at the Showboat Hotel in Las Vegas, where the 
arena has been turned into a bingo parlor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC will open practice for the Rose Bowl next Thursday. Larry Smith must not be 
superstitious. His team will work out for a few days at UC Irvine, just like 
last year before the loss to Michigan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Although Bo Schembechler's Wolverines have won consecutive championships, 
Illinois' John Mackovic was voted Big Ten coach of the year for the second 
straight time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The senior circuits in golf and boxing are far more successful than the one in 
baseball, which is averaging fewer than 1,000 fans a game in Florida. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Leave it to Buddy Ryan to create interest in the rematch of the Philadelphia 
Eagles' 27-0 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It has been quite a year for Nigerian-born football players. Kansas City's 
Christian Okoye is leading the NFL in rushing, and BYU's Mohammed Elewonibi won 
the Outland Trophy Wednesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to the Boz?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hockey may not be your thing, but it would be hard to argue with the selection 
of Wayne Gretzky as the pro athlete of the 1980s and the United States Olympic 
team's victory over the Soviet Union at Lake Placid, N.Y., in '80 as the 
greatest upset. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hold off on that TV movie about Nadia Comaneci's defection from Romania. A soap 
opera may be more in order.

CS LONG BEACH BEATS BRADLEY, 94-84 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A good first half was all Cal State Long Beach needed Wednesday night to become 
the first team in 35 years to spoil Bradley University's home basketball 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve players scored for the 49ers in the first 20 minutes as they built a 
56-34 lead en route to a 94-84 victory before 6,665 fans at the Peoria Civic 
Center. Bradley took advantage of a considerable 49er letdown in the second 
half, but could get no closer than 90-82 with 55 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't play the same in the second half," Long Beach Coach Joe 
Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (3-0) is off to its best start in 11 seasons. It is the worst start 
for Bradley (1-5) in 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost to a very good basketball team," Bradley Coach Stan Albeck said. "They 
have the makings of a great team. They played with poise and covered a lot of 
ground. You have to go north and south against them. You can't go east and west 
because they'll stick an arm or a leg in the passing lane and the result will 
be a layup at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Bradley had turned the ball over 17 times. In all, the Braves made 
30 turnovers, which was a Civic Center record, as were the 24 steals by the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our inexperience showed," Albeck said. "When you have two freshman guards and 
they turn the ball over 13 times between them in the first half, there's no way 
we can possibly win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Troy Joseph, a junior forward whom Harrington discovered at a playground 
tournament last year, had seven steals and was one of four double-figure 
scorers for the 49ers, who shot 54.5% from the field. Tyrone Mitchell led with 
16 points; Rudy Harvey, who made seven of eight shots, had 15, and Joseph and 
Mike Masucci each scored 14. 
</P>
<P>
Center Luke Jackson scored a career-high 29 points for Bradley and had a 
game-high 13 rebounds.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
SYRACUSE HOLDS OFF DUKE'S CHARGE, 78-76 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The calendar read Dec. 6, but Syracuse and Duke made it seem like March. 
</P>
<P>
In a game with the intensity of an NCAA tournament game, top-ranked Syracuse 
used David Johnson's two free throws with three seconds to play Wednesday night 
to beat No. 6 Duke, 78-76. 
</P>
<P>
The victory by the Big East's Orangemen (5-0) evened the ACC-Big East Challenge 
series 3-3 with two games to play tonight at East Rutherford, N.J., including 
the matchup of No. 3 Georgetown and 17th-ranked North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very intense out there," Syracuse's Billy Owens said. "This was the 
all-hyped-up Big East-ACC Challenge. I'll be rooting for Georgetown -- the last 
time I ever root for Georgetown." 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 73-73, after Christian Laettner made two free throws to 
bring Duke (3-1) even with 3:05 to play. 
</P>
<P>
LeRon Ellis then made one free throw with 1:47 left and, after Laettner missed 
two free throws with 1:28 left, Derrick Coleman made both ends of a one-and-one 
opportunity to give Syracuse a lead of 76-73, the only margin greater than two 
points in the final 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman missed a free throw with 39 seconds left, and Phil Henderson made one 
of two to get the Blue Devils within 76-74. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson then scored on a drive with 14 seconds left to tie the game after 
Syracuse had turned the ball over while trying to run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse called a timeout with 10 seconds left. As Owens was bringing the ball 
upcourt he stumbled and appeared to walk but no call was made. 
</P>
<P>
He got the ball to Johnson, who was fouled by Laettner and made both free 
throws. Duke had a last chance, but a long jump shot by Billy McCaffrey fell 
short at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski was impressed by the physical play of the Syracuse 
front line. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to use the word pro," he said. "It's a mature team and they play a good 
style for that type of team." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim was one of the few people upset by the intensity of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play nine or 10 people and get them ready as much as I can in 
December for the conference," he said. "I don't want to get sky-high on Dec. 
6." 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski had just the opposite reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"To be put in that arena at this time is good for us, and it was good for them, 
too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Thompson led Syracuse with 21 points, and Owens had 18. Robert Brickey 
led Duke with 21 points, and Laettner had 19. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 72, Providence 71 -- Dale Davis hit two free throws with 14 seconds 
remaining and the Tigers survived a last-second three-point attempt to win in 
the ACC-Big East Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
After Davis' free throws, Providence's Carlton Screen worked the ball upcourt, 
and it wound up in the hands of forward Marty Conlon, whose three-point shot 
bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Quinton Burton hit a three-point shot at 1:38, giving Providence (4-1) a 69-68 
lead, but two free throws by Marion Cash returned the lead to Clemson (4-1) 
with 1:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
Burton stepped out of bounds going for a rebound, but the Friars turned a miss 
by Clemson into another basket by Burton with 24 seconds left for Providence's 
last lead. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Kansas 86, Southern Methodist 53 -- Terry Brown hit four three-point 
shots and scored 14 points to lead the Jayhawks over the Mustangs at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (7-0) trailed only once and had six players in double figures. Mark 
Randall, Pekka Markkanen, and Kevin Pritchard had 12 points apiece, and Freeman 
West and Mike Maddox had 10. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Missouri 106, Hawaii Loa 48 -- The Tigers shot a school-record 75% and 
Doug Smith scored 17 points to lead five players in double figures as the 
Tigers beat the NAIA's Hawaii Loa at Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri, winning its 20th consecutive home game, opened with a 23-4 burst, led 
by Nathan Buntin's 13 points. The Tigers (5-0) led, 56-23, at halftime after 
shooting 83%. The 75% for the game broke the record of 73% against Iowa State 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Michigan 100, Central Michigan 51 -- Terry Mills scored all of his 17 
points in a first half that saw the Wolverines shoot 56% in beating the 
Chippewas at Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Higgins scored 18 points, Rumeal Robinson had 17 and Loy Vaught 12 for the 
Wolverines, who have won four in a row after losing their opening game. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Louisville 101, Vanderbilt 75 -- Everick Sullivan scored nine points as 
the Cardinals (4-1) opened with a 14-0 run and were never threatened in beating 
the Commodores at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who scored 13 of his 20 points in the first half, hit two jump shots, 
a three-point shot and a slam dunk during the opening spurt, which was capped 
by Tony Kimbro's free throw at 14:17. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville's full-court pressure defense forced Vanderbilt to miss its first 
eight shots and commit three turnovers before Derrick Wilcox broke the drought 
with a jump shot from the top of the key with 13:55 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 111, Tennessee Tech 75 -- Derrick Miller scored 36 points, including 
seven of Kentucky's near-record 18 three-point baskets, in a 111-75 victory at 
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky's three-point baskets was one shy of the record set when St. Francis, 
Pa., and Valparaiso each had 19 in games in February. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats (3-1) also attempted 41 three-point shots, topping Loyola 
Marymount's 39 tries against North Carolina on March 19, 1988.

Seagram Co.: The Montreal-based beverage company's third-quarter net earnings 
increased 19% from a year ago to $169.5 million. Sales were up 4% to $1.4 
billion, giving the company a nine-month record sales total of $3.9 billion. 
Seagram officials attributed the higher earnings figures to increased beverage 
profitability in all markets -- international, United States and Canada.

ART BUCHWALD: GOOD NEWS ISN'T PLAYING IN PEORIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The good news in recent weeks was that millions and millions of people in the 
Eastern Bloc were freed from Communist oppression. It was the most significant 
story since World War II. The bad news was that the television ratings in the 
United States were way down. Freedom may have its moments, but it doesn't sell 
Kellogg's Corn Flakes. 
</P>
<P>
With the heat on, the network news divisions began calling their staffs 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the Rambo Network, whose assistant kept feeding him Rolaids, 
stared out at the group. "OK, who was the wise guy who said that tearing down 
the Berlin Wall would make a good news show?" 
</P>
<P>
There was dead silence in the room. Finally the anchorman spoke up. "I thought 
it might be interesting. Americans had seen the wall standing for so long, I 
imagined that they would enjoy watching it being torn down live." 
</P>
<P>
The president asked: "Do you know what the rating was on that? It was 2.1. We 
used to have a six share of the audience. Two-point-one is lower than the polo 
game we covered with Prince Charles from Karachi." 
</P>
<P>
The executive producer from evening news tried to smooth things over. 
"Everybody makes mistakes. On paper, the end of the wall seemed like a good 
idea. It just so happened that more viewers tuned in to 'I Love Lucy.' Does 
that make overthrowing communism a bad idea?" 
</P>
<P>
The president said: "It is if you overdo it. What about the liberation of 
Czechoslovakia? For four nights we showed Czech citizens dancing in the streets 
of Prague, and we wound up in the sewer." 
</P>
<P>
A writer added: "We were covering history. It was television's finest hour." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell that to the guys who own this network, and who also have a light bulb 
factory in Schenectady. Look, I'm a newsman and I know a story when I see one, 
but I'm not going to put on Bulgaria if nobody is going to watch it. When will 
you all learn that a little freedom on television can go a long way?" 
</P>
<P>
Another producer asked, "Do you want us to cut back on Gorbachev too?" 
</P>
<P>
The president replied: "No, his ratings are still OK. I wouldn't want to have 
him on every night, but the guy does have charisma. Now, the research staff, 
who were immediately alerted after the Nielsen disaster, have come up with some 
guidance on what we can do to beef up the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"They are suggesting that we downplay any future stories on countries freeing 
themselves from communism. We don't have to accept all of their ideas, although 
the light bulb boys like them. They also think that we should go out and find 
some shooting wars instead. The TV audiences prefer to watch people being 
killed than people being liberated." 
</P>
<P>
"What if Albania declares itself free?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that that's any of our business. Nobody in America knows where 
Albania is. I'm not asking you to fudge the news, but you have to remember that 
if nobody watches the show, we're all out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"The fall of the Berlin Wall is a perfect example of overplaying a story. After 
a while, the only ones who were interested were those who lived near it. John 
Q. Viewer in Amarillo couldn't care less -- and that's the guy who is buying 
our sponsor's light beer." 
</P>
<P>
The producer said, "So you don't want us to call them like we see them." 
</P>
<P>
The president told him: "Call them any way you want to, but I have to answer to 
a higher authority. My bosses want to know why this network is providing upbeat 
news from Europe, which is producing lousy ratings, when their light bulb 
business needs all the downbeat news it can get."

DEAR MISS MANNERS: 'ETIQUETTE ZEALOTS' MAY GO TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN, Judith Martin is author of the new book Miss Manners' Guide 
for the Turn-of-the-Millennium (Pharos Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- Several times in your columns you have mentioned that if 
individuals do not act in a manner generally approved of by society, they have 
to suffer society's sanctions. Social control is an absolute necessity in any 
society, especially in as large and individualistic a society as ours. 
</P>
<P>
But how is this to be accomplished? We now have such a fragmented culture that 
peer pressure is diminished, and rudeness and crime (which is extreme rudeness) 
abound. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters even further, it appears to be "politically correct" to 
advocate a pluralistic, multicultural society (I don't support this), and 
perhaps one person's "bad manners" are correct in his culture. 
</P>
<P>
If so, doesn't that negate the whole concept of manners in America, and manners 
especially as a form of social control, at least in principle? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- No. American manners draw on both a variety of traditions and 
the original ideas of the country's founders, who had a specific interest in 
developing an egalitarian etiquette that would be different from the 
aristocratic traditions they knew. But even allowing for the ignorance of 
newcomers and regional differences, we can all distinguish good American 
manners from bad. 
</P>
<P>
As to how we punish the bad, that is a more difficult problem. Society's 
consequences for violating etiquette are not -- nor should they be -- what 
society's consequences are for mass murder or grand larceny. For this reason, 
etiquette zealots are often frustrated enough to take matters into their own 
hands, delivering rude punishments for rudeness, much as vigilante groups 
punish violations of the law by illegal means. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Miss Manners condemns this. But she also believes it to be based on 
an underestimation of what she has been pleased to call society's sanction. 
</P>
<P>
That sanction is social disapproval. Purposeful rudeness antagonizes those who 
are its victims, and they, in turn, treat perpetrators with disdain -- not 
return rudeness, Miss Manners hopes, but the coldness of distaste. Politeness 
does not require anyone to pretend to like being deliberately treated rudely. 
</P>
<P>
While being generally disliked may not be as clear or severe a punishment as a 
jail sentence or fine, it is unpleasant enough to discourage most people from 
persisting in provoking it. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I have a group of female friends to whom I have been 
writing for quite a number of years. Several of these friends have married 
recently. I have never met their mates. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to continue writing and exchanging gifts, but feel awkward now 
that these friends are married. May I continue to address the letters to my 
friends only, or do I now need to address letters to "Mr. and Mrs."? 
</P>
<P>
We usually exchange Christmas and birthday gifts. Should I now include the 
husbands in the gift exchange? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Although seasonal greetings are customarily addressed to both 
members of a couple, a lady does not lose her private mailing privileges upon 
marriage. Your letters and birthday presents continue to go to her alone, 
although it would be courteous to send greetings to her husband and perhaps the 
wish that you will someday meet. If your Christmas presents are for the 
household, they could also be sent to both. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- This will be my first year of sending Christmas cards as a 
widow. I have a son living at home, who has always been part of our signature. 
How do I write my name and his so that no one will mistakenly think that he is 
my husband and not my son? I am also curious about how I should sign my name on 
other correspondence, "Mrs. Alan Hanlin" or "Mrs. Adele Hanlin"? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Your signature is "Adele Hanlin," with the formal name ("Mrs. 
Alan Hanlin") beneath it in parentheses on business letters, so unknown 
recipients will know how to address you. A lady's name does not change on her 
husband's death, and an honorific is not part of anyone's signature. Don't let 
anyone tell you otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Christmas cards, sign them "Adele Hanlin and Sean." Miss Manners 
assumes that you do not make the mistake of sending social greetings to people 
who know you so little as to be unaware that you are recently widowed and have 
a son. You therefore run little risk of having them believe that you have taken 
up with a gentleman too young to have a surname.

What prompted me to write you is not so much the fact that these larger homes 
are built, but the fact that most of the time they show an incredible disregard 
of basic architectural principles of proportion and organization and are often 
down-right ugly. 
</P>
<P>
As an architect and an architectural historian with more than 30 years of 
experience I would like to point out to you some specifics, the few I can see, 
from the photo published with today's article: 
</P>
<P>
The dormers in the mansard roof are out of scale. 
</P>
<P>
Never is there a vase positioned in the pinnacle of a pediment. 
</P>
<P>
Corinthian pilasters don't bend at corners, as shown on the octagon over Mr. 
Coler's head. 
</P>
<P>
The whole organization of the facade on the right side is incongruous. 
</P>
<P>
Please interpret my comments as a constructive contribution to the quality of 
architecture in our city.

SERIES CARRIED 'INACCURATE' TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have read several of the "End of Nature" series by Bill McKibben (Nov. 23-26) 
and agree that it says valuable things and says them well. 
</P>
<P>
However, I have to deplore McKibben's decision to saddle it with that alarmist 
and inaccurate title. The meaning of McKibben's analysis is not that nature is 
ending, but that nature is taking its natural course and correcting in its 
ponderous and amoral way the temporary imbalances brought about by man's 
irreverent and heedless misuse of the planet during the last few centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Nature, I assure you, will not come out second best in a head-to-head showdown 
between nature and mankind. A few dozen (or hundred) species may become extinct 
somewhat sooner than the natural order would dictate; Homo sapiens may well be 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
Natural processes will eliminate (or minimize) the human irritant and the Earth 
will set about to compensate for man's meddling. McKibben's series might better 
be titled "The End of Civilization."

BRILLIANT, GENTEEL, HOPELESS ADAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Adams by Ernest Samuels (The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: 
$25; 504 pages). 
</P>
<P>
"Porcupinus Angeliscus," Secretary of State John Hay called Henry Adams, his 
gossip, walking companion, close friend, and co-owner of the double mansion 
across from the White House which stands today as the Hay-Adams Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The fox knows many things; the porcupine knows one thing well," Sir Isaiah 
Berlin wrote. All his long life -- 1838 to 1918 -- Adams bore a porcupine's 
head upon a fox's skibbling legs. They trotted him restlessly from mastery to 
mastery without ever staying long enough to move in. 
</P>
<P>
Classical historian, philosopher of history, political insider, novelist, 
professor, muckraking editor, conversationalist, husband, grand Platonic 
(though unwillingly) lover, epicure, puritan and, for a year, a fastidious 
South Seas drifter: Adams was all these things, many of them with brilliance. 
Yet they all eluded him or, more accurately, he eluded all of them. When his 
brother, Charles Francis Adams Jr., asked his help in preparing a biography of 
their father, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Make any use of me that you like just as though I were real." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth in a line of famous Adamses -- John, John Quincy, Charles Francis -- 
Henry angrily struggled with the family curse of being so high-minded as to 
reach a summit and then drift off upwards. He ran all the races, and well 
enough to win; but because he could not allow himself to want the prize, he 
never quite ran any race at all. 
</P>
<P>
Except one, and that one without running. He wrote some of the most 
extraordinary sentences in American letters. His genius was a series of 
specific and powerful brilliancies that glitter in his best books and 
particularly in his collected letters. He was a master miniaturist who 
attempted murals and got lost. 
</P>
<P>
Even "The Education of Henry Adams," which carries along wonderfully for 
awhile, sinks struggling into its own quicksand of high-reaching and 
half-articulated thought. William James wrote Adams to commend the early parts 
of the book. But, he added cautiously, "a great deal of the later diplomatic 
history is dealt with so much by hint and implication that to an ignoramus like 
W. J. it reads obscurely." 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Samuels, who had spent his life on Adams' life, makes a spectacular 
effort to assay and describe the cloudy convolutions of such speculative works 
as "Mount Saint Michel and Chartres," and of Adams's theories on history. 
Sometimes, as with a long and devoted marriage, the features of Samuels' 
writing come to resemble those of its subject, both in its witty pinpointing 
and in its clouds. But even he tells us finally -- and it reflects Adams's own 
unsleeping self-awareness: 
</P>
<P>
"Adams could not either state his problem or wholly know what he himself 
meant." 
</P>
<P>
Samuels' three-volume biography was powerful and artful scrutiny of the man who 
doubted he was real. It is a classic, but three volumes in this case may itself 
constitute a kind of practical unreality. Now the biographer has condensed and 
refined his work into one volume, benefitting from additional material that has 
come to light. 
</P>
<P>
It starts off, appropriately, with a high-minded refusal. As a child, Henry 
observed his grandfather, John Quincy, declining to attend a Boston banquet for 
President Tyler. It was a protest against Tyler's slave-holding; even more, it 
was a slap in the face of the Boston financial Establishment for its 
complaisance towards slave-holding interests. 
</P>
<P>
Always a virtuous remnant, the Adamses were never at ease even in the city that 
most of us associate them with. Henry could not even abide its virtues -- nor 
ever quite get away from them. He called Boston "a provincial city in which 
intellectual life has foundered in moral earnestness." All his life he worked, 
not really successfully, to strip himself of what he called "my Bostonianism 
and finikin clinging to what I think best." When Harvard tried to give him an 
honorary doctorate, he wriggled and temporized and introduced so many caveats 
before refusing, that finally President Charles Elliot wrote stiffly reminding 
him that "You are not conferring the degree on yourself -- it is the act of the 
University." 
</P>
<P>
It epitomized his brilliant, hopeless, comical and rather grand pursuit of a 
three-legged contradiction: to be an Adams, to make a mark on a brawling, 
vulgar United States, and to infuse this cigar-chewing, money-grubbing, 
immensely vital country with the spiritual and cultural values of European 
civilization. It made him alternately reach out and pull back, whether as a 
Washington insider-outsider or as a celebrator of old-world sophistication and 
political dialectic. He managed to be an aesthete on close terms with the likes 
of Bernard Berenson, to be a parlor Marxist, and to be a genteel conspirator 
for Cuban independence. "Come and revolute Cuba," he wrote to Hay -- not yet in 
the government -- at one point. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, his salon was a privileged window on national politics. Everyone 
came by to tell him things. At the same time, along with his wife, Clover -- 
until she killed herself in an access of depression -- Mr. and Mrs. Hay, and 
several others of the elect, he set standards for snobbishness. Even President 
Rutherford Hays found himself snubbed one day when he walked over to join Henry 
and several of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels' volume gets in all in, along with Adams's travels, his writings, and 
the long unconsummated love affair, after his wife's death, with Elizabeth 
Cameron, another Washington grande dame. She sent him away, called him back, 
she would and she wouldn't. Finally, she didn't. Possibly this was to his 
relief; he wrote her with melancholy wit: "I am not old enough to be your tame 
cat. You are too old to accept me in any other character." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps wit -- melancholy, choleric, exhilarated -- was, after all, his true 
passion and bedrock reality. Certainly his letters, from which Samuels quotes 
generously and well, demonstrate it. This one-volume compression calls urgently 
for another: a selection of letters from Harvard University Press's six-volume 
set.

The Circus Master's Mission by Joel Brinkley (Random House: $18.95; 394 pages). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"The Circus Master's Mission," a thriller by journalist Joel Brinkley that 
envisions a full-scale military invasion of Nicaragua by the United States, is 
set several years into the future. By now, the Gorbachev era of closer ties 
between Russia and the West has worn thin. We are, in essence, back in the 
pre-Gorbachev era when it would seem likely that a good deal of this 400-page 
book was written. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkley directed the New York Times' coverage of the Iran-Contra scandal and 
reported from Nicaragua for several years, and he offers a view of official and 
off-hours Washington so broadly cynical, and of Nicaragua on the Contra side so 
broadly sinister, that it seems immediately translatable into a 
movie-of-the-week or even an after-dinner board game, a sort of imperialist 
Monopoly for the jaded Georgetown set. 
</P>
<P>
First we meet Major "Paz," a red-haired killer -- "Paz" in the eternal sense, 
it is explained -- who heads a special "Death Penalty" Contra force and who is 
virtually inseparable from his Ray Ban sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, an Oliver North figure, the gung-ho Marine Col. Eric 
Gustafson, chief military attache at the United States embassy in Managua; and 
he and a wayward CIA station chief in Honduras, a disappointed Cuban named 
Rafael Mendoza, are the architects of a scheme to rouse and prod the slumbering 
giant to the north to flex his military muscles and set the Nicaraguan house in 
order -- i.e., move out the Sandinistas and bring in the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
As we proceed along these simple, not to say grossly oversimplified, lines, we 
meet as well the Washington side of the equation. Chief among these is the 
modest but sexually smoldering Chris Eaton, a reporter who is covering 
Nicaragua with extra effort for the little-heralded New World News Service. 
Eaton is recently divorced and, after becoming involved with the beautiful, 
unhappily married Leslie DeSalles -- assistant to Gen. Dayton, who, as it 
happens, oversees the U.S. military presence in Nicaragua -- dreams of a job on 
the New York Times or the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Then too, there is the pathetic, morally corrupt, Valium-addicted Terry Ascher, 
a career diplomat who is the son of a more prominent, retired career diplomat 
who makes a point of belittling and upbraiding him. It is Ascher who becomes 
head of the new White House office, created at the behest of the President 
himself, that manages the Contra program -- a job everyone else prudently won't 
touch; and it is Ascher who allows himself and his country to be duped by the 
manipulative duo of adventurists to the South, Gustafson and Mendoza. These 
two, who know how to distract a man and sap his strength at the same time, have 
a vital ally in the sultry Francesca, a freedom fighter who holds back nothing 
for the Nicaraguan counterrevolution. Ascher, arguably the dumbest Harvard 
graduate in all of American fiction, is a bit surprised by her pointed 
attentions but suspects no ulterior motive on her part. At the moment of truth, 
Brinkley outdoes even his own standard for ham-fisted irony: "Ascher moaned out 
loud, thinking: God, she's a pro." 
</P>
<P>
With the invasion of Nicaragua by a full panoply of American forces, Brinkley 
pulls out all the stops, treating us to a vivid and highly informed guided tour 
of the new generation of our military hard- and software, punctuated by 
comic-book-style exclamations from enthused military personnel: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Bombs away,' Janeway said. Rising jerked the stick as the plane bucked, 
suddenly eight thousand pounds lighter. As the bombs fell, sensor pods in their 
noses locked on to the laser mark reflecting back from the target. Tiny fins 
and aerofoils on the bombs' tails flipped left and right to keep the fall 
straight down the laser path. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Flame and black smoke poured straight up in a fiery jet . . . " 'Bingo, 
buddy,' Janeway said, turning to Rising, thumbs up." 
</P>
<P>
The intended exhilaration of the scene might have been more infectious if 
forces opposing the Sandinistas were not known to have "obsolete weapons, 
demoralized conscripts, antiquated antiaircraft and nothing even resembling an 
air force," but there may yet be something salutary in the rehearsal of such 
high-tech weaponry in the pages of a book, perhaps mitigating the impulse to 
search out actual opportunities for its engagement. 
</P>
<P>
One has more trouble attempting to excuse the portrayal of the Nicaraguan 
conflict in terms that reduce it to anti-Communist slogans and shibboleths that 
haven't passed muster since the days of Vietnam, let alone post-Gorbachev. For 
an insider, Brinkley sure likes to write it simple -- there isn't a word in 
this book about the Contra-cocaine connection, for instance -- and making his 
bad guys such obvious, loner grotesques tends implicitly to legitimize our 
continuing support of the Contras. However, until such U.S.-backed forces are 
recognized and addressed as part and parcel of a long-term, consistent American 
policy that many argue doesn't serve our real interests, we're just looking at 
Latin America as, indeed, a sort of murderous Monopoly board.

YOUR COINS: COLLECTORS WILLING TO PAY MORE THAN DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent column, which mentioned a gold Andrew Jackson medal in a pewter frame, 
has elicited an interesting response from a reader in Woodland Hills. The 
reader says the medal was struck in 1833-34 by the United States Mint and is 
pictured in R.W. Julian's "Medals of the U.S. Mint." It was made in gold, 
silver and bronze, with the pewter frame attached afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be a pin on the back," the reader says. "If the pin is missing, 
it is probably broken off and would hurt the overall value of the piece. It is 
scarce but not rare in gold -- probably 20 to 30 specimens exist in gold. I 
would pay $425 for it, assuming it is undamaged -- for my collection." 
</P>
<P>
In my column, I said the Jackson medal was probably worth between $75 and $150. 
Why the discrepancy between my figure and that of the knowledgeable collector? 
Because I gave a figure that a seller could reasonably expect to receive from a 
dealer, while a collector who specializes in such material would be willing to 
pay much more. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson to be learned from this is that sellers can only hope to get top 
dollar if they can locate the right buyer. Normally, it's necessary to work 
through a dealer, who has to tie up his funds for an undetermined period of 
time in order to make a profit. A patient seller may get lucky and find just 
the right private party for a particular coin or medal. But it is highly 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Practically speaking, once you decide to sell, it's best to consult with three 
or more dealers in order to establish a fair market price. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I have a bronze or brass medal that has the words World's Exposition 
Chicago 1893 and a design of the fair buildings on one side. On the reverse is 
a head of Columbus and his name. I also have a badge that shows Columbus in 
front of his ship with the words World's Fair Official Souvenir 1492-1892. 
Could you please tell me a little of the history of these two pieces and their 
value? -- D.H.C. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Obviously, what you have came from the Chicago World's Fair almost 100 
years ago. A lot of interest is stirring regarding this fair, which observed 
Columbus' discovery of America. In just two years, it will be time to mark the 
500th anniversary and undoubtedly there will be much hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
I have seen dealers at coin shows who handle such material. You can expect a 
commemorative coin from the U.S. Mint to spur interest in the subject. Right 
now, your medal and badge are probably worth about $5 to $10 each, depending 
upon condition. I suspect they'll be worth more in two years. 
</P>

<P>
Eighty-Five Plus: The Oldest Old by Sally Bould, Beverly Sanbourn and Laura 
Reif (Wadsworth Publishing Co.: $16; paper). 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as the authors state, "People who reach 90 are different." 
Gerontologists, engaged in different areas of specialization, distinguish 
between the "young old" (67-74), "old old" (74-85) and "oldest old." 
</P>
<P>
People in the 85-plus group have achieved extreme longevity, which often proves 
a mixed blessing. Unlike several Scandinavian countries whose "oldest old" 
outnumber America's, we lack a strong family network and an adequate medical 
delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
Analyzing different ways the rich and poor are treated (there's a passage about 
the Duchess of Windsor, who died at 89 in a nursing facility, contrasted with 
an ordinary woman on Medicaid), the authors say middle-class people frequently 
must "spend down" their assets, often becoming impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy answers, but there are sensible beginnings to the problem, 
say the authors, utilizing both private and governmental resources. In the 
meantime, those responsible for nonagenarians must manage their finances 
skillfully, make sure physical needs are met and provide dignified, 
compassionate care "as long as needed." ROSELLE M. LEWIS

YOUR WHEELS: POLISHING UP THE IMAGE AT CARWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proper care of a car means different things to different motorists, but one 
nearly universal point of agreement seems to be the need -- or perhaps urge -- 
to drive a clean car. 
</P>
<P>
Among all the nagging tasks that cars demand, everything from oil changes to 
brake jobs, the most relentless and time-consuming must be the weekly or 
monthly task of washing the car. Dirty air or inclement weather only make the 
job all the harder. 
</P>
<P>
American motorists spent an astounding $2.5 billion at the nation's 22,000 
self-serve and conveyor-type carwashes last year in an effort to keep their 
wheels in a presentably clean condition, according to the International Carwash 
Assn. It's a ritual that keeps 300,000 people employed. 
</P>
<P>
The association reported that the majority of car owners go to carwashes now 
and then, but also that there is a hardy minority of 39% of motorists who wash 
their own cars, turning on the garden hose, filling up a bucket with suds and 
taking a sponge to their sheet metal. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a good-quality car soap is important to minimize water spots and 
protect the paint from the harsh chemicals found in many detergents. A 
semiannual waxing will provide the care that can extend the life of a car's 
paint by several years and possibly add hundreds of dollars to the eventual 
resale value of the car. 
</P>
<P>
But a trip to the carwash, for many, is one of life's fascinating luxuries, 
watching the car being hooked up to a conveyor line and towed through various 
spraying stations, giant spinning brushes and blow-dry machines. Nearly 
three-fourths of the trips to such carwashes were because of some "special 
occasion," motorists said in a survey. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of motorists by the carwash association turned up some interesting 
statistics. A surprisingly small 4% of motorists never wash their cars, and 22% 
wash their cars less frequently than once a month, the trade group found. 
</P>
<P>
We might suspect who these people are, who as a matter of money or time cannot 
wash their cars. And perhaps there is a group that may even take a certain 
pride in driving the dirtiest car on the road. For them, the possibility that 
the dirt on their hood might oxidize their paint is a faraway idea or something 
they might even enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, a dirty car provides the same sort of transportation 
that the most polished car does. The carwash association experts suggest, 
though, that these people might have some deeper problems. 
</P>
<P>
"In psychological research, it has been found that a well-groomed car usually 
indicates a well-groomed and orderly driver," according to literature I 
recently received from the association. 
</P>
<P>
The assertion raises some interesting questions. Does a dirty car suggest the 
owner is poorly groomed, perhaps with shaggy long hair or dirty blue jeans? Is 
such a motorist disorderly or even reckless in his driving? 
</P>
<P>
I hope that's not the case. I recently had the misfortune of parking my own car 
overnight under a large date palm that was home to a flock of pigeons. By 
morning, it was literally half-covered with a one-eighth-inch-thick layer of 
bird droppings. I could not stop at one of the nation's 22,000 carwashes, so I 
made the rounds that day with my car in an admittedly disgusting condition. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere I went, people stopped to look. They were incredulous that such a 
car was on the road. I wonder whether I had become a disorderly part of society 
or, at least, whether strangers perceived me as such. That apparently is the 
power of a dirty car. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, bird droppings, acid rain and industrial fallout are all harmful 
to car paint, the association points out. So, even if you are not concerned so 
much about your image in our image-conscious society, you might have some good 
reasons to wash your car this weekend.

YOUR STAMPS: HINGING WILL DECREASE THE VALUE OF MINT SETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I'll bet you get tired of answering the question "How much are these 
stamps worth?" My own question is: Does mounting with hinges significantly 
detract from the value of mint-new issues? I collect for fun, not investment. I 
actually prefer to mount stamps with hinges but I am concerned that I may be 
needlessly damaging them. -- G.R. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No, I don't get tired of talking about stamp prices. We live in such a 
material, money-oriented society that you would have to make a conscious effort 
to avoid discussing the cost of things whenever the conversation turns to 
things that can be bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of gasoline, food, housing and services is part of our everyday 
speech. Why not talk about the prices of collectibles also, such as art, old 
furniture, coins and stamps? You have to start somewhere to get interested in 
philately. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, of course, is when you begin to think that money is more important 
than anything else, you try judging only by the price tag. It is a sad fact 
that ignorant people know the price of everything but the value of nothing. 
</P>
<P>
To answer your more important question, hinging does decrease a stamp's value. 
Many collectors and investors will not even look at a mint stamp if the gum has 
been disturbed by a stamp hinge. If you buy an expensive unhinged mint issue, I 
recommend that you keep it in some type of mount and never hinge it. 
</P>
<P>
Or if you would rather save a lot of money, buy lightly hinged unused stamps at 
a fraction of what you would pay for never-hinged copies, and you don't have to 
worry if the stamp has been regummed or the hinge mark fraudulently removed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I don't want to spend a lot of money. How can I learn the basics of stamp 
collecting before investing money that I can't afford to lose? -- W.A. 
</P>
<P>
A: Go to the public library and read their philatelic books. Visit a local 
dealer and ask for advice. Talk to any stamp collectors that you know and ask 
them how they recommend you get started. Philately need not be expensive; there 
is something for every budget. 
</P>
<P>
If you enclose $1 and ask for "Stamp Collecting Made Easy," you will receive a 
96-page booklet by writing to Linn's Stamp News, P.O. Box 29, Sidney, Ohio 
45365. This booklet is specially designed to help beginning collectors learn 
stamp terminology, and it will introduce you to collecting techniques in terms 
that are easy to understand. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please evaluate these items: A Portuguese Halley's Comet stamp, Russian 
issues showing the Bolshoi Theater and Russian Composers (photocopy enclosed), 
and a set of 4 Swiss fairy tale stamps (Hansel and Gretel, Cinderella, etc.). 
-- B.H. 
</P>
<P>
A: Current Scott's catalogue values are $1.50 mint, 75 cents used for the 1986 
Comet issue; $16.50 mint, $2 used for your Russian stamps; and $3.12 mint, 
$1.08 used for the Swiss set of 1985. Your Soviet stamps were issued in May, 
1951 to honor the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Bolshoi Theater in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My stamp from Portugal shows an airplane propeller, is red in color, and is 
in nice mint condition. I can't figure out the denomination, however. It says 
"1$50" in the lower right corner of the stamp's design. Can you tell me about 
this issue, and how to read the denomination? -- J.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: Portuguese currency units are escudos and centavos, with 100 centavos equal 
to 1 escudo. The way they write the amount, which totals 1 escudo, 50 centavos 
-- or 1 1/2 escudos -- is 1$50. 
</P>
<P>
Your stamp can't be red because the 1$50 value of this air mail set from 
1936-1941 was issued only in dark blue and has a current catalogue value of 70 
cents mint, 45 cents used, in U.S. money. The 2$50 stamp of the set was rose 
red, valued at $1.10 mint, 45 cents canceled in U.S. money. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have some old passports that bear British Consular Service stamps. Also I 
have a small photo of a gentleman that has a green 3-cent U.S. Internal Revenue 
stamp with George Washington's picture. Was this some sort of a tax stamp? 
</P>
<P>
I also have a blue French stamp, postmarked without a date. I believe it to be 
50 or 150 francs. It has a profile of Pasteur on it, and the letter dates from 
around 1926. What is the value of these items? -- S.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: Maybe a few dollars for the passports and revenue-stamped photograph. Most 
U.S. or foreign revenue stamps are not rare or valuable because they were 
issued in large quantities and collector demand is less than for "regular" 
postage stamps from the country. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1923 and 1926, France issued a series of Louis Pasteur stamps of 
various denominations. None of them were over 1 1/2 francs in face value, so 
your stamp must be valued at either 50 centimes or 1 1/2 francs in issue value. 
You imply that the stamp is on its original envelope, making it a little more 
desirable than an off-cover specimen, but still worth only about $1 or so in 
1989 U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My Bulgarian souvenir sheet shows the first Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, 
and the dates 1961-1971. What is it worth? -- P.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: Issued on April 12, 1971, the 10th anniversary of the first human being in 
space, your Bulgarian souvenir sheet has a current catalogue value of $2.25 
mint, $1.75 canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What does t.t.p. mean? I have seen this in connection with auction lots of 
canceled stamps. -- H.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: "Tied to piece" refers to a stamp still glued on a portion of its original 
envelope, with the cancellation covering both the stamp's surface and the 
envelope paper at the stamp's edge. When a stamp is "tied on" there is some 
good evidence that it genuinely belongs with the cover or piece of cover on 
which it is affixed. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the stamp and its cancel, it is normally worth more when tied than 
in a used and off-cover state. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a very old 25-cent newspaper stamp with Abraham Lincoln's portrait in 
the center. It is red and in nice condition. Can you comment on the value and 
circumstances of issue? -- R.K.G. 
</P>
<P>
A: Starting in 1865, the U.S. government required use of newspaper stamps for 
prepayment of postage on bulk shipments of periodicals. You either possess the 
1865 variety in orange red shade, priced in Scott's catalogue at $85, or the 
1875 printing in dark carmine, cataloguing $70.

Blake's Own Business: Robert Blake, of TV's "Baretta" fame, is scouring the 
city for three people he met at the Arriba Restaurant in Pasadena on a Friday 
night about two weeks ago. He wants to find them so badly, he took out a 
4x4-inch ad in the Pasadena Star News with a smiling picture of himself. "A 
simple request, from actor Robert Blake, please help make my holiday season 
special," reads the ad. It seems that one of the three people who chatted with 
Blake at the restaurant mentioned knowing Blake's niece. "It would mean a great 
deal to me if any one of these three people would call me," says the ad. When 
contacted by The Times, Blake said he would rather let the whole thing rest and 
would give no details. "What's going on here is a personal bit of strangeness, 
that's all," he said. DANIEL CERONE

Red Cross Relief Show Canceled: Promoters have called off one of two planned 
disaster-relief concerts sponsored by the American Red Cross because they could 
not line up performers in time for the scheduled Dec. 17 event in the Charlotte 
(N.C.) Coliseum. But the second concert, to be held the same night in Los

Israeli Broadcast Ban: Israel's broadcast authority angered pop music fans and 
leftist politicians Wednesday by banning from radio and television two protest 
songs about the country's handling of the Palestinian uprising on grounds that 
the songs serve the enemies of the Jewish state. "This is a political protest 
and cannot be heard as entertainment. . . . These songs depress the state and 
are propaganda for the Palestine Liberation Organization," authority deputy 
chairman Shlomo Kor said of the tunes by Nurit Galron and Hava Alberstein, two 
of Israel's most popular women singers. Education Minister Yitzhak Navon said 
he will delay implementation of the decision until he can hear arguments from 
both sides. DANIEL CERONE

HINTS FROM HELOISE: CORNSTARCH AND BAKING SODA KEY TO HANDMADE CHRISTMAS 
ORNAMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I've misplaced my recipe for making cornstarch-and-baking-soda 
ornaments, and, of course, now I need it. I know it was in your column some 
time ago, but I hope you can print it again. Thanks for all your wonderful 
help. -- MURRIEL, Kearny, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MURRIEL: I'd be glad to. They're easy to make, and handmade ornaments are 
a great Christmas tradition to keep alive. You'll need: 
</P>
<P>
HANDMADE CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
2 cups baking soda 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups cold water 
</P>
<P>
Mix cornstarch and baking soda in saucepan. Add water. Cook over medium heat, 
stirring constantly, until mixture is consistency of wet mashed potatoes. Turn 
out onto plate. Cover with damp cloth and let it cool. 
</P>
<P>
When cool, knead until smooth. Seal in plastic bag and store in refrigerator 
until ready to use. 
</P>
<P>
Shape ornaments by hand or flatten dough and use cookie cutters to cut out 
shapes. Insert wire hanger into soft dough. Then let ornaments dry overnight, 
or heat them in 250-degree oven 15 minutes. If not completely dry, continue to 
heat in 5-minute increments. 
</P>
<P>
Dried pieces can be painted with water colors, poster paints, acrylic paints or 
felt-tip pens. Finish ornaments with 1 coat or 2 coasts of clear nail polish or 
varnish and they will last for years. 
</P>
<P>
Enjoy your ornament making. 
</P>
<P>

DEAR READERS: So many of our readers have hints for healthier cooking, we 
thought it would be nice to pass them along since many of us are trying to cut 
calories, cholesterol, salt and fat. Including me. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene of Colorado Springs, Colo., cooks chicken breasts in the oven in a 
covered dish with a sodium-free broth. She says they are delicious and low in 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
Katie of Reno, Nev., has a great substitution for high-fat whipped topping. 
Chill some evaporated skim milk well and then whip it. Add a dash of vanilla 
extract or sugar substitute for flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy of Blanco, Tex., uses plain nonfat yogurt in place of sour cream on a 
baked potato. I like to add garlic salt or herbs for a tasty treat. 
</P>
<P>
The new sprinkle-on butter substitutes are fantastic on steamed vegetables, 
mashed potatoes and to add butter flavor to homemade low-fat macaroni and 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
When making baked goods like muffins or breads, add a half cup of oat bran. 
This will give them a better texture and will increase fiber intake. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I have bought a sack of onions, I find it much easier to get 
the whole job done at once: I chop all of the onions in a food processor, put 
them in plastic, self-closing bags and place them in the freezer after 
flattening the bags. 
</P>
<P>
This allows me to break off whatever amount I need and eliminates all the tears 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- STEPHANIE, St. Louis 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: A friend showed me how to make a chocolate fondue. I decided one 
day I would prepare it as practice for a dinner party I was having later. 
</P>
<P>
I did something wrong because the chocolate ended up hard and gritty. I have 
since tried a couple more times and I still get the same results. Any idea why 
the chocolate comes out like this? 
</P>
<P>
 -- PATTY, New York 
</P>
<P>
DEAR PATTY: If you're using the double-boiler method, don't let the water touch 
the bottom of the pan because it will scorch the chocolate and make it hard and 
gritty. 
</P>
<P>
Using a saucepan that is too light and cooking the chocolate too fast could 
also contribute to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to cook chocolate for a fondue is to use a heavy saucepan over low 
heat and stir it often. I like to use a pancake turner. That way you can really 
scrape the whole pan in just a few moments. 
</P>
<P>
Give this a try and let us know how it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I had some very ripe bananas and I decided I would bake some 
banana bread the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
When I began the recipe I went to get the bananas and they were gone. My 
husband had tossed them. So instead of throwing out the already-mixed 
ingredients I thought I would add some canned peaches, since this was all I 
had. 
</P>
<P>
The bread turned out just fine and my family loved it. I am also going to 
experiment with several other fruits.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: BEST OF '89'S FOOD, NUTRITION AND FITNESS BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There is no frigate like a book," wrote Emily Dickinson, describing 
literature's power to transport. True enough, but some books need take us no 
farther than our own kitchens to provide year-round pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
To our mind, the best place to make headway with holiday shopping is at a local 
bookstore, especially the food, nutrition and fitness section, with a side trip 
to the cookbook department. To help you choose gifts, we've listed the cream of 
this year's crop: 
</P>
<P>
Topping the roster is the splendid "Beyond Cholesterol" (Johns Hopkins 
University Press, $18.95). If you want to learn once and for all about 
cardiovascular disease, this is a first-rate choice. Dr. Peter Kwiterovich, 
director of the Lipid Research Clinic at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, 
guides you step-by-step through the maze of evidence about risk factors. He 
explains how to modify them with diet, exercise and, if necessary, drugs. The 
book also contains recipes, complete with nutrient analyses. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of recipes, we have two cookbook suggestions, both designed to promote 
a heart-healthy diet. One, "The American Heart Assn. Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol 
Cookbook" edited by Scott Grundy MD (Times Books, $18.95) opens with an 
overview of diet and cholesterol links, but focuses mainly on buying and 
preparing food. Recipes range from low-fat appetizers to such apparently rich 
desserts as chocolate souffle with vanilla sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The second, "Mediterranean Light" by Martha Rose Shulman (Bantam Books, 
$21.95), will tingle taste buds with dishes like classic ratatouille, 
orange-flavored North African beet salad, hot yogurt soups and chicken 
bouillabaisse. Again, nutritional information is provided. Seasonal menus are a 
nice additional touch, especially useful for the novice. 
</P>
<P>
On another tack, how long can you keep chicken in the refrigerator? How do you 
tell whether eggs are fresh? How do you know if nuts in the shell are stale? 
The answer to these and hundreds of other questions appear in the 
well-researched "Keeping Food Fresh" by Janet Bailey (Harper and Row, $10.95). 
Judging from the questions we receive every week, this would be a great choice 
for almost anyone on your list. 
</P>
<P>
Pomegranates may be among the oldest fruits ever eaten. Yet to millions, 
they're a new food, only recently seen in the upscale section of the 
supermarket. Cassava, a dietary staple in Africa, is similarly alien to most 
Americans. In "The New Foods: A Shopper's Guide With Recipes" (Henry Holt, 
$19.95), Camille Cusumano provides descriptions and recipes for foods and herbs 
new to the supermarket scene. 
</P>
<P>
For athletes, both casual and serious, we suggest "The Sports Nutrition 
Guidebook" by Nancy Clark, (Leisure Press, $12.95). Beginning with basic 
nutrition advice, Clark also considers fluid replacement, carbohydrate loading, 
pre-event meals and use of supplements. Using case studies from her clinical 
experience, she presents reasonable solutions to nutrition problems (including 
weight control) faced by athletes and nonathletes alike. A final section gives 
recipes with analysis of carbohydrate, protein, fat and calorie content. 
</P>
<P>
Another choice for athletes is the recently revised "Food For Sport" by Nathan 
Smith MD and Bonnie Worthington-Roberts Ph.D. (Bull Publishing, $9.95), a 
sports-medicine physician and a nutritionist, respectively. Giving tips to the 
selection of foods and fluids, it also explains nutrient needs geared to 
particular sports and discusses nutrition for athletes of all ages, beginning 
in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
For those whose interest in food extends beyond mealtime, consider "Food in 
History" by Reay Tannahill, a British historian and novelist (Crown Publishers, 
$19.95). First published in 1973, this completely revised volume covers 500,000 
years of fascinating information and anecdotes about the history of man's diet. 
</P>
<P>
Another wonderful gift is "Pomp and Sustenance: 25 Centuries of Sicilian Food" 
by Mary Taylor Simeti (Alfred Knopf, $25). While there are practical 
concessions to dietary concern (such as the suggestion to broil eggplant rather 
than fry it), many recipes here don't fit easily into the daily routine of a 
prudent diet. No matter, the interweaving of recipes and Sicilian history and 
the wealth of beautiful illustrations are reason enough to enjoy this book. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone interested in women's history, try "Never Too Thin" by Robert 
Pollack Seid (Prentice Hall, $19.95). The author, a social historian, traces 
the evolution of the widespread dissatisfaction with weight and body shape that 
has plagued generations of women. 
</P>
<P>
Last, we think there's no better gift in print than a subscription to the 
"Tufts Diet and Nutrition Letter." Order from the Tufts University Diet and 
Nutrition Letter, Subscription Dept., P.O. Box 57843, Boulder, Colo. 
80321-7843, or call (800) 937-9465. The first subscription is $20; subsequent 
orders are $16. The newsletter will provide friends and relatives on a holiday 
list with accurate, up-to-date information on nutrition all year long. 
</P>
<P>
Keep Eggs in Carton When Refrigerated 
</P>
<P>
Question: A friend told me that it's better to store eggs in the carton than in 
the egg rack on the refrigerator door. Is that true? Second, how long can you 
keep fresh eggs in the refrigerator? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Eggs lose moisture and absorb odor through the shell, so keep them in 
the carton, not the door. Also, the temperature on the door is warmer than in 
the interior, leading to more rapid deterioration in quality. 
</P>
<P>
Provided eggs are clean and unbroken, they can be stored safely for as long as 
four to five weeks. They will not, however, be at the same level of quality as 
they were when you first brought them home. Deterioration will be both in 
flavor and texture. Ideally, they are best used up within a week, especially if 
they are to be eaten as is. 
</P>
<P>
You can freeze whole eggs that you don't use up within a reasonable period. 
Simply pierce the yolk with a fork and stir it slowly to mix the yolk and white 
together. Do not beat it, because incorporating air bubbles will cause the eggs 
to dry out as they freeze. You'll also need to add sugar or salt (depending how 
you eventually will use them) to stabilize the texture. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt 
or 1/2 teaspoon sugar per cup of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Individual eggs can be frozen in ice-cube trays, then unmolded and stored in 
plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was in a health-food store looking at supplements for athletes. The sales 
clerk advised me that carnitine supplements can help improve performance in 
endurance contests. Is there any truth to that? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Carnitine is an amino-acid derivative that functions in the metabolism 
of fatty acids. Several years ago, Italy's World Cup soccer team publicly 
attributed its success to carnitine supplements, but the claim is unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Carnitine is found in abundant amounts of animal flesh as well as in dairy 
products, but in only limited amounts in vegetables. But that is not important, 
even to strict vegetarians, because it is produced in the liver and kidney. 
Thus, while carnitine is essential, healthy individuals have all they need. 
</P>
<P>
Supplements may actually be counterproductive. The reason is that they usually 
contain two different forms of the compound, and one inhibits the action of the 
other. In short, your diet and body will provide all the carnitine you need, 
and supplements are best left on the health-food shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Q: During the past several years I have acquired 25 unwanted pounds. It took 
bad news to motivate me to attack the problem: My doctor says my blood sugar is 
too high. He advised me to follow a sensible, low-calorie diet and to come back 
for reevaluation in a few weeks. I know how to cut calories, but is there 
anything special I should be doing because of the blood-sugar problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. A sensible, low-calorie diet, just as your doctor advised, is really all 
that's needed. However, that does imply certain ground rules. First, fats are 
the most concentrated form of calories. But it is especially useful to cut down 
on saturated fat, which drives blood cholesterol up and increases risk of heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Second, to ensure a nutritionally adequate diet, it's important to make the 
calories you do consume count. That means it's a good idea to dispense with 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
This translates into a diet based on skim milk and low-fat dairy products, two 
or three eggs a week, small servings of lean meat, fish or poultry, and 
alternates of dried beans, plenty of fresh vegetables and fresh fruits -- 
especially those rich in vitamins A and C -- and enriched breads and cereals. 
</P>
<P>
You know best how drastically your own diet must be revamped to fit this model. 
For some people it takes no more than cutting back on portion sizes, trimming 
off excess fat and eliminating occasional desserts or calorie-rich, 
nutrient-poor snacks. 
</P>
<P>
Others realize that the problems with their diet go well beyond an excess of 
calories. For many, difficult work schedules have led to dietary habits in need 
of major reshaping. These individuals might do well to seek the help of a 
registered dietitian.

RESTAURATEUR'S 'FIRE &amp; SPICE' FILLS COOKBOOK GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The flood of cookbooks published annually in the United States has left few 
cuisines uncovered. One exception is that of Sri Lanka, a gap that has been 
filled with the publication this year of "Fire &amp; Spice" (McGraw-Hill, 
$19.95) by Heather Jansz Balasuriya and Karin Winegar. 
</P>
<P>
Balasuriya is owner-chef of the Sri Lanka Curry House in Minneapolis, which 
opened 12 years ago and was at that time the only Sri Lankan restaurant in the 
United States. Other restaurants have since opened in California 
</P>
<P>
Born in Colombo, Balasuriya has lived in the United States for 15 years and 
knows well how to reproduce her cuisine with ingredients that are available 
here. Most of the book is dedicated to a rich parade of Sri Lankan curries, 
breads, chutneys and desserts. But Balasuriya has also included a chapter of 
American dishes such as hamburger, pizza, Sloppy Joes and spaghetti spiced up 
with Sri Lankan seasonings. A glossary explains unfamiliar ingredients, and a 
source list names Los Angeles area Indian markets that can supply some of them. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipe is Balasuriya's version of distinctive, dark roasted Sri 
Lankan curry powder. Balasuriya condones using ground spices and dried curry 
leaves instead of fresh if it is more convenient. And she advises that grinding 
whole spices with a mortar and pestle will give better flavor than a food 
processor. 
</P>
<P>
HEATHER'S ROASTED CURRY POWDER 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon mustard seeds 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons ground coriander 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons fennel seeds 
</P>
<P>
20 to 25 curry leaves 
</P>
<P>
10 cardamom pods, crushed 
</P>
<P>
6 whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
6 (1-inch) lengths dried pandan leaves 
</P>
<P>
3 (1-inch) pieces cinnamon stick 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon crushed dried red chiles 
</P>
<P>
Heat large skillet over low to medium heat. Add mustard seeds, cover and roast 
until mustard seeds start to pop. Stir in cumin and coriander. When ground 
spices begin to turn light brown, add fennel seeds, curry leaves, cardamom 
pods, cloves, pepper, pandan leaves, cinnamon sticks and chiles. 
</P>
<P>
Stirring continuously to prevent burning, roast spices until dark golden brown, 
7 to 10 minutes or longer, depending upon heat of stove. Immediately grind 
spices very fine, using mortar and pestle, food processor or spice grinder. 
Store in airtight jar. Makes about 3/4 cup.

Food; Part H; Page 34; Column 1 The best wine to give as a gift is one that's 
no longer available, but so little such wine exists at a reasonable price. One 
superb one that is available is 1985 Franciscan Cabernet Sauvignon Library 
Selection, a marvelously structured, deeply flavored wine that I loved a year 
ago when the winery was selling it for $17. 
</P>
<P>
The winery no longer has any, but the Wine Seller in Westlake Village still has 
a good supply at $219 per case, which makes it just $18.25. This superb wine 
may be ordered by telephone: (800) 827-9463. 
</P>
<P>
The Wine Seller also has a number of older wines including 1981 Sterling 
Reserve at $26.40 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Chilling down a bottle of Champagne for the holidays can be done in the 
refrigerator (slow method: the door is constantly opening and closing), in the 
freezer (but it's usually filled and there's no space), or an ice bucket. 
</P>
<P>
A number of expensive crystal buckets are available in upscale department 
stores, but these are a lot more fragile than the aluminum bucket that retails 
for about $25 to $30. Some of them have the logo of a Champagne house, others 
are blank. Get one with handles for easy carrying from sink to table. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Wine Appreciation Guild, which specializes in wine books, 
also carries an attractive aluminum Champagne bucket large enough to 
accommodate a magnum bottle. The Bourgeat Bucket retails for $30. To order, 
call the Guild at (800) 231-9463 in California or (800) 242-9462 outside 
California. Shipping costs average $4. 
</P>
<P>
Once that bottle is cold, keep it cold with a Wine Brick. I have seen some 
terra-cotta versions for $15. The Wine Appreciation Guild has an attractive 
hand-painted model for $30. 
</P>
<P>
A book for wine lovers that offers insight into wine from a different 
perspective is "Through the Grapevine, the Business of Wine in America," by Jay 
Stuller and Glen Martin (Wynwood, $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
The authors look at various aspects of the wine business with a healthy 
skepticism and offer engaging interviews and discussion with some of the 
industry's more important (but less public) figures.

ABOUT WINE: WHEN YOU'RE UNSURE WHAT TO GIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It might seem to be an impossible task to buy a gift for a wine lover, 
especially if you know little about wine and can't figure out what wine to get 
that will be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
The solution, then, is to avoid buying wine at all and instead go after wine 
gifts that are longer lasting and that any wine lover would covet. This 
includes wine glasses (wine people never have enough glassware), decanters, 
corkscrews and especially books. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if you know a bit about wine and would like to give wine as a gift, 
it is appropriate, especially at this festive time of year when wine is the 
favorite liquid gift (merchants say they make about 25% of their annual wine 
sales during the period from Thanksgiving through Dec. 31). 
</P>
<P>
When selecting a wine to present as a gift, keep these suggestions in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Try to find something you know well (not just something you've read about), 
something you've tasted and can vouch for. Or something that is highly 
recommended by a merchant for either value or panache. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aim for a wine that is not run-of-the-mill stuff that any wine shop will 
carry. Such California wine brands as Dunn, Forman, Woltner, Diamond Creek, 
Duckhorn, or Spottswoode are prized by collectors and even if a collector has a 
case of one of these, an extra bottle is always welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Magnums of red wine, which are not common, are an especially nice gift for 
the wine collector with a cellar, and some specialty wine shops carry a line of 
magnums. Call a local wine shop to see which magnums are available. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Older wines that are no longer commercially available are good ideas, and a 
number of wine shops keep a small selection of older wines. Often, prices 
aren't as high as you might think. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wine lovers usually are lovers of great distilled spirits too, and 
occasionally a bottle of a special Cognac, single-malt Scotch, grappa or 
Armagnac can be a fast solution. These products are not vintage-dated so you 
need no special knowledge to buy them. Wally's in Westwood and the Flask in 
Studio City have large selections of grappa and single-malt Scotch (Wally's 
boasts more than 50 different grappas). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vintage Port and Sauternes are great dessert wines that wine lovers 
treasure, though they rarely buy enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
The non-wine gifts for the wine lover may be bought in any wine shop, and many 
department stores carry a range of vinous gifts. But there are pitfalls, so I 
suggest the following as possible gifts that wine lovers would appreciate. The 
recommendations here are listed from $5 to $150 in ascending order. 
</P>
<P>
$5 to Keeping an opened bottle of wine fresh is difficult. Once the cork is 
pulled, all wine begins to deteriorate through oxidation. To limit the 
oxidation, it's best to recork the wine immediately and refrigerate it (thus 
slowing down the chemical reaction). 
</P>
<P>
I do not recommend that wine be frozen to keep it fresh, as I have read in some 
books and magazines. The act of freezing a wine will actually accelerate the 
oxygenation of the wine and cause it to lose too much of its bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
If you can take the remainder of a bottle and place it in a smaller bottle that 
has no air between the wine and the cork or cap, that works best. Failing that, 
use an inert gas to fill the original wine bottle. 
</P>
<P>
A number of companies put out cans of inert gas, and I have tried many of them. 
All work to some degree, but the best one I've tested is Private Preserve, 
which is essentially a nitrogen sparge for the bottle. A couple of squirts from 
the can and you can safely recork the bottle for weeks. (I tested a half bottle 
of Cabernet and left it six months and the wine was still fine when I finally 
reopened it.) 
</P>
<P>
Getting the top of the foil off a bottle of wine can be messy, especially if 
the wine is an older bottle and the foil is welded to the glass by residue from 
the cork. 
</P>
<P>
The best gadget invented to help you get that top part of the foil removed is 
called the Hallen Foilcutter, which simply clips the top of the foil in two 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a bottle of Champagne open is a fearful experience for some because the 
cork can easily fly away and damage people or things. Getting a grip on it, 
however, is a lot easier when you have something like the one-piece Hallen 
Champagne Star, a device that provides grip on the cork so it can be twisted in 
the bottle and then eased out. 
</P>
<P>
Another device that also works is called the Champagne Key, made of metal and 
hinged to open and then clamp onto the cork. It typically runs a couple of 
dollars more than the Star and works just as well, but is especially 
recommended for Champagne bottles with stubborn corks that don't twist. (One 
model of the Champagne key runs $40. It works better than the lower-priced 
version, but the cheaper one works fine at a fraction of the price.) 
</P>
<P>
Spring-loaded Champagne stoppers are great stocking stuffers. These keep the 
bobbles in bottles of Champagne that aren't finished. 
</P>
<P>
The best value in books for the wine lover is Hugh Johnson's Pocket 
Encyclopedia of Wine 1990 (Simon &amp; Schuster, $9.95). It's updated with 
recommendations on the latest available vintages of wine from around the world 
and chock full of Johnson's insights into wine and serving it. 
</P>
<P>
$10 to Every wine lover owns a corkscrew or two -- or 10. The best models use a 
helix for the screw, not a machined piece of metal that can tear the center out 
of the cork. (You can put a straw up the center of the wire helix.) 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, Herbert Allen invented the best corkscrew I've ever used, called 
the Screwpull. It features a Teflon-coated helix and a needle-sharp point. 
</P>
<P>
The company Allen founded, the Texas-based Hallen Co., with annual sales of $7 
million in wine gadgetry, has come out with various sophistications of the 
original model throughout the years, and Hallen's Pocket Model is my favorite. 
Though it's called the Pocket Model, I never take it anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The reason I prefer it is that it has a finger hole for twirling the cork out 
of the bottle. It's simple to use and usually no more than $16, making it just 
pennies more than the traditional waiters' corkscrew. 
</P>
<P>
For the dedicated wine lover, knowing the temperature and humidity in the wine 
cellar is important, and one of the better values in a combination 
thermometer-hygrometer is a small, stick-on unit available from Brookstone for 
$12.50 plus tax and shipping. To order, call Brookstone at (603) 924-9511. 
</P>
<P>
Wine lovers always need more decanters, and the simple, inexpensive decanter I 
use is an attractive gift. It is the European-style Carafe, a 28-ounce 
wide-bottomed decanter that is sold with a wood bung (to keep air out) for 
$13.25 by Marjorie Lum Wine Glasses. For a catalogue of Lum's wine glasses and 
other wine gifts, drop a note to 112 Pine St., San Anselmo, Calif. 94960, or 
call (415) 454-0660; fax (415) 456-9197. Shipping costs average $4. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a bottle of wine that few people can get is a surprise gift a wine 
lover would like, and such a wine is the 1988 Chaparral Chardonnay made by 
Chalone from Sangiacomo grapes and sold by Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park and 
Wally's in Westwood and Toluca Lake. The wine, $12, is not available at any 
other Southern California location. 
</P>
<P>
Wally's also has the only supply in town of the highly regarded Elijah Craig 
Bourbon, $15.75. 
</P>
<P>
$18 to Budding collectors building wine cellars might appreciate the Cellar 
Cube, an 18- x 18-inch unfinished pine cube that holds two cases of wine. The 
Guild sells it for $35. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Lum also carries a larger, more classic hand blown decanter with a 
top. The bulbous-bottomed decanter slopes up to a nice slim top standing 15 
inches tall. Included is a glass stopper. The 40-ounce decanter is $35. 
(Address and telephone are above.) 
</P>
<P>
The Duke of Bourbon and Wally's are also the only two stores to carry 
single-cask special lots of the Germain-Robin Special Lot Brandy, made in Ukiah 
using traditional Cognac production and blending methods. The stores carry the 
product for $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
Also $39.95 is what Steve Wallace of Wally's called "the best Cognac I have 
under $100," Domaine Frapin Vieille Grand Fine Champagne Cognac, a single 
vineyard Cognac. 
</P>
<P>
A new book on wine with a fascinating look at where wine has been is "A History 
of Wine in America: From the Beginnings to Prohibition," by Thomas Pinney, 
chairman of the department of English at Pomona College (University of 
California Press, $45). 
</P>
<P>
The scholarly work corrects some misconceptions that have been passed down by 
public relations people and gives an insight into today's neo-Prohibitionist 
movement by looking at those of the past. 
</P>
<P>
$47 to Glassware may be hard to buy (what style, type, color, etc. is 
appropriate), but one glass every wine lover should have is the official 
tasting glass known as the INAO Glass (for Institute de National d'Appellations 
d'Origine), a classic 6 1/2-ounce glass with a small tulip-top and a fine rim. 
The Guild offers a 24% lead crystal INAO glass in sets of a dozen for $48. This 
is the perfect glass for wine lovers who are occasionally invited to tastings 
where they have to bring their own glasses. 
</P>
<P>
In a larger wine glass, more suited for the dinner table, the following two are 
offered by Lum: The 13 1/2-ounce, 7 1/2-inch tall Chimney, a perfect 
all-purpose white or red wine glass; the Merlion Glass, similar to the popular 
Les Impitoyables, but smaller, holding 11 ounces; it stands 6 1/2 inches tall. 
A set of six of either glass is $48.25. 
</P>
<P>
Those who like to carry their wine to parties, restaurants or on picnics would 
love the Traveler, a zippered kit that holds two bottles of wine, four wine 
glasses and corkscrew (included). The Guild offers it for $50. 
</P>
<P>
$75 to One of the greatest experiences I have ever had in grappa is a pear 
grappa imported from Italy by Pearson and Hawkins of Santa Barbara. It is 
called Grappa di Pera, produced by Jacopo Poli and it is marketed in an 
extremely lovely, slender 500-milliliter bottle. At $80 to $85, this isn't 
inexpensive, but it is one of the most exquisite dessert drinks I have ever 
tasted. 
</P>
<P>
To open bottles with panache, try Hallen's Leverpull ($90), which is about the 
fastest and easiest and most foolproof method of opening wine. (And if you have 
a dozen bottles to open, it's a must.) It is packaged with the Foilcutter. 
</P>
<P>
The best Champagne? Some would argue Krug, others say Dom Perignon. And many 
connoisseurs vote for Salon. The 1982 Salon ($100) is a sublime, richly 
flavored wine that shows how a fine Champagne can be both rich and delicate at 
the same time. Salon, made only in great vintages from a single vineyard, 
offers rich Chardonnay flavors and a depth rarely found in fine Champagne. And 
it ages in the bottle beautifully, so if the '79 Salon is available, try it as 
well in a side-by-side taste. 
</P>
<P>
$100 to Keeping an opened bottle of wine fresh is difficult. Once the cork is 
pulled, all wine begins to deteriorate through oxidation. 
</P>
</TEXT>
<GRAPHIC>
<P>
 The classic temperature and humidity gauge, manufactured in West Germany, is a 
hygrometer-thermometer offered by the guild for $125. It is attractive enough 
to be a design feature of a wine cellar where guests will be invited. 
</P>
<P>
The Guild also offers diamond-bin wood storage wine racks. These wooden racks 
by Plant Manufacturing in San Francisco hold nine cases each, stand 39 by 39, 
and may be stacked. They are $130 each. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Clos du Bois Barrel Fermented Chardonnay ($11) -- The 
1988 harvest in California yielded Chardonnays with more flavor than did 1987, 
and this wine is a stunning example of delicacy with ample richness. The lemony 
fruit has a hint of orange blossom in it, and the oak is carefully handled to 
not dominate the wine. This wine will be seen in some locations for less than 
$10. Good value.Photo, Screwpull's Lever Model &amp; Foilcutter by Hallen makes 
opening wine bottles neat and effortless.

BACK TO BASICS: SHAPING YEAST DOUGH IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP FOR THAT PERFECT LOAF 
OF BREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Previous columns have explained how to prepare, knead and proof basic yeast 
dough. The next step is to shape the dough into loaves. 
</P>
<P>
After punching down, place the dough on a lightly floured work surface, cover 
with a towel and allow it to rest about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, grease the 
baking pan. 
</P>
<P>
All-purpose loaf pans may be used for bread baking, however the material from 
which they're made affects the bread's crust. For a good brown color, select 
anodized aluminum or darkened metal that absorb heat. 
</P>
<P>
Roll the dough into a 9x7-inch rectangle (Step 1). Beginning at the narrow end, 
fold the bottom third up over the center third of the oblong (Step 2). Turn the 
dough and fold the remaining one-third over (Step 3), pinching the dough 
together along the seam and at the ends. 
</P>
<P>
Using stiffened hands, compress the ends of the dough and fold them over (Step 
4). Turn the dough and place, seam side down, in the prepared pan. Cover and 
let rise in a warm (75 degrees to 85 degrees), draft-free place, until once 
again doubled. 
</P>
<P>
A final column on bread baking will be devoted to alternate methods of shaping 
the dough and baking.

THE VEGETARIAN: NUTS ENLIVEN UNUSUAL CRANBERRY SAUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA SHAW, Shaw is free-lance writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again I've stocked up on cranberries, compelled less by cravings than by 
the spirit of the season, which seems to make them compulsory. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, cranberries aren't quite as versatile as other seasonal foods 
such as pumpkin and sweet potatoes. For one thing, the tart pellets demand 
large infusions of sugar. For another, if not simmered with care, they'll turn 
bitter despite the sweetening. 
</P>
<P>
I've yet to sample a cranberry sauce that's made me lament the berry's short 
season, but this fruit and nut relish, adapted from Carole Schneider's "Fresh: 
A Greenmarket Cookbook" (Panache Press/Random House), comes close. 
</P>
<P>
FRUIT AND NUT RELISH 
</P>
<P>
1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar or 3/4 cup honey 
</P>
<P>
1 (12-ounce) package cranberries 
</P>
<P>
1 cup frozen unsweetened raspberries or 1/2 pint fresh raspberries 
</P>
<P>
3 large navel oranges, peeled and sliced into bite-size segments 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup firm plain yogurt or sour cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup whole shelled walnuts or pecans 
</P>
<P>
Heat water and sugar in medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves and 
mixture is smooth and well blended. Rinse cranberries in colander, discarding 
any that are bruised or blemished. 
</P>
<P>
Add cranberries to sweetened water and bring to boil. Cook, uncovered, just 
until berries pop and juice thickens, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Add orange segments and raspberries to cranberry mixture and mix well. Let 
cool. Stir in yogurt, chill at least 3 hours before serving. Add walnuts just 
before serving. Makes about 4 cups.

YULETIME COOKIES EVOKE MEMORIES OF HOLIDAYS PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does just the mention of baking Christmas cookies evoke fond memories -- going 
all the way back to early childhood? It's almost possible to smell the 
wonderful aromas, hear the laughter and taste the freshly baked pastries. 
</P>
<P>
Typically this was a project involving the whole family. Small children began 
by helping with the decorating, then progressed to forming the cookies and 
finally preparing the dough. Such traditions remain as young adults leave to 
establish homes and families. 
</P>
<P>
So do some of the favorite recipes. But also add new ones coming from friends, 
cookbooks, newspapers or magazines. It's part of the fun to add a new variety 
or two of cookies each year. 
</P>
<P>
The rich dough of Walnut Dessert Cookies bakes to a crispy shortbread. Enjoy 
the cookies plain or in a sandwich with a filling of ground walnuts and 
raspberry or apricot jam. Cocoa Glaze adds a delicious finishing touch. 
</P>
<P>
Lime Wreath Cookies, with festive color and the tang of fresh lime juice, are 
equally ideal for home entertaining or gift giving. The dough is rolled, then 
formed into the Yuletide shape. Lime Sugar and red cinnamon candies garnish the 
wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
"Better Home and Gardens Cookies for Christmas" (Meredith Corp., 1985: $6.95) 
is the source for Candy Window Sugar Cookies. This cookbook has a myriad of 
other recipes, as well as suggestions for gift giving, mailing and baking tips. 
</P>
<P>
Two additional recipes to enhance this year's collection of holiday cookies 
include Almond-Fruit Slices and Crandy Canes. Almonds, candied fruits, raisins 
and spices add up to a rich but not-too-sweet version of the ever-popular 
icebox cookies. Cranberries, raisins, nuts and honey become the filling for the 
cane-shaped confections. 
</P>
<P>
WALNUT DESSERT COOKIES 
</P>
<P>
Walnuts 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup butter or margarine

1 cup sifted flour 
</P>
<P>
Walnut Filling 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa Glaze 
</P>
<P>
Finely grind 1 cup walnuts in food processor or blender and set aside. Cream 
butter with sugar and vanilla. Gradually blend in flour, then walnuts. Chill 
dough for easier rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Roll out onto floured board to about 1/4-inch thickness and cut with 2 1/2-inch 
cutter. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees about 15 minutes, 
until edges brown very lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Using broad spatula, remove to wire rack to cool. When cold, place cookies 
together in pairs, using about 2 teaspoons Walnut Filling for each. Spread 
cooled glaze over half of top cookie. Garnish with large piece of walnut. Makes 
1 dozen filled cookies. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: Serve cookies plain or dip halfway in Cocoa Glaze.

CANDY WINDOW SUGAR COOKIES 
</P>
<P>
Rolled Sugar Cookies 
</P>
<P>
3 ounces clear hard candy of various colors 
</P>
<P>
Prepare dough for Rolled Sugar Cookies. Roll out and cut into desired shapes. 
Place on foil-lined baking sheet. Cut out one or more small shapes in middle of 
each cookie using tiny hors d'oeuvre cutters, thimble or sharp knife. 
</P>
<P>
Finely crush candy into pieces by placing in plastic bag and pounding with 
rolling pin, flat edge of meat mallet or hammer. Spoon enough candy into each 
cutout to fill to level of dough. If using more than one color per hole, mix 
colors as little as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Bake as directed for Rolled Sugar Cookies. Peel off foil and cool. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To make cookies into tree ornaments, use drinking straw to make hole in 
cookie before baking. If holes close during baking, repeat process while 
cookies are still soft. After cooling, run ribbon, yarn or thread through holes 
to form hanger. 
</P>

to melt). Add to flour mixture, along with eggs. Blend at low speed with 
electric mixer until moist, then beat 3 minutes at medium speed. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in remaining flour by hand to make stiff dough. Turn out on floured board 
and knead until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl. Cover. Let rise in 
warm place until doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Turn out on board and knead again. Divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece 
into 18x15-inch rectangle and spread each piece with half filling. Starting at 
15 inch side, fold dough over filling 1/3 way up. Fold dough down 1/3 over 
first fold, to yield 2 strips 15x6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Cut each strip into 15 (1-inch) strips. Twist each strip and pinch ends to 
seal. Place on ungreased baking sheet and bend top of each strip into cane 
shape. Bake at 400 degrees 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire 
racks. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Makes 30 canes.

MICROWAVE: LOWER-CALORIE SAUSAGES IN LESS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Breakfast sausage may not be something you'd consider microwaving, but, in 
fact, it's a natural. And it emerges from the microwave with fewer calories 
than sausages browned in a skillet on top of the stove because most of the 
fatty drippings cook out. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few points to bear in mind if your microwaved sausages are to be 
properly brown and juicy: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always make sure that fresh (raw) pork sausages are fully cooked before you 
serve them. This means that no pink is visible in the center of the sausages. 
If they aren't done after the minimum recommended cooking time, microwave in 
one-minute increments thereafter, testing often. The best way to determine 
doneness is simply to cut a sausage in half. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ignore whistling/popping noises as the sausages microwave. This is just the 
air inside them expanding and escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To give sausages a rich brown color, brush with browning glaze. Or transfer 
cooked sausages to a preheated broiler and brown quickly. Or use a browning 
skillet according to manufacturer's directions. Just be careful not to 
overbrown the sausages because they'll toughen and dry. 
</P>
<P>
BROWNING GLAZE FOR SAUSAGES 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup liquid gravy browner 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup water 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
Combine liquid gravy browner, water and sugar in 1/2-pint preserving jar. Cover 
tightly and refrigerate. Shake well before using. Makes 1 cup. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH SAUSAGE LINKS: Choose small links (12 to 14 per pound) and separate. 
Pierce each link three to four times, brush with browning glaze and arrange, 
not touching, on rack in bake/roast pan (both microwave-safe). 
</P>
<P>
Cover with wax paper and microwave until no pink shows in center, using times 
below as guide, and turning sausages every two minutes or at half time if 
cooking time is less than four minutes. Remove wax paper last two minutes and 
drain off drippings.

OLD-FASHIONED FUDGE IS A PURE AND SIMPLE TREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARILYN MYERLY, Myerly is the author of Wild About Fudge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for something homemade, handmade and very special to give as a gift 
this Christmas to friends or family? 
</P>
<P>
Save the marshmallow creme to top off your cocoa, save the cream cheese for 
cheesecake and try your hand at making real honest-to-goodness fudge. It's made 
with only pure ingredients, which means it's as good as fudge can be. And if 
you've never had real, pure fudge properly cooked, you'll be surprised at how 
good that can be. 
</P>
<P>
Even better, with this new cooking method, the fudge will be smooth as satin, 
yet hold its shape in deep, soft, swirling folds. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoy really fine candy now and then but several years ago I wondered why it 
was that fudges made with only pure ingredients (sugar, milk, butter, etc.) 
often failed. It seemed that they either turned out too hard or too sugary or 
impossibly syrupy -- even though I diligently watched the candy thermometer and 
carefully wiped away the sugar crystals from the side of the cooking pan. 
</P>
<P>
I knew that people added things like marshmallow creme, cream cheese and even 
mashed potatoes to fudge to give the candy attractive form. But never did I 
find that these ingredients enhanced the fudge. 
</P>
<P>
So I started experimenting and my curiosity caught hold. Eventually it grew 
into what became a major project, with notes an inch thick and fudge from here 
to Tuesday. It was fun, fascinating and surprising, and now I know how to make 
dreamy smooth delicious fudge in 75 flavors -- chocolate and way beyond 
chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Let's start with candy thermometers. They are essential when making real fudge 
because fudge must cook to a specific temperature and only a candy thermometer 
can accurately register that temperature. However, many candy thermometers are 
inaccurate. To confuse everyone further, finishing temperatures vary depending 
on the altitude where fudge is cooked. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a wonderfully simple solution to all this: Read the thermometer as 
it stands in boiling water, then cook the fudge until the thermometer registers 
26 degrees above that temperature. By doing this, anyone anywhere using any 
candy thermometer can be assured of always cooking to the correct finishing 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is timing. Syrups, such as corn syrup, molasses and honey are 
usually essential in fudge because they give it a silky smoothness. But I 
found, after many failures, that prolonged cooking makes fudge too syrupy, and 
syrupy fudge eventually turns hard and sugary. For perfectly textured fudge, 
time the cooking so that it reaches its finishing temperature just 15 minutes 
after the fudge comes to a boil. Because of this, an electric range is ideal 
for cooking fudge, because once you find the correct setting, it should not be 
necessary to adjust the heat. 
</P>
<P>
So here is the solution: follow these simple steps to find your finishing 
temperature and both timing and temperature will come out perfect every time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Place thermometer in a small pan with three inches of water and the bulb 
one-half inch above the bottom of the pan. Let the water boil briskly for four 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Without removing the thermometer from the boiling water, and having your 
eyes at the same level as the top of the mercury column, read the thermometer 
carefully. Jot down the reading. This is your first temperature level and it is 
the basis for figuring the finish temperature of the fudge. Success depends on 
the accuracy of this reading. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Add 10 degrees to that number. This is the second temperature level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Add six degrees more. This is the third temperature level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Add 10 degrees more. This is the final, or finishing, temperature level. 
</P>
<P>
These temperature levels will help you time the cooking of the fudge. The goal 
is for the fudge to cook for 15 minutes between the first and finish 
temperature levels. You have a few minutes' leeway either way. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some additional things to keep in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fudge takes about 30 minutes to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- High-quality extracts are essential. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only use unsalted nuts for stirring into fudge. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If fudge seems too thick or hard, break off pieces, knead like clay, then 
form into any attractive shape. Salted nuts pressed onto the top of kneaded 
fudge are especially delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep fudge tightly wrapped to preserve flavor and texture. 
</P>
<P>
To make fudge, you need the following equipment: 
</P>
<P>
Cooking pan: Heavy four-quart pan, measuring seven to eight inches across the 
bottom. This allows the thermometer to be properly submerged. 
</P>
<P>
Stirring pan: Cake-pan type, about nine by 13 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Stirring spoons: Wooden are best. Paddle-shape ideal. 
</P>
<P>
Metal spatula: Pancake turner type. 
</P>
<P>
Candy thermometer: The larger the better for easy reading. 
</P>
<P>
ULTIMATE PURE CHOCOLATE FUDGE 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup cocoa (regular type such as Hershey's) or 2 1/2 ounces unsweetened 
baking chocolate 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon instant coffee granules, optional 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter, cut into several pieces 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup nuts and/or dried fruit, optional 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar, milk, cocoa or chocolate, corn syrup, salt, 3 tablespoons butter 
and coffee granules in cooking pan. Place thermometer in pan with bulb 1/2 inch 
off bottom and leave in place until fudge is done. Turn heat to medium high, 
looking at flame on gas oven at eye level. Turn flame to highest point, then 
back to medium and then carefully adjust to medium high. On large electric 
burner, medium heat may be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Place pan over heat and cook, stirring mixture well. When first temperature 
level is reached, set timer for 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, stirring mixture frequently, or constantly if pan is thin, scraping sides 
and bottom as you stir. After 5 minutes, thermometer should reach second 
temperature level. If it reads higher, slightly lower heat. If it reads lower, 
slightly raise heat. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately set timer for 5 minutes again. After 5 minutes, thermometer should 
reach third temperature level. If it reads higher or lower, adjust heat as 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Stir constantly and watch thermometer closely. In about 5 minutes, when 
thermometer reaches exact finishing temperature, immediately remove from heat 
and remove thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
Pour mixture into stirring pan but do not scrape cooking pan. Let fudge cool at 
room temperature 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Add 2 tablespoons butter, vanilla and nuts or fruit. Begin stirring with clean 
sturdy spoon in easy, steady manner, scraping sides and all parts of pan. Do 
not beat or use electric mixer. Fudge thickens and holds its shape in 4 to 10 
minutes. To know if fudge has thickened enough, stop stirring and count off 5 
seconds. If fudge is still spreading out, resume stirring and repeat until 
fudge holds its shape. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly scoop fudge onto plastic wrap, using spatula. Cool and wrap tightly. 
Fudge tastes best after it has aged 12 hours. Makes 1 pound.

SHERIFF BEGINS CUDAHY PATROL; BELL REGROUPS ITS POLICE DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CUDAHY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid a political feud with the Bell City Council and a faltering recall effort, 
the Cudahy City Council this week turned over the responsibility for law 
enforcement services in the city to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies Wednesday began patrolling Cudahy streets that for 15 years 
have been considered the back-yard territory of the Bell Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the switch, Cudahy Councilman John Robertson has called for the 
formation of a public safety commission to oversee community crime abatement 
programs and act as a liaison between the residents and the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson denied accusations that the commission is merely an attempt to 
placate angry Cudahy residents who launched a recall effort in September in 
response to the decision to change to the Sheriff's Department in mid-contract. 
The contract for police services with the city of Bell was not scheduled to 
expire until July, 1990, but under a 90-day notice clause, either party can be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just tossing a bone to the community," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
The recall effort, started in mid-September by residents who were angry that 
they were not allowed to vote on the contract switch, is the fifth such move 
against Robertson over the years, he said. City officials rejected the first 
set of papers filed by the Committee for Good Government because they were 
improperly served. Georgia Scrivner, a member of the committee, said another 
set of recall petitions has been submitted to the city clerk. The petitions 
must be certified before the group can begin collecting signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The new $1.6-million contract with the Sheriff's Department calls for 17 
deputies to be assigned to Cudahy full time, said Capt. Lynne Poos. With 
staggered shifts, Poos said, there will be three patrol cars on the streets all 
but four hours. For four hours, he said, there will be two cars on patrol. The 
additional manpower, plus anti-drug and anti-gang programs, and liability 
insurance carried by the county, persuaded a majority of the council that a 
switch to the Sheriff's Department would be best for the community, Robertson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer in mid-contract has left some Bell city officials dumbfounded and 
angry. "We had been working closer together," Bell Councilman George Cole said. 
"That's why this was such a shock. There was not one complaint, not a letter, 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson maintained that the decision to switch was "not a question of 
friendship. It was a matter of service." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Sheriff's Department and the Bell Police Department say Bell 
and Cudahy have been bickering over which city should have control over the 
Police Department for much of the 15 years they had been working together. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened now is that Bell and Cudahy got a divorce and Bell got custody 
of the Police Department," one officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Left without the added responsibility of serving Cudahy, the Bell City Council 
this week unveiled a plan for more extensive police protection in its city. 
</P>
<P>
Among the changes will be more park patrols, a business watch program, 
increased anti-gang and anti-drug programs in the elementary schools and high 
schools, and special enforcement activities, such as drug stings and 
anti-prostitution programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Cudahy put some limitations on our service," Mayor Ray Johnson said. "The 
bottom line is that police protection in (Bell) will be greater than it has 
been up to now." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the department had 47 officers handling both cities and had 
budgeted for seven more. But without Cudahy and its $1.3-million annual 
contract, the department would have been left with too many officers and not 
enough money, Johnson said. By the end of next June, he said, the force will be 
reduced to 40 officers through attrition and transfers. 
</P>
<P>
Although there will be fewer officers, Johnson said, Bell residents will be 
getting more protection and programs because police services will no longer be 
spread so thin. The number of officers per one thousand residents will jump 
from .9 to 1.4, he said.

MYSTERY CAUSE OF CARBON MONOXIDE IN 4 CITIES SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air quality experts and an auto maker initiated a joint study this week to find 
out why abnormally high carbon monoxide levels plague an area of Southeast Los 
Angeles County that includes the cities of Lynwood, South Gate, Bell and 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
"In that area last year," said Bill Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District, "we had 51 days that exceeded the federal 
standards, so there is something going on down there." 
</P>
<P>
The study is being done by General Motors Corp., the state Air Resources Board 
and the South Coast Air Quality Management District in the area bounded by 
Slauson Avenue and by three freeways -- the Harbor, Long Beach and Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next three months, scientists will study everything from wind 
direction to traffic flow in an effort to determine why carbon monoxide levels 
there are often double those in nearby monitoring areas, even though auto 
exhaust emissions -- the major cause of carbon monoxide -- have sharply dropped 
throughout the state since 1968. That was the year California dictated 
pollution controls for auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon monoxide is dangerous to people with heart and respiratory problems 
because it inhibits the blood's ability to carry oxygen. It hits its highest 
levels in the cool winter months, forming around areas with high traffic volume 
or congestion. Summertime smog, on the other hand, features high ozone levels 
that cover wide areas. 
</P>
<P>
There are 37 air quality monitoring areas in the Southland, Kelly said, but the 
area under study has the worst concentrations of carbon monoxide. The federal 
health standard is 9.5 parts per million during an eight-hour period, Kelly 
said. Carbon monoxide levels exceeded that level on 51 days in 1988, he said. 
The highest reading in any one period was 32 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, in an adjacent area that has the region's second highest carbon 
monoxide levels, violations were recorded on only 26 days. That area runs west 
from Hawthorne to Marina del Rey and then south along the coast to San Pedro. 
The highest reading in that area last year was 23 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that in those areas," Kelly said, "there are some peculiar 
circumstances that are causing the high carbon monoxide concentrations." 
</P>
<P>
It is known, he said, that the Lynwood and Hawthorne monitoring areas, as they 
are called, have a "surface-level inversion." When the ground cools off at 
night, he said, the air layer closest to the ground also cools and holds on to 
carbon monoxide that is emitted when cars start moving in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
However, that does not explain why carbon monoxide levels at the Lynwood 
monitoring station are double the levels at stations in other monitoring areas, 
he said. Places with consistently high levels of carbon monoxide are called 
"hot spots" and they have been found in Spokane, Wash.; New York City, and 
Denver. This latest study will augment one done last winter by the University 
of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Eight research teams, including one from Denver, will use weather balloons and 
sophisticated measuring instruments to monitor the area's weather conditions, 
including wind direction and speed. The scientists will also chart traffic 
volume and speed. 
</P>
<P>
Things such as train traffic, fast-food drive-up windows or space heaters could 
be contributing to the carbon monoxide problem, Kelly said. Trains give off 
some carbon monoxide, as do space heaters when they are not properly adjusted, 
he said. Drive-up windows concern air quality experts because idling cars emit 
larger levels of carbon monoxide than moving vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
During the study, about 75 air monitoring devices, a 150% increase over the 
usual number, will be placed throughout the entire Southland air basin. Most of 
the devices will be in the Lynwood and Hawthorne areas, but others will go 
elsewhere to serve as the scientific control group for the study. General 
Motors will hire people to drive two specially equipped cars to measure changes 
in carbon monoxide emissions under different driving conditions, such as rapid 
acceleration and various speed levels. 
</P>
<P>
"(We're) interested, believe it or not, in clean air and have been for years," 
said Bill Ott, a spokesman for General Motors. "We've been working with various 
government agencies, be they state, regional or federal, for many years." 
</P>
<P>
The study will cost $510,000 with the Air Resources Board contributing $350,000 
and the air quality district paying $60,000. About $100,000 will come from 
General Motors. Results of the study are not expected for about a year.

Hill said Tuesday that he may add an amendment to an existing bill that would 
delay Diamond Bar's scheduled April, 1990, municipal election until April, 
1991, allowing Councilmen Gary Miller, Gary Werner and John Forbing an extra 
year in office. 
</P>
<P>
According to a technicality in state law, the new council members couldn't fill 
their two-year terms until 1991 without the special legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But the extension, if passed, could help Miller's chances in the special state 
election next year to fill the seat vacated by the resignation of Sen. William 
Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights). That way, Miller wouldn't have to run 
simultaneously for state senator and city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, one of five elected officials targeted in an ongoing FBI investigation 
into political corruption in the Capital, already has declared his candidacy 
for Campbell's seat. Miller also has announced tentative plans to run. 
</P>
<P>
But Hill said he would retract the amendment if Miller enters the state Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gary Miller has made a firm decision that he's going to run against me, 
I'll retract the legislation," Hill said in an interview Tuesday. "I am not 
interested in giving him any additional advantages." 
</P>
<P>
After learning of the assemblyman's statement, Miller said he was "shocked at 
the arrogance of Mr. Hill, imposing this condition on the city of Diamond Bar. 
That's ridiculous. As a result of this conversation, I'm being swayed in the 
direction (of running for Campbell's seat)." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no legal requirement that he do so, Miller has said he would 
give up a 1990 council reelection campaign if he decides to go for the state 
seat. If an extension were granted, he wouldn't have to give up either pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday night's Diamond Bar City Council meeting, Forbing expressed 
outrage that Hill is making Miller's candidacy a factor in whether he proposes 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's holding us hostage," Forbing said. "This shouldn't have anything to do 
with who's running against the assemblyman." 
</P>
<P>
Hill responded yesterday: "It's just practical politics. I don't think anyone's 
accusing me of being a fool. . . . However (council members) react is fine with 
me. They're asking me to do them a big favor." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have been trying since late summer to postpone the election. 
They discovered in August that newly elected council members Miller, Werner and 
Forbing were not guaranteed two-year terms, as city officials originally had 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
The complication arose because of the timing of Diamond Bar's incorporation as 
a city earlier this year. Because Diamond Bar staged its incorporation election 
in March, state law requires it to hold a municipal election in April, 1990 -- 
even if that means shortening the terms of council members. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's proposal would exempt the city from that provision. 
</P>
<P>
Politics aside, delaying the election may be a long shot. Unless legislation 
passes to allow the extension, the council is required to formally set an 
April, 1990, election date by Jan. 4, City Manager Robert Van Nort said. If 
legislation is passed after that, the council would have to take special action 
to overturn its decision. 
</P>
<P>
City officials originally had turned to the county for help. But the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors rejected Diamond Bar's request to hold the 
municipal election in November, 1990, because too many cities already had 
submitted similar requests, Diamond Bar City Atty. Andrew Arczynski said. So 
city officials, including Forbing and Van Nort, lobbied Hill, who promised to 
look into legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the extension say it would be too expensive to have another 
municipal election so soon. The city already is $52,000 in debt to the county 
for costs incurred during the last election. Proponents also argue that an 
April, 1990, election wouldn't give voters enough time to assess new council 
members' performances. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a chance to prove one way or another whether we're doing a good 
job," Forbing said. "What would the people be basing their vote on?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayor Phyllis Papen and Councilman Paul Horcher are trying to keep 
their distance from what could turn into a heated political issue in Diamond 
Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Papen and Horcher, the top finishers in the city's March election, don't face 
reelection until 1992. Their three colleagues, who finished behind them in the 
balloting, are the only ones directly affected by the extension controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said he's "ambivalent on that issue. I'm not one of the three who have 
to sweat it out next year." 
</P>
<P>
Added Papen: "I'm not involved in this. I wasn't the one who approached Frank 
Hill." Hill, however, said all the council members, including Papen, have 
discussed the proposed extension with him. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the City Council, there are those who criticize the plan to extend the 
terms. One critic is Gary Neely, who unsuccessfully ran for the City Council in 
March, finishing in sixth place, 119 votes behind Forbing. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in sticking with the law. I don't see any reason to change the law 
just to help these particular candidates," Neely said. "Some of us have already 
seen what those council members are like, and some of us would just as soon see 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
Cleve Holifield, who finished in seventh place and plans to run in April, also 
opposes the extension. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have a greater disruption than leaving it alone," he said. "It's 
unfortunate the incorporation election caused this shrinkage of terms, but 
that's the price of incorporation during an off year. 
</P>
<P>
"During the next several years, that will iron itself out. After 1992 and '94, 
everything will be back in its proper position."

CONTROVERSY CASTS SHADOW ON HIGH-RISE; 
</P>
<P>
WESTWOOD: FIGHT BY RESIDENTS AGAINST CONDOMINIUM PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS BIGGER 
BATTLE BY COMMUNITY REVIEW BOARDS AGAINST PLANNING DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Westwood homeowner groups are opposing a proposed Wilshire Boulevard high-rise 
they say will cast too long a shadow on nearby homes, a case that highlights a 
festering concern about the role of community design review boards in the 
planning process. 
</P>
<P>
The design for the 22-story condominium project, slated for the north side of 
Wilshire between Selby and Manning avenues, was recommended twice for rejection 
by the Westwood Design Review Board because it was deemed incompatible with its 
surroundings and aesthetically unpleasing. 
</P>
<P>
The project also would place six single-family homes in shade for longer than 
is acceptable under city regulations. In that particular area, zoning 
regulations prohibit new buildings from casting more than two hours of shadow 
on neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the squabble is over whether the condo project, which is in a high-rise 
corridor, is subject to the shade and shadow review of the design board since 
it was grandfathered in under old zoning regulations in effect before design 
review boards were created. According to the ordinance that created design 
review boards, if a proposed building casts more than two hours of shade on 
surrounding residences, the board can recommend against it. 
</P>
<P>
The condo project substantially has already been approved by the city as to 
height, density and other criteria. 
</P>
<P>
The larger dispute here, however, involves the relationship between the citizen 
advisory board and the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation for citizen design review boards, written by City Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky, was enacted in 1988. The ordinance gave the groups advisory 
approval over building design, landscaping and whether a proposed structure 
fits into a community. The boards, an outgrowth of grass-roots concern about 
controlling new development, have been sought by homeowner groups and others 
who want a say in how their neighborhoods look. The City Council member for 
each community appoints that area's advisory panel. The panel's recommendations 
go to the planning director. 
</P>
<P>
Exercising his prerogative, city Planning Director Kenneth Topping ignored the 
advice of the Westwood Design Review Board and approved the condominium project 
proposed by developer Paul Amir. Two homeowner groups, Friends of Westwood and 
Westwood-Holmby Property Owners Assn., Monday appealed Topping's decision to 
the Los Angeles Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
If the matter is ultimately appealed to the City Council, as expected, it is 
likely to be a tug of war between developers and Planning Department officials 
on one side and increasingly powerful homeowner organizations on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The sentiment of council members, many of whose constituents want design review 
boards of their own, may foretell how far they are willing to go toward 
appeasing the slow-growth movement. Yaroslavsky noted that some of the same 
council members voted to exempt several Wilshire Boulevard high-rises from new, 
more stringent zoning laws over his objections. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he will back the Design Review Board's opposition to the 
building's design as too commercial, thus incompatible with other buildings in 
the Wilshire Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission is now conducting its own study of design review 
boards, that are proliferating to the dismay of some officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are some people on the Planning Commission who want to limit the 
scope of design review boards," Yaroslavsky said. "There is some concern they 
have become mini-Planning Commissions, and they're not." 
</P>
<P>
According to Robert Sutton, the head of neighborhood planning for the Planning 
Department, "The existing procedure is not working. People are using it as a 
camouflage to slow down development. Design review boards have used their power 
in a blackmail role. They hold the case hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Westwood Design Review Board, appointed in mid-1988, aren't 
thrilled with the way the process is working either. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Richard Agay voiced his displeasure over what he believes is 
Planning Department tampering with Design Review Board recommendations. Agay 
claimed that Topping, or one of his senior deputies acting in his stead, 
overrules the board only on large projects where the developers have political 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
"We really are at this point the Westwood mini-project design review board," 
Agay said. 
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc committee of the Planning Commission was ostensibly formed to study 
the design review board process and adopt uniform guidelines to avoid abuses, 
but Agay claims there is a hidden agenda. "The real purpose is to emasculate 
design review boards," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood Design Review Board member Carole Magnuson shares Agay's displeasure 
with the planning director's decision on the Amir project. "If the board is 
repeatedly overturned on major projects, I won't continue to function on it." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, said, "if design review is 
turning out to be a joke, they might as well gut it." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he doesn't look at the issue the same way. "A design review 
board does not fail because five people don't get what they want 100 percent of 
the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Magnuson said the 5-2 negative recommendation on the Amir Development Corp. 
condominiums was clear-cut, with the planning director simply contradicting the 
board's judgment on whether the project will enhance the area. She -- and 
others -- describe the building as sleek, ultra modern and commercial looking, 
not residential. Magnuson said she can envision it in Miami or San Francisco, 
but not Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The building will have shades of red, blue and green on the outside. "It's a 
22-story stucco building," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Hummer, an attorney for Amir, disagreed. "I think the building's 
beautiful." She noted that the two architects on the design review board voted 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Hummer and Sutton both said the project is exempt from the shade and shadow 
restrictions because it was already under development when the rules changed, 
so it was grandfathered in. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner activist Lake claims the zoning exemption for the project doesn't 
remove it from design review. "They make up stories that are interesting but 
not legal." 
</P>
<P>
Not every area of Los Angeles has a design review board, but many of them are 
being sought as sections of the city adopt interim control ordinances to manage 
development. 
</P>
<P>
On the Westside, Pacific Palisades and the San Vicente Boulevard corridor in 
Brentwood have boards. A design review board for Granada Hills has been 
approved by the Planning Commission, while a North Hollywood area called Valley 
Village was denied a review board by the Planning Commission because its 
architecture isn't distinctive enough to warrant one, Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Planning Department objects to delays caused by "milking this thing 
to death," which, he said, winds up costing the developer money that he passes 
along in increased prices to renters and buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"We can get to the same point in a more reasonable time period," Sutton said. 
"Once you have your say, isn't that it?" 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly, according to homeowner groups and some design review board 
members. They object because the developer gets the last word in private 
meetings with planning officials to which they are not privy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as deeply disturbed by the process as by the results," Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
The private meeting is one basis of the homeowners' appeal of the condo 
project. Sutton and an attorney for the developer defend the meetings as 
proper, particularly because, they say, their content is later revealed to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Agay, however, said the post design review meetings between developers and the 
Planning Department are a "major defect in the ordinance." While the views of 
opponents are filtered down to the director by his staff, the developer is 
present, with an attorney, to give his side face to face. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton said homeowners have no right to be notified or to attend the meetings, 
which he characterized as working sessions not subject to the state's open 
meeting law, the Brown Act, because they don't involve a public board or 
commission.

TEACHERS SEEK STATE MEDIATION IN STALEMATE OVER RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disgruntled La Canada teachers picketed twice Tuesday after asking the state to 
intervene in stalled salary negotiations with the La Canada Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Two protests -- including one at the district's Board of Education meeting -- 
followed a request Monday asking the state Public Employee Relations Board to 
mediate the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers late last week declared an impasse in negotiations, and no further 
meetings with the district are scheduled before the state board decides whether 
to intervene. A strike is not expected, district and teacher representatives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers began negotiations in May demanding an 18% wage increase, but later 
decreased their request to 10%. District administrators, some of whom concede 
their proposals are low, initially offered a 6% increase with contract and pay 
benefits for certain teachers, but recently offered an alternative of 7% 
without many of those benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Classified employees agreed in November to a 6% increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost-of-living increase offer they're making us is an embarrassment," said 
Martin Lipofsky, a science teacher at La Canada High School and president of 
the La Canada Teachers Assn. "We've done everything we can to make ours 
distinguished schools, and our salaries don't reflect that. It's just not 
right." 
</P>
<P>
District administrators say a 7% increase is the most the district can afford 
to offer its approximately 170 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the lower-end salaries on this schedule are pretty low, and are not 
tremendously competitive at this time," said Voytek Dolinski, district director 
of curriculum. "But I don't see any money out there that is not out there 
already. There's no extra money anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
About $800,000 of this year's $15-million budget has been set aside for salary 
increases. Other funds viewed by teachers as surplus already have been budgeted 
or must be spent elsewhere, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A reserve of $415,000 from developer fees, for instance, under state law may 
only be used for construction or renovation. Another reserve of about $360,000 
has been budgeted for building renovation and is not expected to be available 
next year. And about $465,000 has been earmarked by state law to be used only 
for fiscal emergencies, according to Carol Siegler, president of the Board of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, who are in the second year of a three-year contract with yearly 
negotiations over salary, last year received a pay increase of 11.9%, mainly 
because of higher enrollments, increases in class size and funds from 
Proposition 98, an initiative passed last year that allocates about 40% of the 
state's surplus to California schools. Enrollment has leveled off, and all 
Proposition 98 funds already have been budgeted to pay teachers' salaries, 
Siegler said. 
</P>
<P>
Those explanations have not satisfied angry teachers, who say they are being 
slighted for costly satellite dishes, library-media centers and fax machines. 
La Canada teachers' salaries -- ranging from $20,265 for a beginning teacher to 
$42,970 for 25 years of experience -- are the third lowest in Los Angeles 
County. "We contend that because we are top-quality teachers and are producing 
a top-quality product, we should at least be in the middle of the range, not 
the bottom," said Elizabeth Rose, a La Canada English teacher. District 
students consistently score among the highest on state-administered tests. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking about is not a few more hundred bucks," Rose said. "The 
discrepancy is dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 teachers marched early Tuesday along a sidewalk in front of La Canada 
High School before classes began. Many carried picket signs and displayed them 
to passing traffic, while others distributed flyers and window stickers to 
staff and students arriving at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be top, top, top, but as the years have gone on and things have 
taken their toll, we've slipped" in salaries, said Kathleen Seiler, 60, who 
taught La Canada elementary school students for 30 years before retiring in 
June. "It isn't right that people devote their lives to a career, then, because 
of their salaries, don't have a retirement they can look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers appeared again Tuesday night at the La Canada Board of Education 
meeting, armed with information for board members. Teachers first came before 
the board Nov. 21 to complain about the proposed wage increase, and have held 
community meetings and distributed flyers about their demands, organizers said.

W. HOLLYWOOD GIVEN CONTROL OF HART PARK; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: LOS ANGELES WILL TURN OVER SITE AND ITS $284,000 TRUST FUND. VOTE 
IS TAKEN AMID CLAIMS BY BENEFACTOR'S SON THAT THE MONEY HAS BEEN MISMANAGED. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles city parks officials will turn over the William S. Hart Park and 
its $284,000 trust fund to the city of West Hollywood for the next 30 years, 
despite claims by the silent film star's son that Los Angeles has mismanaged 
the fund. 
</P>
<P>
The vote Monday by parks officials, coupled with approval that night by the 
West Hollywood City Council, officially clears the way for long-awaited 
renovation of the park at the foot of Sunset Strip. West Hollywood has already 
started working on the park. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's son supports the $750,000 renovation but asked that it be delayed until 
Los Angeles officials conduct "an accurate accounting" of the trust fund. The 
67-year-old Santa Monica real estate appraiser estimates the fund should be 
worth more than $800,000 based on interest rates since 1944, when his late 
father donated $50,000 for the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I would just like to see justice done and my father get something that he paid 
for," William S. Hart Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart Jr. is supported by the local chapter of the Sierra Club, which fears 
future gifts to the city's Parks Department could be jeopardized by its 
handling of Hart's money. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows they are reckless and don't really care that much about their 
credibility or the way they manage their money or other people's money," said 
Alexander M. Man of the club's Angeles chapter. 
</P>
<P>
But James E. Hadaway, the department's general manager, said the city has 
already provided an adequate accounting of the fund. In a three-page report 
prepared in 1987, the department attributed the balance to low interest rates 
in the 1940s and 1950s and to decisions over the years to invest only part of 
the fund because of "current and anticipated expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
The department acknowledges the money could have earned more interest if it had 
been invested differently but maintains that it chose investments "providing a 
greater degree of liquidity and security." 
</P>
<P>
Hart Jr. and Man say the city's explanation raises as many questions as it 
answers. As an example, they point to a reference in the report to a period in 
the early 1960s when none of the money was invested because of plans for park 
improvements. The improvements weren't made, and two years later the money was 
turned over to the city treasurer to invest. 
</P>
<P>
"I am beginning to suspect that they spent the money," Hart Jr. said. "I 
believe it was just thrown into the general fund, and it was forgotten about." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners suggested Monday that Hart Jr. 
and Man request a more detailed accounting of the fund. But commissioners said 
there was no reason to delay the 30-year-lease agreement with West Hollywood. 
Under the agreement, Los Angeles will retain ownership of the park, but West 
Hollywood will operate it. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hold this, it accomplishes nothing under the circumstances," said 
Commission President J. Stanley Sanders. "The passage of time is not going to 
correct the accuracy of the past accounting." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Dominick Rubalcava said postponing the agreement would do a 
disservice to the actor's memory by further delaying development of the park he 
dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
Hart donated $50,000 along with his De Longpre Avenue ranch house and about an 
acre of land two years before he died. The star of silent westerns wanted the 
city to erect a fountain there and preserve the estate as a park. During a 
ceremony in 1944, Hart said he was "trying to give back to the American people 
what the American people so generously gave to me." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials never took much interest in the property, which was the 
actor's first California home and where he married actress Winifred Westover in 
1921. The two-story ranch house has been leased to various tenants over the 
years -- most recently Actors Studio West -- but never developed as a 
traditional park. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood, which has only two other parks, has been eager to have the 
estate as a park. For several years, it leased the property from Los Angeles on 
a monthly basis. The two cities stepped up negotiations three years ago for a 
long-term lease after Hart Jr., the Sierra Club and others helped defeat a 
proposal for a parking garage on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Long, West Hollywood's director of human resources, said the city's 
Public Facilities Board has discussed the controversy surrounding Hart's 
donation, but the city has made no effort to check into claims that the fund 
has been shortchanged. Long said the entire $284,000 will go toward the current 
renovation and to cover maintenance expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we are taking the city of Los Angeles' word for it," Long said. 
"But that doesn't preclude us from looking into it in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Hart Jr. said he is particularly upset about the fund because West Hollywood 
could use the additional money to renovate the park. The current development 
will include landscaping, a fountain, walkways, benches and an AIDS memorial, 
but West Hollywood officials say they still don't have $500,000 needed to 
rehabilitate the ranch house. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to get anything out of this," said Hart Jr., who waged an 
unsuccessful court battle in the 1950s and '60s to overturn his father's will. 
"The real beneficiaries are the older people who live in West Hollywood who use 
that park. . . . But it is as though (Los Angeles officials) just don't give a 
damn."

When dozens of residents from West Hollywood's east side turned out this week 
for a hearing to determine whether to shut down a restaurant described as the 
"epicenter of crime" on that end of town, they boisterously lived up to a label 
they had earned during the recent fight over a civic center in the city. 
</P>
<P>
They were rabble rousing. 
</P>
<P>
With hoots, jeers, cheers and a near-fistfight or two, members of the recently 
organized East End Community Action group were flexing new-found muscle 
developed in the civic center fight. 
</P>
<P>
After a volley of three-minute speeches by group members and other residents 
detailing prostitution, drug dealing and panhandling at the Oki Dog restaurant, 
the Business License Commission voted unanimously to revoke the restaurant's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
The Oki Dog is a 24-hour hot dog stand on Santa Monica Boulevard near Gardner 
Street that sheriff's deputies say has been a magnet for trouble for years. A 
Sheriff's Department report found that 6% of the city's arrests in a two-month 
period this fall were made at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
While the commission's decision to revoke the license apparently was heavily 
influenced by the sheriff's report, members of the east-end group took some 
guarded credit for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely another pump in the arm. We knew we had to get something 
good here to keep going," said group member Ed Riney. "People on the east side 
are starting to realize we have the muscle to improve our lot." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group, which claims about 30 active members, had circulated 
about 5,000 leaflets about the Tuesday hearing, imploring east-side residents 
to testify. Many of the speakers said they would not have known about it 
otherwise. The hearing turned into a sort of recruitment session for the 
organization, as several people from the crowd joined on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
East End Community Action is the most visible and active citizen's group to 
emerge from the east side of town, long viewed as the ugly stepsister to the 
sparkling west end of West Hollywood, which bills itself as the "creative 
city." Members say that the discontent along the eastern corridor of Santa 
Monica Boulevard has a long history, but that it took a "slap in the face" to 
bring individuals together into a political force. 
</P>
<P>
The rude awakening for many east-end residents was the proposal to build a 
lavish civic center to house the city government in West Hollywood Park on the 
west end. East-end residents coalesced in the effort to defeat the civic center 
on the ballot, arguing that building a City Hall east of Crescent Heights 
Boulevard would make the city government more accountable to the city's poorer 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people felt they had been abandoned. They saw the civic center as the 
classic example of west side intolerance," Riney said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steve Schulte, who led the charge against the civic center and lives 
in the eastern half of the city, said that campaign taught people how to fight 
City Hall by going door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed them they could organize, that they could take on the status quo," 
Schulte said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems had been that no one had actually confronted the city, 
except in a piecemeal fashion," said Ron Goins, chairman of the group. "We are 
one of the first organizations on this end to actually give the city trouble. 
And that's because they have given us trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The run-down conditions, higher crime rates and shabby buildings on the east 
end are products of city neglect, residents say. In sharp contrast to the 
hostility toward development that prevails on the west side of town, members of 
the east-end group actively seek development. A better mix of shops and 
businesses, they say, would be a significant stop toward making the east end a 
more livable neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The group claims it will continue to be non-partisan, like West Hollywood West, 
the group's counterpart on the west side of town. Though Schulte was 
instrumental in the east-end group's formation during the anti-civic center 
campaign, the group has tenaciously maintained it will follow its own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the election-night party celebrating the defeat of the civic center, 
members of the new group were seething over Schulte's support for reinstating a 
controversial feeding program for the homeless in Plummer Park -- the only park 
on the east side of town. East-end residents say the feeding program has 
brought crime and a variety of nuisances to the area. Schulte and Councilman 
John Heilman, who frequently oppose one another on major issues, have come 
under fire from the group, but for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Heilman has long been blind to the east end. Schulte helped us defeat the 
civic center, but then turned around and kept the bums in our front yards," 
Goins said. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman and Schulte welcomed the organization of the east end, acknowledging 
that the city government may have focused primarily on west-side concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with people who say we have not done enough," Heilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Although group members say they will attack east-side problems issue by issue 
-- they say they will now wage an all-out fight against the Plummer Park 
feeding program and have begun a mailing campaign -- they also hope to have 
substantial influence on next April's council elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will field our own candidates in the foreseeable future, but 
I think we agree there needs to be change. It is time for some new blood on the 
council," Goins said. 
</P>
<P>
Council candidates appear to be taking the group and its aims seriously. Two 
candidates have already held meetings with east-end leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a voter turnout of 19% (in the civic center election) when the county 
could only get 12%, said Tad Bright, a member of the east-end group. "I think 
our City Council had better listen to us."

COURT MAY DETERMINE LINEUP OF CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TWO CERRITOS COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO HAVE SERVED MORE THAN TWO TERMS MAY 
NOT BE ABLE TO RUN FOR REELECTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
The mayor, who is a three-term City Council member, and a colleague, who has 
served five terms, may not be able to run for reelection next year if a court 
rules that a City Charter amendment limiting members to two consecutive terms 
is legal. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment was approved by voters three years ago but was successfully 
challenged last year in court on grounds that the effective date was ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit filed Nov. 1 by backers of the amendment known as Proposition H asks 
the Los Angeles County Superior Court to enforce the City Charter change. If it 
is successful, Mayor Diana Needham and Councilman Barry Rabbitt would not be 
allowed to seek reelection when their terms expire next year. 
</P>
<P>
Hydelita Madula-Soto and Leora C. Einson filed the suit against Cerritos and 
City Clerk Caroline DeLlamas. Einson said they filed the lawsuit when they 
learned that Needham and Rabbitt would be allowed to seek reelection next year. 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners said the amendment was aimed at incumbents whose terms expired 
in April, 1988, and who had served more then two terms. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on one phrase in the amendment: "This amendment will not 
affect the term of any council member presently in office." 
</P>
<P>
But the most recent petitioners point out that the amendment also states that: 
"Any council member who has served two consecutive four-year terms shall not be 
eligible for a period of two years to seek reelection." 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to obey the law, and they're not doing it," Einson said. "We just 
want to make a better government, and the people proved that they think the 
same way, because the proposition passed by an overwhelming vote." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt said he will definitely run for reelection, but Needham said she does 
not know whether she will run, even if the court says she can. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said last week that the limit on terms for council members may 
be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. J. Kenneth Brown said that in two earlier California cases judges 
ruled that limiting terms is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition H backers filed a suit last year when Councilman Daniel K. Wong ran 
for a third term. A Superior Court judge said the amendment's effective date 
was vague and let him run. Wong was elected to his third term. 
</P>
<P>
If voters did not want long-term incumbents, they would not have voted for 
Wong, Brown said, adding that the amendment's wording is so unclear that it 
does not apply to present council members. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have done it right," he said, "but they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt agreed: "They should have had someone with at least sixth-grade English 
to write it. It might have been all right. There was so much ambiguity and 
contradiction in the language that nobody knows yet what it means, and the 
authors turned around and said, 'Well, we really meant this, don't worry about 
what we wrote.' " 
</P>
<P>
He said that because the authors of the amendment had run unsuccessfully in the 
past, they hoped to get the incumbents out of office so they would have a 
better chance of winning a City Council seat. "Even if there were five 
vacancies, they weren't electable in this community," Rabbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Einson, Leora Einson's husband, was a member of a small group that led 
the fight to get the amendment on the ballot and was defeated in the last 
election. He said he ran because he wanted to make people conscious of 
Proposition H. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no other candidates running who supported Proposition H," he said. 
"The city is interested in major developments and is neglecting day care and 
senior citizen services. I wanted to balance things."

HOSPITAL CORPORATION CHIEF RESIGNS AFTER 3 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing "personal and career reasons," Stephen Ummel has resigned as president 
and chief executive officer of Memorial Health Services, the corporation that 
owns Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and other facilities, after three years 
at that post. "I've thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from my association with 
Memorial," Ummel said in an interview, "but it appeared an opportune time for 
both parties to reach this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Among major accomplishments during his tenure, Ummel said, were the improvement 
of computer technology, the development of basic "core" values for operation of 
the hospital and important strategic planning for its future. 
</P>
<P>
While declining to divulge specific plans, Ummel said he was exploring several 
"exciting career opportunities" locally and out of state. "I'm confident that 
I'm leaving Memorial stronger and more resilient than when I assumed this 
position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No plans have been made to find a permanent replacement, according to hospital 
spokesman Ron Yukelson. "Institutionally, we all wish him well in his future 
career and endeavors," Yukelson said of Ummel, whose departure was announced 
Wednesday, a day after it became effective.

CONCERNS ABOUT TAXICABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Max Salter said he is proud of his city's stringent new guidelines for 
taxicab operators but is concerned about cabs licensed elsewhere that give 
visitors a bad impression of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"London has immaculate cabs. In Tokyo they have white doilies in the taxis," he 
said at the City Council's informal session Tuesday. "I've gotten into cabs 
here that are a disgrace. And Los Angeles is the biggest city on the Pacific 
Rim." 
</P>
<P>
He urged Councilman Bernard Hecht and Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds, who serve as 
Beverly Hills' liaison committee to neighboring cities, to press for area-wide 
standards that would improve the appearance, cleanliness and manners of cabs 
and drivers.

STUDENTS AID QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children at La Ballona School in Culver City have raised more than $700 for San 
Francisco Bay area earthquake relief, by selling popcorn and juice and by 
collecting pennies. 
</P>
<P>
A check for $700.19 was sent to the Red Cross last week, said Jacque Kamm, a 
teacher and adviser of the student council. The students, in kindergarten 
through the fifth grade, brought in more than $200 in pennies. Students sold 
popcorn for a quarter a bag and orange drink for a quarter a cup at school 
during recess for four days. 
</P>
<P>
Kamm estimates that more than 2,000 bags of popcorn were sold. The orange drink 
was donated by McDonald's, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Student council President Ryan Nakanishi, 10, decided that the school's 450 
students should raise funds, after watching the earthquake news on television 
and worrying about his aunt in Santa Cruz. "I just thought it would be neat to 
send money up there. They need money so they could buy things that they need 
every day, like toothbrushes and clothes," Nakanishi said. 
</P>
<P>
In October, students of Culver City's Farragut School brought $575 to school 
for earthquake victims, said school secretary Sue Newman. She said most of the 
money came from the children themselves, rather than from their parents. "They 
felt very close to the situation. . . . This came from their little hearts and 
their little pockets," she said.

INVOICES TO BE REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has asked the city attorney to review $23,960 worth of 
invoices submitted by Land Design for construction projects along Holt and 
Garey avenues. 
</P>
<P>
D. Rodney Tapp, owner of Land Design, says the city has withheld payments to 
him since he publicly criticized the council for firing former City 
Administrator A. J. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Acting City Administrator Tom Fee said he reviewed the invoices submitted by 
Land Design dating to April and has had "a very hard time following the basis 
for compensation" for some of the work. 
</P>
<P>
Fee recommended delaying some payments, but the council decided to delay all 
payments while the city attorney conducts a review.

TRAFFIC WILL GET WORSE WITH OR WITHOUT THE 710 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I appreciated your article in the San Gabriel Valley section titled "1 City's 
Passion Is Another's Poison" on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Using the figures in your article "Traffic Builds in Alhambra: So Does Anger," 
Alhambra City Manager Kevin Murphy quotes that Atlantic Boulevard has 27,000 
vehicles per day, 1989. Without the freeway, by the year 2000 the number will 
be 73,000. With the freeway, the traffic on Atlantic Boulevard will be 49,000 
cars per day, an 81% increase on an already crowded street. This, after the 
spending of possibly $1 billion for the 710. 
</P>
<P>
Los Robles Avenue has 19,000 vehicles per day. Without the freeway, in 11 years 
it will be 56,000. With the freeway, the traffic on Los Robles will be 36,000 
cars per day, an 89% increase on an already crowded street. Again, after the 
spending of possibly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
My point is that after the spending of this $1 billion, we aren't any better 
off then we are today, we're worse. If the traffic is so bad today, then the 
figures Kevin Murphy gave only indicate how much worse it will get, either way. 
If we don't get people out of their cars, we are in bad shape. That is why we 
are pushing so hard for light rail and monorail. We recognize only a few care 
to save South Pasadena, fine. But everyone should be concerned with getting the 
most for our tax dollar and ending gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission's Rail Transit 
Project, they figure to complete the Long Beach Light Rail "Blue Line" in 1990, 
the Norwalk-El Segundo "Green Line" in 1993 and the Pasadena Line in 1996. 
According to their figures, the cost per mile for the Metro "Green Line" is $20 
million. This means with the $1 billion it would cost to build those 6.2 miles 
of freeway, for the 710, we all could get 50 miles of light rail. 
</P>
<P>
The 710 Freeway was planned and designed in the 1950s. It has proven not to be 
the solution to our regional traffic needs. Caltrans has stated that the 
completion of the 710 Freeway will not solve our traffic problem. If Caltrans 
has to spend that $1 billion, then spend it on something which will solve our 
transit needs in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
We understand Alhambra's feelings with their traffic problems, we are feeling 
the same with our traffic. Until we can get people out of their cars, Kevin 
Murphy's figures paint the complete picture. A minimum of an 81% increase on 
Atlantic and an 89% increase on Los Robles whether the 710 Freeway is completed 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
We don't have a choice now. We are stuck in our cars, in our traffic, with 
nowhere else to turn. With light rail or monorail, at least we will have a 
choice. It won't happen until the 21st Century, but then neither would the 
completion of the 710.

The Bellflower Adult School has presented its Student of the Year award to a 
76-year-old resident of Woodruff Convalescent Hospital for her determination to 
persevere despite a debilitating stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, a stroke left Ramona Hosford able to use only the right side 
of her body. Unwilling to slow down, she began attending art classes at the 
hospital, where she often uses her teeth and right arm to complete projects, 
said Cherie Buss, a social service aide at the hospital. "She is very 
independent," Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
Hosford, a former resident of San Diego, moved to the convalescent hospital 
after her stroke.

COMMEND SPONSORS OF SEMINAR ON RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: "Students Get Lesson in Bias at This Camp," (Times, Dec. 3). Project 
Brotherhood/Sisterhood should be commended for sponsoring this three-day 
seminar on combatting racism! 
</P>
<P>
The problem of racism has dramatically risen with the influx of Asian and 
Hispanic immigrants into the San Gabriel Valley in the last 10 years. Young 
peoples' attitudes toward race are strongly influenced by their parents. Many 
immigrants coming into our American "melting pot" have never had much 
opportunity to interact with those of different ethnic backgrounds. Their 
unfortunate ignorance breeds racism. As every young person knows, it's very 
difficult to change your parents' attitudes about anything! Schools offer the 
best hope of combatting racism. 
</P>
<P>
When I graduated from Rosemead High School in 1970, our ethnic student 
population was approximately 66% white, 30% Hispanic, 2% Asian and virtually no 
blacks. Today, it is 13% white, 54% Hispanic, 28% Asian and 1% black. 
</P>
<P>
My high school did such a fine job of getting us involved in student 
activities, that I was "color blind" -- the ethnicity of my classmates never 
entered my mind. We were first and foremost, Rosemead High School students! 
Although times have changed, the basic principles have not: Students who attend 
these seminars and are actively involved in school activities will benefit the 
most; those who do not get involved will always be hampered in life by their 
own prejudice.

LOAN FOR ARMORY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors approved a $180,000 interest-free loan and a 
grant of $36,350 for the new Armory Center for the Visual Arts at its meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The money will cover unanticipated costs arising from the renovation of the 
56-year-old National Guard building at 145 N. Raymond Ave. The center operates 
an art gallery and children's art program rent free in the city-owned building, 
which it rehabilitated and now maintains. 
</P>
<P>
Center Director Elisa Greben Crystal said the center received sufficient 
three-year fund-raising pledges to pay for the $630,000 renovation but lacked 
$184,716 due now for work already completed. The city also should pay for 
$36,350 worth of ceiling repairs because city officials failed to secure 
California Conservation Corps workers as promised, Crystal said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson and Director Bill Paparian objected to the grant and 
loan, saying that the city is also being asked to provide $84,568 to the Day 
One anti-drug program and $75,000 to Pasadena Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed to fund the three but put a hold on aid to other nonprofit 
social service agencies until a city policy is formulated.

WATER-SAVER INCENTIVE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved an ordinance that will allow the city levy a fee on 
residents who do not install certain plumbing fixtures designed to save water. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff is expected to recommend next spring that the council adopt a 
65-cents-a-month fee for each apartment unit and a $1-a-month fee for 
single-family houses that do not have certain fixtures, which are expected to 
include low-flow shower heads and toilets. 
</P>
<P>
"It is anticipated that the effective date for the incentive fee will be 
delayed until May 1, 1990," a staff report stated. 
</P>
<P>
One critic called the plan a tax, but council members said that in passing the 
ordinance they made a commitment to follow through on the city's water 
conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
The measure could raise an additional $327,000 for the city, which could cover 
half of the costs of the program because it provides rebates to residents who 
install water-saving plumbing fixtures.

HOSPITAL LEADERS INVITED TO 'SUMMIT' ON TRAUMA CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach Memorial Medical Center has invited representatives of 23 other area 
hospitals to attend a Dec. 15 "trauma summit" to discuss the future of the 
county's ailing trauma care network. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential is there for a crisis," hospital spokesman Ron Yukelson said, 
"and we'd like to avert that crisis before it gets to the crisis point." 
</P>
<P>
Memorial is one of several hospitals to have complained recently that staying 
in the trauma business is becoming less and less economically feasible. Of the 
county's 23 original trauma network members to be represented at the planned 
meeting, 10 have already dropped out of the system. And Memorial is engaged in 
a study of its own trauma services that recently prompted the Long Beach City 
Council to direct City Manager James Hankla to work with the hospital to assure 
that its trauma unit remains open. 
</P>
<P>
"The agenda is to get everybody together," Yukelson said of the half-day 
conference. "There are ways that hospitals can cut costs, become better funded 
and operate the entire trauma network more profitably. This is an attempt to 
get all those ideas on the table."

COMMITTEE ASKED TO DRAFT PUBLIC OFFICIALS' ETHICS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has directed one of its committees to draw up a proposed 
ethics code for public officials in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote, the council Tuesday asked its Legislative Committee to 
review ethics codes adopted by other cities or governmental agencies, as well 
as a recent Los Angeles report written in the wake of controversies over Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The code could include standards governing travel, the acceptance of gifts and 
outside fees and might also toughen financial disclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ernie Kell raised the issue of a city ethics code, saying that while 
state law covers campaign activities, there are few laws regulating officials 
once they are elected or appointed.

PRINCESS LOUISE DECLARED TOTAL LOSS BY OWNERS; FUTURE UNCLEAR; 
</P>
<P>
SHIPWRECK: A NUMBER OF GROUPS WITH WIDELY DIFFERENT PLANS HAVE INDICATED 
INTEREST IN THE SUNKEN SAN PEDRO LANDMARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A month after it capsized without warning at a San Pedro shipyard, the former 
cruise ship Princess Louise has been declared a total loss by its owners, the 
Bank of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"We've declared it a total loss, and we believe that's what the (insurance) 
surveyor is going to do," bank President Lance Oak said. According to Oak, the 
67-year-old ship is insured for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
A fixture in Los Angeles Harbor after it was converted into a restaurant in 
1966, the Princess Louise suddenly listed to starboard and capsized on Oct. 30 
as it was being readied for sale at Southwest Marine of San Pedro. The cause is 
still unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the half-sunken ship has attracted the interest of a range of 
groups with strikingly different plans for its future. 
</P>
<P>
Several salvage companies have proposed to carve the ship up and send the 
pieces to scrap yards. But Los Angeles scuba divers are hoping to get the 
360-foot vessel refloated and then scuttled off the Palos Verdes Peninsula for 
use as an underwater recreational attraction. 
</P>
<P>
And a Washington state steamboat enthusiast would like to return the ship to 
its original home port, Vancouver, Canada. The Princess Louise, he argues, is 
the last 1920s-era West Coast cruise liner left intact. 
</P>
<P>
"It is to West Coast coastal liner history what the Delta Queen is to river 
boat history," said Loren Herrigstad, who said he will try to raise money for 
the project through a group he founded recently called the Steamship 
Preservation Trust. "She deserves the same care and recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Oak said he has received proposals from nine salvage companies interested in 
being hired to remove the ship, which is resting on its starboard side in the 
slip where it was moored. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of the proposals provide for refloating the ship, he said. The rest 
would involve scrapping it. But Oak said he would not rule out refloating the 
ship, saying cost estimates supplied in some proposals indicate that the method 
"might be economical." 
</P>
<P>
"Economics is the major question," Oak said. " . . . I have a responsibility to 
my shareholders." He declined to elaborate or to reveal the estimated costs of 
the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
One group keenly interested in refloating the Princess Louise is the Greater 
Los Angeles Council on Diving, which has been working with the state Department 
of Fish and Game to find a ship for an artificial reef. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the California Coastal Commission approved the department's plans 
for the project: to tow a vessel about a mile off Point Vicente and scuttle it. 
The plans still must be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the 
State Lands Commission. 
</P>
<P>
David Lee, president of the diving group, said a sunken Princess Louise would 
create a new habitat for marine life and an adventurous atmosphere for divers. 
</P>
<P>
"It would provide an opportunity for recreational sports scuba divers to visit 
a shipwreck," Lee said. "It would be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Herrigstad of Olympia, Wash., said members of his U.S. and Canadian 
preservation group believe it would be a great historical loss to scuttle the 
Princess Louise, which cruised the Alaskan straits from Vancouver to Skagway, 
Alaska, for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ship is the only remaining example of the ocean liners that plied 
West Coast waters between the world wars. 
</P>
<P>
"Many trains and locomotives have been preserved in steam museums, but the 
Queen Mary is the only ocean liner," Herrigstad said. "The maritime heritage of 
the '20s has been grossly neglected." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about this point, Lee said that if Herrigstad can arrange to save the 
Princess Louise, he would "certainly be supportive." 
</P>
<P>
"But if he can't, and it's going to end up being ground up and made into 
Toyotas, I would much rather have it as an artificial reef," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrigstad and Lee have notified the Bank of San Pedro of their interest in the 
Princess Louise, but Oak said that there is unlikely to be a decision on the 
vessel's fate for two weeks to a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Princess Louise, the 67-year-old former cruise ship that suddenly capsized in 
October in a San Pedro shipyard, had been a fixture in the port area since 
1966, the year it was converted into a restaurant. The wreck's owners have 
declared it a total loss, but a number of proposals for making use of it have 
been made by others.

PORT URGED TO FIND BERTH FOR MUSEUM SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has urged the Port of Los Angeles to find a berth 
for the merchant ship Lane Victory, but it stopped short of recommending that 
the ship be placed at Berth 87 in San Pedro, near the Los Angeles Maritime 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-0 vote represented a partial victory for the Long Beach-based U.S. 
Merchant Marine Veterans World War II, which has been trying to renovate the 
ship into a floating museum and is pressing the Harbor Department to give up 
Berth 87. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Department has repeatedly refused the group's requests, saying it 
needs Berth 87 for use as a container terminal. However, spokeswoman Julia 
Nagano said, "We are working with them to find a permanent home and we are very 
supportive of their venture." 
</P>
<P>
The council's resolution, introduced by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, asks 
the Harbor Department to find a home for the ship "in a locale with easy public 
access and adequate parking accommodations, where it will serve as a memorial 
museum and benefit the residents of Los Angeles and all of Southern 
California."

SCHOOL NEWS: STUDENT LEARNS THE WAYS OF WASHINGTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nogales High School junior Gilbert Velasquez wants to be an aeronautical 
engineer, not a congressman, but he recently got to see what it's like to make 
decisions that influence the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez of West Covina was one of about 225 high school students from around 
the country who attended the six-day Congressional Youth Leadership Conference 
in Washington last month. 
</P>
<P>
The students met with members of Congress and their staffs, journalists, and 
lobbyists. The high point of the conference was a mock Congress in which the 
students debated, lobbied and voted on the proposed volunteer service 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an opportunity of a lifetime, and it made you want to do more in public 
service," Velasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, 16, who is interested in golf, band and the science club at his 
school, said he went to the conference mainly to see Washington but now wants 
to be more involved. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez is taking his experience back to his school by starting a drive to 
get more 18-year-olds to register to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by the National Youth Leadership Council, a 
nonprofit, nonpartisan group. The council sends high school juniors and seniors 
to Washington every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Cabrera, a senior at Claremont's Webb School, and Karissa Reese, a senior 
at Imperial High School in Pasadena, attended conferences earlier this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Ferguson remembers the thrill of discovering a baby heron in the pond at 
his ranch in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The mother heron was feeding her chick on an island Ferguson had carved out and 
protected with a moat in the pond he created to attract wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"You just feel wonderful," he said. "Ducks and herons need a place to lay their 
eggs so coyotes can't get to them." 
</P>
<P>
The pond is just one way Ferguson gives wildlife a hand on the 440-acre 
Bluebird Ranch. But other examples abound: There are the bees he keeps on the 
property to pollinate wildflowers. And the underground water he pipes to the 
surface to provide animals with another spot for a drink. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is part of a growing network of landowners who are developing their 
property to attract wildlife with the help of a nonprofit organization called 
Operation Stronghold. The group, started by Oregon cattle rancher and author 
Dayton Hyde in 1979, helps owners of more than 6 million acres in a similar 
way. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, Ferguson, a Glendora doctor who manages the land he 
co-owns with six families, has been getting preservation advice from Operation 
Stronghold through the mail. Ferguson, 44, feels his involvement in the project 
offers a sensible option in the conservation debate Glendorans have faced in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Concern for hillside preservation has sparked enough interest in the foothill 
community that the City Council last week placed a special property tax on the 
April 10 ballot that, if approved, would fund land acquisition for 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, president of the Chamber of Commerce, doesn't think the idea will fly 
with voters. The chamber last week presented City Hall with more than 1,500 
signatures opposing such a tax. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can afford to buy the land," he said. The city has estimated 
the cost of purchasing Glendora's 2,112 acres of privately-held hillside land 
at $112 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Mason, a member of the mayor's advisory committee that proposed the tax 
and the creation of a hillside conservancy, said that although acquiring all 
the land at once would be impossible, even piecemeal purchases would be 
important. 
</P>
<P>
While parcels that landowners donate to the conservancy could be closed off at 
their request, the hillside committee would prefer opening most areas to the 
public because "it's the kind of beautiful countryside that people would 
enjoy," he said. "There will always be people who would abuse the privilege, 
but you hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he thinks a more effective avenue would be to encourage 
landowners to nurture what wildlife they have. 
</P>
<P>
He has urged the city to take an active role in linking local landowners with 
Stronghold and advising them of tax benefits that come with membership. 
</P>
<P>
Stronghold, which includes members in England, Canada and South Africa, doesn't 
hurt the image of landholders either, said 61-year-old Hyde, the organization's 
driving force. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the rich guy up the hill who wants to keep (the land) to himself 
but (someone who) is doing something positive for the environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A New England couple built an entire trout stream on their property, one 
Canadian member maintains 1,000 miles of bluebird houses along the birds' 
migratory trail and many members are creating wetlands on their land. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of good people doing quiet unsung jobs like that. It adds up 
nationwide to a pretty big contribution," Hyde said, adding he believes private 
landowners have an advantage over the federal forest service because they can 
protect their property from the recreational demands of the public. 
</P>
<P>
Stronghold advised Ferguson to plant fig trees around an abandoned reservoir he 
was converting into a fish pond. The ripened fruit drops into the water and 
feeds the bluegill and catfish he bought from a pet shop. 
</P>
<P>
When Ferguson asked how he could fend off the gophers and squirrels gnawing at 
his avocado trees, Stronghold suggested he erect posts in the fields as perches 
for preying hawks to control the rodent population. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a deer track," Ferguson said, waving at a V-shaped imprint in the mud 
downstream from a shallow drinking pool. He created the puddle by damming up a 
trickle of spring water so animals could have an easier drink. Nearby, a metal 
water heater lay on the ground, a hole welded in its side to form a trough fed 
by another spring. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not things that are new and shiny," Ferguson said. For a reason. 
</P>
<P>
Once he put out a relatively clean bathtub for animals to drink from, and no 
one showed. "Only after I painted it with camouflage paint and it got mossy did 
we start seeing tracks around it." 
</P>
<P>
The deer that thrive on the ranch -- Ferguson has observed as many as 14 in a 
single cluster -- also draw hunters. He has had to run scores of hunters off 
his property within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had deer shot on our front lawn and carried off, and bullets in our 
home," he said, adding that stray shots killed a family pet as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel immensely wealthy with the land, the beauty and joy it brings, and I 
want to protect it," he said. "I feel guilty because a lot of people look up 
there and want to zone it open space." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson hopes the hillside conservancy the city is helping to establish will 
keep public use of the land limited. Animals should be able to live without 
interference from humans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to places like Griffith Park, and (people) have driven all the game 
away."

Memorial services will be at 4 p.m. today at Claremont Presbyterian Church for 
Mayor Alex Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who had served on the City Council since 1986 and as mayor since last 
April, died early Monday, apparently of a heart attack. He was at his home when 
he became ill, and was taken to Pomona Valley Community Hospital. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Nick Presecan will assume mayoral responsibilities. The City 
Council must decide whether to appoint someone to serve out Hughes' term or 
leave the seat empty until April, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an exceptional human being and . . . an outstanding public servant," 
City Manager Glenn D. Southard said. 
</P>
<P>
"Alex had extreme passion for all people. He would listen. He had integrity. 
That's what people expect in an elected official. He was really top flight," 
Southard said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was associate superintendent of Claremont schools, having served the 
district since 1966, when he was appointed assistant principal of Claremont 
High School. He was principal in 1968-75, then was appointed assistant 
superintendent of the school system. He was promoted to associate 
superintendent this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tom Peeler, Claremont superintendent, said Hughes "was a highly unique 
person who was involved with the city and a real leader in the school 
district." 
</P>
<P>
Southard said Hughes contributed to the schools by maintaining outstanding 
early relationships between the city and the district. As a result, the city 
and the district have sponsored several programs together, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave and gave until there wasn't anything left to give," said Councilwoman 
Diann Ring, who was elected with Hughes. "He used to play Santa Claus at the 
schools and at Christmas parties. I saw him last Saturday in his suit." 
</P>
<P>
During the 23 years he lived in Claremont, Hughes was a member of the Rotary 
Club, ruling elder of Claremont Presbyterian Church and was on the board of 
directors of the Services Center for Independent Living. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was born in Cleveland. He attended the University of Southern California 
and received bachelor's and master's degrees in education. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes is survived by Anita Gaffron Hughes, his wife of 24 years, and three 
children: John, 22, Kelly, 19, and James, 12. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Services Center for 
Independent Living, 480 S. Indian Hill Blvd.; Claremont Presbyterian Church, 
1111 N. Mountain Ave., or the American Red Cross, Claremont Chapter, 2065 N. 
Indian Hill Blvd.

LA CANADA BANS HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT FOR 45 DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING: THE CITY WANTS TIME TO STUDY CHANGES IN THE CURRENT HILLSIDE 
ORDINANCE. THE MORATORIUM MAY BE EXTENDED UP TO 10 MONTHS. 
</P>

<P>
Hillside development in La Canada Flintridge has been halted for at least 45 
days under an emergency ordinance adopted Monday night by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4-0 in favor of the ordinance. Councilman Ed Phelps abstained 
due to a conflict of interest because his former law firm represented a La 
Canada Flintridge hillside developer. 
</P>
<P>
The matter was brought before the council at Monday's meeting by Director of 
Community Development Bill Campbell, who presented a staff report requesting 
the council to allow the staff to review the current hillside construction 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Under the emergency moratorium, the city staff will have 45 days to propose 
changes in the current hillside ordinance, written in 1979, and schedule public 
hearings. After that, the City Council may extend the moratorium up to 10 
months and 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
The staff's primary aim is to review the slope density standards, Campbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ordinance concerns hillside developments on slopes with a 15% 
grade or steeper. The affected areas are in the northern section of La Canada 
Flintridge along the San Gabriel Mountains and the southern area at the base of 
the San Rafael Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology and the economic value of the land is making hillside development 
more likely," said Councilman O. Warren Hilgren. "We as the City Council have a 
responsibility to the downhill people we represent, who may have to look up at 
a gigantic wall of masonry." 
</P>
<P>
The staff report said retaining walls have a negative impact on the city's 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
"People were building very precipitous buildings with high retaining walls," 
City Senior Planner Craig Ewing said. "The character of these buildings was not 
considered appropriate for La Canada." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell estimated that at least a dozen proposed projects would be affected by 
the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"All the tough properties are starting to be explored now, so they're using 
this technique of retaining walls to move forward on these lots," he said. "The 
availability is getting very, very limited, so a lot of these lots that have 
lain around and haven't received development pressures are now coming into 
play." 
</P>
<P>
The city staff and City Council decided to review the hillside ordinance after 
a developer applied for a building permit for a hillside property on Robin Hill 
Road. The permit for the proposed 5,000-square-foot structure on the 
35,000-square-foot site was rejected by the planning commission and by the City 
Council last month. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the straw that broke the camel's back," said Campbell. "There have 
been other projects that have gone through a review process, and we've raised 
the issue that there should be something done about this particular standard. 
This got the attention that we needed." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Chris Valente added, "That made us wake up and say, 'Hey, let's 
fill in the cracks of this ordinance.' Developers aren't going to be too 
excited with us, but I feel it's another important step that we can take 
together as a council."

DIALECT COACH FINDS HIS ROLE PUTTING AN ACCENT ON THE STARS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE MAN WHO HELPED SOME CAST MEMBERS OF 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' ACHIEVE A 
RANGE OF SOUTHERN SPEECH ALSO HELPS IMMIGRANTS AND EXECUTIVES SHED THEIR 
DIALECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dolly Parton needed a dialect coach for "Steel Magnolias" as much as she needed 
a few more rhinestones. 
</P>
<P>
The actress-singer from Locust Ridge, Tenn., already has a genuine Southern 
accent, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
But the characteristic sounds of the South did not come naturally to all the 
members of the new movie's cast, and so David Alan Stern was called in by 
casting director Hank McCann. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, 43, who lives in Park Labrea, is a dialect coach, a person who helps 
actors achieve aural authenticity. (In addition to teaching accents, he also 
guides immigrants, would-be anchors, executives and others in losing them.) For 
"Steel Magnolias," a film about six strong-willed women in rural Louisiana, 
Stern helped perfect the Southern accents of actresses Olympia Dukakis and 
Darryl Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, who spent a week on the set in Natchitoches, La., recalls being teased 
by Parton. "Where's this little boy from Brooklyn who's supposed to teach us 
little gals to sound Southern?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
As Stern points out, there are really many Southern accents, not just one. For 
"Steel Magnolias," he taught very different styles of Southern speech to 
Dukakis and Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to create two different worlds with speech patterns," he said, 
explaining that director Herbert Ross wanted the women's accents to reflect 
their differing socioeconomic levels. Dukakis, who plays the widow of the 
town's mayor, "was to have a very aristocratic Southern accent." Stern calls it 
"plantation style." 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard people joke that you have to learn to talk that way to graduate 
from Duke Law School," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah, who plays a plain young woman hired to work in the beauty parlor owned 
by Parton's character, was to have a rural Southern accent much like her movie 
boss's. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, who has a doctorate in speech communication from Temple University in 
Philadelphia, has what he describes as "a completely non-traditional way of 
looking at accents and dialects." 
</P>
<P>
As he explains: "Most people look at accents in terms of pronunciation 
differences. What really creates the essence of, say, a New York sound, even 
more than the pronunciation -- what causes many of the differences in 
pronunciation -- is that the muscles of the mouth are moving in a different 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Shifting from his upscale, non-regional accent to a stereotyped "New Yawk" 
accent, Stern demonstrated that the latter is visibly different. A New York 
accent "muscularizes" his lower lip and chin. 
</P>
<P>
Stern teaches that different accents focus the sound at different points in the 
speaker's mouth. Plantation Southern is focused farther back in the mouth than 
rural Southern. The r sound is also very different in the two styles, he said. 
Genteel Southerners drop the r after vowels, while rural Southerners have hard, 
tight r's. Plantation Southern is characterized by certain rounded vowels. 
Rural Southern has a more twangy sound. Stern also teaches his students the 
lilt that characterizes Southern speech. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, who started out to become an actor, says his aim in coaching actors is 
to help them perfect an accent so they can forget it and get on with acting. 
"You want them to be able to become a character who expresses herself that 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he got into the accent business, Stern joked: "Doesn't everyone wake 
up when they are 10 years old and decide to become an accent and dialect coach 
for the movies?" In fact, he said, he knew he had a gift for mimicking accents 
when he was about 10 and his father brought home the cast album of "My Fair 
Lady," the world's only hit musical about dialect coaching. Stern effortlessly 
reproduced all the accents on the record. "That," he said, "was when I realized 
I was a parrot." 
</P>
<P>
Stern made the transition from parrot to teacher of parrots when he was on the 
speech faculty at Wichita State University and was asked by members of the 
drama department to coach student actors. "Out there in the Midwest, where 
everybody was twanging away, the theater faculty asked me if I could teach 
accents to others," he recalled. He found that he could, and continued to coach 
after he moved to Pennsylvania State University. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, "tired of academic poverty and academic politics," he moved to Los 
Angeles and began seeking clients. "I was able to place very large ads in the 
trade papers," he recalled. His industry clients have included Lynn Redgrave, 
whom he coaches when she has to sound American, Michael York and Bronson 
Pinchot, "a very quick study with dialects." 
</P>
<P>
Stern found that he began to see more and more non-theatrical clients who 
wanted help losing an accent, not acquiring one. "When I came out to Hollywood, 
I was operating on the assumption that 99% of my work would be teaching English 
speakers to put on accents for the movies. From the very beginning it was 50-50 
and now sometimes 25-75 on the accent-reduction side." 
</P>
<P>
Stern's accent-reduction clients have included actor Edward James Olmos. 
</P>
<P>
Stern discovered that he could apply the same principles he uses with his 
Hollywood clientele to non-actors. As a general rule, Stern said, non-regional 
English is spoken farther back in the mouth than most other languages, 
including Spanish, and involves less movement of the lips and the rest of the 
face. Many non-English speakers have to learn how to use more of their tongue 
when they speak, and so the first step in the process is doing calisthenics of 
the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Stern never promises clients that they will be able to pass as native English 
speakers, although some can, he said. Nor does he think everyone with an accent 
should lose it. "People who do accent reduction often get accused of wanting to 
homogenize the world, but I've spent hours on the phone talking people out of 
it," he said. "I feel it's only necessary when the accent is interfering with 
some professional or social goal the person has." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the goal is greater intelligibility. Remarkably often, Stern said, 
the client is simply sick to death of being asked, "Where are you from?" 
Sometimes, the client realizes that his or her speech is making a false, 
negative impression. Stern recalls working with a Moroccan client whose 
monotone speech was routinely interpreted as unfriendly. Stern taught the 
client the varied intonation pattern he says is associated with expressive 
English (Stern calls it "jump up and step down"). 
</P>
<P>
Stern says he is increasingly called upon to teach accent reduction to speech 
pathologists, teachers of English as a second language and others working with 
California's flood of non-English-speaking newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
The movies may be sexier, but accent reduction is, by far, the more satisfying 
aspect of his work, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
The process of losing an accent can be very stressful, Stern said. "The hardest 
part is coming to grips with the emotional impact of using a new style of 
speech." However motivated to lose the accent, the client often ends up 
thinking: "This doesn't sound like me. This isn't what talking has felt like 
all my life." 
</P>
<P>
"That's scary," Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
Stern has enormous empathy for such students. After all, he says, using the 
non-regional dialect he speaks so well, "most of my professional life is spent 
speaking a dialect that is not my own." 
</P>
<P>
Stern says he starts every day sounding like a television broadcaster. "But if 
my wife and I have a couple of glasses of wine, I begin to sound like Brooklyn, 
and she begins to sound like Texas."

33-YEAR-OLD LA SALLE HIGH SCHOOL PLANS TO ENROLL GIRLS IN 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
La Salle High School in Pasadena will open its classroom doors to girls next 
year for the first time in its 33-year history, making it one of only two 
coeducational Catholic high schools in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It was mainly a desire we had to prepare our school for the next century," 
said Brother Philip Clarke, the school's principal. 
</P>
<P>
"We were examining the types of things that we should take care of in terms of 
curriculum, programs, activities and sports, and when we examined all this, the 
obvious question came up of why we are remaining a single-sex school in this 
day and age," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the things that sparked the need for the examination, however, was the 
school's decline in enrollment over the past five years, Clarke said. The 
school has 320 students, only 64% of its capacity of 500. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle hopes to attract 150 girls for the 1990-91 school year, Clarke said. 
Bishop Amat High School in La Puente also is co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey commissioned by the school, parents of potential future students 
and alumni have said they would like a co-ed Catholic school in the area, 
Clarke said, and offering the choice between co-ed and single-sex education was 
a motivating factor in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Single-sex for all students is probably not a good idea," said Clarke, who 
believes that single-sex schools provide positive learning atmospheres. "So the 
idea of having a choice where parents of students can choose single-sex or 
choose co-ed is an important factor for us. And in this area, that choice 
simply has not been available." 
</P>
<P>
Both students and faculty have welcomed the decision, with the faculty giving 
almost unanimous support, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
"We like the idea of the school going co-ed. It will add new dimensions to the 
school," said Tom Carter, a sophomore at La Salle. 
</P>
<P>
The school plans to spend $500,000 in physical plant renovations and hire 10 
more teachers over the next two years, bringing the faculty to 31. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle is also planning to undergo less tangible changes in anticipation of 
the new students. The student government will visit co-ed schools to look into 
the types of social groups and activities necessary to accommodate the girls. 
Teachers will go through training to prepare them for the psychological and 
teaching adjustments necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you introduce a dramatic change into an existing structure, that 
causes uncertainties, and it causes a certain amount of tension and a certain 
amount of worry that is there just because of the changes," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
All of the teachers at La Salle have taught co-ed classes before, Clarke said. 
The Christian Brothers, which run La Salle, also own eight other high schools 
in California and Oregon. All eight either are co-ed or are considering it. 
</P>
<P>
"Christian Brothers prefer" co-ed schools "to single-sex schools because the 
kids fit better into their present generation, they are prepared better for 
life than just in a single-sex school, according to our experience," Clarke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Christian Brothers follows the announcement in early 
October that the Westlake School for girls on the Westside and the Harvard 
School for boys in North Hollywood, two prestigious private schools, will merge 
in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of Westlake students have protested the merger, citing research showing 
that single-sex education may be beneficial for girls. Proponents of the 
Harvard-Westlake merger, however, contend that single-sex education is out of 
date and th!t, if Harvard were to go co-ed on its own, Westlake might not be 
able to survive financially. 
</P>
<P>
The academic debate over the quality of a single-sex education as compared with 
a co-educational setting, however, has leaned towards the conclusion that, at 
least for girls, single-sex education is better. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and 1970s, social and economic reasons forced some single-sex 
schools to close or go co-ed. Single-sex education was viewed as a barrier to 
the successful socialization of adolescents, said Valerie Lee, professor at the 
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's research, however, shows that in schools where students are of the same 
socioeconomic status, "single-sex schools seem to be advantageous to the women 
that attend them," and that for boys, "it doesn't seem to make much difference" 
whether they go to a co-ed or single-sex school. 
</P>
<P>
For both boys and girls, she said, "all of the statistically significant 
single-sex school effects were positive" and there were "few negative effects."

TWO VALLEY PLAYERS MAKE JUNIOR COLLEGE ALL-AMERICAN TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two players from San Gabriel Valley colleges have been named to the 1989 Junior 
College Grid-Wire All-American Team. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Devon Hosey of Pasadena City College, a 5-10, 165-pound 
sophomore, was named to the first team and running back Leonard Russell of Mt. 
San Antonio, a 6-3, 235-pound sophomore, made the second. 
</P>
<P>
Russell was Mt. San Antonio's leading rusher the last two seasons. A transfer 
from Arizona State University and a former All-CIF selection at Long Beach Poly 
High, Russell rushed for 1,470 yards and nine touchdowns in 240 carries, an 
average of 6.1 yards. He averaged 163 yards a game. He had rushed for 1,618 
yards in 278 carries as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Among players receiving honorable mention were Steve Schell of Citrus at tight 
end, Mick Barsala of Pasadena at linebacker and Darick Holmes of Mt. San 
Antonio as an all-purpose runner. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena High senior Mike Fehmers, who led the Tigers to the CIF 2-A 
Division water polo title in November, has been named the division player of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Fehmers was joined on the 2-A first team by teammates Matt Cherrie and Tim 
Norduett, both seniors. South Pasadena also landed seniors Robert Watkins and 
Larry Haggquist on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Jerry Wulf was selected as the 2-A coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The only other first-team selection in the 2-A from the San Gabriel Valley was 
senior Sandor Poka of Alhambra. Senior Jerry Wooden of Rowland made the 3-A 
first team. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Dana Chalais, who led Citrus College into the Southern California 
regionals of the state community college volleyball playoffs, has been selected 
Foothill Conference player of the year by conference coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Chalais, a former Covina High standout, was joined on the all-conference first 
team by sophomore setter Monique Serna and freshman hitter Amy Young. 
</P>
<P>
The Owls finished second in the Foothill Conference at 12-2 and were 16-3 
overall.

MUIR LOOKS LIKE CREAM OF BASKETBALL CROP; 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' SPORTS: WEST COVINA AND PASADENA FIGURE TO BE THE CLOSEST CHALLENGERS TO 
THE POWERHOUSE MUSTANGS.

<P>
When it comes to girls' high school basketball in the San Gabriel Valley this 
season, the spotlight figures to be clearly focused on Muir High School in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
That should not come as a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
With four second-place finishes in CIF Southern Section play since 1983, the 
Mustangs may be the best team that has never won a division championship. 
</P>
<P>
But with another corps of outstanding players, the Mustangs are hoping that 
this is the season when they finally reach the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
Muir appears to be the class of valley basketball teams. Its two closest 
challengers could be West Covina and Muir's cross-town rival, Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The other contenders are Ganesha, Los Altos, South Hills, San Dimas, Covina, 
Walnut and St. Lucy's. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the top 10 teams: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Muir (Pacific League; 4-AA Division) -- It was a brilliant debut for Mel 
Sims as coach of the Mustangs last season. 
</P>
<P>
In their best season since 1986, the Mustangs wound up with a 24-5 record, 
finished second in 4-A and reached the state Division II regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this team is better than last year because I've been here a year," 
Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly helps to return an All-Southern Section point guard, 5-1 senior 
Rose Jong, and an all-valley forward, 5-10 senior Karen Banks. Jong averaged 10 
points and 10.1 assists last season and Banks, who has signed a letter of 
intent with UC Santa Barbara, averaged 15 points and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The other starter returning is all-league guard Taunya Johnson, a 5-7 senior. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major concerns after last season was replacing All-Southern Section 
center Lisa Salsman, who is a freshman at Arizona State. But the Mustangs 
should have more than adequate players to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Banks, front-line players include centers Josie Pacheco (6-0) and Kim 
Davis (6-2) and forward Melinda Armstrong (6-0), a talented transfer. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- West Covina (Sierra League; 5-A) -- Expectations are high at West Covina, 
and why not? 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs return an all-valley center, 6-2 senior Ingrid Dixson, and one of 
the valley's best floor leaders, 5-6 senior point guard Lisa Sloan, from a team 
that went 19-3 and advanced to the 5-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Dixson, a major-college recruit, averaged 17.4 points and 11.4 rebounds last 
season and Sloan averaged 11.2 points and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Bill Torricelli said Dixson will be a marked player: 
"Everybody seems to know her, and if they don't they just see her out there and 
set their defense to stop her." 
</P>
<P>
But the coach is not certain about the players surrounding his two stars. 
</P>
<P>
"The wings that played last year were great players and we don't really have 
that kind of players right now," he said. "I think the kids realize that they 
will have to work, and it's going to take some time." 
</P>
<P>
A key will be the development of sophomore guards Thao Tran (5-5) and Lisa 
Pearl (5-6). West Covina also expects to be led by forwards Anna Hernandez, a 
5-7 junior, and Anette Jacobs, a 5-8 senior, and also starts junior Evelyn 
Johnson (5-11) in its twin-post alignment. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Pasadena (Pacific League; 5-A) -- The Bulldogs are probably only the 
second best team in Pasadena, but that doesn't mean they are not one of the 
best in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs do not have Muir's size, but with four starters returning from a 
16-9 team and depth, Pasadena figures to be among the best in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had good teams with mostly individual talent, and this is the 
deepest team I've ever had," says Coach Dudley Stewart. "We go about 12 deep. 
This is going to be more of a team effort." 
</P>
<P>
The leader is all-league forward Kim Rice, a 5-10 senior who missed about half 
of last season because of personal reasons. The return of junior center 
Stephanie Hall (6-0) gives the Bulldogs respectable size on their front line. 
</P>
<P>
Two other starters returning are seniors Anita Bilboussian (5-5) at point guard 
and Shauntel Webster (5-6) at the other guard. The Bulldogs should have depth 
at guard with the return of senior Tamara Wallace (5-6) and Teyonye Mosley 
(5-7). 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena can also draw players from a junior varsity that was 18-0 last season, 
including junior point guard Nyree Derderian (5-7). 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Ganesha (Hacienda League; 4-A) -- It was an inexperienced Ganesha squad 
that finished 14-9 and reached the second round of the 3-A playoffs last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Even Coach Wesley Stewart, was in his first year. 
</P>
<P>
That is not the case this time around with the return of four starters and 
several top reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list are center Andrea Rutland (6-2) and center/forward Monica 
Hicks (6-1), a pair of juniors who combine to give the Giants a tall one-two 
punch on their front line. 
</P>
<P>
The other starters returning are point guard Nadina Powell (5-4), an excellent 
passer and ball handler, and forward Shontel Patterson (5-7). Beverly Hackett 
(5-8) starts at the other guard. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants also return top reserves Tinesha Cole (5-8) and Leslie Macon (5-9) 
at forward and have an understudy at point guard in sophomore Dominique Lindsay 
(5-3). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty good group of kids," Stewart said. "I feel that my bench will be 
a lot stronger than it was last year." 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Los Altos (Sierra League; 4-A) -- With the graduation of All-Southern 
Section players Susan Peters and Jonna Steffens on the front line, the 
Conquerors will take on a different look this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably will have better outside shooting," Coach Don Holbrook said. "It's 
the inside game that's suffering. But if we can get through December 
(tournament play), I think we'll be better by January." 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming down from last season but we still have good people," Holbrook 
said. "We have a good group and we should be stronger in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Los Altos, which finished 26-2 last season and reached the 4-A quarterfinals, 
returns starters Natasha Sussoev (5-7), a junior, at guard and senior Jennifer 
Hovelsen (5-10) at center in the twin-post alignment. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquerors also return senior guards Kyra Watari (5-6) and Teri Hayashibara 
(5-2), the point guard. On the inside, Los Altos also has post players Tiffany 
Kendrick (5-9) and Christie Flenniken (5-10), who could be the top offensive 
player. Kendrick is a sophomore and Flenniken a junior. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- South Hills (Valle Vista League; 3-A) -- There is an aura of confidence 
surrounding the Huskies, and Coach Paul Reed says it comes from experience. 
</P>
<P>
That's an ingredient that the team didn't always demonstrate last season when 
it finished 16-7 and placed second in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of feel that with the experience we would have won it," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
That does not figure to ring true this season with three starters and six top 
lettermen returning. Topping the list are senior point guard Karen Hecox (5-5), 
one of the best distance runners in the state, and post player Kelly Figueroa, 
a 5-10 senior who averaged a team-high 15 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
The most improved player is the other starter in the post, 6-3 senior Moira 
Henny, who could be the most dominant inside player in the league. 
</P>
<P>
South Hills has two other good athletes in the starting lineup on the wings in 
Shelly Kennedy (5-10), an all-league volleyball player, and Susie Robbin (5-9), 
an all-league softball player. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all very athletic," Reed said. "It's kind of an eclectic team from an 
athletic standpoint. We have volleyball, cross-country and softball players." 
</P>
<P>
7 -- San Dimas (Montview League; 3-A) -- Coach Bill Wakely said he could have 
almost predicted what happened at the end of last season when the Saints were 
surprisingly eliminated by Duarte in the opening round of the 3-A playoffs 
after a successful 19-5 season. 
</P>
<P>
But the coach says his team has a much better attitude this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in much better shape," he said. "The week of the playoffs we had some 
bad practices and I knew we'd lose. But this year we have a better attitude." 
</P>
<P>
It helps to return an All-Southern Section performer in 5-11 senior post player 
Natalie Kramer, who averaged 15 points and 13.1 rebounds and 4.5 steals as a 
junior. Kramer moved to New Jersey after the season but has returned for her 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
The other player in the team's twin-post alignment is junior Shelly Baughn, 
another strong inside player. The Saints, who have outstanding quickness and a 
good full-court press, also expect to start forward Michelle Barnett (5-9) and 
5-6 guards Lisa Arizmendez and Tshibola Badibanga. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Covina (Valle Vista League; 3-A) -- It may be a tall task to expect the 
Colts to repeat their success of last season when they won the league title and 
reached the 3-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when you consider that Covina does not have a starter taller than 
5-8. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real hard for me to assess this team," Coach Stu Sims said. "We don't 
have the good size, but we've got good quickness." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts return only two starters from last year's 17-7 team but both were 
all-league selections: point guard Mindy Marasco (5-4), an excellent outside 
shooter, and forward Nicole Costigan (5-8). 
</P>
<P>
Covina also returns top reserves in forward Janice Peterson (5-7) and swing man 
Melanie Mount (5-7). The Colts will also benefit from the addition of swing man 
Cindy Cagle (5-7) and guard Jennifer Smith (5-4) from a fine junior varsity 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident but I'm not overconfident," Sims says. "I feel we can stay with 
most teams that we play." 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Walnut (Valle Vista League; 4-AA) -- When he became coach of the Mustangs 
after last season, Kelly Bruce figured he would have to rely mostly on 
all-valley forward Tristin Alfred to carry the offensive burden. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Alfred, it appears she will have a helping hand or two. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have more players than just Tristin who can produce for us," said 
Bruce, an assistant for the Walnut boys the last two seasons. "I really feel 
that we have an interchangeable team. We can go with a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Alfred, a 5-11 senior who averaged 18.2 points and 14.1 rebounds last 
season, will not be a central element in the team's success. "I think she's a 
better player than she was last year," Bruce said. "She does a lot of things 
well." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, who finished 10-14 last season and reached the 4-A playoffs, have 
two other all-league players in senior forward Shelli Calagna (5-8) and 
sophomore guard Davette Williams (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
Another top player returning is swing man Mia McBride, a 5-9 sophomore. The 
Mustangs have talent up from their junior varsity squad in sophomore point 
guard Michelle Daddona (5-4) and senior forward Tonya Lozano (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
10 -- St. Lucy's (Baseline League; 2-A) -- On the surface, this may seem like a 
rebuilding year for the Regents. 
</P>
<P>
There are only four seniors and no starters from a team that finished 19-9 and 
reached the 3-A quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion Brea-Olinda. 
But appearances can sometimes be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very young but from day one of practice to now we've improved a great 
deal," Coach David Confair said. "Once they get a lot more playing time, they 
should get a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
"There's plenty of talent in there. The only thing is the kids need to see it 
in themselves." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the Regents will probably rely on seniors Stacey Bateman 
(5-10) at center and seniors Amy Kohls (5-4), Kathy Loyd (5-5) and Marcy 
Alvarez (5-5) at guard. But Confair will also turn to younger players such as 
juniors Jennifer Robledo (5-9) and Kelly Schlacter (5-7) and sophomore Nikki 
Baker (5-6), all forwards. 
</P>
<P>
While the team does not have size, Confair said there is quickness and the best 
attitude of any team he has coached.

FOR A FEE, NEW SERVICE WILL DELIVER THE VERY WORST IN BEST REVENGE

If you don't mind hurting your purse in order to hurt the person, for $180 plus 
tax you can get a satin-lined mock coffin with the message: "Wish you were 
here." 
</P>
<P>
But if you want to play it cheap, you can have a bouquet of dead flowers 
delivered for $25. Or cheaper still, for $20 you can have the person put on the 
mailing lists of 20 religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Pool will do the dirty work for you: gift wrap the stale fish, fill the 
shiny red container with a cow chip; stick pins in voodoo dolls. And then he 
will drive with his bull terrier, Peugeot, to deliver these bundles of 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to have fun with an ugly situation and a fun way to be mad about 
something," said Pool, 29, who started Revenge a la Carte about two months ago 
after quitting his job as a flight attendant for Continental Airlines. 
Referring to the airline's hard-nosed boss, he said: "I jokingly say that, 
after working for Frank Lorenzo for six years, this business came naturally to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Working out of his West Los Angeles home, he says he receives an average of 
five calls a day from disgruntled employees, angry co-workers, jilted lovers or 
people who just want to play a joke on unsuspecting friends. Most of the 
callers are in their mid-20s to late 40s, although Pool says he once received 
an order from a woman who "wanted me to know for sure that she was 86 years 
old." 
</P>
<P>
About half of his business comes from people who want to get back at their 
former lovers, Pool said. Customers frustrated about something or someone at 
work are also very common. 
</P>
<P>
He recounts the case of a young woman who used his services to make her 
displeasure known to a co-worker. She had heard through the office grapevine 
that "a man had bet his friend that he would have her in bed within 30 days." 
She asked Pool to deliver a box of overripe fish to the man with a card saying 
"No way." 
</P>
<P>
"Live embarrassments" are another service offered on Pool's "menu of just 
deserts." These are priced according to the situation. According to the menu, 
Pool will retain "starving actors" to provide "public humiliation made to 
order." 
</P>
<P>
Pool recalls, for example, a man who wanted to play a practical joke at a 
friend's wedding. Pool hired an actress to show up at the wedding portraying 
the groom's pregnant ex-girlfriend. In a rumpled maternity dress and with tears 
streaming down her cheeks, the actress told the groom: "I can't believe what 
you have done to me. You didn't even invite me." 
</P>
<P>
The flabbergasted groom tried his best to persuade his upset bride that he had 
no idea what was happening. It was only when the groom's so-called girlfriend 
laughed that the tension was defused. The actress was invited to stay for the 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
Not all jobs turn out to be plain, lighthearted fun, Pool concedes. "If the 
going gets serious, I leave. It's a situation between two people, and I don't 
want to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
He sees himself merely as someone who "helps people relieve stress." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, people may be a bit too timid," he said. "After you express 
your feelings, it's always much better." 
</P>
<P>
Pool, who moved to Los Angeles from Denver a year ago, finds Southern 
California ideal for such a business. "People here are more accepting of a new 
idea. Also, they will do practically anything to have fun after the day's 
traffic, smog and the office." 
</P>
<P>
The very nature of his service has made Pool wary of lawsuits. "I can't arrange 
for . . . services like pies in the face. I have to protect myself." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he says, he has his own standards of dignity and taste to maintain. 
"Someone asked me the other day if I could send body parts to somebody. It was 
so shocking to hear that. I wouldn't send something that would offend me." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pool says he knows of no competitors in Los Angeles, he said there are 
similar services in Boston and Denver. In any event, Revenge a la Carte is 
unusual enough to have drawn attention from, among other places, Australian 
television and the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Pool hopes that one day he is "able to have a storefront in a foot-traffic area 
so that people may enter the shop and see what it has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
A new addition to his list of services is the "Surgeon General's Warning." This 
is a bottle full of cigarette ashes and butts that "can be delivered by a 
smoker to one who is against smoking or by a non-smoker to one who fouls the 
workplace." 
</P>
<P>
New ideas flow in every day, particularly from friends. "The business keeps 
getting bigger," Pool said, and the schedule tighter. 
</P>
<P>
And Pool is confident that his niche is secure. 
</P>
<P>
"Till the end of time," he said, "somebody will be mad at something or 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Revenge a la Carte is at 3634 Tuller Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 398-0028.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 272 to 128, the House approved a deficit reduction bill that puts 
the fiscal 1990 federal budget in compliance with Gramm-Rudman limits on annual 
indebtedness. The Senate then approved the measure by voice vote, and President 
Bush signed it into law. 
</P>
<P>
The "reconciliation" bill (HR 3299) would reduce red ink for the year that 
began Oct. 1 by at least $14.6 billion, lowering the deficit to the 
$110-billion level required by the Gramm-Rudman law. Legislated spending cuts 
would account for about $6.6 billion of the reduction and new taxes about $2.9 
billion. Forced across-the-board cuts, in effect until February under 
"sequestration" provisions, would reduce the year's deficit by $4.6 billion, 
and lower Treasury borrowing costs resulting from the bill would save $629 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Along with cutting the deficit and enacting new taxes in specialized areas of 
the economy, the bill makes several policy changes. For example, it reforms the 
way physicians are reimbursed under Medicare, prohibiting them from charging 
unreasonable fees that ultimately are paid by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure confronts the deficit more squarely than any of the annual 
reconciliation bills passed previously this decade. Still, it leaves 
entitlement programs virtually untouched, resorts to accounting gimmicks, such 
as moving the $1.8 billion Postal Service deficit and $420 million in Farm 
Credit System bailout costs "off budget," and once again pushes the most 
difficult fiscal and political decisions on taming the deficit into the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the reconciliation bill.

Nevada Wilderness 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 126 to 283, the House rejected an amendment to reduce by 40% the 
proposed Nevada wilderness area. Congress later sent to President Bush a bill 
(S 974) designating 733,000 unspoiled acres in the state as federal wilderness 
to be protected by law against logging, mining and other degrading commercial 
and recreational uses. All of the land is owned by the National Forest Service. 
This amendment sought to reduce the Nevada wilderness area from 733,000 to the 
412,000 acres recommended by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yuetter, who 
oversees the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush signs the bill, Nevada will become the 50th state to have U.S. 
wilderness areas under terms of the 1964 Wilderness Act. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to reduce Nevada wilderness areas by 40%.

Dial-a-Porn 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 98 to 306, the House refused to remove "dial-a-porn" language from 
the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill for the departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education (HR 3566). This preserved Senate language to 
outlaw or curb services that provide sexually explicit telephone commentary to 
callers. A 1989 Supreme Court decision struck down an existing "dial-a-porn" 
law as an infringement on free speech. The new language was signed into law by 
President Bush as part of HR 3566. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to remove dial-a-porn language from the pending 
appropriations bill.

MAN FINDS SON AND LOST LOVE AFTER 27 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Federal Express letter from Temple City last month changed Adolph A. 
Szameit's life. 
</P>
<P>
Szameit, 59, a retiree living alone in Pensacola, Fla., had long ago given up 
hope of finding his lost love, Betty Benson Szameit, and their son, Randy. He 
last saw them in Seattle 27 years ago, when Randy was 2. 
</P>
<P>
But the letter, from Randy Szameit's wife, Alison, changed all that. In less 
than a week, Adolph Szameit has been transformed from a bachelor to a father 
and grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
Szameit was planning to marry Randy's mother before going back to Florida, 
packing his belongings and returning to join her in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to leave without us being a family again, even a short time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The family members separated years ago because of circumstances beyond their 
control, Adolph Szameit said, adding that to say more might hurt other people 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, Szameit, a manager for a high-technology firm with worldwide 
offices, searched in vain for his son, even asking the company's branches to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
But he ran into dead end after dead end. 
</P>
<P>
"My big worry was that he may have been hurting and needed me," Adolph Szameit 
said, his voice breaking. "You never stop wondering." 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, Randy Szameit said, he also wondered about his father, who 
he thought had abandoned the family. But he didn't ask his mother for fear of 
upsetting her. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Randy's son, Shaun, was born four years ago that he and his 
wife began thinking more about finding the senior Szameit. 
</P>
<P>
"We were wondering what Shaun's background is," Alison Szameit said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, her mother, Norma Gutierrez -- a genealogy buff looking for her 
own brother, who had been adopted by another family -- joined the search. 
</P>
<P>
Every time they were at the library, Alison Szameit said, she and her mother 
would peruse the out-of-town telephone books. "We'd look to see if there's 
another Szameit." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, with help from Social Security officials, the two found Adolph 
Szameit's address in Pensacola. Alison Szameit immediately sent an overnight 
letter with photographs of herself and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I read the letter and I said, 'This is some kind of hoax,' " Adolph Szameit 
said. "I thought it's some kind of scam to take advantage of retired people. I 
came this close to throwing it in the trash." 
</P>
<P>
But the letter mentioned Randy Szameit's half-sister, now living in 
Pennsylvania, and Adolph Szameit decided that it might be for real. He 
double-checked by calling directory assistance in Temple City and discovered 
that there was indeed a resident named Randy Szameit. 
</P>
<P>
After a few tearful telephone calls, Adolph Szameit decided to head West. 
Although usually a private person, he said, he couldn't help telling everyone, 
from the travel agent to fellow passengers and the airline crew on his flight 
to Los Angeles, that he had found his son. 
</P>
<P>
"The stewardesses were crying," Szameit said. And so did the Pensacola travel 
agents, who made special arrangements to get him economy seats in less than 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so into the whole reunion," said Patrice Adams of Today's Travel in 
Pensacola. Her entire office "just got kind of all choked up." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in a joyous and tearful reunion at Los Angeles International 
Airport, Adolph Szameit hugged and kissed his family. He cradled his son's and 
grandson's faces, gazing at them in half disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, God," he said, "I'm so glad to see you."

RIO HONDO SEEKS PROBE OF 'HIT' LETTER AGAINST SOLIS

<P>
Rio Hondo College officials have asked five government agencies to help them 
find out who sent a bogus "hit" letter, typed on college stationery, to 
district voters just days before the Nov. 7 trustees election. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, written by a group claiming to be the "staff committee for ethical 
elections," sharply criticized board President Hilda Solis, who was up for 
reelection against candidates David Flores and Elizabeth Van Note. Solis won 
with 45.7% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said: "We the faculty of Rio Hondo are concerned about ethical 
practices being conducted as a part of the election of your representative to 
the Board of Trustees." The letter went on to accuse Solis of living outside 
the district, associating with an accused child molester and supporting college 
liberals who want a large pay raise for the faculty. Solis says the allegations 
are false and defamatory. 
</P>
<P>
College officials say they are upset because the letter was written on college 
stationery by a group that does not exist, and falsely gave the impression that 
it was official college business. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wood, vice president of administrative affairs, said the college has asked 
the state attorney general's office, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission, the U.S. Postal Service fraud 
division and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to help 
investigate. College officials say they have few leads.

JAY DAULEY, SWAP MEET FOUNDER, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Dauley, founder of the La Mirada Drive-In Theater Swap Meet and a number of 
other flea markets, died of heart failure Nov. 21 at his home in San Antonio, 
Tex. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Fort Worth, Dauley moved his wife and six children to California in the 
mid-1950s. He worked at odd jobs and as an electrician for several years before 
launching his first swap meet in Modesto. Within five years, he had a string of 
flea market operations from San Francisco to Los Angeles and in Texas, 
Oklahoma, Louisiana, Florida and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to La Mirada in 1964, the year he opened that swap meet, which grew to 
attract more than 20,000 buyers and became the largest weekend swap meet in 
Southern California. An article in The Wall Street Journal about that time 
named Dauley the "King of the Flea Markets." 
</P>
<P>
His Swap-O-Rama empire began to decline in the 1980s, however, when some of his 
investments failed, most notably an air show in Arizona. In 1985, he moved to 
San Antonio where he turned the Mission Open Air Market into the largest flea 
market in South Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Dauley is survived by his wife Joanne, four sons, a daughter, two brothers, 14 
grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren.

BLIND 14-YEAR-OLD GOES TO MAT WITH HANDICAP; 
</P>
<P>
WRESTLING: SINCE LOSING HIS EYESIGHT, JOEL RAMOS HAS BEEN BATTLING THE ODDS AS 
HE TRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joel Ramos, who at 14 has had to adjust suddenly to being blind, is preoccupied 
almost completely with wrestling. It makes his world seem not so dark. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I feel the best, when I'm wrestling," said Ramos, a student at 
John Glenn High School in Norwalk who fell and suffered a detached retina in 
his left eye 20 months ago. That eye detects only shadows and light. His right 
eye, injured permanently when he was a child, detects nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman's goal, now that he has come out from a period of seclusion, is to 
be a Suburban League junior varsity champion. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Coach Ralph Valle keeps telling him, he has to make the JV team. 
</P>
<P>
Each afternoon, the 155-pound Ramos takes high hopes and courage into the 
school's stuffy wrestling room, which is furnished with only a red mat, a radio 
and a scale. There he is treated the way he wants to be -- like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared stunned after getting dumped last week by 240-pound Steve Rosales, 
on whom he had been attempting an inside half-cradle. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the matter, Joel?" asked Valle, who has a crew cut and a build that 
attests to the fact that he once was a wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos did not answer, so the coach asked Rosales: "Did you hurt my baby?" 
</P>
<P>
"He hurts me more than I hurt him," Rosales said. 
</P>
<P>
As Ramos wrestled, assistant coach Fo Dominguez told him where his opponent's 
arms were. "Joel has good potential," Dominguez said. "He has a sense of 
feeling where the other guy is. Wrestling's all in the heart and mind, and what 
you feel." 
</P>
<P>
Practice was grueling. Ramos, his face sweaty, ran laps around the room, 
holding onto a teammate's shoulder. Skipping came next; Ramos tried, but the 
other wrestlers yelled, "Come on, Joel, do it right." 
</P>
<P>
When displeased with his team, Valle orders push-ups. Ramos cannot always keep 
up with the pace. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you waiting for, Joel?" Valle said. "Want me to ask you personally? 
Please do a push-up, Joel." 
</P>
<P>
The coach rides the other wrestlers in much the same way, which makes Ramos 
feel that he is one of them. But there are melancholy moments, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you see this?" Valle asked the team while demonstrating a move. While his 
teammates gathered around Valle, all Ramos could do was recline on his elbows 
alone at the edge of the mat. 
</P>
<P>
While Ramos wants to be on the JV team, Valle said, "I don't know how realistic 
that is. We're loaded." The Eagles won the league varsity and JV titles last 
year, and almost all of those wrestlers have returned. If Ramos does not make 
the JV team, he can still compete in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Valle does not sugarcoat his evaluation of Ramos: "He's a pretty tough kid when 
he stops feeling sorry for himself. He's got talent. He's naturally strong and 
is stubborn as hell -- that's a good thing to be when you're wrestling because 
you don't want to quit. He still lacks the confidence to be successful in a 
match, but he's a freshman. He tends to be lazy sometimes. He will have to work 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who had poor vision since birth, lost the sight in his right eye when he 
fell and struck it on a table when he was 5. He is not sure what caused the 
detachment in his left eye, but believes it happened when he fell on his head 
while playing football in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward he began to see spots. "I ignored it at first, then I started 
losing vision and I told my parents about it," Ramos said. "Then the doctor 
told me and I got scared." 
</P>
<P>
The retina was too badly torn to be repaired, although three operations were 
attempted. "He had hereditary retinal degeneration," said Edgar Thomas, an 
ophthalmologist with Retina Vitreous Associates in Los Angeles. "Trauma may or 
may not have caused (the detachment)." 
</P>
<P>
Atop the living-room TV in the Ramos home near Norwalk Boulevard is a photo of 
Joel taken two years ago. In it he wears glasses as thick as the ones his 
father, Jose Jesus Ramos, now wears. Jose Ramos, a former truck driver, is 
blind in one eye and even with his glasses must use a magnifying glass to read 
out of the other one. 
</P>
<P>
Jose sat on a couch on a recent afternoon while his wife, Leticia, lay on a 
matching one, nursing a head bump she suffered when her car hit a fence while 
she was learning to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Hard times? You can say that again," Jose said. "We just look ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Ramos said Joel suffered a lot when he first lost his sight. "He didn't 
want to see nobody, just wanted to stay in his room," he said. "Now everything 
is a challenge. He's learning Braille. He's been more social with us and his 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
The Ramoses worry about their son's wrestling, although Thomas said the worst 
the wrestler could suffer would be a sore eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to encourage it," Jose Ramos said. "He always liked football. We 
were afraid of his playing in the street so we converted a small place to play 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
He walked out to the back yard and looked at the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
"He and his friends would play," he said, "but now, no more." 
</P>
<P>
At the recent wrestling practice, Ramos said he still feels sorry for himself. 
"I think about it and get depressed," he said. "I miss a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Among them are reading the Sunday comics and looking at girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Do they have Playboy in Braille?" Ramos was asked by Rosales, his mat partner. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
"The pictures and everything?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Ramos said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this fall, Ramos ran on the Glenn cross-country team. Holding onto a 
teammate, he did fine, although the downhill courses were scary and often 
caused him to fall. Jerry Stein, the cross-country coach, said that Ramos first 
ran three miles in 45 minutes but later improved to 36 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that it was boredom rather than a sudden emboldenment that made him 
decide to come out of his room. He chose wrestling, he said, because it is the 
only thing he doesn't need help with, and it is satisfying. "I can be having 
the worst day, but if I pin somebody it makes me feel good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he has found that there are other things that must be mastered besides 
cradles, takedowns and half-nelsons. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a week he is driven to a residential neighborhood in Norwalk, where 
Suzanne Hassall, an orientation and mobility specialist, and student teacher 
Gina Anderson teach him how to cross a street. 
</P>
<P>
"At first he wouldn't walk outdoors or when other kids are around," Hassall 
said as she watched Ramos walk down a sidewalk with his cane. "He's doing real 
well this year. He has terrific orientation, he can always tell you where he 
is." 
</P>
<P>
At 8 on a recent morning Ramos was in Pola Lawson's special education 
classroom, practicing on a machine that types in Braille. He sat in the corner 
of a room, facing students in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an intelligent young man," Lawson said. "We're trying to get him in the 
mainstream."

MOTHERS' HELPERS FOR THE '90S; 
</P>
<P>
LIFE STYLES: ENTREPRENEURS ARE OFFERING SERVICES DESIGNED TO RELIEVE 
STRESSED-OUT MOTHERS. EVERYTHING FROM BEEPERS TO BABY-PROOFING TO IN-HOME 
MASSAGES IS AVAILABLE.

You're nine months pregnant, and your home resembles the aftermath of the Exxon 
Valdez spill at Prince William Sound. Carrie needs a diaper change, just when 
you've run out of your favorite disposable brand, and Stephan has just dumped 
the ant farm down the toilet. And he's not even your kid. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, reach for some mom savers -- those indispensable, time-liberating 
convenience services that no 1990s mother should be without. 
</P>
<P>
A new host of entrepreneurs are taking aim at today's overwhelmed, 
time-desperate mother. The services, which seldom target fathers, offer 
everything from massages and private fitness sessions to home-safety 
installations, shopping services and toll numbers doling out instant parenting 
advice and bedtime stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Convenience services have really escalated in the past two years," said Harry 
Jigamian, associate publisher and advertising director of L.A. Parent magazine. 
"There's been a real increase of ads in that department. No one has time to go 
out and shop. Mothers want more time to spend with their child and an 
opportunity to just get away from the stress and strain of being a mother." 
</P>
<P>
In the future, mothers will be able to flick on home appliances from the 
office, according to a 52-page report titled "Women in the 1990s," recently 
issued by Family Circle magazine. And no longer will "spotless" be the supposed 
norm for home cleanliness; "reasonable neatness" will be the replacement, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Pagers, typically reserved for busy executives, will be considered a mother's 
new electronic apron strings, especially since 60% of American women will work 
outside the home by 1995, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom can now be beeped by any kid, anywhere," said Robert Goldstein, founder of 
Page-A Parent, which began six months ago as an offshoot of his Westlake 
Village telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 customers have signed up for Goldstein's service, which charges from 
$14 to $18 a month, depending on added paging features. 
</P>
<P>
"People who travel also use the service to keep in touch with their child," 
Goldstein said, adding that most use the pagers for potential emergency 
situations. "But I just use it to keep track of my wife," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Schiffman uses a beeper to track down her 10-year-old daughter, Risa, 
who acts in TV movies and commercials. Risa keeps her mother informed of her 
whereabouts through the beeper, should agents or casting directors need an 
on-the-spot audition. "Beepers are commonly used among show-biz mothers," said 
Schiffman, 39, who lives in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women experiencing their first labor pains now can beep their husbands 
by using Daddy Beepers, a service begun six months ago at the Medical Center of 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Mothers use it during the last month of pregnancy at no charge," said Sherry 
Reese, vice president of marketing at the hospital. "The convenience lies in 
the security -- knowing that you will have access to the most important person 
in the world when you go into labor." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital also presents a free "celebration meal," with champagne, lobster 
and candles, for mothers and a chosen guest, just before leaving the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
For $25, the medical center offers a limousine to pick up dad and the children 
at home, bring them to the hospital and drive the new family back home. "It's 
very comfortable for mom and the new baby," Reese said of the discounted 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that most youngsters get into most things, home-safety specialists 
have a remedy. Two rival companies, the Family Safety Center in Studio City -- 
begun in 1987 -- and Mr. Baby Proofer in North Hollywood -- begun in 1985 -- 
will install door and cabinet latches, stairway gates, banister guards and 
toilet locks, among other items. Prices range from $50, to install basic safety 
devices in apartments, to $5,000 for complete baby-proofing million-dollar 
mansions. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, mothers will call me and say their husband has tried to put on a 
couple of latches, and then he's got totally frustrated and quit," said Mr. 
Baby Proofer (and owner) Danny McNeill, 29, who once worked as a children's 
furniture salesman at the Juvenile Shop in Sherman Oaks with Keith Noren, owner 
of the Family Safety Center. 
</P>
<P>
Noren, 39, who operates a retail home-safety shop as part of his installation 
business, said: "The service really cuts down on your fear level. It gives you 
the edge during the times you can't adequately supervise your child." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tobey Cotsen has never touched a soiled diaper in her 31 years, her 
Los Angeles company, Bundle of Convenience, delivers an assortment of diapers, 
formulas, food, ointments and other baby needs. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends would run out of diapers at midnight and say they couldn't go to a 
convenience store to buy such-and-such a brand because little Robbie only wears 
Huggies Supertrim 3," Cotsen said. "So I thought, why not a delivery service?" 
</P>
<P>
Cotsen's 200 customers receive deliveries every two weeks that average $65 -- 
about 15% above grocery store prices. The service, begun in 1987, also will 
ship bundles in advance to traveling parents. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Gianopulos began using Bundle of Convenience six months ago when her 
daughter, Mimi, was born. "All of a sudden you find you're out of diapers, and 
it's pretty scary," said Gianopulos, 36, who lives in Studio City. "When you're 
a new mom, life is so unpredictable, you can't always get out of the house when 
you need to. It's a real timesaver." 
</P>
<P>
Cotsen said a wide cross-section of working and non-working mothers use her 
service, and most of them would not be considered wealthy. But others find this 
hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
"These services have to be for the more affluent," said Carollee Howes, 
associate professor at UCLA's Graduate School of Education. "Others simply 
don't have enough money to take advantage of it. Most parents with double 
incomes are working out of necessity, and the two incomes buy about the same 
standard of living as one did before." 
</P>
<P>
Other services, like in-home fitness sessions, perhaps do attract those with 
extra cash, such as actress Joan Collins, five-day-a-week customer of Judy 
Greenfeld's Homeaerobics. "There is life after birth," said Greenfeld, who 
specializes in private classes for pregnant women and mothers who have recently 
given birth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard when you've been in shape and then -- boom -- you're a pregnant 
woman," said Greenfeld, 30, who lives in Van Nuys and has 10 clients who pay 
$50 and up for a half an hour session. "I think most pregnant women don't want 
to exercise in clubs because there's a lot of pressure on being thin, even when 
you're pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Greenfeld, a former certified aerobics instructor, began her service in 1983 
after moving from New York. "We do a lot of stretching," she said. "We don't do 
any movements that would raise the mother's heartbeat above 120, because that 
could be dangerous to the baby, especially during the first three months of 
pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
Many local fitness centers now provide child-care facilities, such as the Firm 
in Woodland Hills and Racquetball World in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Moms feel real heavy after having a baby, and many can't afford a baby-sitter 
when they want to go work out," said Shaughn Lynn, manager of the Firm, which 
opened in 1987. Morning hours are busiest in the child-care area, which is 
staffed by eight employees, said Lynn, who added, "We have some single dads who 
use the facilities too." 
</P>
<P>
But what do most mothers, pregnant or otherwise, really want? "A thorough 
lower-back massage," said Kathy Mattes, founder of M'massage, an in-home 
massage service for mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Mattes, who lives in Reseda, started her business in 1987 after receiving 
several massages from instructors who she said were insensitive to the needs of 
a pregnant body. Acupuncture points in the ankles, hands and little toes should 
be avoided, Mattes said, because they may trigger labor in advanced stages of 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Mattes, a certified massage technician, charges her 175 clients $55 for one 
hour of complete body massage. 
</P>
<P>
Randi Grinbaum began receiving massages from Mattes nine months ago, when she 
was six months pregnant. "I had tremendous lower-back pain," said Grinbaum, 30, 
who lives in Hidden Hills. "I went twice a week because the pain was so 
intense, but Kathy was able to release it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really felt wonderful."

TRAVELING MUSEUM ALLOWS STUDENTS TO TOUCH THE PAST; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: RAY GLAZNER TOURS SCHOOLS WITH HIS OWN MUSEUM. HE SAYS STUDENTS 
"REMEMBER WHAT THEY CAN TOUCH." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ray Glazner goes Back to the Past. And he does it with special effects, though 
not the stuff of Steven Spielberg. His props -- beaver skins, moccasins, 
bayonets -- are real-life replicas of another era in American history, when 
revolution had only begun to reach the colonial consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
He is his own museum -- he calls it "Images of the Past," and he takes his 
exhibits to San Fernando Valley-area schools and clubs. Bearded and burly, he 
looks the part of an early settler, primed to capture his prey in the 
wilderness and cook it on a campfire. 
</P>
<P>
But Glazner is actually a retired schoolteacher from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years," said Glazner, 48, of Simi Valley, "I've collected enough 
stuff to do any period in American, or even world, history." 
</P>
<P>
By reading "lifeless" textbooks, Glazner believes, most students don't feel 
connected to the major themes and symbols of American history; they simply 
memorize dates and names. By displaying dozens of artifacts from pre- and 
post-Revolutionary War days, Glazner hopes to make a more lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask them what they read in a history book and they wouldn't be able to tell 
you," Glazner said, "but ask them the details of a movie they saw and they can 
tell you everything. They remember what they can touch." 
</P>
<P>
They touch everything. During a recent presentation at Fairfield School in Van 
Nuys, third-graders were fascinated with Glazner's artifacts, asking dozens of 
questions. On this day, he dressed up as a pre-Revolutionary War merchant, 
wearing breeches, a waistcoat and black boots. When he finished explaining the 
historical significance of the items, about 50 in all, the students filed up to 
the rectangular table and played with the past. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't find things like this around now," said Danielle Judis, 8. "I like 
learning about what happened in the old days." 
</P>
<P>
Glazner experienced the same curiosity when he attended elementary school in 
New Jersey in the early 1950s. He had a teacher who has served as his role 
model. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just returned from Korea," Glazner said, "and he would bring in things 
from the war. He made it so easy to hear and see things. I decided right then 
that this would be how I was going to teach." 
</P>
<P>
Glazner benefited from growing up in a well-to-do family with a passion for 
collecting antiques. Each weekend, his family spent hours at antique shops. His 
parents would check on glass and furniture, but Glazner headed straight for the 
military items. 
</P>
<P>
"A gun was more exciting than a piece of glass," he recalled. "We used to hunt 
all the time, and so guns meant a lot to us." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Glazner has gradually collected pieces of American history wherever 
he could obtain them -- swap meets, antique shops, museums, organized 
historical festivals. Some he keeps for himself, and others he uses in his 
presentations. He's not afraid to make expensive purchases, such as the $1,500 
he spent on a 1783 Pennsylvania rifle, considering them valuable long-term 
investments. He receives $200 a day from schools, although he says at his 
current pace -- about one class a week -- he will only net about $10,000 this 
academic year. 
</P>
<P>
After 25 years as an elementary and junior high school teacher in Bloomsburg, 
N.J., Glazner headed west to California after his wife, Linda, became chairman 
of the occupational health department at UCLA. He began "Images of the Past" in 
June, 1988. He considered returning to full-time teaching, but resented the 
state of California's requirement that teachers must pass math aptitude tests. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be damned if I have to take a class in geometry and trigonometry," 
Glazner said, "when it's stuff I'm not going to use." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he's aiming for a schedule that would take him to about 100 to 150 
schools per year. He says once he's visited a school, "they always ask me 
back," but the hard part is getting there in the first place. On days he's not 
giving his presentation, Glazner is contacting schools, mailing brochures or 
searching for more artifacts. History, he asserts, isn't given its proper 
respect in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids don't even know how to visit a museum," Glazner said. "They get bored 
really quickly. The objects are behind glass, and so they can't touch them. All 
they see are these cards that explain what the objects are, which is just more 
reading for them. They get enough of that at school." 
</P>
<P>
Even when there might be interest, Glazner understands the inherent limitations 
of school districts. "Not every teacher interested in artifacts can afford 
them, and the schools can't pay for them, either." 
</P>
<P>
Glazner has a simple answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Me."

FAMILY LIFE: NEW REALITIES TEST HOLIDAY PERCEPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At some point each Christmas Day, we could count on my mother to gaze out at 
the clear blue skies and 72-degree weather and say, wistfully, "It just doesn't 
seem like Christmas, does it?" 
</P>
<P>
Considering that she was born and raised in Orange County and never spent the 
holidays anywhere other than Southern California, it was an odd comment -- 
almost as if she expected snow and a family sleigh ride. 
</P>
<P>
She was a perfect example, I think, of how we become programmed by movies, 
books, magazines and television. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas is snow, sleigh bells, a roaring fire, family togetherness and all 
our wishes coming true. It's peace and good will, a time when even the Scrooges 
of world have a change of heart, mend their evil ways and join the family of 
man. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's what we've been programmed to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many of us end the holidays on a hollow instead of hallowed note 
because none of the above happened. 
</P>
<P>
Family togetherness is hard to come by now that the nuclear family barely 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
Divorced parents obviously no longer live in a Norman Rockwell world, if they 
ever did, and should take conscious steps to change their expectation levels, 
says marriage and family therapist Karen L. Watson of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Often (they) have a view of a traditional family celebrating a traditional 
American holiday, and in a desperate attempt to make that a reality for 
themselves and their children, they are setting themselves up for a dismal 
holiday," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She maintains that "coming to grips with reality" will open the way for them to 
enjoy "loving, memorable holiday experiences . . . (just) not in the 
traditional manner." Realistic expectations, she says, can be met and often 
give birth to "ingenious and clever plans" that guarantee their fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
After you've accepted reality, it becomes a fairly simple matter of changing 
habits. What, after all, are traditions but habits that have become 
institutionalized? 
</P>
<P>
For instance, while preparing to serve dinner to my 11-year-old and his guest 
this past weekend, my son told him, "Don't sit there; that's my place." Then 
seconds later, "Sorry, not there either; that's my dad's place." 
</P>
<P>
And the friend understood, because it's the same at his house. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure we could all change seats without any permanent damage; it would just 
be uncomfortable the first few times is all. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for the major habits we have. I know that my first Christmas 
after divorce was my most miserable. The kids were at their mother's house and 
I was alone -- just me and a bunch of empty boxes and used wrapping paper. 
</P>
<P>
Before day's end, I erased the fact it was Christmas. I put all the gifts away 
and stripped the tree of lights and ornaments and got it out of the house. I 
even turned down invitations to join friends because I wasn't interested in 
their Christmas, either. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Christmas is again a most pleasurable day for me. Radically different from 
what it was 10 years ago, surely, but a day to which I again look forward. 
</P>
<P>
After the kids and I have finished opening gifts, I'm not ashamed to admit that 
I'm somewhat anxious to get them off to their mother's. 
</P>
<P>
I have my traditional golf match, you see. 
</P>
<P>
Each Christmas for the past four or five years, my regular golf partner and I 
have played one, sometimes two courses. While it's the only day of the year 
that all courses are closed, most leave the flags in the holes so that play is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
And since I've become so adroit at making the kinds of changes Karen Watson 
says we must make, I have my eye on a really big one. 
</P>
<P>
When this holiday is over, I plan for the first time in my life to carefully 
put away the tree lights so that next year I won't have to spend a solitary 
minute untangling them.

SERVICES LET PARENTS CALL OUT FOR CHILD-REARING TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It used to be that moms just phoned their own mothers for sorely needed advice 
on child rearing. Today, they call British child-care authority Penelope Leach. 
</P>
<P>
Leach is one of nine child-rearing experts whose advice can be reached by 
dialing (900) 246-MOMS, a recorded service offered by the National Parenting 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents today are really focused on being the best parents they can be," said 
David Katzner, who recently formed the Woodland Hills-based service. "We're 
sort of geared today to these one-minute bites." 
</P>
<P>
Callers are asked to select an age group from a menu, which then cues them into 
an additional menu that lists tips on such subjects as thumb sucking, book 
recommendations and ear infections. Katzner, a producer for CBS news, said the 
nationwide service receives several hundred calls a day. 
</P>
<P>
Parents also may leave specific questions after a tape's conclusion, which will 
be answered in writing by one of the experts at no extra charge. The cost per 
call is $1.95 for the first minute and 95 cents for each additional minute. 
Tape transcripts are offered through the service's monthly newsletter, which 
contains additional parenting tips for an annual fee of $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
The Parent Connection, a similar service, was begun two years ago by Jayne 
Major, who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy and education from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that parents who are in the middle of stressful situations often need 
some quick advice," said Major, who receives about 1,000 calls a month at the 
number (900) 976-4MOM. 
</P>
<P>
Callers, who are charged 90 cents per call, also may choose from a list of 
advice on specific areas such as temper tantrums, how to avoid spanking, and 
understanding children's thinking. A scenario is played out on the taped 
message (for example, a daughter who endures a spanking because she used mom's 
makeup), and advice is given on how to handle the situation in alternate ways. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank-based L.A. Parent magazine recently started an information line, (818) 
842-KIDS, which lists events geared toward parents and children. "Parents can 
also leave a message if they need help in getting a referral to pediatricians 
or any other concern," said Harry Jigamian, the magazine's associate producer. 
"We'll call them back."

Too tired to tell your child a bedtime story? The solution may be to call (900) 
MINI-MOM. "We have the best stories for just 80 cents a minute," announces a 
recording of a child's voice. "But you need your parents' permission." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Stipek, professor of child development and education at UCLA, advises 
parents to keep calls to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that substitutes the parental role is of dubious value, to me," 
Stipek said. "A child benefits from shared, personal contact when being read 
to. It's difficult to receive that from a phone earpiece."

ASK THE VET: LEUKEMIA VACCINATION WISE FOR INDOOR CAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn.

Q: is it necessary to have my indoor cat vaccinated for leukemia? She never 
goes outside, and she is the only cat that I have. I worry that she might get 
sick from the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Hardesty, Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: Since the feline leukemia virus is a common disease-causing agent among 
cats, I would highly recommend having your cat vaccinated. Although the disease 
is spread by direct contact with other cats, it would be worth the peace of 
mind to have your cat protected. It may be necessary to board your cat in the 
future, or an injury or illness might cause your cat to become more susceptible 
if she is ever hospitalized. There is an occasional post-vaccination fever, but 
it is of short duration. I would also recommend that you have your cat tested 
prior to vaccination to determine that she is negative for the FeLV virus.

Q: Mike is an 8-year-old boxer who bleeds anally when he expels waste. He has 
been under treatment by three veterinarians for that symptom and for colitis. 
During the treatment, it was learned that he is allergic to soy and milk 
products. The colitis has been brought under control through diet, but the 
bleeding continues to be uncontrolled. His present vet states that an organism 
called Giardia is causing the problem. That organism is found in water. 
Medication prescribed for Mike seems to offer no solution. I'm hoping that you 
can provide a solution to this problem. 
</P>
<P>
George Saturensky, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
A: Bleeding from the colon can be a sign of many disorders, one of which could 
be an infection from Giardia, which is the genus name for a protozoan organism. 
A Giardia condition is often difficult to diagnose, as it requires that 
multiple fecal smears be examined. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to note that Giardia can also afflict human beings, so great 
care should be taken when removing contaminated feces from the yard. Giardia 
can be treated with antibiotics such as penicillin G. 
</P>
<P>
Other causes of colon or rectal bleeding can be ulcers, tumors or mucosal 
injury. Since the colitis has been determined to be from an allergy and is 
being controlled by diet, other tests will be necessary to help find the source 
of the bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
The most direct method is to use an endoscope to examine the entire colon. 
Since the surface of the colon is usually smooth and even in color, it will be 
easy to find tumor masses or ulcers. Should anything suspicious be seen in the 
scope, several biopsies should be taken and sent to a pathologist for a 
diagnosis. A barium enema is an alternative, but it may be less useful in 
coming up with a diagnosis. Exploratory surgery to examine the colon is another 
possibility, but small defects in the inside lining can be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Chronic colitis often includes some bleeding, and it can be very difficult to 
treat. It often requires lifelong medication and a controlled diet. 
Unfortunately, not all cases respond well to medication.

Angelenos have developed thick skins, dating back to earlier this century when 
writeL. Mencken dismissed L.A. as "Moronia." They're used to hearing gibes from 
New Yorkers (current and ex) as well as San Franciscans. 
</P>
<P>
But there's got to be a limit. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the members of a homeowners association in another California city are 
filing suit over water quality problems and runaway growth because, they say, 
they don't want to "live in a little Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The snobbish homeowners group resides in . . . Fresno.

You can't help thinking that the 1950s were a simpler time when you compare a 
roadside Burma Shave jingle from that era with a sort of updated version that

A typical Burma Shave ditty, spread along six signs, would proclaim:

The sight of USC's horse, Traveler, galloping around the Coliseum is 
unquestionably impressive. But lately there's been a resurgence of interest in 
the Trojans' original mascot, a scraggly mutt named George Tirebiter, legendary 
chaser of whitewalls. 
</P>
<P>
Though the curbside setter has been dead since 1950 -- he didn't live to see 
the advent of radials -- "George Tirebiter" T-shirts were big items at USC 
games this year. A photo of him recently ran in a fraternity newspaper. And his 
picture hangs alongside those of Trojan football greats in the USC hangout, 
Julie's. 
</P>
<P>
Tirebiter's origins are murky, but he first strolled onto campus in 1941. He 
became a national figure in 1947 when he disappeared, prompting a search of 
UCLA. One day George casually returned, apparently of his own accord. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the aging Tirebiter began nipping at moving people, too. One writer 
suggested that his strange behavior was "a shot reaction from all the 
hydrophobia tests the health department gave him each time he bit a UCLA 
rooter." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, he was placed under house arrest at an El Centro ranch in 1950. A few 
months later, apparently while trying to sink his teeth into one last tire, he 
was run over by an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Hays, a USC grad, was so moved by nostalgia that he sent us his copy of 
the Sept. 20, 1950, Daily Trojan that reported the tragedy in giant headlines. 
</P>
<P>
"Gone to heaven," the newspaper eulogized Tirebiter, "where he will have 
cushion rides for breakfast, white sidewalls for lunch, and cold rubber recaps 
for dinner."

About 40 people, including religious leaders and political activists, were

About 200 placard-carrying demonstrators rallied outside the Temple Street 
entrance to the building, while a group that included actor Martin Sheen, 
Father Luis Olivares and several other local Catholic priests and nuns linked 
arms in front of the doors and refused orders to move aside.

When the demonstrators refused to yield, officers in riot helmets led them away

The purchase of 145 acres of pristine woodlands west of Santa Clarita for a new

the area -- was announced Wednesday by an environmental group and state Sen. Ed 
Davis (R-Valencia).

Davis said the new Towsley Canyon Park, which was immediately opened to the

<P>
The purchase of 145 acres of pristine woodlands west of Santa Clarita for a new 
park -- a move that could block or at least hinder plans by county sanitation 
officials to open a garbage dump in the area -- was announced Wednesday by 
state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) and an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the new Towsley Canyon Park, which was immediately opened to the 
public, was the first step toward creating the proposed 6,000-acre Santa 
Clarita Woodlands State Park west of Santa Clarita and north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, said the 145 acres is at the mouth of Towsley Canyon, a unique 
area filled with waterfalls and groves of big-pine spruce. The parcel surrounds 
land that the conservancy hopes to buy someday for the proposed woodlands state 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The woodlands are the home of a wide variety of wildlife, such as deer, 
mountain lions and even an occasional bear. "This is the best of the best," 
said Laurene Weste, a Santa Clarita parks commissioner and environmentalist, in 
describing the property. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase is considered a victory for the conservancy, which has been 
competing with the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts to buy land in and 
around Towsley Canyon. The sanitation districts have obtained options to buy 
760 acres southwest of the new Towsley Canyon Park, but not contiguous with it. 
</P>
<P>
The park's grant deed will not allow industrial traffic, including dump trucks, 
along a road that leads to the property under option by the sanitation 
districts, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent memo, sanitation district engineers called the property "the only 
feasible access way from the Golden State Freeway to the potential landfill 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said the conservancy sought the Towsley property not to block the 
dump, but to create a park. But Davis said the purchase makes it easier to 
defeat plans to open a 235-million-ton landfill in Towsley Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll have to resort to force of arms" to fight the dump, Davis 
said. "We did it legally." 
</P>
<P>
Davis blasted sanitation officials for considering Towsley for a dump at all. 
"Imagine dumping putrid waste into an area like that," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Tidemanson, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public 
Works, said he was unaware of the purchase and said it was too soon to comment 
on its potential impact on the proposed landfill. The public works department 
is working with the sanitation districts to find new dump sites to ease the 
county's mounting garbage problems. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Edmiston said, the deed restrictions limiting traffic through the 
park would make it difficult for developers to build projects, such as 
condominiums, in other parts of the proposed woodlands state park. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said the conservancy is negotiating with other property owners in the 
area, including the federal Bureau of Land Management, which owns 1,200 acres 
in and around Towsley Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The county sanitation districts are negotiating with property owners throughout 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The 145-acre parcel was purchased from the Rivendale Ranch Co. for $500,000 by 
the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, a joint agency comprised 
of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the Conejo Recreation and Park 
District and the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
The authority later will be reimbursed the $500,000 with state funds provided 
by recent legislation written by Davis and signed by Gov. George Deukmejian.

REDONDO BEACH LETS PLAN FOR TRANSIENTS DIE A QUIET DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: THE CITY COUNCIL DECLINES TO VOTE ON CHURCH'S PROPOSAL TO SET UP AID 
STATION IN CITY PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Invite the homeless to Redondo Beach? Feed and clothe them in a city park? For 
free? 
</P>
<P>
"We might as well have Hanoi Jane and Martin Sheen just bus 'em on in from 
downtown L.A.," City Councilman Terry Ward privately scoffed when the idea 
first emerged two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But when the request -- made by a church and blessed by the city's 
fundamentalist Christian mayor -- came to a hearing Tuesday night, it was with 
a kinder, gentler attitude that council members turned it away. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy discussion, they simply declined to bring it up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the city of Redondo Beach acts with malice," explained 
Councilman StevanColin, whose district includes the park where Hope 
Chapel-Redondo Beach wanted to set up a temporary aid station for transients. 
</P>
<P>
When constituents phoned City Hall to offer their opinion, Colin said, "almost 
every caller (opposing the idea) started out by saying, 'I don't want you to 
misunderstand me -- it's not that I don't want to help the homeless. It's just 
that I don't think we should do it in a city park.' " 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a request from Hope Chapel's Haven of Hope Ministry to set up a 
45-day food and clothing distribution program in Dominguez Park, in central 
Redondo Beach. The 17-acre park is the home of the South Redondo Little League. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which would be run out of a church-owned trailer, would also draw 
transients for a head-count that would help gauge the extent of homelessness in 
the affluent beach cities of the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Bill Gross said public land was needed because the church itself is 
homeless: Hope Chapel-Redondo Beach is so new that it has no church property 
and holds Sunday services in a high school cafeteria. He added, however, that 
part of the reason his church came to the city was that homelessness "is not 
just a church problem." 
</P>
<P>
The request -- which put yet another suburban community on the spot in dealing 
with Los Angeles County's reputation as the nation's homeless capital -- 
prompted a flood of emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Ward, compared the reaction to the furor that erupted earlier this 
year when Malibu's honorary mayor, actor Martin Sheen, declared that exclusive 
seaside enclave a sanctuary for the disenfranchised. Other council members 
expressed fears that such involvement could create the sort of tensions that 
have arisen recently in Santa Monica, where liberal policies toward the 
homeless have placed a strain on social services and spawned political 
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Local advocates for the homeless mentally ill backed the idea, claiming that 
the beach cities are lacking in services for the disenfranchised, even though 
local outreach workers report there are at least half a dozen homeless people 
in every Redondo Beach park. 
</P>
<P>
But park officials argued that the plan would draw transients to a city where 
street people are seldom seen, and several members of the clergy expressed 
concern that it would duplicate free lunch programs already being offered in 
Redondo Beach by local churches and the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living around the park also complained that the program would make it 
impossible for their children to play safely there. 
</P>
<P>
The sole backer on the council was Mayor Brad Parton, a frequent Hope Chapel 
congregant. 
</P>
<P>
"If this isn't something our city can jump on . . . then our idea of government 
is pretty mixed up," Parton told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But the request did not come to a vote. Instead, the council asked that Hope 
Chapel be added to the city's referral list of local social service agencies.

BURBANK WEIGHS $100,000 SCHOOL SECURITY SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank Board of Education, in a continuing effort to address increased 
violence on school campuses, is expected tonight to approve spending more than 
$100,000 for emergency communication systems at each of the city's two high 
schools and one elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the five board members said Wednesday they will vote to install the 
security systems. Two board members could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like a good idea to me," board member William Abbey said. "I think 
it's consistent with the board's response to the needs and feelings of teachers 
at the two high schools regarding campus security issues." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Vivian Kaufman agreed: "I certainly hope that this will make 
the teachers feel more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The plans call for the installation of nine emergency telephones at Burbank and 
John Burroughs high schools and one at Bret Harte Elementary School, said 
Richard Tighe, assistant superintendent for business. An electronic beeper 
system also would be installed at John Burroughs High School, Tighe said. 
</P>
<P>
All 47 Burroughs teachers will be equipped with wireless beepers that, when 
activated, would trigger an alarm indicating the location of a disturbance on a 
light panel in the school's administrative office, Tighe said. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the phones and beeper system are expected to be in place by early 
January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed communication systems are part of the district's recent efforts to 
improve security on school campuses, where, according to state statistics, 
violence has increased sharply over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the board approved plans to hire an additional security 
aide for each of Burbank's two high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about increased violence at Burbank schools escalated Oct. 20, when 
teachers at John Burroughs High School staged a one-day strike to protest the 
board's decision not to expel a student accused of hitting a teacher and 
threatening to kill him and another instructor. 
</P>
<P>
The board has refused to comment on the incident, in which a 16-year-old 
Burroughs student was charged with one felony count of threatening a public 
official and two misdemeanor counts of battery. A trial is scheduled to begin 
today in Pasadena Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Harte officials requested that an emergency phone be installed in the 
school's hallway after a former custodian assaulted a teacher on that campus 
last month, Tighe said.

JUDGE SIDES WITH CITY AGAINST FEISTY HOLLYWOOD COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge sided Wednesday with the city of Los Angeles in a 
dispute with a scrappy citizens advisory committee on Hollywood redevelopment 
that has refused to disband, despite a City Council decision to abolish it. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kurt J. Lewin rejected claims by the group, known as the Project Area 
Committee, that the council's action violated state law as well as the 
Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, a broad blueprint for renewal in central 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was a victory for Hollywood-area Councilman Michael Woo, a strong 
supporter of the redevelopment project. Woo had asked the council to dissolve 
the committee last May because it had become a forum for "wacky behavior" bent 
on undermining the renewal effort. 
</P>
<P>
Woo described the ruling as "exhilarating." He said he wanted to "send out a 
peace message" to committee members and invite them to cooperate with the 
advisory panel he appointed in August. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up in December, 1983, to help the Community Redevelopment 
Agency prepare a redevelopment plan for 1,100 acres of central Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
When the council adopted the $922-million plan in May, 1986, the committee 
became an advisory group directed by state law to report to the CRA on "policy 
matters" affecting local residents. 
</P>
<P>
State law required the CRA to consult with the committee for three years. Last 
May, when the three years elapsed, the council followed Woo's lead and voted to 
replace the largely elected committee with a separate advisory group. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee refused to die. Committee members pointed to a section of the 
plan stating that "to the maximum extent permitted by law, the activities of 
the agency pertaining to implementation of the plan . . . shall be developed in 
consultation with the . . . committee." The members interpret that to mean the 
life of the 30-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin disagreed. Ultimately, the judge said, the question is a political one 
that "area residents can still pursue . . . at the ballot box."

MOSES AND THE MASSES TURN OUT FOR MUSIC CENTER BIRTHDAY BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask a Hollywood cabbie how to get to the Music Center and he might say, 
"Practice!" 
</P>
<P>
Ask the kids from Chinatown's Castelar Elementary School and you won't get a 
punch line. "We walked up Alpine and turned left on Grand," one sixth-grader 
explained Wednesday, providing a partial explanation as to why an estimated 
10,000 people found themselves on Music Center Plaza at lunchtime Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the Music Center's 25th birthday. In a silver anniversary year 
that has been sprinkled with exclusive black-tie soirees, this event was a 
decidedly Populist affair that featured, among other things, Charlton Heston 
doing a little Moses shtick. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to 70 kids from Castelar, the crowd included more than 1,200 
uniformed high school musicians, an army of office workers on their lunch 
break, scores of jurors from the courthouse next door and at least two theater 
lovers who rode in on an RTD bus. 
</P>
<P>
"What I was trying to do was compare the number of people to the kids in band, 
and 10,000 is probably conservative," said Music Center spokeswoman Kathy 
Bornstein. 
</P>
<P>
The party was a way for the Music Center to show its appreciation for years of 
support from the Los Angeles community, Bornstein said. "We do a lot of big 
events and galas during the year. We're really more and more geared to doing 
events for the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
This party featured carrot cake, cartons of milk, jugglers and the USC Song 
Girls. Radio personalities Ken Minyard and Bob Arthur served as emcees, and, as 
at any good Southern California party, the talk turned to real estate. When the 
Music Center opened on Dec. 6, 1964, they noted, the average cost of a 
three-bedroom home in Los Angeles was $15,425. 
</P>
<P>
The massive musical ensemble was composed of the USC marching band and 22 high 
school bands that had arrived from as far away as Mojave, Riverside and San 
Diego. They played selections from "A Chorus Line," "The Phantom of the Opera" 
and "The Music Man." 
</P>
<P>
Heston, featured as a guest speaker along with Carol Channing, recalled that 
when the Music Center was being planned more than 25 years ago, "some people 
thought it might dampen the performing arts here. Of course, that has not 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Adding some Hollywood schmaltz to the occasion, Heston briefly reprised his 
role in the film "The Ten Commandments," with the Lipchitz Fountain playing the 
role of the Red Sea. Holding Moses' (prop) staff aloft, Heston intoned, "Who is 
on the Lord's side? Let him come to me!" 
</P>
<P>
The waters parted, of course. Just like at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
For revelers who didn't have jobs to get back to or verdicts to decide, the 
Music Center opened the Mark Taper Forum to the public Wednesday afternoon for 
a free dress rehearsal of Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory."

TORRANCE CLAIMS BIAS, HAS JUDGE TAKEN OFF 3RD CASE AGAINST MOBIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord, who has seen two cases he filed against 
Mobil Oil Corp. thrown out by Municipal Court Judge Thomas P. Allen Jr., has 
forced the judge off a third case against the oil company. 
</P>
<P>
Lord alleged in a motion he filed Monday that Allen is prejudiced and cannot be 
impartial in the case. Such motions cannot be opposed and are routinely 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
Allen was out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave Allen his walking papers," Lord said. "This is the first time this 
office has done it in the five years I have been here." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said: "I was surprised." 
</P>
<P>
In the case, Mobil was cited for 170 misdemeanor counts of violating the state 
safety code. The alleged violations were uncovered during an intensive safety 
audit of the refinery in 1988 performed by the federal Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration. Lord based his case on the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Lord pointed to the most recently dismissed case 
against Mobil. He said the judge had already made up his mind about misdemeanor 
cases stemming from an OSHA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Allen dismissed a case against Mobil and one of its contractors on 
the grounds that the case stemmed from an OSHA investigation. A worker was 
burned over 40% of his body and another was injured when flammable hydrocarbon 
liquids spilled onto hot pipes Aug. 5, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining his decision at the time, Allen said that "once OSHA has 
jurisdiction, that's it. Nobody else has jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Allen's dismissal, Lord said: "Mobil's lawyers made a good 
presentation in court. They talk very eloquently and they sound good. They have 
the top lawyers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"To some small degree, (Allen) may have been assuming that what they were 
saying . . . should be given more credence than what I say. Allen was persuaded 
to their position even though, I think, the law is clear. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than going back to Allen, I figured it would be better to put it before 
a judge who doesn't already have a preconceived notion of what the decision 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
Lord said he will appeal Allen's decision involving the August, 1988, accident, 
adding that legal decisions favor the position that a federal safety 
investigation does not preempt state misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a misdemeanor in the city of Torrance, I have authority and 
jurisdiction to prosecute it," Lord said. "This is the first time someone has 
come into court and advanced a serious argument that I don't." 
</P>
<P>
David Guthman, chief of the environmental crimes unit of the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office, agreed with Lord's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Guthman's office has filed an appeal in the other case against Mobil that Allen 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Originally brought by Lord, the case named Mobil, refinery manager Wyman Robb 
and then second-in-command Tom Gregory as well as three officials of Cal Cat 
Chemical Co., a Mobil contractor based in Benicia. 
</P>
<P>
The case concerned an explosion July 15, 1988, that killed a man and injured 
two others. The three were part of a Cal Cat Chemical crew cleaning sludge from 
storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Lord filed the case July 15, the district attorney took it over 
to pursue the possibility that felony manslaughter charges would be filed. The 
city prosecutor's office handles only misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
Allen dismissed that case Oct. 30, saying the state law applied only to the 
employer of the dead or injured employees -- Cal Cat Chemical -- and not to 
Mobil.

HUGHES NAMED R.P.V. MAYOR; MCTAGGART UPSET AT SNUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JOHNSON, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The turmoil on the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council reached new heights 
Wednesday when outgoing Mayor Jacki Bacharach nominated Councilman Mel Hughes 
to succeed her, snubbing Councilman John McTaggart, who was expected to take 
over the largely ceremonial post. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, an engineer who has served on the council for six years and was mayor 
once before, became mayor again by a vote of 3 to 2. Had the council followed 
its scheduled rotation of the mayor's post, it would have been McTaggart's turn 
to represent the city during ribbon-cutting ceremonies and preside at the 
council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Bacharach told an audience of about 30 people at 12:30 a.m. that she hoped 
Hughes could unify the city after a "very contentious year. I think we need a 
time of healing." 
</P>
<P>
Her words were greeted with an outburst from the audience, including Florence 
McTaggart, who had come to City Hall to see her husband named mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unethical," shouted one person. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel John should be it," yelled another. "No. It's not right. It's not 
right, Jacki." 
</P>
<P>
So began the time of healing. 
</P>
<P>
McTaggart and Councilman Robert Ryan voted against Hughes but could not best 
Bacharach and her council allies, Hughes and Douglas Hinchliffe. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview following the vote, Bacharach explained her decision. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that there's a majority and a minority on the council, and 
you don't put in a mayor who is a spokesman for the minority," she said. "I 
know John is hurt, and I'm truly sorry for it. I don't think he has the ability 
to bring the city together. He identifies with Bob (Ryan) and with Bob's 
concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Others on the council and in City Hall have said privately that they suspect an 
alliance between Ryan and McTaggart, but McTaggart stoutly denied that one 
existed -- at least until Tuesday night's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"If they wanted to bring Bob and me closer together, there would be no better 
way on the face of the earth," McTaggart said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Bacharach and other city officials assert that Ryan has destroyed staff morale 
by bullying city employees, a charge he denies. And they have criticized him 
for keeping secret for more than a year his marriage to City Clerk Jo Purcell. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Ryan said no alliance exists between him and 
McTaggart. "John is a good friend of mine, just like Jacki is a good friend of 
Mel's and Doug's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan called the council's action a "cheap, political trick" that was "very 
hurtful to John." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said he will do what he can to smooth things over. 
</P>
<P>
However, McTaggart said it is not going to be easy. "I'll probably get over it, 
but it's going to take a while."

CHURCH PLAN FOR TRANSIENTS IN REDONDO BEACH SHELVED; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SIMPLY DECLINED TO VOTE ON THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Invite the homeless to Redondo Beach? Feed and clothe them in a city park? For 
free? 
</P>
<P>
"We might as well have Hanoi Jane and Martin Sheen just bus 'em on in from 
downtown L.A.," City Councilman Terry Ward privately scoffed when the idea 
first emerged two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But when the request -- made by a church and blessed by the city's 
fundamentalist Christian mayor -- came to a hearing Tuesday night, it was with 
a kinder, gentler attitude that council members turned it away. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy discussion, they simply declined to bring it up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the city of Redondo Beach acts with malice," explained 
Councilman Stevan Colin, whose district includes the park where Hope 
Chapel-Redondo Beach wanted to set up a temporary aid station for transients. 
</P>
<P>
When constituents phoned City Hall to offer their opinion, Colin said, "almost 
every caller (opposing the idea) started out by saying, 'I don't want you to 
misunderstand me -- it's not that I don't want to help the homeless. It's just 
that I don't think we should do it in a city park.' " 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a request from Hope Chapel's Haven of Hope Ministry to set up a 
45-day food and clothing distribution program in Dominguez Park, in central 
Redondo Beach. The 17-acre park is the home of the South Redondo Little League. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which would be run out of a church-owned trailer, would also draw 
transients for a head-count that would help gauge the extent of homelessness in 
the affluent beach cities of the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Bill Gross said public land was needed because the church itself is 
homeless: Hope Chapel-Redondo Beach is so new that it has no church property 
and holds Sunday services in a high school cafeteria. He added, however, that 
part of the reason his church came to the city was that homelessness "is not 
just a church problem." 
</P>
<P>
The request -- which put yet another suburban community on the spot in dealing 
with Los Angeles County's reputation as the nation's homeless capital -- 
prompted a flood of emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Ward, compared the reaction to the furor that erupted earlier this 
year when Malibu's honorary mayor, actor Martin Sheen, declared that exclusive 
seaside enclave a sanctuary for the disenfranchised. Other council members 
expressed fears that such involvement could create the sort of tensions that 
have arisen recently in Santa Monica, where liberal policies toward the 
homeless have placed a strain on social services and spawned political 
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Local advocates for the homeless mentally ill backed the idea, claiming that 
the beach cities are lacking in services for the disenfranchised, even though 
local outreach workers report there are at least half a dozen homeless people 
in every Redondo Beach park. 
</P>
<P>
But park officials argued that the plan would draw transients to a city where 
street people are seldom seen, and several members of the clergy expressed 
concern that it would duplicate free lunch programs already being offered in 
Redondo Beach by local churches and the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living around the park also complained that the program would make it 
impossible for their children to play safely there. 
</P>
<P>
The sole backer on the council was Mayor Brad Parton, a frequent Hope Chapel 
congregant. 
</P>
<P>
"If this isn't something our city can jump on . . . then our idea of government 
is pretty mixed up," Parton told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But the request did not come to a vote. Instead, the council asked that Hope 
Chapel be added to the city's referral list of local social service agencies.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARRESTS IN THEFTS OF RECYCLING BINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a day after the Manhattan Beach residential trash recycling program 
began Monday, police arrested two men for allegedly pilfering recycling bins. 
</P>
<P>
Other pilfering has been reported, but these are the only arrests that have 
been made under the city ordinance against salvaging without a permit, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Enrique Palma Vargas, 27, of Inglewood and Jesus Urena 
Maldonado, 62, of Los Angeles were arrested at 1:25 p.m. Monday as they were 
allegedly putting an orange recycling bin into a truck at 748 Rosecrans Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Det. Sgt. John Zea said the men were released for arraignment on misdemeanor 
charges Jan. 4 in South Bay Municipal Court in Torrance. Conviction carries a 
maximum penalty of a $500 fine and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Zea said he expects police to make a lot of arrests because the value of 
recyclable materials always attracts pilferers. 
</P>
<P>
In the city recycling program, newspapers, plastic soft drink containers, glass 
and aluminum and tin cans are placed in recycling bins supplied to 15,000 
residences by the city. They are collected on regular trash pickup days by 
Western Waste Industries under a contract with the city.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1-DAY STRIKE DELAYS TRASH PICKUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residential trash collection resumed Tuesday in four South Bay cities after 160 
trash haulers for Gardena-based Western Waste Industries walked off the job 
Monday in a one-day wildcat strike. 
</P>
<P>
Trash pickups are running a day late this week in Carson, Gardena, Inglewood 
and Manhattan Beach. The normal collection schedule will resume on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Western Waste trash collectors said they did not report for work Monday because 
a new contract was adopted without their approval. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Richard Haft said representatives from the Teamsters Union 
had accepted a contract. He blamed the strike, which he said did not have union 
authorization, on poor communication between the union and its members. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Teamsters Local 396 declined to comment.

GOVERNMENT: VETERANS OF WESTLAKE VILLAGE AND AGOURA HILLS GOVERNMENT ARE 
ELECTED TO ONE-YEAR TERMS AS MAYOR.

<P>
The city councils of Westlake Village and Agoura Hills selected new mayors and 
installed newly elected members Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
In Westlake Village, Councilwoman Bonnie Klove was selected by her colleagues 
for the mostly ceremonial position of mayor. In Agoura Hills, Councilwoman 
Vicky Leary was picked to be mayor. Both will serve for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Klove and Leary have served on their respective councils since their cities 
were incorporated. Westlake Village was incorporated in 1981, and Agoura Hills 
became a city in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin D. Pelletier had been mayor of Westlake Village for the past year. He 
and Irwin Shane left the council Wednesday, after serving two terms each. Two 
new members were installed, businessman Douglas R. Yarrow and former City 
Manager James E. Emmons. 
</P>
<P>
Yarrow and Emmons won their seats in the Nov. 7 election, in which Shane was 
defeated. Pelletier did not run. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Kenneth E. Rufener was selected mayor pro tem in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
In Agoura Hills, where Councilwoman Darlene McBane had been mayor for the past 
year, businessman Ed Kurtz took his place on the council Wednesday. He won his 
seat in the Nov. 7 election, in which Jack W. Koenig was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills City Councilwoman Louise C. Rishoff became that council's new 
mayor pro tem.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TATTOO BAN MAY BE MODIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ban on tattooing in Torrance may be modified to allow the application of 
permanent makeup, in which pigment is added to the skin around eyes, mouths and 
eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, City Council members said they would like to change their 
30-year-old ordinance outlawing tattooing to allow both permanent makeup and 
cosmetic reconstruction, in which pigment is used to hide scars or return 
damaged skin to more natural tones. 
</P>
<P>
The council told staff members to prepare possible amendments to the city's 
anti-tattooing law for consideration Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Three cosmetologists were ordered to stop their tattooing services several 
weeks ago when a woman seeking a business license to offer permanent makeup 
protested the license's denial by showing city officials advertisements from 
the three businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetologist Irene Hatate, who has done permanent makeup and cosmetic 
reconstruction in her Torrance salon for about four years, appealed to the City 
Council.

FOUR ARRESTED IN HOLD-UPS OF ALIENS AT BORDER

Four residents of Mexico were arrested early Wednesday morning in connection 
with three hold-ups conducted along the international border, San Diego police 
said.

The robberies took place at about 3 a.m. on the U.S. side of the border near 
the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The Police Department's Border Crime Intervention 
Unit, which was patrolling there, made the arrests, police spokesman Bill 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers using night-observation equipment watched as four men with knives held 
up two separate groups of illegal aliens, Robinson said. The officers arrested 
the suspects as they were waiting for and following another group of 
undocumented aliens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One group of aliens taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol early 
Wednesday morning later identified the four suspects as the men who had held 
them up, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves took "a small amount of cash, some clothing and personal jewelry," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Mariano Camacho Rojas, 18, and Roberto Jimenez Garcia, 20, both 
of Tijuana; Jorge Garcia Lopez, 23, of Torreon, Coahuila; and Ochoa Angel 
Garibaldi, 18, of Guadalajara. Each was held on suspicion of six counts of 
armed robbery.

PARKING PRODUCES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS; BUT FOR 
SPECTATORS, IT OFTEN PRODUCES HEADACHES, FRUSTRATION 
</P>

<P>
It has become a required nuisance, this business of paying for parking. Roll 
down the window, extend an arm, drop $3 here, $5 there. 
</P>
<P>
But to sports organizations that provide parking, it can amount to millions of 
dollars in revenue -- enough to pay a front office, buy a ballplayer, or in the 
case of new Angel pitcher Mark Langston, at least make the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Parking has become such a big business -- an estimated $8-billion-plus industry 
nationwide -- that consultants are hired just to study parking. Should they add 
more? Should the spaces be smaller? Should they charge more? How can they make 
more? 
</P>
<P>
Parking fees at Angel games last season yielded $2.28 million before expenses 
and provided a profit of $1.8 million, which the Angels split with the city of 
Anaheim, which owns the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Ram games produced $903,295 in parking revenue last year, of which the Rams and 
Anaheim each netted $377,000. 
</P>
<P>
At Dodger Stadium, parking fees alone could have paid Fernando Valenzuela's 
$1.85 million salary last season. The Dodgers, a private organization that owns 
the parking lot, would not provide precise financial information. But they pay 
about one-fourth of their total parking revenue to System Parking, Inc., which 
manages the lot. Still, the Dodgers clearly made more than the $1.8 million 
that the Angels split with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The Forum, also a privately held corporation, can park only 3,450 cars for a 
16,000-seat arena, and pre-sells virtually the entire lot to Laker and King 
season-ticket holders. That's why no matter how early you arrive at the Forum, 
the chances are you'll be sent across the street to Hollywood Park, which can 
accommodate about 25,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Some organizations make no money on parking. The State of California owns the 
parking at Exposition Park -- the Coliseum and the Sports Arena -- and nets 
about $1.5 million annually. The Raiders and Clippers receive none of that 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, however, did make an estimated $161,098 in parking fees during 
the 1984-85 season by overcharging customers, according to a state audit 
released in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Clippers violated their lease agreement with the state 
by charging season-parking holders more than the state-regulated price. 
Subsequently, the Clippers were ordered to reimburse the overcharged funds, 
which they did with tickets to less desirable games. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the California Museum of Science and Industry, which oversees 
the state-owned lots, said the Clippers no longer overcharge parking customers. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the Rose Bowl, owned by the city of Pasadena, where a 
tradition of free parking has cost the city about $120,000 annually at UCLA 
football games alone, according to Rose Bowl officials. Seemingly, that 
tradition is changing. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that there is potential for additional revenue if we had a fully 
paid parking program, but that revenue will not be realized unless we complete 
negotiations with UCLA," said Greg Asbury, the Rose Bowl's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has the right to approve or disapprove all parking fees, according to its 
contract with the Rose Bowl, which runs through 1996. Two seasons ago, in 
response to a request from the city, UCLA began selling football season-parking 
passes for all paved areas, about 5,100 spaces. All the revenue -- $11,575 net 
per game -- from those spaces goes to the city of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
But UCLA opposes a fully paid parking program, which would include charging for 
the unpaved lots on the adjacent golf course, baseball diamonds and soccer 
fields that can accommodate 17,000-22,000 cars. UCLA cannot sell season parking 
for the unpaved areas, because when it rains, cars are not allowed to park on 
the grass. 
</P>
<P>
"We are against paid parking, and we think parking on the unpaved areas should 
be free -- it adds to the environment and ambience of our football games and we 
think it adds to our ability to sell season tickets," said Steve Salm, UCLA's 
business manager for athletics. "It is UCLA's preference that parking on the 
unpaved areas remain free." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the pay-for-parking issue has been around for years, despite 
a myriad of proposed obstacles such as traffic tie-ups, too many unpaved lots, 
and a strange street configuration around the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Unconvinced, Rose Bowl officials cordoned off a test area for a Mickey Thompson 
off-road event, called it preferred parking and charged $5 a car. 
</P>
<P>
"The preferred parking filled up first," said Connie Campbell, Rose Bowl 
coordinator. "What we learned from it is that people expected to pay a fee for 
parking. They paid because they thought they would get a better spot to park, 
and they did." 
</P>
<P>
But some people have even paid for parking when they didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a friend who used to go down to the Rose Bowl before UCLA games, cordon 
off an area and charge for parking," said Jack Woody, a Pasadena resident. 
"He'd come home with $400-$500 every time." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim and Dodger stadiums can accommodate 16,000 cars each. The Dodgers sell 
6,000 season parking passes at $400 each, the Angels sell 2,750 season-parking 
passes, also at $400 each, and the Rams sell 3,000 season-parking passes at 
$110 each. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers charge $3 a game for parking, the Angels $4 and the Rams $5. 
Spokesmen for the Angels and Rams say there is rarely a parking sellout in 
baseball, but that parking at Ram games is virtually sold out every game. 
</P>
<P>
Yet industry experts caution that the parking business isn't always a money 
maker, especially if the facility is used no more than 30 times a year. They 
also cite huge costs for developing parking, from $6,500 to $39,000 a space, 
depending on the worth of the land and the type of structure, which makes it 
difficult to make money. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people think it's like a slot machine, but it's not," said Stanley 
Long, president of the Parking Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody wrote (The Times) that people should be advised to open up parking 
lots because all you have to do is get a lot and stop people at the gate and 
have them pay. Well, there's more to it than that. Most of the operators are 
union, and there's insurance. Generally the average profit is around 6%. It's 
not the gold mine a lot of people think it is." 
</P>
<P>
Paying to park at sports events, however, is not what bothers most Southern 
Californians. It's the hassle that goes along with finding a place to park, and 
then sometimes, not finding one at all. 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, Coliseum events are the worst. There are only 5,000 parking 
spaces in Exposition Park to accommodate a stadium that seats 92,000. Since the 
Coliseum averages 75,000 fans an event, the parking facility turns away about 
20,000 cars. Last year, there was not enough parking for 20 of 31 Coliseum 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember going to a Rams' game at the Coliseum with some friends a long 
time ago," said Bill Hurrell, a transportation consultant for Wilbur Smith 
Associates in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We had tickets and the game was sold out, but we couldn't find a place to 
park. The people I was with had a real nice car and were afraid to leave it in 
the area where they could find parking, so we just left. Sounds crazy, but 
that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The situation hasn't changed much. 
</P>
<P>
"People are coming to a venue anticipating to park and the spaces are filled 
three hours before the start of the game," said Rick Ullman, general manager of 
Five Star Parking, which oversees the Exposition Park lots. 
</P>
<P>
USC, across the street from Exposition Park, also sells parking for Coliseum 
events at $6 a car. However, the number of spaces available per event varies 
greatly, from 400 to 4,000, depending on what else is happening at USC. There 
is also parking across the street from USC at the Shrine Auditorium, and in 
private lots around the Coliseum, which charge anywhere from $5 to $20 to park. 
</P>
<P>
"For USC football games, we can anticipate most all our student and faculty 
permit holders will attend, so we have to save space for them first," said Roy 
Heidicker, USC events manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have to hold space for about 2,750 USC season football parking pass 
holders. So we monitor the situation and open up as many spaces as we can to 
the general public. For a UCLA-USC game, if we have 500 spaces to sell that 
would be a high estimate." 
</P>
<P>
Last month's game between UCLA at USC provided a good example of the congestion 
motorists can encounter. One group arrived at the Coliseum two hours before the 
game and circled for more than an hour, looking for a place to park. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, about 45 minutes before kickoff, the group drove right by a sign on 
the USC campus that said "USC season parking and permit only" and approached a 
parking booth. The driver explained her plight and the attendant told her they 
could park, but it would cost them $6. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot, at that point I would have paid $20," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sundays are normally quiet on campus, so USC can provide parking for 3,000 to 
4,000 cars for Raider games. The state recently signed a letter of intent with 
USC to build a 450-car parking lot on the northwest corner of Exposition 
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
For Sports Arena events, about half of the 5,000 spaces cannot be seen from the 
Arena. The Clippers reserve Lot 6, about 1,600 spaces, for season parking and 
sell single-game parking in Lots 5 and 5A, where 1,000 cars can be 
accommodated. In sellout parking situations, about eight times a year, the 
Sports Arena opens Lot 1, about one block away. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Five Star Parking to build a 1,500-car parking lot adjacent to 
the sports arena is under consideration by the state. 
</P>
<P>
But things could be worse, judging from problems in other parts of the country. 
Yankee Stadium, located in New York's Bronx, doesn't really even have a parking 
lot. The lots outside the stadium are owned by the city of New York and 
accommodate only 6,900 cars -- not near enough for a 57,000-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the worst parking situation in baseball, except for maybe Fenway 
Park (in Boston)," said Bill Squires, the director of stadium operations at 
Yankee Stadium. "At least we can take care of our players' parking. I don't 
think (the Red Sox) can even do that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like Dodger Stadium, where they have a huge lot surrounding the park. 
The city regulates the pricing, which is $4 and $7 for valet, but it fills up 
fast. And parking on the street is not a wise think to do in this 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Parking is worse at Boston's Fenway Park, where the minimum charge to park is 
as much as a reserved game ticket -- $10. The Red Sox literally have no parking 
facility of their own, and the surrounding lots are independently owned and 
unregulated. Public transportation, needless to say, is encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the New Jersey Meadowlands, where the New York Giants and 
Jets and New Jersey Nets play, has seemingly unlimited parking -- 28,000 spaces 
-- and at a good price, $5 for football games and $3 for basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
But why drive when you can take a train, bus or subway? At Boston Garden, home 
of the Bruins and Celtics, a commuter train stops at North Station, which is 
right at the Garden. The T-subway also stops right at the arena. For the 
die-hard drivers, there are private parking lots in the area, but the price is 
hefty. The lot directly across from the Garden charges $15. 
</P>
<P>
Madison Square Garden, home of the New York Rangers and Knicks, has a similar 
setup. Penn Station is located beneath the Garden, and subway service is a 
couple of blocks away. There are about four parking lots in the vicinity that 
charge $10-$15 a car. Then there's street parking, which one New Yorker said 
you wouldn't want to chance. 
</P>
<P>
"You could get a ticket, or then, you could get your car stolen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parking is a seller's market everywhere. Milwaukee County Stadium, which can 
accommodate 13,000 cars, will charge $6 a game this season for preferred 
parking at Brewer games. Preferred parking lots are those closest to the 
stadium. Other parking will cost $4. 
</P>
<P>
Parking at Chicago's Wrigley Field can be an event in itself. The ballpark is 
located in the midst of a residential neighborhood, and the Cubs' own only 
three lots with very limited space to sell to the public. Most all parking is 
on the street and in private lots in the area, where a space can cost $15. 
</P>
<P>
At Candlestick Park, where the 49ers play to sellout crowds of 62,000 every 
game, it costs $12 to park in one of the 7,000 paved spaces. The rest of the 
fans pay $7 to park in one of the 10,000 dirt spaces outside the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Those fans pray that it doesn't rain.

HOWIE LONG IS TACKLING NEW CHALLENGES; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: DEFENSIVE LINEMAN, HEALTHY AT LAST AND BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT, TAKES 
SOME SHOTS AT HIS CRITICS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like some perennial on the Johnny-Arsenio circuit who fades into oblivion while 
Jessica Hahn and Zsa Zsa make the rounds, he returns to our living rooms, a 
force once more, smiling so winsomely the sun seems to glint off his incisors, 
the man to ask about everything -- there's just no telling what he might say! 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen . . . 
</P>
<P>
Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
All last season and half of this one, he was written off as washed up or gone 
Hollywood. NBC's O.J. Simpson opined that Long was now lifting weights for 
maximum "cut," for that good show-biz look. 
</P>
<P>
Long, not one to laugh off a slight, thought that was hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "insider," Bobby Beathard, the former Washington Redskin general manager, 
opined that Long just wasn't the defensive end he used to be. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Beathard? 
</P>
<P>
"We're as responsible for Bobby Beathard being at NBC as anyone," said Long, no 
longer amused. 
</P>
<P>
"We kicked their (Redskin) butts just about every time we played them, and 
those are the players he scouted and drafted. We traded them everyone but 
Run-Run Jones (a Raider equipment man), and we were just about to lock that 
deal up when (Beathard) left Washington. And that's fact. He was going to give 
us the right side of their offensive line and their bookend defensive ends for 
Run-Run Jones. A lot of people don't know that. I'm going to let it out now." 
</P>
<P>
Long was the first real Los Angeles Raider star. Lyle Alzado and Jim Plunkett 
belonged more toOakland; Marcus Allen was Southern California's own, but 
reluctant. Who would hang around until 6 p.m. and go on with the mini-cams and 
make jokes about this week's opponent? Howie! 
</P>
<P>
Who got a drink in the Seattle Seahawk huddle one day and told them he deserved 
it more than they did? Who needled his buddies like Alzado in the papers, made 
the cover of GQ, did national spots for Personna, Nike, Campbell's Soup? Who 
got a $9.7-million contract from Al Davis that pays $1.1 million this year 
escalating to $1.8 million in 1994? 
</P>
<P>
Who missed most of last season with a calf injury diagnosed as any-day-now? 
</P>
<P>
Who missed most of this exhibition season with a sprained ankle that wasn't 
thought to be a big deal . . . then took shots to play and didn't make the 
starting lineup until Game 7? 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders plummeting and Long on the sidelines looking fetching in a 
baseball cap, the world dive-bombed him. 
</P>
<P>
The ankle healed, with the help of Art Shell, who gave him the time off he 
needed. The next thing you knew, here's Howie! 
</P>
<P>
"Al came to me and said, 'We're going to give you an opportunity to get well,' 
" Long said. "But I still didn't have the feel for what my situation was. I 
didn't get that feel until Art Shell came in. The first thing he did was come 
up to me and say, 'You tell me when you're ready to play. I don't care what 
anybody else says.' 
</P>
<P>
"That meant a lot to me. There was too much gray area." 
</P>
<P>
Gray area, of course, was ruinous to Long, the worrier, who had been handed 
around from relative to relative as a child, who long after he achieved stardom 
and riches would lie awake at night wondering where it all might go. 
</P>
<P>
When he was on top of it all, deemed the game's outstanding defensive force, he 
sat up nights imagining the worst, so you can imagine how easy this was. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm up all night now," he said laughing. "I just have the company of my kids 
(two sons, 4 and 1 1/2). Now I have someone to run the whole situation by. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, it rattled me a little bit, the things being said, the 
things being written about me. And then I got to the point where I just said, 
'The hell with it. You can't control what you can't control. The only thing you 
can control is, No. 1, getting well; and No. 2, when you come back, playing 
your butt off.' 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't know what it's like. There are certain types of injuries you 
can't function with. If you break a hand or you hurt something in your upper 
body, you've got a shot. But when you can't run. . . . My game is getting off 
the ball, explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the gone-Hollywood claim) is is a hook for people. I don't actively 
pursue anything in that industry. I get offers to do some things. I'm not going 
reading for things. In the off-season, I go home, I work out and that's what I 
do. If I have to do a commercial, it's one day for six figures. If that's going 
Hollywood, fine. I call it paying the bills, man. Putting my kids through 
college." 
</P>
<P>
Mama, don't let his kids grow up to be football stars . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I would not encourage it," he said, laughing. "I have dreams of an outfield 
(the Longs' third son is due this week). I have dreams of arbitration -- for 
eight mil a year by that time. The biggest worry you have as an outfielder is, 
what, staying awake?" 
</P>
<P>
Football is exciting, football is lucrative, football made him. 
</P>
<P>
Football is hard, football is merciless, football can break you into many 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many situations where I went in this direction (playing 
football) for it not to have been fate," Long said. "God has been good to me. 
I'm fortunate to be around. But I've seen everything there is to see -- 
injuries, success, failure. I know what a toll the game takes on your body." 
</P>
<P>
If he is no longer the game's dominant force -- meet Philadelphia's Reggie 
White -- Long remains a force. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Reggie White is a glimpse of the future," he said. "Here's a guy, 6-6, 
295. Those are normal numbers for an offensive tackle. When you couple that 
with 4.6-, 4.7-second speed . . . and the strength of three. . . . You've got a 
superior player. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the fact that I've worked hard. I'm competing again. I don't 
envision myself being as good as everybody says I am and I don't envision 
myself being as bad as everybody says I am. I don't do anything great, but I do 
a lot of things good, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
It's not all, at all. At 29, the handsome young scion with the assured future 
literally crawls through his large house in the South Bay for days after games. 
What the heck, it's a living.

JIM MURRAY: 'NO MAS' TALKING -- IT'S TIME TO FIGHT;

The trouble with Sugar Ray Leonard as a pug is, he doesn't look like one. He 
looks like he just walked off a can of baby food. If you saw him in the park, 
you'd want to take him down to the precinct and buy him a lollipop till his 
parents showed up. 
</P>
<P>
He's got this wide-eyed, innocent, baby-faced stare. He's not really very big, 
certainly not big enough to be the middleweight champion of the world. The 
forehead is smooth and unwrinkled, not a mark on it. There's no scar tissue 
over the eyes or ears. He has all his teeth. He smiles a lot. His nose isn't 
mashed against his cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
You look at his record and you picture Hulk Hogan. You look at the fighter and 
it's "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
It's not fair. Killers should look the part. It has always been the contention 
here that the reason Scotland Yard never caught Jack the Ripper was because he 
didn't look the way Jack the Ripper was supposed to look. Nature plays tricks. 
He probably looked more like a wimp than a monster. Wolves look cuddly. Hitler 
looked comical. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard doesn't look like a wimp but if he'd tried to pick a fight in 
a bar before he got famous, the tough guys would have laughed and recommended 
he get back on his tricycle and go home to mother. 
</P>
<P>
The first time Ray fights anybody, he seems to inspire that kind of 
overconfident reaction. There is very little doubt that when Roberto Duran 
looked across the ring in Montreal that night in 1980 and first saw Ray, he 
couldn't believe his good luck. They got altar boys tougher than that where 
Roberto comes from. 
</P>
<P>
You have to think Thomas Hearns also figured he was in with teacher's pet the 
first time he fought him. We know Marvin Hagler did. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't even sound like a fighter. His voice doesn't rumble like a freight 
going through a tunnel. He doesn't have the laryngitic whisper of someone who's 
taken too many hooks to the Adam's apple. He doesn't talk like somebody being 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
He uses words like perspective and minimize distractions, gratification -- 
spelling bee words. He doesn't exactly quote Schopenhauer or Nietsche but he 
does say things like, "Underestimating an opponent is not my forte." Pugs are 
supposed to stick to, "I'll moider da bum." 
</P>
<P>
But, by the second fight, Ray has blown his cover. They see right through that 
look of the little boy getting his first look at Santa Claus and treat him for 
what he is, Baby Face Nelson, Public Enemy No. 1 in boxing trunks, a terrorist 
with gloves on. 
</P>
<P>
What's his secret? Speed. The great equalizer. Boxing is a speed sport. It's a 
simple matter of physics. The car that hits you going 5 m.p.h. leaves you 
unhurt. The same car hits you going 125 m.p.h., they pick you up in a basket. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto with punches. Velocity plus mass equals unconsciousness when it lands on 
the chin. The original Sugar Ray taught that to a generation of tough guys from 
Jake LaMotta to Rocky Graziano. The new Sugar Ray taught it to the Marvin 
Hagler -- and Roberto Duran -- generation. 
</P>
<P>
The question becomes: What happens when the speed decelerates? When the 
reflexes slow? When that happens, does the match come down to brute strength? 
</P>
<P>
This is the proposition that saves tonight's matchup at The Mirage Hotel from 
being a foregone conclusion. Joe Louis once said he never lost his punch, just 
the ability to get it there on time. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens Thursday night -- and it almost happened when he fought the 
Hearns rematch -- does Sugar Ray live up to his looks? Nature apparently 
intended him to be a piano player or a ballet dancer. When the speed's gone, 
does he turn into Little Boy Blue at last? 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Duran couldn't be anything else but what he is. Central Casting 
wouldn't list him as anything but pure pug. Sugar Ray might get the parts where 
he wears a velvet suit with buckle shoes. 
</P>
<P>
If Sugar Ray hasn't lost any speed, Duran is going to think it's raining 
punches. If Sugar Ray has lost his speed, he's going to feel as if a wildcat's 
got into the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
A fighter's supposed to look like something hanging off a French cathedral, not 
like a cheerleader. Any self-respecting director would send Sugar Ray back to 
makeup with orders not to return till they painted him up to look like the 
hunchback of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if he's lost some speed, Roberto Duran may do the makeup for him. 
Sugar Ray may go from Little Lord Fauntleroy to Jake LaMotta in five rounds. If 
he's lost his edge, by the time Duran is through with him, he's going to be 
able to haunt operas.

CARTER SIGNS WITH PADRES AND BECOMES HIGHEST-PAID NONPITCHER IN BASEBALL

Center fielder Joe Carter signed a three-year, $9.2-million contract with the 
San Diego Padres Wednesday, making him the highest-paid position player in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the trade engineered by Jack McKeon, Padre vice president/baseball 
operations, catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., left fielder Chris James and minor league 
third baseman Carlos Baerga went to the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn: "Trader Jack has done it again. He was the 
marquee name of the whole winter meetings. But hey, if you think Jack's 
excited, you should see me. I'm going crazy. We got a super player this city's 
just going to fall in love with. What a class act." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 29, has averaged 30 home runs and 108 runs batted in the past four 
seasons. Only three American League players have driven in more runs in that 
span, and the last time Carter hit fewer than 25 homers in a season was in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres maintained their pace Wednesday night by signing free-agent 
outfielder Fred Lynn -- a former Angel -- to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn, 37, will earn $500,000 and will also receive a signing bonus of about 
$100,000. He spent last season with the Detroit Tigers, hitting .241 with 11 
home runs and 46 RBIs in 117 games. BOB NIGHTENGALE

METS TRADE MYERS TO CINCINNATI FOR FRANCO; 
</P>
<P>
WINTER MEETINGS: DEAL INVOLVES A SWAP OF LEFT-HANDED RELIEF PITCHERS; INDIANS 
TO SIGN HERNANDEZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Convinced that the numbers in his salary were more important to Cincinnati Red 
owner Marge Schott than his pitching statistics, John Franco welcomed the trade 
that sent him to the New York Mets Wednesday for Randy Myers, a swap of two of 
the National League's best left-handed relievers. 
</P>
<P>
The teams also exchanged minor leaguers: 25-year-old right-handed pitcher Kip 
Gross went to Cincinnati and 22-year-old outfielder Don Brown went to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Franco, who was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and lives there during the off-season, 
said he had heard reports that he might be traded to the New York Yankees and 
was pleasantly surprised to hear he had been dealt to the Mets. He said he had 
no malice toward his former club, but warned Schott and the Reds that "if they 
lose (Eric) Davis, I think the town would be ready to lynch her. . . . She's 
going to have to dip down into her wallet." 
</P>
<P>
Myers was the second link to the Mets' 1986 World Series championship team to 
be lost Wednesday. Free-agent first baseman Keith Hernandez said he had told 
the Cleveland Indians that he would sign today. Hernandez will be receiving a 
reported two-year contract worth in excess of $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Franco, who has a career record of 42-30 with 148 saves and a 2.49 earned-run 
average in 393 games, said he hoped to sign a long-term deal with the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"What it really comes down to is money. I don't think (Schott) wanted to pay me 
the going rate," said Franco, who had an NL-leading 39 saves in 1988 but 
slumped in 1989 to a 4-8 record with 32 saves and a 3.12 ERA in 60 games. 
</P>
<P>
Franco, 29, earned $1,067,500 last season compared with $300,000 for Myers, 27. 
Both are eligible for arbitration next year; the Reds would have had to sign 
Franco to a long-term contract to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
Red General Manager Bob Quinn said finances and free agency were not factors in 
the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the hardest-throwing right-handed reliever in Rob Dibble, and now we 
have the hardest-throwing left-handed reliever in Randy Myers," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Myers was 7-4 with a 2.35 ERA and 24 saves in 65 games with the Mets last 
season. He recorded 88 strikeouts in 84 1/3 innings. He is 17-13 lifetime with 
56 saves and an 2.74 in 185 games.

FREE-SPENDING FRENZY CONTINUES: HRBEK GETS $14 MILLION FOR 5 YEARS 
</P>

<P>
Unbelievable. Ron Simon could think of no better word for it. There is no 
better word for it. 
</P>
<P>
The latest example of a baseball market gone crazy occurred Wednesday at the 
winter meetings when the Minnesota Twins retained free-agent first baseman Kent 
Hrbek with a five-year guaranty of $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Simon stood on the dais -- agents having become the stars of this show -- 
and said, "the best word for it is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Unbelievable, he said, in the sense that only a month ago Hrbek was thinking of 
maybe $7.3 million for three years, and in spring training it was $4 million 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Unbelievable as well, Simon said, in the sense that Hrbek actually sacrificed 
to stay with his hometown team, having been offered five-year deals of $15.5 
million by the Detroit Tigers and $15 million by the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
"Kent's instruction to me was to get the most competitive offer from the Twins, 
so he could stay," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, the Twins were only offering three years at less than the 
$9 million teammate Kirby Puckett had received. 
</P>
<P>
Then owner Carl Pohlad arrived and responded to the bidding war and the loss, 
earlier Wednesday, of relief ace Jeff Reardon, who moved to his hometown Boston 
Red Sox for a three-year, $6.8-million guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make a decision on two high-profile free agents," Twins' General 
Manager Andy MacPhail said, adding that the Twins figured they could fill the 
relief void easier than that created by the loss of Hrbek's power. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, he said, Hrbek is 29 compared to Reardon's 34, and "baseball in the Twin 
Cities wouldn't have been the same without Kent." 
</P>
<P>
A choice was necessary, MacPhail said, because the Twins are playing on an 
"uneven field," attempting to compete with teams in bigger markets, teams that 
have "revenues we'll never see." 
</P>
<P>
This is a pivotal aspect of the collective bargaining proposal that the owners 
have presented to the players association. They are asking that salaries for 
players with zero to six years of major league service be determined by a 
two-year statistical table and that those salaries be shared by all 26 teams. 
</P>
<P>
It's called revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
"Something has to be done if the Twins are going to continue to compete," 
MacPhail said, implying that he can't always count on the loyalty of a Hrbek or 
Gary Gaetti, who rejected a larger offer from the Dodgers to return as the 
Twins' third baseman two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For Hrbek, there was a concession in another way as well, MacPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
He recognized that Puckett is the Twins' best player, MacPhail said, and didn't 
try to surpass the $3 million a year Puckett will receive in the $9-million 
contract he signed two weeks ago and which ignited the current escalation. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened since then couldn't have been foreseen," MacPhail said. "I 
wouldn't have thought it possible." 
</P>
<P>
In a word: unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Twins now have that gaping hole in their bullpen, the Red Sox have 
two closers in Reardon and Lee Smith, 25 for 30 in save situations last year. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, will be offered in trade, the Red Sox seeking a starting 
pitcher, plus a first baseman or right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Of Reardon, Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman said: "He improves our 
flexibility and should be a plus in the clubhouse because he hates to lose." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox have paid a big price to correct a suspect attitude. In addition to 
the $6.8 million for Reardon, they spent $6.4 million on free-agent catcher 
Tony Pena, which had more to do with the .212 batting average of Rich Gedman 
last year than questionable intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Boston is a team that normally abstains from free agency, but Gorman said it is 
a one-time happening. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the depth in our farm system right now, but we will again in a 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't done this in the past and we won't in the future. This is not a 
change in our policy." 
</P>
<P>
There was some stunning speculation Wednesday -- not denied by General Manager 
Mike Port before his departure from Nashville -- that the Angels have been a 
quiet entry in the bidding for free-agent relief pitcher Mark Davis, though 
Davis is expected to match or exceed the $16 million the Angels have guaranteed 
Mark Langston and may have to guarantee Robin Yount. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear they are in it," Chicago White Sox General Manager Larry Himes said of 
the Angels and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"If they put Davis with Harvey at the back of their bullpen they'll have the 
best team in the American League." 
</P>
<P>
Angel center fielder Devon White, in Nashville to receive his Gold Glove, has 
been the subject of recurring trade speculation, his possible departure 
apparently hinging on the signing of Yount as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Devo that no one is an untouchable," Port said. 
</P>
<P>
"I also asked him if he had an answering machine because I may have to get a 
hold of him." 
</P>
<P>
The face of the American League West keeps changing. 
</P>
<P>
Langston joins the Angels. Reardon leaves the Twins. Dave Parker and Tony 
Phillips depart Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing the Angels or anyone else does now will determine who wins the 
American League West," A's General Manager Sandy Alderson said. "It still has 
to be played out over 162 games." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we won 104 games in 1988, added Mike Moore and Rickey Henderson, and 
there were still three teams that had a chance to win going into the last week 
of the (1989) season." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 39, led the A's in runs batted in last year. He wanted a two-year 
contract, but the A's wouldn't go beyond one. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips provided pivotal versatility before settling in at second base. He 
wanted a three-year contract, but the A's wouldn't go beyond two. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost some depth, but I don't think we've been mortally wounded," 
Alderson said. "The nucleus of our team is still intact. 
</P>
<P>
"Having both Henderson and Jose Canseco available for the full season should 
more than compensate for the loss of Parker. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize that having Dave would make it that much better, but if I didn't 
think we could survive, I wouldn't have let him leave." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I don't want to be critical. Dave and Tony were significant to our 
success, but if you're asking if I still like our team, the answer is yes."

O'MALLEY TO REWARD LASORDA;

DODGERS: OWNER SAYS HE WILL MEET WITH MANAGER TO TALK ABOUT A CONTRACT 
EXTENSION.

The man who has said he could manage the Dodgers forever will apparently get a 
chance to do it for a while longer. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger owner Peter O'Malley said he has planned a meeting with Tom Lasorda to 
discuss extending Lasorda's contract, which expires at the end of next season. 
O'Malley did not give a date for the meeting -- "It could be tomorrow, it could 
be next month" -- but left no doubt as to his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"We will definitely meet," O'Malley said. "And put it this way: If you could 
buy stock in Tommy Lasorda, I would buy all I could." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, who will be 63 at the end of his current contract, said he would 
answer O'Malley's call on the first ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not ready to retire. I love my job. I love the Dodgers. . . . If he wants 
to contact me, I would be very happy to talk," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said that although he has thought about his Dodger future past 1990, it 
would not be right for him to contact O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a contract with the man. I am in no position to say anything about 
anything past that contract," Lasorda said. "Now, if he wants to talk to me, 
that's great. I'd be proud. But I would never call him first. That's not the 
way it works." 
</P>
<P>
Before Lasorda signed his last contract on July 8, 1988 -- a two-year deal 
worth $1 million -- there was speculation that he would like to be a general 
manager. Lasorda, though, is apparently having too much fun to leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up every morning and I'm always excited about going to the ballpark," he 
said. "I can never wait to get there and give the fans exciting baseball. 
That's something I don't want to lose." 
</P>
<P>
He said he also supports Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred does a very good job. He's hard-working and we have a great 
relationship," Lasorda said. "And I would rather be a manager then a general 
manager. I'm fine mentally, I'm fine physically. I don't see any reason to stop 
doing something I love." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, as the Dodgers fell to a 77-83 record, most of Lasorda's impact was 
behind the scenes. But O'Malley said he noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks good, he looks strong, and it's obvious he enjoys his work and does 
it better than ever," O'Malley said. "We are happy and impressed with the job 
he has done, and feel that he does it as well (as) -- or better than -- anyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda has a record of 1,097-955, a .535 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth day of these four-day-old meetings, the Dodgers did nothing 
exciting Wednesday and Claire is growing more resigned to going home empty 
handed. 
</P>
<P>
Claire confirmed that the Dodger had made an offer to free agent Robin Yount 
earlier this winter. But since Yount's agent, brother Larry, has not spoken to 
them recently, outlook in that area remains bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Claire also said that the Dodgers had dropped out of the Craig Lefferts 
sweepstakes, implying that the money being offered the San Francisco Giants' 
middle reliever -- three years, $6 million from Montreal -- is too much. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes to a point of decision where you just have to pass," Claire said.

Pervis Ellison's first NBA season appeared to slip away Wednesday, as 
Sacramento King officials predicted that the No. 1 draft pick wouldn't be ready 
to play until mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports indicating that Ellison would miss only three weeks were 
incorrect, the Kings said. 
</P>
<P>
Suffering from tendinitis in his right big toe, Ellison was ordered by doctors 
to stay off his foot for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After three weeks of inactivity, the 6-foot-10 rookie will begin a slow and 
cautious rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, Ellison will have to learn to walk and run all over again, 
the club said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he must get into competitive shape, conditioning his legs for the 
rigors of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
The process will probably keep Ellison out of the lineup until March, when the 
regular season dwindles to its last five or six weeks. The season ends April 
21.

CAL LUTHERAN'S LEE FIGHTS FIRES TO STAY IN SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As summer jobs go, Brenda Lee's is anything but run of the mill. 
</P>
<P>
It is far removed from the basketball court, where she has starred as a 
5-foot-8 guard and forward for California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks 
the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is about as distant from basketball as a player could get during 
the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
She has spent her past four summers as a firefighter for the U.S. Forest 
Service and expects to work in the same capacity next summer. 
</P>
<P>
She became a firefighter at the suggestion of one of her teachers at Quincy 
(Calif.) High near Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my high school teachers, Norm White, was with the forest service over 
the summer, and he said maybe I could get into it because it's a good way to 
stay in shape and the pay is good," Lee said. "So I applied and went through 
the tests you take to get in." 
</P>
<P>
To become a firefighter, Lee, a 21-year-old senior, had to pass written tests 
on chain-saw safety, the care and use of tools and a safety exam. The easiest 
part, for her, was having to run a mile and a half in less than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Lee had doubts about the work, which can be long and tiring. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first summer I thought, 'I don't know if I want to do this again,' 
because it's tough work," she said. "But then I thought it's a good way to stay 
in shape and the money is right." 
</P>
<P>
Lee says that she probably makes more money during the summer than most of her 
teammates and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great for students because you get a lot of work in the time you're 
there," she said. "It's a lot of work, but you get a lot of money for a college 
student." 
</P>
<P>
The work is both mentally and physically stimulating, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps you a lot mentally because you don't just look out for yourself, you 
look out for your crew," Lee said. "Your mind always has to be on it or 
something (bad) can happen." 
</P>
<P>
She said the physical benefits factor into her success on the court for the 
Regals. Lee is the team's offensive leader, averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 
rebounds. She also has 652 rebounds in her college career, which puts her in 
good position to surpass the school record of 753. 
</P>
<P>
Staying in peak condition is especially important to Lee, who competes in three 
sports for Cal Lutheran. She also plays volleyball and softball. 
</P>
<P>
In limited playing time as a utility player in softball last season, she batted 
.308. And she was a starting middle blocker in her first season on the 
volleyball team this season. She was also a hurdler on the track team during 
her freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Lee said, the transition from one sport to the next can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's hard to leave a sport behind because you're used to working with 
certain people and going through a certain routine," she said. "It's hard to 
just walk away from it and go on to another sport. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult because you want to be out there playing, but you don't want to 
get ahead of yourself. It's something you always have to be prepared for. You 
have to be ready at any time to go on to the next sport." 
</P>
<P>
She said it is a particularly difficult transition when a team struggles 
through a losing season, such as the nightmare of a 0-21 season the Regals 
recently completed in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
But even in a dismal season, Lee said there is much that can be learned. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn that winning isn't everything," she said. "You might not like 
(losing), but it helps you build character and that's important." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Lee, the basketball season has started in winning fashion. Cal 
Lutheran is off to a 4-2 start after finishing 7-18 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said that a lot of the team's early success can be traced to Cal Lutheran's 
having all its starters back from last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so nice having people on the team who you've played with before," she 
said. "The people we have now know each other well. And we're tired of losing, 
and now we want to get used to winning. I think we can go into games now with 
confidence, but it's not because of our record but because of the confidence we 
have from being with each other for so long." 
</P>
<P>
She has also seen marked improvement in her play since she started at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've improved from just being a one-dimensional player to one who can 
adjust to different situations," Lee said. "Coming into Cal Lutheran, I was 
just a guard, and since I've been here I've played guard, forward and center. 
Playing all those positions helps you understand the game better and know what 
you have to do out there." 
</P>
<P>
Her growth has not been simply limited to the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've grown as a person and I've grown as a player," Lee said. "As far 
as achieving something for me, I think I've achieved about everything except 
one thing and that's to make All-American in basketball." 
</P>
<P>
It's the desire to make the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics' 
All-American team that drives her. 
</P>
<P>
After her college basketball career, Lee hopes to continue in the sport as a 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I definitely want to work with basketball because that's the sport I 
love and I think I could do well with that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee says it will probably take another year after she graduates in May to 
complete work on her teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
Since the NCAA first held a Division II championship for women's volleyball in 
1981, the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. has been the dominant force in 
the division. In eight seasons of competing, CCAA teams have won four titles. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition could continue when the Division II Elite Eight tournament is 
held today through Saturday at Cal State Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside, which began the playoffs as the No. 4 seed, has a 26-4 record.

VANN MCELROY BACK; STATUS STILL IN DOUBT

<TEXT>
<P>
Vann McElroy, the Raiders' two-time Pro Bowl safety, returned to practice 
Wednesday, meaning that he must be activated this week or next, or cut. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy suffered a calf injury in Game 4. However, he was additionally held out 
of drills for two weeks after he said he was ready, raising speculation that 
the Raiders didn't plan to re-activate him. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy was persuaded to renegotiate his $575,000 contract before the season. 
Instead of the $36,000 he would have been due, he agreed to take an estimated 
$25,000 for any game that he missed because of injury, meaning that the club 
has saved $11,000 for every game he wasn't active. MARK HEISLER

CLU SEARCHING FOR NEW NFL TENANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after the Dallas Cowboys severed their ties with Cal Lutheran, university 
President Jerry Miller said that other NFL teams were interested in moving 
their training camps to the Thousand Oaks school and that the university 
actively would seek another NFL tenant. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been indications that there are other teams who are interested," 
Miller said, "but there hasn't been any direct contact yet." 
</P>
<P>
Miller declined to name teams that had expressed interest in training at Cal 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys, who held their preseason training camp at Cal Lutheran for the 
past 27 summers, ended their relationship with the university Tuesday, citing 
economic and geographical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Cowboys' previous management had signed a contract with Cal 
Lutheran through the summer of 1991, the university does not expect to take 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll work together (with the Cowboys) on a settlement," Miller said. "I'm 
confident that we can work something out that should keep us from getting 
involved in any in-court litigations." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Irving, Tex., on Wednesday, Cowboy owner Jerry Jones 
indicated that the team would pay for any financial loss suffered by Cal 
Lutheran because of the relocation of camp to Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
CLU administrator Dennis Gillette did not have records of the school's profits 
from the Cowboys' stay, but the Thousand Oaks Chamber of Commerce conducted a 
study in 1983 that found that $250,000 flowed into the city annually as a 
result of Dallas' six-week training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that ($250,000 figure) could be increased by at least 10% to 15% now," 
Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran football Coach Bob Shoup said that the Cowboys would be missed in 
Thousand Oaks but not financially. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of different organizations that would like to be here at 
Cal Lutheran not related to sports," Shoup said. "I don't think we'll suffer 
filling the dorms and filling summer activities. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollars that the Cowboys pay to Cal Lutheran is certainly consistent with 
what we'd charge any other group." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley radio station KWNK will continue to carry Cowboy games, according 
to General Manager Manny Cabranes.

IT'S A NATURAL: SIMILAR SERRA AND LOMPOC COLLIDE FOR CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Serra High football Coach Leo Hand sees many similarities between his Cavaliers 
and the Lompoc Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Both are quick. Both run unorthodox offenses. And both boast perfect records 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, Hand believes that Serra and Lompoc deserve to play for the 
CIF-Southern Section Division VII title at 7:30 Saturday night at El Camino 
College. It's no fluke when the top seed (Lompoc) ends up meeting the No. 2 
seed (Serra) in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Lompoc is well-suited for us, and we're well-suited for them," said 
Serra's first-year coach. "It should be a great game." 
</P>
<P>
In the only Southern Section final matching unbeaten teams, Serra will put its 
13-0 record and hard-hitting reputation on the line against a Lompoc team that 
is also 13-0 and features perhaps the best running back in the division. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Napolean Kaufman has been virtually unstoppable, averaging 9.5 yards 
per carry on his way to 2,051 yards rushing. The 5-foot-8, 155-pound junior has 
scored 35 touchdowns five ways: 28 on runs, two on pass receptions, two on 
interceptions, two on kickoff returns and one on a punt return. 
</P>
<P>
His versatility obviously poses problems for Serra, but Hand says it would be a 
big mistake to overlook the other starters in Lompoc's wing-T backfield. 
Quarterback Jason Garife has passed for 972 yards and eight touchdowns and 
rushed for 588 yards and 10 TDs. Fullback Milton Royster has rushed for 704 
yards and eight TDs. 
</P>
<P>
In defeating Mira Costa, Chaminade and Temple City in the playoffs, the Braves 
have averaged 42 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to defense everybody," Hand said. "We just can't zero in on (Kaufman) 
and leave ourselves vulnerable to the other players." 
</P>
<P>
Serra's aggressive defense is coming off perhaps its best effort last week in a 
12-3 semifinal win over Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks. The Cavaliers gave up 185 
total yards and forced five turnovers. Jerald Henry had two interceptions, 
sophomore Chris Long had one pick-off, and Louis Laffitte and Rodney Lands 
recovered fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Serra's full-house backfield has accounted for 3,882 yards and 57 rushing 
touchdowns. Fullback Dennis Gerard leads the team with 1,681 yards and 26 
touchdowns, but halfback Lamont Daniel (956 yards, 10 TDs) has been the leading 
rusher each of the last two games. He had 134 yards on 14 carries last week. 
</P>
<P>
Hand said he will not hesitate to use backup quarterback Alex Marcelin if the 
situation calls for it. Marcelin, the team's passing specialist, played most of 
the game against Notre Dame and completed a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide 
receiver Donald Godden, who has scoring catches in Serra's three playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are seeking their school's first CIF football title. A bridesmaid 
five times, Lompoc is making its sixth appearance in the finals. Serra will 
make its second trip to the finals, having lost to Schurr in the 1980 
Southeastern Conference title game. 
</P>
<P>
In the L.A. City 4-A semifinals: 
</P>
<P>
Carson (9-1) vs. Crenshaw (8-4) at Veterans Stadium, 7:30 p.m. Friday -- The 
Pacific League champion Colts face third-place Crenshaw in a rematch of a game 
won by Carson, 39-12, on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never cared for playing someone we've played before," Carson Coach Gene 
Vollnogle said. "It's tough to get the kids to come back and play a good game. 
It's the same problem we've had against Banning." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle hopes his defense, anchored by middle linebacker Nkosi Littleton, can 
keep Crenshaw running back Kevin Hicks in check. Hicks has led Crenshaw to 
playoff wins over San Fernando and Taft of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Carson, the defending 4-A champion, is coming off a 31-0 victory 
over Kennedy of Granada Hills after drawing a bye in the first round. The Colt 
offense was paced by quarterback Armin Youngblood, who passed for three scores 
to give him a single-season school record of 27 touchdown throws. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood has completed 107 of 212 attempts for 2,135 yards. His primary 
receiver, Michael Ross, has 42 catches for 803 yards and 14 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
Carson is down to its third-string left offensive tackle after Ben Leui 
suffered a separated shoulder last week, but Vollnogle is confident Frank 
Padilla and Junior Auelua can do the job.

PATIENT GRANT SLOWS VELASQUEZ, DEFEATS BURROUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grant High played a game of keep away in the second half to hand Burroughs its 
first loss, 63-50, Wednesday night in a nonleague contest at Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers, a well-conditioned unit under the watchful eye and shrill voice of 
Coach Howard Levine, repeatedly moved the ball around the perimeter in search 
of the high-percentage shot. 
</P>
<P>
After seven, eight, sometimes nine passes (Grant fans gleefully tallied them in 
unison), the Lancers would cash in with a basket. Senior forward Setro Terzian, 
whose 13 points all came in the second half, most often made the deposit. 
</P>
<P>
"I chewed them out at halftime for not being patient enough," said Levine, 
whose team improved to 3-0. "We thought if we could move the ball patiently 
enough, we'd get some pretty decent shots." 
</P>
<P>
Added Terzian: "And make them tired." 
</P>
<P>
Grant's best keep-away tactic, however, was denying Burroughs senior center Ray 
Velasquez a good shot in the second half. Burroughs (3-1) led, 24-23, at 
halftime on the strength of 13 points by Velasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, however, held Velasquez to only five points in the second half, when the 
Lancers outscored the Indians, 40-26. Velasquez, a 6-foot-4, 260-pound transfer 
from Hoover, had scored 75 points in three games and was the most valuable 
player of the Burbank-Hoover tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, I wasn't shooting at all," said Velasquez, who was two for 
eight from the field in the second half. "It was the worst shooting game I had 
all year. I wasn't forcing anything -- they just wouldn't drop." 
</P>
<P>
"They did a good job on him," Burroughs Coach Ira Sollod said. "They were a 
little better than I expected. But I think it was more ourselves taking us out 
of our game. We had two or three guys out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
Grant closed both the first and third quarters with 9-0 runs and led, 51-32, 
after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers led, 13-7, after one quarter as sixth-man Billy May, who tied 
Velasquez with a game-high 18 points, and Keith Weinstein, who finished with 16 
points, each made three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Burroughs weathered a shooting spell colder than an Alaskan frontal 
system, missing 12 consecutive shots from the field before Velasquez made one 
to pull the Indians to within 18-10. 
</P>
<P>
Then Burroughs got hot. Senior guard Marnie Calderon, who made 50 of 100 
three-point shots last season, and Velasquez connected on consecutive 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, who scored nine points in the second quarter, added consecutive 
short jump shots and Burroughs went to the locker room with a one-point lead.

Cal State Dominguez Hills outscored visiting Azusa Pacific University, 29-15, 
to open the second half, then went to a four-corner offense to take a 77-70 
non-conference basketball victory Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills (1-5), ended a five-game losing streak, the worst start in the 
school's history. Azusa Pacific fell to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills trailed by five points in the first 12 minutes of the game but 
took the lead for good, 24-21, on a three-point basket by senior forward Brian 
Johnson with 5:16 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills, which led by three points at the half, opened a 48-38 lead 
four minutes into the second half. Azusa Pacific cut that to 48-45 with 13 
minutes to go, but then the Toros ran off 11 unanswered points. 
</P>
<P>
Coach David Yanai of Dominguez Hills, who started three freshmen for the fifth 
consecutive time, was pleased with the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We had good recognition from an offensive standpoint of the type of shots we 
needed to take," he said. "We got the good shot selection we needed to get from 
different people. In the previous five games we didn't execute as well as we 
thought we should have at this point in the season." 
</P>
<P>
The teams combined to commit 30 turnovers, but Dominguez Hills made 21 of 28 
free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Robert Barksdale (25 points) shared high-scoring honors with Azusa 
Pacific's Matt Burns. Other players in double figures were Brian Johnson (18) 
and Vincent Washington (15) of Dominguez Hills and Patrick McMann and Jeff 
Hester of the Cougars. PAUL McLEOD

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

CLARK SCORES 45 IN TRIUMPHANT RETURN IN SMALL SCHOOLS INVITATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This time there were no lawyers, no television cameras and no press releases. 
This time there were no rumors, no appeals and very little frustration. This 
time Tony Clark was playing basketball rather than being entangled in it. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday at the second San Diego Small Schools Invitational at La Jolla Country 
Day, the big man from Christian set three tournament records and held off a 
late surge by Capristrano Valley Christian to preserve a 71-68 opening round 
victory for the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
What a long, strange, trip it has been. 
</P>
<P>
It began in mid-June, with Clark's decision to transfer from Division I 
Valhalla, where he was the leading scorer in the county and the San Diego 
section Player of the Year, to Division IV Christian. 
</P>
<P>
It heightened when Section Commissioner Kendall Webb declared Clark ineligible 
for athletics, on grounds of possible recruiting violations stemming from a May 
dinner meeting involving the parents of six top county players. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the question of what college he would play for -- Arizona, it turned out 
-- hung in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Finally it ended. On Nov. 16, his remaining high school eligibility was 
restored by a Section Board of Managers subcommittee, on an appeal by his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
At long last, Clark fielded questions concerning his first official high school 
on-court performance since the spring, when Valhalla lost 79-67 to San Diego in 
Division I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
And he gave quite a show. In his Patriot debut, Clark had 45 points, including 
five three-pointers, 16 rebounds, five blocked shots, and a nasty cold. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have been better," said Clark, who scored Christian's first 16 
points. "We started out like a ball of fire, but then we relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Christian outscored Capistrano Valley Christian 18-11 in both the first and 
second quarters, but the Eagles' switch to a full-court pressure defense 
crimped Christian's, namely Clark's, scoring effectiveness in the second half. 
CVC outscored Christian, 46-35, after the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a long way to go as a team," Christian Coach Randy Wright said. "Our 
inexperience really showed and there's lots of work to do on defense." KIM Q. 
BERKSHIREIn other games: San Diego Small Schools tournament Parker 51, 
Army-Navy 50 -- Dan Cabban scored 13 of his 14 points in the second half to 
lead Parker. Teammate Glen Knight had 20 points as did Philip Parks of 
Army-Navy. St. Gregory's (Tucson) 78, La Jolla Country Day 61 -- St. Gregory's 
Donne Clark dominated the game by scoring 20 points, grabbing 17 rebounds and 
blocking seven shots. Hilltop Tournament Ramona 53, Santana 30 -- Alfonso De La 
Neuz had a game high 21 points for Ramona in its opening victory (1-0) at 
Grossmont High. Only five players scored for Santana (0-1). De La Neuz also had 
four steals and three 3-pointers. Todd Johnson, after only one day of practice, 
grabbed nine rebounds. Point Loma 50, Hoover 31 -- J.J. Stokes scored 21 for 
the Pointers (1-2). Hoover stayed winless for the tournament. Kearny 60, 
Hilltop 56 -- Tommy Rawlins scored the go-ahead basket for Kearny with 30 
seconds to go as Kearny overcame a fourth-quarter eight-point deficit. Rawlins 
ended with 15 points as did teammate Darnay Scott. Carlos Gonzales had 14 for 
Hilltop. Norsemen-Warhawk Tournament Patrick Henry 60, Lincoln 55 -- Jason 
Lonsdale had a game-high 17 points and pulled down 16 rebounds to help keep the 
Patriots undefeated (4-0). Teammates Danny Kotnik (12) and Ross Edwards (11) 
also scored in doubles figures. Henry's 26 point second quarter gave it a 33-27 
halftime lead. Coronado 70, Madison 64 -- Derek Wastila scored 15 of his 27 
points in the fourth quarter as Coronado came from behind and wiped out a 
seven-point defecit. Other nonleague games: San Pasqual 72, Indio 49 -- For the 
third time in four games, Bryan Banner scored at least 20 points for San 
Pasqual (4-0). This time out, the 6-foot-6 senior forward came away with 
exactly 20. Teammate David Duerrst, a 6-1 sophomore, added 10 points. San 
Pasqual now heads into the second round of the River/Romona tournament in 
Riverside against Glendora, the state's Division II runnerup a year ago. 
Lutheran 56, St. Margarets 54 -- Jeff Hooper poured in 24 points for Lutheran 
and teammate Steve Hinaman added 10 points and five steals as Lutheran opened 
its season. St. Augustine 78, West Hills 37 -- Bryan Cantwell's 30 points 
helped the Saints even its season record (3-3).

IT'S TWO FOR THE 2-A SHOW: LINCOLN VS. EL CAMINO FOR TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
LINCOLN: THEIR ANGRY YOUNG MEN, WITH HELP FROM A SPEEDY NEWCOMER, GAINED A 
MEASURE OF REVENGE AND A BERTH IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lincoln High's football team had 21 angry young men, all seniors, who vowed to 
put to rest a two-year-old inferiority complex. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, the Hornets did indeed advance to the San Diego Section semifinals in 
1987 and 1988. Nothing to be ashamed of, but what gnawed at them was the fact 
that one team -- San Pasqual -- had terminated their title aspirations each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"We went in last year talking revenge," said Thomas Baker, a senior outside 
linebacker and blocking back at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But revenge was not to come. Not then, anyway. San Pasqual, which came from 
behind in the 1987 game to edge Lincoln, 28-27, last year routed the Hornets, 
40-29. 
</P>
<P>
As fate would have it, this season Lincoln and San Pasqual again advanced 
through the preliminary rounds only to meet each other in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Here was one final opportunity for Lincoln's seniors to prove they could indeed 
topple the North County power. One final opportunity to advance to San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium, where the section finals are waged each year. One final 
opportunity to put themselves in position to earn a 2-A championship, something 
San Pasqual did in '87. 
</P>
<P>
Last chance -- better take it. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln did, coming from behind twice in the final three minutes to pull out a 
stunning, 35-32, victory. (Lincoln plays El Camino for the title at 5 p.m. 
Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
But this could hardly be called revenge. The senior almost singularly 
responsible for the final touchdown which came with less than 30 seconds 
remaining was the only senior on the team who did not experience either of the 
failures of the past two autumns. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Dean did not play football for Lincoln the past two years because of 
eligibility problems. But without Dean this year, the Hornets most likely would 
not have advanced to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've ever been on a team where the result of a game is 
in the hands of one player," said Terrell Davis, a senior running back. 
</P>
<P>
Against San Pasqual, Dean took a kickoff at his 23 with 34 seconds showing. San 
Pasqual had just went ahead, 35-32, following a nine-play, 58-yard drive. But 
that lead was short-lived because Dean ran the kickoff back 77 yards for a 
touchdown and gave Lincoln the margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
That was only an encore. Dean started the show the previous week in the 
quarterfinals against Grossmont. With the Hornets trailing, 25-19, Dean fielded 
a punt at his 21, bobbled it, picked it up a second time, looked straight ahead 
and dashed 79 yards into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
His touchdown return tied the score and put Lincoln into position to later win 
in a California tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Just luck? 
</P>
<P>
Not really. Dean has returned seven punts or kickoffs for touchdowns this year. 
And the punt return against Grossmont came amid some odd circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"The officials were calling everything," said Bakir Madyun, one of the top 
offensive linemen in the county, who was supposed to be blocking during the 
punt return. "So we were scared to block and we ended up just standing in their 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Dean's main attribute is his speed. 
</P>
<P>
"He may be the fastest player on the team," said Vic Player, Lincoln coach. 
</P>
<P>
That's saying something because all four runners of Lincoln's state-qualifying 
400-meter relay team, which turned in a 41.6 last spring (Dwayne McAfee, 
Charles Brown, Scott Hammond and Doug Boyd), play football. 
</P>
<P>
But wait, that's not all. The Hornets' 1,600-meter relay team, eighth fastest 
in the county last year (Hammond, Davis, John McCartney and Hanno Readen) also 
play football. 
</P>
<P>
But Dean's teammates and coaches say the returns are the result of more than 
just speed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has the vision," Davis said. "And it's natural. He can feel it when 
he's going to get hit, and he ends up making all the right moves." 
</P>
<P>
Vic Player, Lincoln coach, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a feeling," he said. "It's all natural. It's nothing he works at or 
nothing we can teach, he just has it. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm sure glad he discovered it the last couple games." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Dean has discovered it. He's been questioned about it and he's dwelled on 
it. But now he says he must forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
He too speaks of his touchdown returns as a reliance on instinct or reaction -- 
something not to be thought of if success is to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to take it like I always do," he said. "I'll practice hard this 
week and play my best Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
While Dean's late-game heroics have singled him out on a team heavy in team 
unity and light in individual superstars, they have also given the team reason 
to listen to another player, wide receiver Dwayne McAfee, who all season has 
been convincing the Hornets that "as long as there's still time left on the 
clock, we can win." 
</P>
<P>
Some players say McAfee's sideline rousting can become irritating. But they 
also say he has instilled an attitude in the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be sitting down on the sideline and he tells us to get up," Baker said. 
"He tells the crowd to get up and make some noise. And he does make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
"He even yells at the cheerleaders," Player said. 
</P>
<P>
McAfee gets his inspiration from a Bible passage. 
</P>
<P>
"Philippians 4:13 says we can do all things through Christ which strengthen us, 
and that's the attitude this team has," he said. "Hey, San Pasqual is a good 
football team. They're big and strong and they have a big offensive line that 
they marched behind and scored with a few seconds remaining. But still we 
didn't give up." 
</P>
<P>
Added Charles Brown, a senior running back, "I know we had enough time to win 
even if Victor had gotten tackled. The offense would have taken over and moved 
down field as it can. I know we had enough time." 
</P>
<P>
Call it a team-wide attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the two games we lost (to Southwest, 21-18, and to Crawford, 13-6), they 
were saying we didn't lose the games, we just ran out of time," Player said.

<P>
It's been five years since Joe Malek and Brian Madlangbayan sat in San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium watching El Camino defeat Chula Vista, 24-17, for the 2-A 
Section football title. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, as teammates on the local Pop Warner team, they dreamed of growing 
up and playing for El Camino on that same turf for that same title. 
</P>
<P>
Their dream of growing up hasn't exactly come true -- Malek stands all of 
5-feet-2 and Madlangbayan is an imposing 5-6 -- but they will be on the field 
at 5 p.m. Saturday when El Camino plays Lincoln for the 2-A title at Jack 
Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And the two "gromits," as they were nicknamed by teammate Ricky Spears, will be 
in the starting backfield for the 12-1 Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Madlangbayan's running and Malek's passing are major reasons why El 
Camino is making its first trip to the semifinals since '84. 
</P>
<P>
Madlangbayan has been the more prolific -- running for 1,562 yards and a 
school-record 26 touchdowns. He was named to the first-team All-Avocado League 
team. He is within 98 yards of breaking Toussant Tyler's single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
Malek, though, has been the bigger surprise. He has somehow found a way to 
throw for 662 yards and seven touchdowns with just two interceptions in 90 
attempts. In El Camino's three playoff games, Malek has completed 19 of 26 
passes. He has also rushed for 161 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people knew how good Brian was," El Camino Coach Herb Meyer said. "But 
I think Joe running around showing these big people up has surprised some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Malek admits he'd have to be considered one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really thought I'd be a quarterback at this level," Malek said. 
</P>
<P>
Listed in the program at 5-4 -- Malek wrote 5-4 1/2 instead of 5-1 1/2 two 
years ago -- Malek began his football career as a safety on the seventh grade 
Pop Warner team. 
</P>
<P>
But the next year, Malek got this crazy idea he could play quarterback. And 
what made it even crazier was the belief that he could beat out Jerry Garrett 
-- a former star quarterback for Oceanside High -- for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, Malek won the job and moved Garrett to wingback. The rest of the 
backfield included Madlangbayan at fullback and O.J. Hall, a Rancho Buena Vista 
tailback who finished fourth in the county in rushing with 1,285 yards. 
Naturally, the team went undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Malek said his size has limited his opportunities to pass, but his small 
stature hasn't been a big problem. And he has made believers of his teammates 
</P>
<P>
"I've had this disability, but I've learned to work around it," said Malek, 
whose father is 6-0 and mother is all of 4-11. "I belong out there. I have this 
talent. I play like any other quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
But even Meyer, maybe Malek's No. 1 fan, said he had his doubts for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt he could run the option without any problems, but the big 
concern was that he limited our passing attack," Meyer said. "We had to change 
some things . . . for Joe, but in the second half of the season he's done a 
real good job. I think the San Pasqual game is where Joe started to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Before El Camino's 27-0 victory over previously undefeated San Pasqual, Meyer 
said Malek sometimes tried to carry the entire team. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe had a little bit of a superman's complex," Meyer said. "He thought he had 
to do everything himself. I think I was pushing him a little too much, early 
on, and he didn't respond to that too well. Joe is also a very intense 
competitor and a perfectionist." 
</P>
<P>
Madlangbayan said his best friend has always been that way. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets so emotional because he wants to get every play perfect," Madlangbayan 
said. "That's when I have to be there and get him to relax a little." 
</P>
<P>
If Malek is the high-strung type, then Madlangbayan is just the opposite. Meyer 
said Madlangbayan is not a stoic, but he's close. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian is not a real fireball type of guy," Meyer said. "No matter how hard he 
gets hit, he just bounces right back up like nothing happened. That kind of 
thing is infectious." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes though Madlangbayan is too tough for his own good. He played part of 
last week's 49-0 victory over Ramona with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even remember third and fourth quarter," he said. "They told me I ran 
for a two-point conversion, but I don't remember it." 
</P>
<P>
He does remember the season and career he's had at El Camino though. And when 
he reflects on it, he finds it a little hard to fathom. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd have told me a couple years ago that I'd break the touchdown record 
and rush for 1,500 yards, I'd have laughed," said Madlangbayan, a starter since 
his ninth game as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
But those big linemen aren't laughing while trying to find, then catch the 5-6, 
190-pounder. "I don't run straight up and I'm so small they can't really see 
me," he said. "So they can't ever really get a good hit on me." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer recalled one run in particular against Santana which typified 
Madlangbayan's style. 
</P>
<P>
"About the whole team had a shot at him and he cut back across the field about 
three times and wound up scoring a touchdown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian plays about as deep as any back I've seen -- sometimes nine yards behind 
the quarterback. But he's got such great cutback ability and vision that we 
tell the linemen to hold their blocks an extra second. He's short in stature, 
but he plays like a guy 6-1 or 6-2."

GROSSMONT COACH'S AWARD GIVES SEASON PERFECT END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colleen Suwara, Grossmont College's women's volleyball coach, was named 
national community college coach of the year Tuesday by the American Volleyball 
Coaches Assn., punctuating a terrific season in which the Griffins finished 
27-1 and won their second state championship in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a tremendous amount of fun with this team this year," Suwara said. "They 
were very willing to work hard and it paid off. (The award) was exciting, but 
winning the state championship was even better because all the girls got to 
participate in the celebration." 
</P>
<P>
The celebration came Sunday afternoon when Grossmont defeated De Anza College, 
15-9, 15-7, 7-15, 15-7, in the tournament final at Citrus College in Cerritos. 
The Griffins had advanced by beating De Anza Sunday morning in the winner's 
bracket final, 10-15, 15-2, 15-12, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont's Suzy Schutz was chosen the tournament's most valuable player, 
joining teammates Vicky Cavadias and Eliana Penido on the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
In four tournament matches, including 3-1 and 3-0 victories over Cabrillo and 
El Camino Saturday, Schutz led Grossmont with 86 kills, 84 digs and five 
service aces. Cavadias, a setter, had 174 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomores Schutz and Cavadias are local players from Grossmont High who Suwara 
expects to be heavily recruited. Schutz was voted Grossmont's most valuable 
player by her teammates.

Penido, a freshman from Rio de Janeiro, has been a pleasant surprise for 
Suwara. About a year ago, Penido called Suwara to ask if she could play at 
Grossmont. Suwara told Penido she would have to try out just like everybody 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Penido, who had played in clubs in Brazil, not only made the team, but became a 
standout and was selected the most valuable player of the Pacific Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
A car accident three weeks ago threatened the remainder of Penido's season 
leaving her with an injured shoulder. It wasn't until three days before the 
state tournament that Penido was given medical clearance to play. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors said she wouldn't further damage the shoulder, but she would be 
limited in what she could do," Suwara said. "You could tell the shoulder was 
hurting her, and she was playing in a lot of pain, but she played great." 
</P>
<P>
Penido wasn't the only ailing Griffin. Cavadias also had a sore shoulder and a 
case of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
This was Grossmont's third consecutive state tournament appearance. The 
Griffins won the title in 1987 and finished seventh last year. In five years 
under Suwara, Grossmont has won five PCC titles and has not lost a conference 
match since 1985, a streak of 52 matches. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont's only loss this year was to Miami Dade, the national champion. 
(California teams do not participate in the national tournament.) But Grossmont 
avenged that loss defeating Dade in a tournament a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
Is Suwara looking to move on? No, she says, offering praise to five-year 
assistants Paul Tucker and Steve Mitchell. "I'm real happy at Grossmont 
College." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Dabasinskas, a former football standout at San Pasqual High, completed two 
days of interviewing for a Rhodes Scholarship Wednesday at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Dabasinskas, a center with a 3.87 grade-point-average and Trojan swimmer Ray 
Looze are trying to become only the second Pac 10 athlete to earn the 
distinction. Pat Haden was the first. 
</P>
<P>
Dabasinskas, a 6-foot-5, 255-pound junior who has been hampered by injuries, 
said regardless of whether he attends Oxford or not he will skip his senior 
year of football to continue his education. Dabasinskas will graduate in May 
with a degree in Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can play at this level, but it hasn't worked out," Dabasinskas was 
quoted in a press release. "Now I'm glad I didn't put all my eggs in one 
basket. I'm glad I emphasized academics as well." 
</P>
<P>
USC's Junior Seau, the section player of the year in 1986 from Oceanside High, 
was chosen to the Associated Press' All-America second team. Seau, a linebacker 
who was a Prop. 48 his freshman season, was also chosen as USC's most valuable 
player leading the Trojans with 18 sacks and 67 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Who is Mark Kraatz? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the answer can be found in Who's Who in Athletics In American Colleges 
and Universities, a new book to be released by the publishers of Who's Who in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Gladson Nwanna, the president of the Athletic Press of 
America, its maiden edition is expected to have 1,000 listings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only criterion is that the student-athletes be outstanding in the various 
areas of athletic participation," Nwanna said. "Part of the nomination form 
asks for the GPA, but we made that optional." 
</P>
<P>
Now, for those who can't wait and those who did not already know, Kraatz is a 
senior guard for Christian Heritage men's basketball team. He is a two-time 
National Christian College Athletic Assn. All-American. He led the NCCAA in 
assists with a 10.1 average and carries a 3.4 grade-point-average in education 
graduate classes. 
</P>
<P>
A fact not listed in the book is that Kraatz, 22, is married to the former 
Susan Peschke, who works in the Hawks' athletic department. The two have known 
each other since high school.

PHOTOGRAPHERS, SCHOLARS TO FOCUS THEIR LENSES ON BORDER ISSUES 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A symposium in conjunction with a photo exhibit exploring life on the 
U.S.-Mexican border will be held Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium and exhibit, jointly titled "Los Vecinos" (The Neighbors), are 
organized by the Museum of Photographic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, on display at the museum through Jan. 7, features the work of 
seven photographers who each chose one aspect of border life on which to focus. 
The symposium, which is free and open to the public, will include a number of 
panel discussions that further explore the issues addressed by the 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium begins Friday at 9:30 a.m. at the Recital Hall in the Palisades 
area of Balboa Park, next to the Marie Hitchcock Puppet Theater. The first 
session is on "Cultural and Economic Integration at the Border" and includes 
photographer Elizabeth Sisco, and commentators Lawrence Herzog and Richard 
Sinkin. 
</P>
<P>
Sisco's work in the exhibit explores the tourist industry in Tijuana and the 
stereotypes common to both sides of the border. Herzog is an associate 
professor of Mexican American studies at San Diego State University. Sinkin is 
managing director of the San Diego-based Interamerican Holdings Co. 
</P>
<P>
Photographers Don Bartletti and Graciela Iturbide will be joined by commentator 
Susan Tiano for the 1 p.m. session, titled "Family and Daily Life Along the 
U.S./Mexico Border." Bartletti, a staff photographer for the San Diego County 
edition of The Times, has documented living conditions for undocumented workers 
in North County. Iturbide explored the subculture of cholos, disenfranchised 
youths who have their own style of dress and talk and who often are gang 
members. Tiano is an associate professor of sociology at the University of New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
At 3:30 p.m., photographers Antonio Turok and Susan Meiselas and commentators 
Kitty Calavita and America Rodriguez will discuss "Immigration and Migration." 
Turok's exhibition photos follow two Guatemalans as they make their way from 
their homeland to San Diego, while Meiselas accompanied the U.S. Border Patrol 
on their rounds of the region. Calavita is an assistant professor of social 
ecology at the UC Irvine and Rodriguez, who coordinated the symposium, is a 
free-lance reporter for National Public Radio with a specialty in immigration 
and border politics. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium continues Saturday at 10 a.m. at the Centro Cultural de la Raza 
in Balboa Park with a session titled "National Perspectives on the Border." 
Photographers Liliana Nieto del Rio and Pablo Ortiz Monasterio will be joined 
by commentators Peter Smith and Jorge Bustamante. Nieto del Rio's exhibit 
photos focus on the youngsters who live and work on the streets of Tijuana, and 
Monasterio explored the maquiladora industry. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is a professor of political science, adjunct professor of international 
relations and Pacific studies, and Simon Bolivar professor of Latin American 
studies at UCSD. Bustamante is director of the Border Studies Center at the 
Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana.

SOVIETS TWIRL AND LEAP INTO SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
ACROBATICS: TROUPE PROVIDES A BUFFET OF ROUTINES FOR AUDIENCES AT THE OLD GLOBE 
THEATRE.

<P>
They twirl, they leap, they balance, they dance. 
</P>
<P>
They are the Soviet Acrobatic Revue at the Old Globe Theatre, and if the 
American premiere of this Soviet import proves anything, it is that a circus in 
any country is still a circus. 
</P>
<P>
Thus said, this one-ring troupe provides a dandy little divertissement, with 
talented performers who are eager to please. It is not the ultimate circus and 
certainly not the ultimate acrobatic revue, despite the considerable charm and 
skill of its performers -- four of which are family acts. And it does not help 
to have the very practiced and justly acclaimed "Le Cirque du Soleil" 
performing simultaneously on the other side of Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Acrobatic Revue, a last-minute replacement for the Peking Acrobats 
whose visas were held up by the Chinese government in the wake of the summer 
uprising in Beijing, was assembled by promoter Don Hughes as a collage of top 
Soviet dance, acrobatic and comic acts. 
</P>
<P>
What the troupe provides, consequently, is a sampler of many styles of 
performance -- a buffet of some sparkling individual numbers that never quite 
find the common harmony that would blend the parts into a whole. 
</P>
<P>
The brevity of the 21 acts (at about six minutes each) -- beautifully costumed 
in great bursts of color -- worked best with the children in the audience who 
moved easily from the oohing and aahing over Shamhal and Muhtar Abakarov, the 
Daghestan father and son tightrope walkers (imagine walking blindfolded and in 
a black sack across the high wire) to the giggles elicited by the clown, Sergei 
Alexandrevich Pavlov, who seems to have no problem tap dancing, juggling and 
making faces while he plays "Blue Moon" on the trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
Still there is something for the unjaded of any age here: Charlie Chaplin and 
the little flower girl gliding gracefully on roller ice skates (Alexander 
Rozanov and Liliya Mandrychenko); a birdlike contortionist (Rusanna Vardanyan), 
complete with white wings, transforming her body atop a bird cage; a 
beautifully fluid acrobat (Inga Dianova) doing her twists, turns and loops 
inside a steel ring balanced on husband Ahmed Dianov's forehead. 
</P>
<P>
And a Cossack who does his flips with spears (Mikhail Sklyadnev); the brick 
juggling by the remarkably cheerful Anvar Dianov who performs as if it is a 
rare kick rather than a challenge to balance 15 bricks while putting on his 
jacket; the athletic dancing of a five-member company that includes the show's 
artistic director, Uriy Zamyatnin, and athletics so smooth, it looked like 
dancing from Ivan Pristupa, wife Ludmila Pristupa and Uriy Sugrobov. 
</P>
<P>
Another quality the Soviets have in common with their grease-painted brethren 
everywhere is the trick of making tricks look easy. There were intimations of 
how difficult some of these numbers are when Vladimir Serov, riding a unicycle 
on a slack wire, almost dropped the fifth cup he was balancing on the fifth 
saucer on his head. Blame opening night jitters if you will, but not Serov, who 
distinguished himself later with balancing upside down on a teapot on a 
sideways unicycle that he pedaled with his hands across the slack wire. 
(Serov's partner, wife Iraida Serova, also handled five hula hoops on a 
unicycle with evident ease.) 
</P>
<P>
The show ended with the Soviet and United States flags side by side, a trick 
that got the biggest applause of all from the opening-night audience -- another 
difference between the Soviet Acrobatic Revue and Le Cirque, which does not 
wave a Canadian or American flag at the end of its show. The way to tell when 
glasnost is really here is when such self-conscious demonstrations of 
friendship seem unnecessarily quaint. 
</P>
<P>

ENSEMBLE OFFERS A RIVETING LOOK AT MEDIEVAL PAGEANTS

<P>
Can music drama from the 12th Century have the emotional tug of verismo opera 
and the dramatic punch of Brechtian theater? 
</P>
<P>
At St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral on Tuesday night, Frederick Renz's Ensemble 
for Early Music gave that unlikely theoretical question a decidedly affirmative 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe of 20 New York City musicians, all singers except for three 
instrumentalists, performed "Herod and the Innocents," a conflation of two 
medieval mystery plays based on the biblical Nativity narratives. In this 
piece, singing shepherds and Magi visit the Holy Family, and Herod oversees his 
vengeful infanticide to stirring musical cadence. 
</P>
<P>
With a minimum of props and set, but a highly imaginative repertory of stylized 
gesture and liturgical procession, the ensemble gave a riveting, vivid account 
of these medieval pageants. 
</P>
<P>
"Herod and the Innocents" could hardly have found a more sympathetic setting 
than the local cathedral. When the players entered singing in slow procession 
through the darkened church, they heightened the dramatic expectation 
significantly. And, when the angel-narrator sang perched on the triple-arch 
set, with the cathedral's half-finished organ facade as backdrop, the montage 
of sacred symbols was indeed striking. 
</P>
<P>
Although the music in the 12th-Century play manuscripts is exclusively vocal 
and primarily monophonic, like Gregorian chant,Renz's ensemble elaborated the 
musical fabric with polyphonic fragments and continuous but discreet 
instrumental accompaniment. Unlike the ethereal chant as practiced by the monks 
of Solemnes, however, the style of most of this singing was rhythmic and highly 
inflected. 
</P>
<P>
From a purist's perspective, the Ensemble for Early Music under Renz's 
direction courted inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
True to the period, it employed only male voices for this ecclesiastical art 
form. The sole female, Gabrielle Brite, played the non-singing role of Mary, 
and Rachel's extended lament over the murdered innocent children was 
passionately sung by countertenor Douglas Stevens. But the lute and hammered 
dulcimer interpolations, as evocative as they sounded, would not have been 
likely instruments for a church function. 
</P>
<P>
The highly dramatic lighting, designed by Robert Graham Small, was also a 
distinctly modern accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
Notable singers were David Frye as the archangel, whose resonant tenor voice 
gracefully filled the cathedral, and Stevens, whose countertenor instrument was 
both penetrating and lyrical. Peter Becker had the passion for Herod's deranged 
malevolence, but his weak bass-baritone did not adequately support his 
character. 
</P>
<P>
The performance concluded with the moving Gregorian "Te Deum" sung by a 
procession that snaked through the cathedral aisles.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: DESPITE THE COMPARISONS, ULMER DOES OWN 
THING(S) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beyond jazz's mainstream and outside the confines of commercial jazz radio, 
singer and guitarist James Blood Ulmer continues his idiosyncratic 
explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Ulmer, who plays two shows at the Spirit Club in San Diego this Friday night, 
has often been linked to jazzman Ornette Coleman and rock guitarist Jimi 
Hendrix. In truth, he's one of the few true originals around. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Ulmer, the press has overemphasized his ties to Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
"I never played with him. Yeah, he played guitar, but the only guitar player I 
listen to is Wes Montgomery." 
</P>
<P>
On the 1987 album "America -- Do You Remember the Love?," his last American 
release, Ulmer's vocals call to mind the earthy storytelling of Taj Mahal, 
while his best guitar work has a melodic, meditative quality due in part to the 
unusual tunings he uses. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Ulmer explained, all strings are tuned to the same note, so that 
open strings create a harmonic drone like the effect achieved by Indian 
sitarists. Although Ulmer's guitar work on his vocal numbers tends to be sparse 
and supportive of the singing, on instrumental tunes his improvisations often 
become collages of fiery, staccato fragments that reveal his '60s and '70s 
experiences with avant garde saxophonists Coleman and Arthur Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
After years of recording pretty much what pleased him, which made albums like 
"America" a rich mix of the danceable and the cerebral, Ulmer is changing his 
tactics in search of a broader following. Now, instead of doing earthy vocal 
songs side by side with searing, spacey instrumentals, Ulmer has two bands, one 
for each of the two directions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of being related to as a weird guitar player who does everything at 
once," Ulmer said. "More innovative, creative musical ideas create an elite 
audience. Now I'm trying to expand my audiences." 
</P>
<P>
With the group Phalanx, Ulmer continues to explore his instrumental music. He's 
appearing in San Diego with his other band, which supports the vocal music he 
refers to as his "blues thing." This band includes bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma 
and percussionist Calvin Weston, both of whom also played with Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Currently without an American recording deal, Ulmer has two albums due for 
release early next year: "James Blood Ulmer's Blues Experience," and a session 
with drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson and bassist Bill Laswell. He's hoping to 
make his next album for a U.S. label. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he wants to reach a larger audience, Ulmer doesn't care to predict 
which radio format might accommodate his music. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord, I don't know that. If I had to figure that out and write music, too, I'd 
be in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Ulmer plays shows at 9 and 11:15. Opening will be The Crows, combining members 
of Manhattan Transfer and the Mighty Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
After Ulmer kicks it off, the Week of the Guitarist continues Tuesday night, 
Dec. 12, in the San Diego City College Theater with a debut performance by Jim 
Storey with his new band Open Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Storey, 36, has played with Eddie Henderson, Richie Cole and Pharoah Sanders, 
as well as locals Hollis Gentry, Joe Marillo, Bruce Cameron and the late Ella 
Ruth Piggee, but he's trying to launch a career as a leader. The music, he 
hopes, is challenging, but also accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"This is sort of progressive fusion," Storey said. "We use acoustic bass, 
percussion and drums with electric guitar, keyboards and sax. It's not really 
funk like Lites Out jazz. It's more progressive, leaning toward Latin." 
</P>
<P>
Storey, who grew up emulating blues masters like B.B. King and Albert King 
before chasing after jazzmen like Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, John 
Scofield, John Abercrombie and Pat Metheny, has put together a crack crew 
including saxophonist Steve Feierabend, Chris Conner on bass, Alan Eicher on 
keyboards, Danny Campbell on drums and Kim Kimmery on percussion. The band has 
a repertoire including 30 of Storey's compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Their 8 p.m. performance will be broadcast live on KSDS-FM (88.3). If you don't 
live in the heart of the city, you can receive the signal over most local cable 
television systems. A "splitter" allows you to run a separate line directly to 
the back of your receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Checkfield partners and studio wizards John Archer and Ron Satterfield are 
putting the finishing touches on the follow-up album to "Through The Lens," 
titled "A View from the Edge." The band's first three albums have sold a total 
of more than 160,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The Daniel Hook Quartet, led by the French swing singer, will be 
featured this Sunday at 7 p.m. on KSDS's "Le Jazz Club" program. At 1 p.m. 
Saturday, Erin Searles will highlight the music of trumpeter Donald Byrd on her 
"Silhouettes in Jazz" program. . . . At Croce's in downtown San Diego: Friday 
night, Pieces, the a cappella group, and Algo Caliente; Saturday night: pianist 
Bob Hamilton followed by the Joe Marillo Quartet; Sunday night: A.J. Croce 
followed by Joe Marillo's jam session. . . . At Diego's Loft: Friday night, 
saxophonist Gary Lefebvre; Saturday night, Algo Caliente; Sunday night, fusion 
with Vehicles. . . . Tonight and Friday night at the B Street Cafe &amp; Bar in 
downtown San Diego: the Mark Lessman Band. . . . Next Wednesday, Dec. 13, 
Fattburger plays Art Good's "Jazz Trax Nite" at the Catamaran in Mission Beach.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 272 to 128, the House approved a deficit-reduction bill that puts 
the fiscal 1990 federal budget in compliance with Gramm-Rudman limits on annual 
indebtedness. The Senate then approved the measure by voice vote, and President 
Bush signed it into law. 
</P>
<P>
The "reconciliation" bill (HR 3299) would reduce red ink for the year that 
began Oct. 1 by at least $14.6 billion, lowering the deficit to the 
$110-billion level required by the Gramm-Rudman law. Legislated spending cuts 
would account for about $6.6 billion of the reduction, and new taxes about $2.9 
billion. Forced across-the-board cuts, in effect until February under 
"sequestration" provisions, would reduce the year's deficit by $4.6 billion, 
and lower Treasury borrowing costs resulting from the bill would save $629 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Along with cutting the deficit and enacting new taxes in specialized areas of 
the economy, the bill makes several policy changes. For example, it reforms the 
way physicians are reimbursed under Medicare, prohibiting them from charging 
unreasonable fees that ultimately are paid by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure confronts the deficit more squarely than any of the annual 
reconciliation bills passed previously this decade. Still, it leaves 
entitlement programs virtually untouched, resorts to accounting gimmicks, such 
as moving the $1.8-billion Postal Service deficit and $420 million in Farm 
Credit System bailout costs "off budget," and once again pushes the most 
difficult fiscal and political decisions on taming the deficit into the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) said "a yes vote provides for real 
deficit reduction. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) said the bill lacks "any significant effort 
to address the root cause of the entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the reconciliation bill.

Nevada Wilderness 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 126 to 283, the House rejected an amendment to reduce by 40% the 
proposed Nevada wilderness area. Congress later sent to President Bush a bill 
(S 974) designating 733,000 unspoiled acres in the state as federal wilderness 
to be protected by law against logging, mining and other degrading commercial 
and recreational uses. All of the land is owned by the National Forest Service. 
This amendment sought to reduce the Nevada wilderness area from 733,000 to the 
412,000 acres recommended by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who 
oversees the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush signs the bill, Nevada will become the 50th state to have U.S. 
wilderness areas under terms of the 1964 Wilderness Act. 
</P>
<P>
Amendment supporter Don Young (R-Alaska) said the bill was advocated by 
environmentalists and others "that think they have the God-given right to tell 
people that live on the land how they should live." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) said "this so-called Draconian measure adds 
six-tenths of 1% of the state of Nevada to wilderness. I think that is very, 
very modest." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to reduce Nevada wilderness areas by 40%.

Dial-a-Porn 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 98 to 306, the House refused to remove "dial-a-porn" language from 
the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill for the departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education (HR 3566). This preserved Senate language to 
outlaw or curb services that provide sexually explicit telephone commentary to 
callers. A 1989 Supreme Court decision struck down an existing "dial-a-porn" 
law as an infringement of free speech. The new language was signed into law by 
President Bush as part of HR 3566. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting to remove the language from the bill objected on procedural 
grounds. They disliked the way the Senate had loaded up HR 3566 at the end of 
the 1989 session with provisions not germane to the bill. They also objected to 
disregarding House rules and allowing an appropriations bill to be used as the 
vehicle for substantive changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers on the other side of the issue said the House should seize the 
opportunity at hand to move against dial-a-porn services. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to remove dial-a-porn language from the pending 
appropriations bill.

Bluff Cove conflict -- A story on Oct. 29 in the South Bay section of The Times 
about conflicts between surfers and jet skiers at Bluff Cove incorrectly said 
that Pat Hulett, president of the San Pedro-based Class A Boating Assn., had 
jet skied there. Hulett has surfed in the cove. 
</P>
<P>
The story also incorrectly described an arrangement at Cabrillo Beach in San

'TIS THE SEASON TO BE SANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you couldn't make it as an Elvis impersonator and you're willing to put on a 
little weight, there's still hope. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of openings these days for Santa Claus in stores and shopping 
malls. As any retailer worth his receivables has discovered, booking the man 
with the rosy cheeks, twinkling eyes and furry red suit can boost sales by 
bringing in hundreds of kid-toting shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
At Nordstrom in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Santa will attract "a couple 
hundred" shoppers per day, said Greg Flotho, manager of the children's boutique 
there. "When kids see him, they can drag Mom here to sit on Santa's lap, then 
say, 'I like this tractor, Mom' or 'This is a neat doll,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a booming business has emerged to supply sleigh loads of Santas to 
malls, car dealers, restaurants, hotels and even banks during the holiday 
season. And there is brisk competition for the most convincing Santas -- those 
with the best pot bellies, silvery-white beards and hearty ho-ho-hos. 
</P>
<P>
The jostling for likely candidates is no surprise considering that Santa can 
mean the difference for merchants between a merry Christmas and an unhappy 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping boost sales for retailers, St. Nick is a source of revenue for 
shopping malls, which can reap handsome fees by providing space for Santa, and 
for suppliers -- typically photography firms or promotional agencies -- which 
take in thousands of dollars from photo concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Santa himself, however, most often earns blue-collar wages. In the Los Angeles 
area, Kris Kringles typically make $5-$9 per hour for a seasonal gig and 
$75-$150 per hour for parties, although in the most successful malls, a good 
Santa can earn $18 an hour or more. 
</P>
<P>
At least a dozen major agencies -- many of them national -- and scores of 
smaller firms send Santas to Southland retailers. They include Western 
Temporary Services of Walnut Creek; Ciresi &amp; Associates of Newberry, Ohio; 
Chris Cringle Special Events of San Pedro; Dixie Doodle Entertainment of 
Orange; Cherry Hill Photos from New Jersey, and Santa Plus of St. Charles, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the suppliers provide a professional photographer with Santa, who snaps 
shots of the kids with St. Nick at about $6 a clip. Some even offer videotapes 
of the brief sessions with Kris Kringle, for about $20 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa suppliers typically can gross $35,000-$40,000 at an average-sized 
regional mall for the season from photo sales and sales of novelty items, such 
as reindeer antlers and Christmas coloring books. 
</P>
<P>
The potential revenue has caused competition in the Santa industry to climb 
about 200% in 20 years, estimated Jenny Zink, national marketing director with 
Western Temp, which began its Santa division in 1968 and now places about 3,300 
St. Nicks each year. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the agencies and photo studios each year suit up and ship out as 
many as 20,000 Kris Kringles to malls, parades and parties throughout the 
nation, retail officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
And of the money taken in from photo sales, 25% to 40% will go back to the 
malls as a commission. It's not unusual for a regional center each Christmas 
season to collect $10,000 to $25,000 -- depending on the mall's size -- from 
photo sales, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the photo sales, malls and other retailers shell out anywhere from 
$1,500-$5,000 for the season, or up to $150 per hour, to have a Santa or two 
greeting customers. 
</P>
<P>
The yearly demand for Santa's throne depends on how retailers size up the 
holiday shopping season. With Christmas sales this year off to a slow start, 
the Santa business has been brisk, retail officials said. Half a dozen firms 
estimated that requests for St. Nick this year are running 15% to 20% ahead of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers look to Santa to put shoppers in a jovial, carefree mood -- all the 
better for opening their wallets. Moreover, his mere presence draws shoppers 
into toy departments. 
</P>
<P>
Santa's drawing power is especially helpful on slow weekdays, when busy parents 
are less likely to shop. Zink estimates that mall traffic jumps 10% to 15% when 
Santa is in a major store. 
</P>
<P>
But a good Santa is not always easy to find. The supplier's search for St. Nick 
often begins as early as September. But "it's always very difficult to get 
Santas," said one Santa supplier who asked not to be named. "We're out there 
busting our butts on this." 
</P>
<P>
To find him, companies scour senior citizen bulletin boards, Daily Variety for 
out-of-work actors and lists of last year's recruits. And the quest for 
potential prospects doesn't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see (a Santa look-alike) at a bus stop, I'll pull over" and ask him, said 
Cathy Perks, a manager for Western Temporary Services in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one elderly man told Perks that she was the sixth person to approach 
him in five weeks. "He said he was going to shave off his beard because he 
couldn't take it anymore. He was out here for a mellow vacation and everyone 
was attacking him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the search reaches right into the shopping mall, when customers with 
whiskers -- or who just look jolly -- are cajoled in a pinch to fill Santa's 
boots for even a day. 
</P>
<P>
"The show must go on," explains Bill Salerno, sales director with Ciresi &amp; 
Associates, which supplies Santas to about 300 malls across the United States.

Caesars Fined: Caesars Hotel Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., was allowed to 
remain open but was fined $250,000 by the Casino Control Commission for alleged 
discriminatory practices against minorities and women. A judge had recommended 
that Caesars be fined only $15,600 for relocating female and black dealers to 
accommodate the perceived preferences of a high roller. The $250,000 fine was 
the maximum penalty Caesars could receive.

Help-Wanted Ads Advance in October: The volume of help-wanted advertising in 51 
major newspapers increased in October, the Conference Board said. The group 
said want-ad volume was rising in 69% of the newspapers, compared to 55% in 
September and 35% in August, 1988, but down from 84% a year ago. The board's 
help-wanted ad index rose to 150 from 148 in September, but was down sharply 
from 161 a year ago. "The data on want-ad volume suggests that while the labor 
market is cooling off we are not on the verge of a recession," Conference Board 
economist Ken Goldstein said.

McGraw-Hill Cuts Staff: New York-based McGraw-Hill Inc., the publishing and 
information services company, announced sweeping layoffs and a restructuring. 
It plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, a 7.3% reduction. In addition, it hopes to 
streamline operations by shifting from a structure of three operating firms to 
two. The cost of the layoffs, a writedown of assets and the costs associated 
with closing its general book division will result in a $220-million charge to 
fourth-quarter earnings, McGraw-Hill said.

U.S. SANCTIONS OF JAPAN INEVITABLE, SENATOR SAYS;

Sen. Frank H. Murkowski said Wednesday that he believes it inevitable that the 
United States will impose retaliatory sanctions against Japan in the simmering 
dispute over foreign access to Tokyo's public works construction market. 
</P>
<P>
Murkowski (R-Alaska) told reporters here that sanctions in the construction 
sector would have a "symbolic" impact and would encourage Japan to make 
concessions on a range of other trade issues under dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will have to come to a 301 because of the way the system (in Japan) 
works," Murkowski said, referring to Section 301 in the U.S. Trade Law, which 
provides for punitive sanctions. "They need something to come down to justify a 
reaction."

Murkowski, co-chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee 
on East Asian and Pacific affairs, said some significant progress has been made 
in licensing and opening public works bidding to American construction 
companies since the issue emerged three years ago. But he complained that there 
has been no comparable access for U.S. architectural, engineering and design 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception in the United States is one of inequity," Murkowski said. "Our 
markets are open. Why aren't yours?" 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Murkowski was upbeat about Japan's progress in opening its 
construction market. As many as 17 major public works projects have been open 
to foreign bidding, and 13 U.S. construction companies have now obtained 
licenses here, obtaining about $65 million in contracts through joint venture 
arrangements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that falls far short of the $2.4 billion in annual business claimed by 
Japanese contractors in the United States, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two American design firms licensed in Japan have been unable to 
find joint venture partners here and therefore remain locked out, he said. The 
Japanese government and the construction industry should establish "ground 
rules" that would allow such firms to tie up with local partners, Murkowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills submitted a report to 
Congress criticizing the pervasiveness of dango, or collusive bidding, in 
Japan's construction industry. The report said an arcane system of awarding 
public works contracts to insiders deprives American companies of competitive 
opportunities here. 
</P>
<P>
Hills, however, chose not to recommend that trade sanctions be imposed at this 
time, recognizing that the Japanese side has made improvements in market access 
for foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Murkowski, who is visiting Tokyo for talks with Japanese government and 
construction industry officials, has been an outspoken advocate of a tougher 
line against Japan in the construction trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded Wednesday that he played a key role in prodding the Justice 
Department to seek about $35 million in punitive damages against a cartel of 
Japanese firms that the Japan Fair Trade Commission ruled had rigged bids on 
contracts at the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka between 1984 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We raised hell with the Navy and went to the Justice Department and stirred 
the pot," Murkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, a Justice Department lawyer visited Tokyo last month 
and threatened cartel members with legal action in the United States unless 
they paid damages in connection with the Yokosuka dango case. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before Hills announced her findings in Washington on Nov. 22, leading 
companies in the cartel agreed to pay about $32 million in an out-of-court 
settlement. Murkowski said the firms feared being cut off from future Pentagon 
contracts, as well as facing litigation under U.S. antitrust law.

Telecommunications Deal Expected: An international consortium including San 
Francisco-based Pacific Telesis is expected to be awarded a license today to 
build West Germany's first private cellular telephone system. The deal could be 
worth billions in revenue for Pacific Telesis, the parent of Pacific Bell and 
owner of a 26% stake in the consortium. Pacific Telesis' partners are West 
Germany's Mannesmann AG and DG-Bank, along with Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless 
PLC and France's Lyonnaise des Eaux.

CHRYSLER EXPLORING SALE OF TECHNOLOGIES UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO MAKERS: THE COMPANY HOPES TO SHED ITS DEFENSE-ORIENTED SUBSIDIARY AND 
FOCUS ON BUILDING CARS AND TRUCKS.

<P>
Chrysler Corp. said Wednesday that it wants to sell its Chrysler Technologies 
Corp. subsidiary, which includes its defense electronics and Gulfstream 
Aerospace aircraft businesses, to concentrate on making cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to explore the sale comes as the auto market is softening, foreign 
competition is increasing and Chrysler is attempting to cut costs to remain 
competitive. Sales of Chrysler cars and light trucks for the year through Nov. 
30 were 6.4% behind last year's pace, reflecting an industrywide slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's third-largest auto maker said it had hired First Boston Corp. to 
advise it on the sale of Chrysler Technologies, all of which has been acquired 
since 1985. No timetable was set. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler also said Gulfstream founder and Chairman Allen Paulson is considering 
a bid for Chrysler Technologies and had resigned from the Chrysler board and 
taken a leave of absence from Gulfstream to pursue a possible purchase. Paulson 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, who said last month that Chrysler may have to cut $1.5 
billion in costs, said Wednesday that the proposed sale of the Technologies 
unit is not related to a need for cash. "This is a strategic move that has been 
under consideration for some time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca said the auto market will be fiercely competitive in the next decade 
and that Chrysler must prepare. "We intend to go head to head with the Toyotas 
and Hondas of the world as well as anybody else in the market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year, Chrysler has closed one Detroit assembly plant, announced 
cost cuts of at least $1 billion and stopped production of one subcompact car 
model. 
</P>
<P>
But to counter weak domestic demand and increased foreign competition, auto 
analysts have said the Highland Park, Mich.-based auto maker must return to its 
core and sell off other assets. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chrysler Technologies accounted for a relatively small proportion of 
the parent company's overall earnings, analysts said the businesses had been 
acquired as a way of helping diversify out of the cyclical auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Technologies is made up of Gulfstream, which was acquired for $637 
million in 1985; Electrospace Systems Inc., a maker of defense and electronics 
products and systems that Chrysler bought for $367 million in 1987, and 
Airborne Systems Inc., formed last January by combining the military 
aviation-related functions of Gulfstream and Electrospace. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream accounted for most of Chrysler Technologies' $1.3 billion in revenue 
last year, said John Stellman, a spokesman for the subsidiary. The unit posted 
a pretax profit of about $149 million in 1988 and had projected earnings of 
about $121 million this year. Chrysler Corp. had net income of $1.05 billion in 
1988 on sales of $35.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream has about 5,000 workers, Electrospace has about 2,000 and Chrysler 
Technologies Airborne Systems has about 1,300. On Oct. 1, Chrysler began a 
program to slash at least $1 billion from its budget by year-end 1990, 
including the elimination of about 8% of its white-collar work force. 
</P>
<P>
In late September, Chrysler sold about half of its stake in Japanese auto maker 
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., gaining about $310 million after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Mary Anne Sudol, of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York, said the 
decision to sell Chrysler Technologies was sound and "since they bought it, the 
world has changed." 
</P>
<P>
"In the current thawing in the Cold War and the anticipated cuts in defense 
budgets, an operation like that, which is small relative to Chrysler's size, 
makes less and less sense." 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts complained that the announcement came too late. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad Chrysler didn't make this decision six months ago, when Chrysler 
Technologies was worth more," said Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
He said the value of the defense unit has declined as East-West relations have 
thawed and that the aircraft group has suffered a decline in its order backlog. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler stock rose 12.5 cents to $19.125 a share Wednesday on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

NIKKEI HITS ANOTHER HIGH DESPITE MOVE TO TIGHTEN MARGINS

Tighter margin requirements helped slow, but could not stifle, the rally on the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange Wednesday as stubborn investors kept on buying, pushing 
prices to new highs in brisk trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as though suddenly the party's over," said Toranobu Sugai, senior 
trader for Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling at the open was quickly reversed, with late futures-related 
buying giving prices a final swift kick up. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index jumped 160.12, or 0.43%, to finish at 37,654.29, 
both a record close and a new traded high. It surged 190.30 on Tuesday and has 
closed at a record in 10 of the past 11 trading days. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1 billion shares changed hands for the eighth day in a row, with the 
day's volume about 1.2 billion shares against 1.3 billion Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei posted a traded high of 37,589.91 just before the close, after 
plunging 195.07 in the first 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Steel companies again captured volume, while retailers and pharmaceuticals were 
chased as domestic laggards. 
</P>
<P>
"People are looking at laggards, and anything under 1,000 yen," Sugai said. 
"There's little downside risk." 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, securities used as collateral for margin buying will be valued 
at 50% of market value rather than 60%. The tightening was done because of the 
recent sharp rally in the stock market, a stock exchange official said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, share prices finished sharply higher on London's Stock Exchange 
Wednesday, boosted in part by a hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Financial Times 100-share index was up 26.2, or 1.1%, at 
2,353.7.

PRODUCTIVITY HURT BY WEAK MANUFACTURING

<P>
American workers made modest productivity gains in the third quarter, but the 
lackluster manufacturing sector posted its lowest output gain in three years 
and continued to slow the overall economy, the government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time this year, the quarter-to-quarter hourly wage gains made 
by workers outpaced the growth in consumer inflation, the Labor Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The department said overall productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy 
increased at a revised annual rate of 2.5% in the July-September period, more 
than double the anemic 1.1% annual rate gain in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But in manufacturing, a sector weakened by slumping auto sales and other 
problems, productivity increased at a revised annual rate of just 1% after 
improving at an annual rate of 3.7% in the April-June period. 
</P>
<P>
The poor manufacturing performance came as output rose just 1.2% and hours 
worked increased a weak 0.2%, reflecting slackened demand for goods. The 
increase in output was the smallest since a slight decline in the second 
quarter of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the poor productivity gain in manufacturing and a significant 
increase in wages, unit labor costs, a key determinant of future price 
inflation, rose at an annual rate of 4.9% after decreasing by 1% in the second 
quarter. It was the largest increase in unit labor costs since the 1982 
recession, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
That increase will likely translate into either higher prices for consumers for 
manufactured goods or lower profits for producers -- or both -- and also makes 
it more difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete in overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting more upward wage pressure in manufacturing, and with the weak 
productivity numbers, that pushes up costs," said Michael Evans, head of a 
Washington forecasting firm. 
</P>
<P>

Non-farm business productivity, percent change from previous quarter,

FED'S REGIONAL REPORT SEES GENERALLY STABLE ECONOMY

<P>
U.S. economic activity ranged from stable to expanding modestly last month, 
although the manufacturing sector showed signs of weakness, the Federal Reserve 
Board said Wednesday in its look at regional economic trends. 
</P>
<P>
But in its "Beige Book" report on economic conditions, the central bank said 
only two of its 12 districts showed "some recent softening" in the economy. The 
districts were not named, but summaries provided by the Fed indicated that they 
were the ones based in Richmond, Va., and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer spending has varied among districts," the report said. "Strength has 
been mostly confined to nondurable items, while sales of autos and other 
durables have generally been weak." 
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates have dampened sales of durable goods -- big-ticket items 
expected to last more than three years -- because such items often are financed 
through borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of districts report some softening in manufacturing activity, but 
there are pockets of strength," the Fed said. "Construction is strong or 
improving in the West and Midwest but somewhat sluggish in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Weakness in the auto industry and among its suppliers was most commonly cited 
as a major factor in the manufacturing slowdown," the Fed said, but the 
computer, electronics and defense industries also slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to inflation, the report said, "Those districts that reported on 
price developments generally noted flat to modestly increased input prices, 
with several mentioning the continuing escalation of medical insurance costs." 
</P>
<P>
The survey by the 12 district banks was conducted before Nov. 28 in preparation 
for the Dec. 18 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
As the central bank's monetary policy-setting arm, the committee sets goals for 
monetary growth, which in turn influences interest rates. It was the tighter 
monetary policies that pushed up interest rates recently as the Fed sought to 
restrain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and housing industries were most affected by the tight-money 
policies, although the Fed has eased its grip recently, and the housing 
industry has picked up as mortgage rates have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales were described as on target or healthy in the New York, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis and San Francisco districts and unchanged in Boston, Cleveland and 
Philadelphia. Richmond and Dallas noted some softening. 
</P>
<P>
"Some slowing in manufacturing activity has occurred in most areas," the report 
said. "Weakness in the auto industry and among its suppliers was most commonly 
cited as a major factor in the manufacturing slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey showed agriculture improving in much of the country, although 
drought was reported in south Texas and along the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
It also reported increased natural gas exploration in the Kansas City district 
and said the oil and gas industry is optimistic about expanding in the Dallas 
district next year. 
</P>
<P>
Loan demand at commercial banks, the survey said, varied by type and region. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco region, hit by the strong earthquake in October, "reports 
strong loan demand in most areas, though the rate of growth seems to have 
slowed from its earlier robust pace," the Fed reported.

A MUSIC CENTER BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It seemed an impossibility: a ball on the stage of the Music Center's Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. But the Los Angeles Junior Philharmonic Committee and its 
powers, president Judy Bartholomew, chairman Joan Riach and chairman emeritus 
Fran Muir dreamed, and Ernest Fleishmann pulled out the stops. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, on the eve of the 25th Anniversary of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic's opening night concert at the Music Center, a turn-away crowd of 
650 turned into stage stars, dancing to polkas, marches, the 1812 Overture and 
"Dear Heart," first to a joyous Philharmonic conducted by Henry Mancini, later 
to Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Band. 
</P>
<P>
In between came the Grand Cotillion performance by the Beverly Hills Cotillion 
Dance Ensemble, a live auction with Robert Abell, and cuisine of salmon, lamb, 
molded chocolate treble clefs and champagne -- all behind place cards 
embellished with gold eighth notes and under a canopy of twinkly lights with a 
view of the Pavilion's empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
Heralding the night: Philharmonic board chairman Michael and Susan Connell, 
Music Center Unified Fund '90 chair Maurice and Carolyn DeWald, Leon and Judy

BOOKS: ROMANCE WRITER MARY JO PUTNEY BRISTLES WHEN PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF HER 
BOOKS. THEY'RE NOT "TRASH," SHE SAYS.

<P>
About a year ago, when an acquaintance found out what Mary Jo Putney did for a 
living, she said with disdain, "Oh, you write romance novels. I never read 
trash like that." 
</P>
<P>
Putney, bristling only slightly, gets a serious expression on her face. "I 
don't mind if someone says to me, 'I read it and I didn't like it.' But for 
someone to say what she said to my face is pretty insulting. It shows how 
little people know." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, anyone who spends a few hours with Putney finds out quickly that this 
43-year-old single woman is quite serious about her books, which are well 
regarded in the genre. 
</P>
<P>
Putney, who was just honored as the author of the Best Regency Novel of the 
Year by Romantic Times magazine, has written eight books, including the 
recently released "The Rake and the Reformer," which won the award. 
</P>
<P>
Although prolific -- she has produced those novels in 3 1/2 years -- she is 
also quite scholarly in her pursuits and serious about her work. Her book-lined 
office, which is upstairs in her townhouse here, has some titles, including 
historical tomes, that require heavy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
"She's absolutely one of the outstanding writers of the year," said Kathryn 
Falk, publisher of Romantic Times, the bimonthly bible of the romance novel 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
And in a field that is both crowded -- 120 new romance titles are released each 
month -- and overrun by the predictable heaving-breasts-and-hungry-loins 
passages, Putney "is an unusually strong writer with an ability to come up with 
fresh plots," Falk says. "Her book ('The Rake and the Reformer'), a real page 
turner, could have been a mainstream novel." 
</P>
<P>
The current novel is also a breakthrough in the Regency romance category. 
Romance novels fall into one of three major categories: the long historical 
novels, also called bodice-rippers; the contemporary romances, usually 
featuring more explicit sex and up-to-date themes; and the Regency romances, 
which are confined to the Regency period (1811-1820) and focus on the English 
comedy of manners and courtship. 
</P>
<P>
While "The Rake and the Reformer" does have the requisite deep-sighing heroine 
-- Alys, a pre-feminist who works as a steward despite her hidden noble birth 
-- and the devilishly irresistible hero -- Reggie, tall, dark and 
you-guessed-it handsome -- there is a twist. Paralleling the romance -- that 
agonizing period when all is fantasy, desire and unconsummated rolls in the hay 
-- is another tale: one of alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a realistic story. Anyone who knows anything about alcoholism will 
recognize that I have used Alcoholics Anonymous steps to recovery," Putney 
said. But it is all set in another time. "I've used some 20th-Century themes, 
but they work in this form. The Regency era was a very heavy period for 
drinking. It was not unusual for people to drink three bottles of wine a night, 
plus port." 
</P>
<P>
Someone close to her had a serious drinking problem, and she wanted to address 
that theme in the book. But if romance novels offer a promise of escape from 
contemporary problems, why would a reader want to encounter those problems in 
fiction? 
</P>
<P>
"There are readers who want some fantasy as well as reality. They want 
characters they can understand, characters with a larger-than-life quality 
dealing with real issues," Putney said. However, she admits, the book has not 
been hyped as a tale about an alcoholic and his recovery. "It's nowhere in the 
promotional material because we didn't want to scare readers away." 
</P>
<P>
Her editor at New American Library, Hilary Ross, said: "It has been very 
successful letting writers do innovative things and treat more serious themes. 
Otherwise, the genre gets cliched and tired." 
</P>
<P>
Putney turned to this work about three years ago after a career as a free-lance 
graphic designer. She put together an outline for a novel a few months before 
her 40th birthday, sent it out and immediately got a contract from New American 
Library, a week after she turned 40. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had an easier time of it than almost anyone I know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, she has been chapter adviser for the Maryland group of 
Romance Writers of America. Almost 35 regional authors meet once a month to 
discuss the state of the industry, to listen to speakers on genre fiction and 
to share information. Tea and cookies, very English, usually end the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great having support," she said. "Sometimes I'll be in the middle of a 
story, and I won't know where to turn. I'll pick up the phone and call another 
writer and say, 'I have plot problems,' and she'll know just what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
When she first started writing, Putney says, she felt isolated and knew she had 
a lot to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"I know some career women have a prejudice against romance novels, because I 
myself had never read a Harlequin or Silhouette book before," she said. "And 
because I wasn't a romance reader, I was considered innovative with the stories 
I wrote." 
</P>
<P>
She chose the field of Regency romances, she says, because "it was a good place 
to start, it had a narrow framework, it was about relationships and people. And 
it was also an area in which I could earn a living." 
</P>
<P>
She knows the reality of the marketplace for writers: That while only about 5% 
of all general writers earn a living at writing, almost 15% of all genre 
writers do. In a few years, Putney says, she expects to earn a $50,000 annual 
income from her work. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, she believes that she fell naturally into the work because of 
her background, which includes a degree in 18th-Century English literature from 
Syracuse University in her native Upstate New York, followed by two years in 
Oxford, England. It makes her especially familiar with the period she writes 
about and the places she describes. She is an Anglophile, and her townhouse 
reflects her tastes with its treasured pieces of old English furniture, as well 
as her favorite teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
In her office, there is also an inspirational artwork with these words floating 
above the head of an angelic muse: "Within the circle of proficient thought 
resides your golden meter. . . . Retrieve." 
</P>
<P>
Falk of Romantic Times says that there may be danger ahead despite the 
auspicious beginnings: "Quite often, romance writers come out very strong, but 
then they fall into the traps of writing the same novel over and over and 
losing their original freshness." 
</P>
<P>
But Putney doesn't want to be confined to any category, at least not in the 
long run. "I'll probably work my way into more mainstream historical work," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean she offers any apology for what she does now. "I'm very 
comfortable with what I do," she said. "I write good books, the best I know 
how. A good story doesn't have to be defended."

THE HOLOCAUST -- A TOUGH SELL FOR THE HOLIDAYS?; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: FILMS WITH A SIMILAR THEME POSE A MARKETING CHALLENGE. DISTRIBUTORS 
DEVISE NEW CAMPAIGNS AND COUNT ON GOOD REVIEWS.

<P>
Jack Brodsky has been marketing Hollywood movies long enough to know one of the 
immutable rules of the game -- rules are made to be broken. 
</P>
<P>
"All the rules in our business change every week," says Brodsky, president of 
distribution and marketing for Morgan Creek Productions, which produced Paul 
Mazursky's new $12-million film, "Enemies, A Love Story." 
</P>
<P>
"If you saw 'sex, lies and videotape' before it went to Cannes and said it 
would make $30 million, someone would've taken you in for a brain scan." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Brodsky is in the midst of a high-stakes marketing challenge. Along 
with Tom Sherak, Fox Film's domestic marketing and distribution chief, he's 
trying to carve out a comfortable niche in the crowded holiday film season for 
"Enemies," an unsettling, emotional tale about the romantic entanglements of 
Holocaust survivors in late-40s New York. With "Music Box" and "Triumph of the 
Spirit" also due out this month, and the documentary "Lodz Ghetto" already in 
theaters, "Enemies" is one of several adult-oriented films being released 
during the holidays with a Holocaust-related theme. 
</P>
<P>
It is tough enough for serious dramas to get attention amid the comedies and 
adventures that dominate the Christmas release schedule. Having four films 
simultaneously in the market with Holocaust themes may be an unprecedent 
challenge to the distributors' marketing departments. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the features will be heavily dependent on good reviews, 
word-of-mouth and Academy Award nominations that will be announced in February. 
But the film makers are also banking on changes in Americans' moviegoing 
habits. Serious films aren't the commercial liabilities they were just a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when 'Enemies' would have been viewed as an uncommercial 
movie," said Sherak. "But after the success of challenging films like 
'Dangerous Liaisons,' 'The Accidental Tourist' and 'The Last Emperor,' we think 
a picture like this can have a very strong appeal. It needs a lot of tender 
loving care. But there's an enormous adult audience that we think will want to 
see the film." 
</P>
<P>
The 'Enemies' team has concocted a daring strategy with its advertising. The 
campaign is designed to do more than simply tempt moviegoers with a trailer 
full of intriguing scenes and tantalizing dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're quite literally telling them the story of the film," explained Sherak, 
who said the trailer for "Enemies" is currently running with such adult 
pictures as "Steel Magnolias." "In any good movie advertising, you want to give 
them a good reason to see the movie. And we want audiences to know the story 
because we think that will just involve them all the more." 
</P>
<P>
With a respected director like Mazursky and a cast that includes Anjelica 
Huston, Ron Silver and Lena Olin, 'Enemies' has an impressive array of acting 
talent -- but no major box-office attraction. So Fox is reminding moviegoers of 
its casts' award-winning laurels. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a word we use a lot around here called pedigree," said Brodsky. "We 
think the film's pedigree gives us a lot to work with, starting with Paul 
Mazursky's reputation as a talented film maker. We've discovered through our 
research that Mazursky is a real draw for an adult audience. People know his 
name, and he has a real following. 
</P>
<P>
"We're also playing up the fact that we have an Oscar winner with Anjelica, a 
Tony winner with Ron and an actress who was in 'The Unbearable Lightness of 
Being,' which we think has a strong association with the audience we're aiming 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Fox's advertising only alludes to the film's Holocaust theme, preferring to 
stress its actors' credentials. In fact, Mazursky scoffs at the notion that 
"Enemies" can only reach a narrow, art-house audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm an optimist, but I don't think it's just about the Holocaust or 
Jewish suffering. It's also about great passion -- and it's a great story, full 
of surprises and ironic comedy. It goes from laughter to despair, because it's 
also about the existence of God. And the question that if He exists, how could 
he allow the Holocaust to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Brodsky said future "Enemies" ads will emphasize critics' endorsements. In 
fact, television commercials will begin appearing in New York and Los Angeles 
on Sunday featuring quotes from early positive reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Good reviews are also being counted on by the distributor of "Triumph of the 
Spirit." Elliot Slutzky, president of marketing and distribution for 
independent Transworld Entertainment, said ads promoting Friday's opening of 
"Triumph" in New York and Los Angeles will be laden with blurbs from early rave 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Triumph" is based on a true story about a Greek Jew who survived Auschwitz by 
winning more than 200 boxing matches held to entertain Nazi officers. The ad 
for the movie shows actor Willem Defoe leaning over an opponent in a ring while 
a referee, wearing a Nazi swastika, looks on. 
</P>
<P>
Slutzky said the ad was designed to highlight the strong cast (Dafoe's co-stars 
are Edward James Olmos and Robert Loggia) and to take its Holocaust setting 
head-on. Previous ads have also attempted to pair "Triumph" with "Platoon," 
which had the same producer -- Arnold Kopelson. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the picture is powerful enough to garner word of mouth and build like 
'Platoon' did," Slutzky said. 
</P>
<P>
Transworld is also counting on "Triumph" publicity to move off of the 
entertainment pages and into the news and editorial page columns, which was the 
pattern that helped fuel interest in "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
"The film raises issues that generate the kind of publicity you cannot create," 
Slutzky said. "It has a documentary feel; it's real." 
</P>
<P>
The key element of Transworld's own publicity campaign is Salamo Arouch, the 
man portrayed in the movie. Arouch, who served as technical consultant on the 
film, has been brought over to the United States from his home in Israel to 
talk about his death-camp experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Pictures executives refused to discuss their marketing strategy for 
Costa-Gavras' "Music Box," a contemporary courtroom drama about a lawyer 
(Jessica Lange) who defends her father against charges of committing Holocaust 
atrocities. A spokeswoman for the film said the studio rejects the notion that 
"Music Box" belongs in a story about Holocaust movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Music Box" producer Irwin Winkler says that marketing decisions are up the 
studio but that as far he is concerned, the Holocaust theme shouldn't be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no compunction about using references to the Holocaust if it tied into 
the quotes from critics that we wanted for our ads," said Winkler. "I'm 
certainly not going to go around and say this film isn't about the Holocaust. 
It's obviously an important part of the background of the picture." 
</P>
<P>
Winkler, who's produced such films as the "Rocky" series and "Raging Bull," 
says that like "Enemies," "Music Box" will rely on critical plaudits and that 
he is already collecting excerpts from early rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran producer admits that studio marketing executives prefer to downplay 
material that might make a film appear controversial or lacking in commercial 
appeal. "I figure the studio will be a little nervous," Winkler says. "When we 
made 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull,' the studio people didn't want us to mention 
anything about boxing. They thought it would hurt the pictures. Of course, when 
the movies did well, then everyone wanted to make a boxing picture." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it could be an uphill struggle for these films to compete with more 
commercial holiday-season films. Eyeing Fox's "pedigree" campaign for 
"Enemies," some industry experts question whether Anjelica Huston's Oscar 
credentials or a tie-in with an obscure art-house delight like 'Unbearable 
Lightness' will really grab moviegoers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that their trailer is an act of desperation," said one veteran 
producer. "They try so hard to puff up everything prestigious about the movie, 
then tell you the whole plot, that it really seems like they didn't know what 
else to do. The trailer even plugs Ron Silver's Tony Award -- that's got to be 
a first." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gordon Weaver, a former studio marketing exec who now runs a respected 
marketing consultant firm, isn't as pessimistic. "The art of opening a 
difficult film is being totally honest about your movie," he said. "It's not so 
much whether a film is difficult or not, but finding the audience that wants to 
go see it. 
</P>
<P>
"With 'Enemies,' I think it's a real smart plan to go after people who are 
already predisposed to like your movie. If you can attract educated adults, 
then they'll not only go see it, but spread the news with good word-of-mouth." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, both "Enemies" and "Music Box" initially open for exclusive 
runs in only three cities -- Los Angeles, New York and Toronto -- only going 
into wider release in mid-January. "We're not deluding ourselves that we're 
going to be like 'Harlem Nights,' which could be savaged by critics and still 
survive," said Sherak of "Enemies." "This movie has to open itself. Obviously, 
we're hoping for a lot of good reviews. And if we can get some nominations for 
Academy Awards or Golden Globes, then we'll expand the picture's run a little 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Transworld's Slutzky says the roll-out plan for "Triumph of the Spirit" is tied 
directly to the Academy Award nominations. On Feb. 2, two weeks before the 
nominations are announced, the movie will be opened in 12 additional major 
markets. Two weeks after the nominations, 25 more markets will be added. 
</P>
<P>
Slutzky said the regional marketing plan calls for heavy promotional tie-ins 
with the Jewish community -- premieres and benefits with groups like B'nai 
B'rith, and advertising in Jewish newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely slanting (the promotion toward the Jewish community), 
although we feel the film will have broad appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Slutzky says the fact that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has 
a large Jewish membership is not something they can count on for a large 
turn-out at Oscar screenings. On the other hand, he adds that "it can't hurt, 
can it?"

'WORKING GIRL' NO MATCH FOR 'BATMAN'

Caped Crusader Clobbers Working Girl. That's a capsule summary of what happened 
on the Billboard rental chart this week, with "Batman" winging its way to the 
top of the rental and sales charts in just two weeks, demoting "Working Girl" 
to fourth. But the supremacy of "Batman" is being seriously challenged by 
second-ranked "Scrooged," the Bill Murray version of "A Christmas Carol," which 
could become an even more appealing rental as Christmas gets closer. "K-9," 
starring Jim Belushi and a German shepherd, sprinted up to No. 8 in just two 
weeks. Look for it to be in the Top 5 next week. "Three Fugitives," co-starring 
Nick Nolte, is still doing strong rental business, inching up a notch to No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
* Compared to the 1984 original, which raked in more than $200 million, 
"Ghostbusters II" was a practically a box-office flop -- grossing just $111 
million. But the sequel could outdo the original in rentals simply because the 
home-video market is so much larger today than it was in 1985. "Ghostbusters 
II" entered the rental chart at No. 10 and could bounce into the Top 5 next 
week.

CLEARANCE: The "Star Wars" test site, above, near San Clemente is generally off 
limits to the public and press, partly because TRW, which operates the 
facility, doesn't want its aerospace competitors to know what it's doing. . . . 
So who's getting a look at the place: Yes, the Russians, who will send a 
contingent of scientists later this month. . . . A TRW spokeswoman says the 
Russians are being allowed "because the State Department invited them." Dana

As one of Orange County's four trauma centers prepares to drop out of the 
nationally known but debt-ridden emergency network two days after Christmas, 
several Orange County hospitals are reportedly considering filling the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Although no hospital has yet signed up with the county as a trauma center, 
administrators at several facilities have held "preliminary meetings" to 
discuss the idea, county officials said. None of the hospitals are expected to 
make a final decision until after the holidays, and any new trauma center would 
have to be certified by the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't got anybody jumping up and saying they want to be a trauma center," 
said Betty O'Rourke, manager of the county's Emergency Medical Services, who in 
mid-October wrote to 10 north central county hospitals inviting them to start 
one. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Rourke confirmed that she has had discussions with some of the hospitals. 
And sources added one hospital is "'seriously considering" the invitation, 
while two others have expressed cautious interest. 
</P>
<P>
Trauma centers are specially staffed and equipped to offer faster and more 
sophisticated medical care than standard emergency rooms to people suffering 
from severe, possibly life-threatening injuries, such as from car crashes, 
falls, shootings, and stabbings. 
</P>
<P>
However, trauma centers throughout Southern California have lost millions of 
dollars -- an estimated $5 million last year in Orange County -- because often 
the patients who receive the costly care have no medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the prestige of offering landmark medical care appears to be sparking 
the interest of some Orange County hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"The prestige is still there," a county official said. "You get hero points 
from your colleagues for providing that level of care." 
</P>
<P>
Further, the costs could be offset by the "good public relations" value of such 
specialized care and the promise of millions of dollars in new tobacco tax 
money soon to be distributed to trauma hospitals, O'Rourke said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the hospitals that have expressed cautious interest in trauma care are 
173-bed Los Alamitos Medical Center on the Orange County-Los Angeles County 
border and 141-bed Humana Hospital-Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at the two hospitals noted that although they have not rejected 
the option of trauma care, neither have they seriously examined its costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have to analyze it very carefully," said Los Alamitos associate 
administrator Charlene Robinson. But, she added, "we haven't ruled it out." Los 
Alamitos officials still haven't broached the idea to staff physicians or their 
parent corporation in Los Angeles and probably will not do so until after 
Christmas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
'Might Consider It' 
</P>
<P>
At Humana, executive director Mark Aanonson said: "We don't close our mind to 
anything. If they (county officials) had something in mind that might be 
workable, we might consider it." 
</P>
<P>
Aanonson acknowledged the public relations potential of having a trauma center. 
But he added that staffing and financing a trauma center probably have too many 
negatives. "All the money you have to pay out for standby fees and stipends (to 
trauma doctors) plus the occasional $200,000 to $300,000 bad debt, it's not 
really attractive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One source said 347-bed St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in 
Fullerton is weighing the idea, but hospital president Paul Viviano adamantly 
denied that. He said he and his staff had looked at O'Rourke's letter, given 
the idea "serious consideration" and soundly rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested at this time," Viviano said. "Not unless the governor or 
the supervisors are going to provide a Christmas present -- lots of additional 
reimbursement." 
</P>
<P>
The specialized centers are expensive because they are staffed 24 hours a day 
with a trauma surgeon and anesthesiologists, with neurosurgeons and other 
specialists on call. When the system works, paramedics speed badly injured 
accident victims to a trauma center for computerized tomography scans, surgery 
or other lifesaving care. Receiving the proper diagnosis and care in the first 
hour after a severe injury is crucial to the patient's chance of survival, 
studies have shown. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's network of trauma centers was a national model when it began in 
1980. It opened with five centers, and for the last six years has operated with 
four -- UCI Medical Center in Orange, Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center 
in Mission Viejo, United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana and Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center. But in recent years, hospital officials 
have complained that they can't afford to provide the care. When Fountain 
Valley's directors decided to close the trauma center permanently Dec. 27, they 
blamed losses from uninsured patients that hit $1 million last year and were 
expected to triple in 1990.

STATE BOARD BANS NEW OFFSHORE OIL, GAS LEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a new blow to the petroleum industry, the State Lands Commission on 
Wednesday declared all remaining unleased or unprotected coastal waters in 
Southern California off limits to oil and gas development. 
</P>
<P>
The move outlawed new oil or gas leases for all of Orange County's coastline, 
from the high-tide mark onshore to three miles offshore. The three-mile strip 
of state-owned coastal waters already was protected south of Huntington Beach 
to San Diego. The State Lands Commission's vote on Wednesday expanded that 
sanctuary to include all state waters off Huntington Beach, Sunset Beach and 
Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that I'm ecstatic," said Laguna Beach Councilman Robert F. Gentry, 
who heads a coalition of Orange County coastal communities opposed to offshore 
oil drilling. "The State Lands Commission is responding to the will of the 
people of Orange County in protecting our very precious (coastline) resource." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision followed a similar commission ban last year covering 
waters off Humboldt and Mendocino counties and now means that for the first 
time all new oil and gas drilling in state waters from Oregon to Mexico has 
been shut down. The action also provided evidence of the continuing 
repercussions from the disastrous Alaskan oil spill last March. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's move does not require approval by the governor, state Legislature 
or federal government. However, the Lands Commission could reverse itself in 
the future and the state Legislature could overturn the decision. 
</P>
<P>
While the move does not affect waters outside the three-mile limit, President 
Bush and Congress in separate actions earlier this year locked out new oil and 
gas leasing activity in federal waters off California until at least next June. 
Slightly more than half of the oil produced off the California coast occurs in 
federal waters beyond the three-mile limit. 
</P>
<P>
"The world has changed since the Valdez accident," Controller Gray Davis, a 
member of the commission, said Wednesday. "We've learned we can't afford to 
gamble with California's coastline," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just sheer dumb luck we haven't experienced the same catastrophic 
accident," added Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, another commission member. 
</P>
<P>
On a 2-0 vote, Davis and McCarthy set aside 310 square miles of ocean tracts 
located between the northern city limits of Newport Beach and Point Fermin in 
Los Angeles County, and all offshore lands in Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
The new sanctuary area established Wednesday is believed to hold between 100 
million and 300 million barrels of crude oil valued at between $500 million and 
$1 billion at today's prices. 
</P>
<P>
Most oil rigs off Orange County are along the Huntington Beach shoreline. 
Huntington Beach City Administrator Paul E. Cook on Wednesday praised the 
commission's ban on further leases off the city's shores. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think the visual blight caused by oil drilling off our shores is 
offensive," Cook said. "Our city hasn't been getting any new revenue from any 
of the new offshore rigs that have been popping up out there, so we get all the 
visual blight and no income from it." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach City Councilman Peter M. Green, an environmentalist who 
opposes expansion of offshore drilling, said the real danger to Orange County's 
coastline is in the federally controlled waters beyond the three-mile limit. 
"I'm more concerned about what the federal government plans to do," Green said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the coalition of coastal cities released a study made by a 
Virginia-based environmental consulting firm about the potential dangers of 
offshore drilling to Orange County. The $235,000 study said intensive offshore 
oil and gas drilling would severely cut the value of oceanfront property, and 
could reduce the local tourist trade by $223 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry interest in drilling in the newly created sanctuary areas off 
Orange and Los Angeles counties was said by the commission staff to be 
"modest." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's vote came despite protests from the oil industry, which pleaded for 
a "balanced" view that took national security and economic issues into account 
as well as environmental factors. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Covington, spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum Assn. and the 
California Coastal Operators Group, said California oil would minimize 
dependence on foreign oil. She also reminded the commission that since 1980 an 
estimated $3.5 billion in oil royalties have been paid into the state treasury, 
a good portion of it earmarked for education. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when the state must increase the sales tax to provide earthquake 
relief, it is not a time to cast aside this economic contribution to the 
state's welfare," Covington said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, the State Lands Commission imposed a ban on oil and gas 
drilling in state waters off the coasts of Humboldt and Mendocino counties. 
Last Feb. 9, President Bush announced a postponement of leasing in all federal 
waters -- those beyond three miles from shore -- in Northern and Central 
California, and Congress later imposed a ban in federal waters off Central 
California. A presidential task force on offshore drilling is scheduled to 
report back to Bush next month.

CAMPBELL LEADS LEGISLATIVE JUNKET IN N.Y.C.; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE: THE STATE SENATOR IS VISITING FINANCIAL AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS 
IN THE BIG APPLE SHORTLY BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Barely a month before he is expected to leave office for a high-paying private 
job, state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) is leading a weeklong 
legislative junket to New York City that includes as part of the agenda a tour 
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, Campbell is heading a 
delegation of six legislators -- five senators and Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown -- who were sent to New York this week at taxpayer's expense to ask 
investment bankers what California political leaders need to do to hold onto 
the AAA rating for state government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But an itinerary of the New York trip, released at the request of The Times, 
also shows that as part of their official duties, Campbell and his committee 
staff met with Metropolitan Museum President William Lueres to tour the 
world-renowned institution Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Burns, staff director of the joint budget committee, said Wednesday 
evening that he arranged the museum tour at the specific request of Campbell, 
who has a "personal interest" in the cultural institution because he is a board 
member of the California Museum of Science &amp; Industry in Los Angeles' 
Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his desire to have a better sense of how museums work," Burns said. "If 
we can have quality museums in California, it will help provide better quality 
of life for everybody in California." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Burns said that Campbell and his wife, Margene, have taken time 
off this week to see the the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall and "The Heidi 
Chronicles," a Broadway production that received the 1989 Tony Award and 
Pulitzer Prize for the year's best play. Tickets to the events were not put on 
the taxpayers' tab, Burns added. 
</P>
<P>
Informed of Campbell's trip, a spokesman for California Common Cause accused 
the Orange County senator Wednesday of taking advantage of his elected position 
just before he steps down next month to take a new job as president of the 
California Manufacturers Assn., a powerful Sacramento trade group. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's safe to say that there's at least an appearance that there is a 
free ride, a final journey of sorts, for a senator who may feel that this is 
what the state owes him for his service," said Mark Haarer, acting director of 
the public interest group. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we owe Senator Campbell anything at this point," said Haarer. 
"What he owes taxpayers is an immediate resignation from his position and a 
refusal to embark on any future trips that may be of such lavish cost to all 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
When Campbell announced his resignation Oct. 26, Common Cause criticized the 
senator for not stepping down immediately instead of early January as he plans. 
Campbell told reporters that he wanted to stay on to "clear up" a number of 
legislative endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
One of those is the New York trip, which Burns explained Wednesday is an annual 
trek taken by a number of state legislators to huddle with members of the New 
York financial community that assign ratings and help sell state government 
bonds. Campbell's joint legislative committee began making arrangements for the 
trip three years ago, and preparations for this week's excursion to New York 
City were made in August, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Campbell this week are Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach); 
Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose); Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland); Sen. 
Ken Maddy (R-Fresno); and Assembly Speaker Brown. Several of the senators 
brought their wives along. 
</P>
<P>
The group began arriving in New York Saturday and Sunday, and each senator is 
booked in suites that cost at least $350 a night in the exclusive Park Lane 
Hotel, a hotel clerk confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
During the week, the group has been scheduled to meet with representatives of 
the Fitch Investors Service bond-rating firm and four bond houses, including 
Drexel Burnham Lambert. In addition, Campbell's group has scheduled meetings 
with officials from the Pfizer Corp., Philip Morris and U.S. Tobacco to discuss 
the firms' concerns about the state's increased tobacco tax. 
</P>
<P>
Such meetings, said Maddy, are crucial for keeping up good relations and 
communication with bond house officials, whose highest AAA rating on state 
government bonds helps save taxpayers millions of dollars in annual interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the Legislature's fiscal leaders also learn plenty from the New York 
financial community, he said. "We learn a tremendous amount, we learn how we 
should and can react in order to keep California strong and viable," Maddy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the same would apply to Campbell, who has already announced he is 
leaving public office, Maddy said: "I don't begrudge him the fact that he's 
back here or that he's going to be a great benefit to California in his new 
role." 
</P>
<P>
Burns also said the public would benefit indirectly by financing Campbell's 
visit this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Sen. Campbell is going to provide service to the Legislature as an 
adviser and a longtime friend to the members," said Burns, who added that 
expenses for Campbell's wife would not be paid by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the schedule of important meetings, Campbell's group also has plenty of 
time to enjoy itself. With bond houses in the morning and corporate executives 
at dinner, the itinerary called for the lawmakers to take every afternoon off. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, for example, the group met with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
representatives over breakfast and then went on to the museum for the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to about noon (and) everybody went their separate ways," said Maddy. 
"My wife and I did some shopping." 
</P>
<P>
The schedule for Campbell's group also calls for the legislators to stay an 
extra night and return home Friday morning, although their last official 
meeting with Drexel Burnham is scheduled at 11 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Aide Burns said he allowed for the extra night in New York City because he 
didn't want the lawmakers getting snarled in Los Angeles air and automobile 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"If you leave here (Thursday night), you get into Los Angeles at 5 or 6 at 
night and it's a bitch to try to get across Los Angeles," said Burns.

PARK BOND MEASURE PUT ON APRIL BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday voted 4 to 0 to sponsor a $21-million bond measure 
designed to purchase 120 acres of farmland for a new park. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is scheduled for the April 10 ballot. The special election on the 
proposed general-obligation bonds would require support from two-thirds of 
those voting. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the 20-year bond issue show average payments of $5.83 per month for 
homeowners and $2.29 per month for mobile-home owners. 
</P>
<P>
Also enacted Tuesday was a "Save Open Space" program providing written proof 
that the city would create parks, a community center, a senior center and some 
agricultural uses on the acreage, if the bond purchase is a success. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a document that references to the bond measure," City Manager Stephen 
B. Julian said. "This way, people can have a written explanation when they ask 
about the bond, and we can say we have a program supporting it." 
</P>
<P>
The land is north of Junipero Serra Road and is envisioned as a "Central Park" 
by Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer. Much of it is covered with dying orange groves 
owned by former farmers who are having difficulty selling their land because it 
is under an agricultural preserve zone, enacted by the city in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the election has been declared, city officials cannot spend public 
money to take a position on the issue. They can, however, spend money to print 
and distribute educational information about the bond measure, Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue was recommended in a recently completed study saying the city 
has a shortage of recreational acreage. WENDY PAULSON

FBI SEEKS IDENTITY OF BANK ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI is asking for the public's help in identifying a bank robber who has 
struck Wells Fargo Bank branches in Laguna Hills and San Clemente recently. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the 6-foot 6-inch man presented tellers with notes, then fled 
with an undisclosed amount of money, FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The man struck most recently on Monday at the branch in the 24700 block of 
Alicia Parkway in Laguna Hills. Bucky Cox, who heads the FBI's office in Santa 
Ana, said the robber presented a note to the teller that read: "Give me large 
bills. I have a gun. I will shoot you." 
</P>
<P>
The bandit then handed a brown folder to the teller, which she filled with 
money and returned to him. While no gun was seen, Cox said the man wore a 
loose-fitting shirt that could easily conceal a gun tucked in a waistband. 
</P>
<P>
The same man also is believed to have robbed the Wells Fargo branch in the 700 
block of South El Camino Real in San Clemente on Nov. 17, FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said the man appears to weigh between 200 and 250 pounds, is in his 30s 
with brown hair and a mustache. He has worn a blue baseball cap during the 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Cox asked anyone with information to call the FBI at (714) 542-8825.

<P>
Mayor Larry Agran headed a five-member Irvine delegation that left for 
Hermosillo, Mexico, Wednesday to investigate the possibility of setting up a 
sister city relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine group planned to spend five days talking with officials of 
Hermosillo, a city of about 600,000 that is the capital of the Mexican state of 
Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Larsen, a city aide, said the group included Stella Cardoza, a 
representative of Irvine's city manager's office; Fred Niditch, from the Irvine 
Unified School District; Jeanne Keevil, editor of the Irvine World News; and 
Kenny Agran, the mayor's son. 
</P>
<P>
"Sister cities traditionally have cultural, economic and student exchanges," 
Larsen said. "Representatives from the two cities have been discussing this for 
several months." 
</P>
<P>
Agran is to discuss details of the trip at the next City Council meeting, which 
is scheduled for Tuesday. LEN HALL

<P>
A back yard pool in Newport Beach in which a toddler nearly drowned will be 
filled and transformed into a garden, the child's parents said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely going to do something and do something real soon," said 
Diana Landis, the child's mother. "My husband wants to turn it into a garden." 
</P>
<P>
Landis and her husband on Wednesday thanked Newport Beach Police Officer Bill 
Graham, who revived 18-month-old Jeffrey. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey fell into the pool Saturday while his father retrieved some gardening 
tools. The father found him floating motionless, called police and attempted to 
revive the child. 
</P>

Graham, 25, a father of two, responded. As a military policeman three years 
ago, Graham said he was once unsuccessful in trying to revive an asphyxiated 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, my God, it's happening again," Graham said. "I said to myself, 'I 
know that look. It's death, and I've seen it before.' " 
</P>
<P>
Graham said he saw the boy was not breathing and no airway had been 
established. Jeffrey had turned ashen, and his lips and hands were blue. The 
officer immediately held the infant face-up across his forearm to open his 
airway. Graham began patting the boy on the back, and Jeffrey began coughing 
and spitting up water. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was real fresh and just happened. Getting him breathing was the 
first thing," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey was released from a hospital Monday in good condition and with no sign 
of neurological damage. 
</P>
<P>
"After we saw him in the emergency room after an hour or so, we knew he was 
going to be OK," Landis said. 
</P>
<P>
When Jeffrey returned home, he showed no fear of the pool. It was almost as 
though he didn't remember a thing, Diana Landis said.

BLOOD, BULLET HOLES FOUND IN STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police found a stolen car Wednesday with bullet holes and blood on the driver's 
seat, but they could not immediately link the vehicle to any crime. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Nissan Sentra was found in the 400 block of South Andres Place about 8 
a.m., said police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. Sheriff's investigators 
identified the vehicle as one stolen in Laguna Hills on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The car had three bullet holes in it, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Police so far have no leads as to who was driving the vehicle or to any victims 
in the incident, Thomas said. Investigators are informing other departments of 
their find, she said.

CITY LISTS CHOICES FOR FEDERAL GRANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The City of La Habra will recommend that $321,000 in federal Community 
Development Block Grant funds be allocated for local projects during the 
1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed projects include reconstruction of a portion of Hazel Street between 
1st Avenue to a point just north of Erna Avenue; partial funding for the La 
Habra Community Resources Care Center, Neighborhood Housing Services of La 
Habra, the Gary Center, La Habra Local Development Co., and Neighborhood 
Housing Services of La Habra; and funding for improvements to alleys near the 
bus yard at the La Habra City School District office. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Lee Risner explained that as a city with fewer than 50,000 
residents, La Habra is subject to decisions made by county officials regarding 
the use of the federal money. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were (a larger) city we could count on getting about twice what we're 
getting now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county has awarded funds which did not follow the city's 
recommendations, Risner noted that "we've gone over and argued with them and 
have been reasonably successful in our arguments." DAVID F. BURKE

FIVE CITY COUNCILS SELECT NEW MAYORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five north Orange County city councils chose new mayors this week. 
</P>
<P>
In La Habra, Beth Graham was appointed mayor on a 4-0 vote with one abstention, 
replacing William Mahoney. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Douglas J. Bystry abstained and voiced objections to the process. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly favor an equal, fair and rotational basis for the selection of 
mayor in our city," he said. Bystry has served for three years on the council 
and said he felt it was his turn to become mayor a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Brea, former Mayor Pro Tem Carrey J. Nelson replaced Gene A. Leyton as mayor 
by a unanimous vote. Nelson, who previously served as mayor in 1983-84, said 
his election was "deja vu." 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, the council unanimously appointed Councilman A.B. (Buck) Catlin 
to serve as mayor, succeeding Molly McClanahan. It is Catlin's second term as 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In Placentia, Norman Z. Eckenrode was unanimously elected mayor, replacing 
Carol Downey. And in Yorba Linda, the City Council unanimously elected Gene 
Wisner, who also served in 1985.

<P>
REFERENDUM EFFORT ON ELECTIONS STALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legal glitch has stalled the referendum efforts of a Tustin group trying to 
overturn the City Council's decision to change local election dates. 
</P>
<P>
The group has gathered more than 600 signatures for a referendum, but some 
members, including leader Berklee Maughan, have stopped collecting signatures 
after learning of potential legal problems with the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James Rourke said last week that he would advise the council that 
the referendum is not proper even if enough signatures are gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Elections, he said, are not a proper topic for referendums. A spokesman for the 
California secretary of state's office agreed with that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"The referendum has died," said Councilman John Kelly, who had supported the 
effort. "I'm not going to collect any more signatures. All I can do is keep my 
fingers crossed that the judge rules in our favor Jan. 17." 
</P>
<P>
On that date a Superior Court judge is scheduled to hear a case brought last 
month by Kelly and Councilman Earl J. Prescott challenging the legal residency 
status of Ronald B. Hoesterey, who voted for the election-date change at his 
last meeting before resigning. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge rules in Kelly's and Prescott's favor, Hoesterey's vote, and hence 
the decision to change election dates, could be ruled invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott is not waiting until then, however. He has asked Assemblywoman Doris 
Allen to request an opinion on the referendum from the state legislative 
counsel. That opinion is due Monday, he said. Until then, he is still 
collecting signatures, which will be submitted as a petition if the referendum 
is ruled invalid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't over until the fat lady sings, and in this case, that's the 
legislative counsel opinion," Prescott said. SHANNON SANDS

3 YOUTHS SHOT IN PLACENTIA DRIVE-BY ATTACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Three youths were wounded Wednesday evening by shotgun blasts in a drive-by 
shooting, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The three unidentified victims -- believed to have been two girls and a boy -- 
were shot as they sat in a car on Tafolla Street at Orangethorpe Avenue, 
according to Placentia police and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Two shotgun blasts were fired from a vehicle passing by on Orangethorpe, said 
Police Lt. Ken Rowley. The assailants' vehicle then sped off. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gonzalez, 19, who witnessed the shooting as he was walking home, said he 
saw a passenger in a mini-truck point and fire a gun. He said the truck slowed 
suddenly and stereo music blasting from inside stopped. "I was stunned. I was 
tripping out. The guys (assailants) just took off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shotgun blasts blew out the front and rear windows of the white Buick 
Regal. All of the victims were taken to Placentia-Linda Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a boy and a girl appeared to have minor injuries, but another 
girl who stayed in a car appeared to be more seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Although youth gangs are known to be active in the area, Rowley said he did not 
know whether the shooting was related to gang activity.

SADDLEBACK VALLEY INCORPORATION SUPPORTED BY STUDY, GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of a fledgling movement to incorporate a wide area of Saddleback Valley 
say a preliminary study suggests that the proposed city would be financially 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Wilson, president of the Community Coalition for Incorporation, said that 
a study released Tuesday by an Oceanside financial consultant shows that a city 
consisting of El Toro, Lake Forest and Portola Hills would have a surplus of 
more than $5 million in the first year if revenue and spending remained at 
current levels. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really very encouraging," Wilson said Wednesday. "It proves that we 
would be healthy if we were a city." 
</P>
<P>
The group has already announced it will launch a petition drive in January to 
put cityhood on the ballot in November, 1990. This will be the group's second 
incorporation attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The petition drive and a financial feasibility study, paid for by the 
coalition, are needed by cityhood proponents as part of their incorporation 
application to the Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1988, South County's Mission Viejo, Dana Point and 
Laguna Niguel have opted for cityhood. Some residents of Laguna Hills are also 
considering such a move. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary study on El Toro adds up all revenue accrued in the area in 
fiscal year 1988-89 and compares it to expenditures by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year study will be followed early next year by a full financial 
feasibility study, which will project the financial condition of the proposed 
21-square-mile city for two years, said Fred Christiansen, who is conducting 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen, who also conducted the financial feasibility study for Laguna 
Niguel, said that the preliminary study was done to give pro-cityhood leaders 
an indication of whether to "go or not to go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
"These figures say, 'Go,' " Christiansen said. "Now they will move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said coalition members last met on Monday and are recruiting volunteers 
to circulate petitions. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't have much time," said Wilson, who was one of the leaders of 
last year's failed attempt to form a city called Saddleback Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike voters in the three newest cities, a majority of residents of El Toro, 
Lake Forest, Aegean Hills, Portola Hills and Laguna Hills have rejected bids 
for cityhood in the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
The incorporation attempt for Saddleback Valley, about a year ago, was defeated 
largely because of opposition from Laguna Hills voters, many of whom were 
planning to start an incorporation effort of their own. But the Laguna Hills 
incorporation effort last spring was defeated too, mostly because of opposition 
from Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wilson said that she and other community leaders are renewing their 
pro-cityhood campaign because of an informal survey that suggested interest in 
forming a city that does not include Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 202 people surveyed in interviews at local shopping centers, 50% favored 
incorporation, 20% opposed it and 30% were undecided, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The new city would include the proposed Foothills Ranch Planned Community, 
which would include 4,000 homes, an industrial complex and a commercial center 
between Portola Hills and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The group must gather the signatures of 25% of the 28,000 registered voters who 
live within the proposed city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest opposition to the incorporation effort may come from residents of 
Portola Hills, an isolated neighborhood that often affiliates itself more with 
rural Trabuco Canyon than it does with El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Portola Hills Homeowners Assn. said they were against the effort 
at an Oct. 23 meeting with Wilson and other pro-city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The level of opposition, Wilson conceded, could match that of Laguna Hills 
residents during the Saddleback Valley campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of people come (to the meeting) who were dead set against 
(incorporation)," Wilson said.

MONTANA SAYS HE'LL BE READY TO START AGAINST RAMS MONDAY

Bruised ribs, flak jacket and all, Joe Montana says he will be the starting 
quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers in their showdown with the Rams Monday 
night in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't feel any worse than it has the last couple of weeks," Montana said 
of his rib injury. "I'll be ready to play Monday night." 
</P>
<P>
Surprised? Were you expecting Steve Young? 
</P>
<P>
Not when Montana has started seven games against the Rams in Anaheim Stadium 
and won seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Montana was removed from last Sunday's game with Atlanta just before halftime 
after reinjuring his bruised ribs. 
</P>
<P>
But he attended 49er practice Wednesday, and said he would join in Thursday's 
workout. It wasn't a day off for Montana, however. It was the second of three 
days of electric stimulation treatment to his rib cage by trainer Lindsy 
McLean. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I took a breath I felt this sharp pain above my rib cage," Montana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays were taken at halftime to rule out the possibility of a punctured lung. 
</P>
<P>
Montana said he could have played in the second half, if needed, but that the 
pain would have limited his mobility. 
</P>
<P>
George Seifert, 49er coach, making it clear that Montana would be his starter 
against the Rams, expressed concern for his quarterback's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
"If Joe is healthy, and I go by what he tells me and what our medical staff 
tells me, he's our quarterback. We've got a great quarterback who's banged up, 
but he's played hurt quite a bit of his career, and done a heck of a job." 
</P>
<P>
Montana has been sacked 29 times in 11 games, six more than the comparable 
period last year, raising questions about his protection. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there could be more protection from the offensive line," Seifert said. 
"I know that's something we're working on." 
</P>
<P>
Seifert also acknowledged his game plan included doing "something new" to 
combat the Rams' accent on the passing game. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Everett is a fine quarterback and I'm sure the Rams will try to do 
whatever they can to spread out our defense," Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
In the teams' first meeting this season, a 13-12 Ram victory on Mike Lansford's 
last-minute field goal, Everett hooked up with Flipper Anderson for a 65-yard 
scoring pass play, the game's only touchdown. In all, Anderson had four 
receptions for 112 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Anderson) is awfully good," Seifert said. "He's a tough man to deal 
with. And, if their quarterback has any time at all, he's been particularly 
effective in the latter stages of the game, as he was in ours." 
</P>
<P>
To combat the Everett-Anderson combination and the expected return of Henry 
Ellard after a two-game absence due to a strained hamstring, Seifert said: "I 
think we'll have to do something different (in contrast to the first meeting). 
Just to say we'll play our basic defense against them won't get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ram defensive end Doug Reed was put on injured reserve Wednesday with a 
sprained ankle, and rookie linebacker Brian Smith was activated to take his 
place. Reed, the team's starter at left end, was injured in the Rams' victory 
over Phoenix Nov. 19. He will spend a minimum of six weeks on injured reserve, 
effectively ending his season unless the Rams advance through the playoffs. . . 
. In the week's first injury report to league headquarters, quarterback Joe 
Montana was listed as "probable" for Monday night's game. Montana is one of 
three 49ers who lead NFC individual statistical categories. Montana is the 
top-rated passer with a 116.1 rating. Receiver Jerry Rice is the leading 
receiver with 70 catches for 1,298 yards, and kicker Mike Cofer leads the 
conference in scoring with 113 points. . . . With a two-game lead with three to 
play, Monday night doesn't present a "must-win" situation for the 49ers. But 
Coach George Seifert makes it clear he wants a victory badly. A victory would 
not only wrap up the NFC West title, but would ensure a home-field advantage 
throughout the playoffs.

DAVIS CUP TEAM TO FEATURE CHANG, LEACH, BUT NOT AGASSI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Agassi doesn't play the Australian Open and he doesn't play Wimbledon. 
And after the U.S. team was announced Wednesday, Agassi doesn't play Davis Cup 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite sure he does not consider this a slap in the face," said Agassi's 
agent, Bill Shelton of International Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
In something of a surprise, Placentia's Michael Chang and Aaron Krickstein will 
play singles, and Laguna Beach's Rick Leach and Jim Pugh will make their Davis 
Cup debut in doubles when the United States meets Mexico in a first-round match 
Feb. 2-4 at LaCosta. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gorman, captain of the U.S. team, said he told Agassi that other players 
deserved a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our conversation is private, but I will tell you I told him that there were 
others playing a lot better, and this was their opportunity to play," Gorman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team represents a complete break from the past since none of the four 
players named to the squad played in this year's quarterfinal victory over 
France or in the semifinal loss to West Germany -- when Agassi lost twice in 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker beat Agassi in a key match, coming from two sets down, as the West 
Germans defeated the United States, 3-2, at Munich in July. The defending Davis 
Cup champions entertain Sweden later this month at Stuttgart in a rematch of 
last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team defeated Paraguay, 5-0, and France, 5-0, before losing to West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, 17, played in his first Davis Cup last February against Paraguay and won 
both of his matches. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said Chang and Krickstein are among seven Americans ranked in the top 13 
who could have been chosen, but they were asked to play because their time had 
come -- and it was the same with Leach and Pugh. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little bit of looking with an eye to the future, too," said Gorman, 
whose job of picking a team to play Mexico became slightly difficult because of 
(a) John McEnroe's decision to sit this round out and (b) Agassi's scattered 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman scouted the No. 4-ranked McEnroe, No. 5 Chang, No. 6 Gilbert, No. 7 
Agassi and No. 8 Krickstein last week in New York during the Masters 
tournament, where Agassi drew more attention for the pink bicycling tights he 
wore beneath his shorts and his black-and-pink polished fingernail than he did 
with his tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said then that he wanted to play in the Davis Cup, but his agent said 
Wednesday that Agassi is happy with the team that was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
"I just talked to him and he sounded great to me," Shelton said. "He'll just 
spend his time getting ready for the tour." 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, 22, last played in the Davis Cup in 1987, when the United States 
was beaten by Paraguay, 3-2. He lostthe deciding match to Victor Pecci. 
Krickstein wasn't planning on playing against Mexico and had scheduled a heavy 
workload around Davis Cup time. He plays at Sydney and in the Australian Open 
at Melbourne, then in the Davis Cup and in an ATP tournament at Milan the 
following week. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's hard to say no to the Davis Cup," said Krickstein, who speculated on 
why Gorman said no to Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's just a thing to make him work harder, to get him going again; that 
he's not just on the team if he doesn't perform," Krickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Should the United States defeat Mexico, the next round would be in Europe 
against either Czechoslovakia or Switzerland. Gorman said he may choose an 
entirely different team after the Mexican matches. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, nobody is guaranteed," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told them all, the easiest thing in the world is a country where there 
are only four players to start with," Gorman said. "There are no surprises 
there." 
</P>
<P>
For the U.S. team, the surprises began Wednesday.

NO. 1 BREA-OLINDA STARTS SLOWLY, THEN ROARS PAST NO. 2 EL TORO

For a little more than one quarter, Brea-Olinda High School looked vulnerable 
in the championship game of the Irvine Girls' Basketball Tournament at 
Woodbridge High School. 
</P>
<P>
Second-ranked El Toro led the county's top-ranked team by four points a minute 
into the second half. Then reality set in. El Toro went cold from the perimeter 
and Brea scored 13 consecutive points to take a 30-21 lead two minutes before 
the half. El Toro never recovered and wound up losing, 75-55. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Wildcats' points in the decisive run came on the inside from 
Jinelle Williams, a 5-foot-8 center. Williams led all scorers with 24 points 
and was the tournament's most valuable player. Brea-Olinda is unbeaten in four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The early season matchup of the county's top two teams left unanswered one 
question: Can a county team beat Brea-Olinda? 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (3-1) gave a good account of itself, staying closer than Brea's 
previous three tournament opponents, who lost by margins of 28, 32 and 28.

'TIS THE SEASON TO BE SANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you couldn't make it as an Elvis impersonator and you're willing to put on a 
little weight, there's still hope. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of openings these days for Santa Claus in stores and shopping 
malls. As any retailer worth his receivables has discovered, booking the man 
with the rosy cheeks, twinkling eyes and furry red suit can boost sales by 
bringing in hundreds of kid-toting shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
At Nordstrom in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Santa will attract "a couple 
hundred" shoppers per day, said Greg Flotho, manager of the children's boutique 
there. "When kids see him, they can drag Mom here to sit on Santa's lap, then 
say, 'I like this tractor, Mom' or 'This is a neat doll,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a booming business has emerged to supply sleigh-loads of Santas to 
malls, car dealers, restaurants, hotels and even banks during the holiday 
season. And there is brisk competition for the most convincing Santas -- those 
with the best potbellies, silvery-white beards, and hearty ho-ho-hos. 
</P>
<P>
The jostling for likely candidates is no surprise considering that Santa can 
mean the difference for merchants between a merry Christmas and an unhappy 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Besides retailers relying on St. Nick to help boost sales, shopping malls can 
reap handsome fees by providing space for Santa, and the suppliers -- typically 
photography firms or promotional agencies -- take in thousands of dollars from 
their photo concessions. Even Santa can pull down more than double the minimum 
wage for each hour spent with kids on his knee. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least a dozen major agencies -- many of them national -- and 
scores of smaller firms that send Santas to Southland retailers. They include 
Western Temporary Services of Walnut Creek, Ciresi &amp; Associates of 
Newberry, Ohio, Chris Cringle Special Events cof San Pedro, Dixie Doodle 
Entertainment of Orange, Cherry Hill Photos of New Jersey and Santa Plus of St. 
Charles, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the suppliers provide a professional photographer with Santa, who snaps 
shots of the kids with St. Nick at about $6 a clip. Some even offer videotapes 
of the brief sessions with Kris Kringle, for about $20 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa suppliers typically can gross $35,000 to $40,000 at an average-sized 
regional mall for the season from photo sales and sales of novelty items, such 
as reindeer antlers and Christmas coloring books. 
</P>
<P>
The potential revenue has caused competition in the Santa industry to climb 
about 200% in 20 years, estimated Jenny Zink, national marketing director with 
Western Temp, which began its Santa division in 1968 and now places about 3,300 
St. Nicks each year. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the agencies and photo studios each year suit up and ship out as 
many as 20,000 Kris Kringles to malls, parades and parties throughout the 
nation, retail officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
And of the money taken in from photo sales, 25% to 40% will go back to the 
malls as a commission. It's not unusual for a regional center each Christmas 
season to collect anywhere from $10,000 to $25,000 -- depending on the mall's 
size -- from photo sales, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the photo sales, malls and other retailers shell out anywhere from 
$1,500 to $5,000 for the season, or up to $150 per hour, to have a Santa or two 
greeting customers. 
</P>
<P>
The yearly demand for Santa's throne depends on how retailers size up the 
holiday shopping season. With Christmas sales this year off to a slow start, 
the Santa business has been brisk, retail officials said. Half a dozen firms 
estimated that requests for St. Nick this year are running 15% to 20% ahead of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers look to Santa to put shoppers in a jovial, carefree mood -- all the 
better for opening their wallets. Moreover, his mere presence draws shoppers 
into toy departments. 
</P>
<P>
Santa's drawing power is especially helpful in drawing crowds on slow weekdays, 
when busy parents are less likely to shop. Zink estimates that mall traffic 
jumps 10% to 15% when Santa is in a major store. 
</P>
<P>
Even Santa, who may be an aspiring actor, a lawyer or a retired executive, can 
reap some of the financial rewards. In the Los Angeles area, Kris Kringles earn 
$5 to $9 an hour for a seasonal gig and $75 to $150 an hour for parties. 
</P>
<P>
But a good Santa is not always easy to find. The supplier's search for St. Nick 
often begins as early as September. But "it's always very difficult to get 
Santas," said one Santa supplier who asked not to be named. "We're out there 
busting our butts on this." 
</P>
<P>
To find him, companies scour senior-citizen bulletin boards, Daily Variety for 
out-of-work actors, and lists of last year's recruits. And the quest for 
potential prospects doesn't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see (a Santa look-alike) at a bus stop, I'll pull over" and ask him, said 
Cathy Perks, a manager for Western Temporary Services in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one elderly man told Perks that she was the sixth person to approach 
him in five weeks. "He said he was going to shave off his beard because he 
couldn't take it any more -- he was out here for a mellow vacation and everyone 
was attacking him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the search reaches right into the shopping mall, when customers with 
whiskers -- or who just look jolly -- are cajoled in a pinch to fill Santa's 
boots for even a day. 
</P>
<P>
"The show must go on," explains Bill Salerno, sales director with Ciresi &amp; 
Associates, which supplies surrogate Santas to about 300 malls across the 
United States. "When you're doing that many, it's bound to happen at one or two 
malls" every year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don the whiskers soon find that being Santa isn't necessarily the 
easiest job in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers, for one thing, are notoriously picky when it comes to choosing who 
sits on Santa's throne. 
</P>
<P>
Maura Eggan, marketing director at South Coast Plaza, demands that Kris Kringle 
not only be terrific with children, but "is the creme de la creme. He has a 
real beard and . . . the kidneys of a camel, so he never goes to the bathroom 
or takes lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Santas routinely get thrown up on and worse. "Sometimes little kids are just 
scared to death -- they may try to pull off a beard or act just like a puppy 
and go potty. . . . And any time Santa stands on a street outside a store, the 
big red Santa suit is a great target for kids with cups of ice or BB guns," 
said Nancy Clayton, manager in Temple City with Western Temp. 
</P>
<P>
After days like that, the easy part of the job is learning the names of all 
eight reindeer and sitting for what can be an eight-hour stretch in a 40-pound 
suit, lifting hundreds of 2- and 3-year-old leg-biters. 
</P>
<P>
But come Christmas eve -- when stockrooms are starting to looking bare -- it 
all becomes worthwhile. After all, as Western Temp's Clayton put it: "Santa 
gets to be a pain in the neck -- but he's a very special person."

SCHICK CENTERS SEEKING A FINANCIAL CURE; 
</P>
<P>
ADDICTIONS: PATRICK J. FRAWLEY JR.'S HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING DESPITE THE BOOM 
IN DRUG- AND ALCOHOL-TREATMENT SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
STUDIO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick J. Frawley Jr. has had a diverse career. He started in the 
import-export business, ran a company that makes ballpoint pens, chaired the 
Schick Safety Razor Co. and another concern that makes movie prints. He is also 
a wealthy man and recently sold one of his Holmby Hills estates to television 
producer Aaron Spelling. 
</P>
<P>
But for the last 20 years, Frawley, 65, now chairman and president of Frawley 
Corp. in Studio City, has had a one-track mind. He wants to cure the nation's 
alcoholics, drug addicts and smokers of their habits, and he thinks his 
company's Schick hospitals and clinics are the places to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"My entire focus is on the hospitals because it's a life-and-death matter," 
said Frawley, who ought to know: He is a reformed alcoholic and he believes 
addictions can be cured through negative reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Drug and alcohol treatment would seem to be booming these days, with movie 
stars and athletes coming out of the closet with their substance-abuse problems 
and because of the nationwide charge started by former First Lady Nancy Reagan 
to "just say no" to drugs. Indeed, the number of drug and alcohol programs in 
the United States increased from 5,747 in 1982 to 6,866 in 1987, according to 
the National Assn. of Addiction Treatment Providers, an Irvine-based trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's big business now," said Alan Haveson, spokesman for the National Council 
on Alcoholism, a New York-based research and education group that estimates 
about $15 billion a year is spent on chemical dependency treatments. 
</P>
<P>
But Frawley's three Schick Shadel hospitals and three smaller Schick clinics in 
California, Washington and Texas -- which originally adopted their names from 
the Schick razor company and have been around since before former First Lady 
Betty Ford even admitted she was an alcoholic, much less started her own clinic 
-- are in need of some therapy themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine months that ended Sept. 30, Frawley lost $1.2 million on revenue of 
$21 million, and its stock, which is listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange, has 
slipped from a 1988 high of $8.50 a share to $6.50. The number of patients 
admitted to Schick fell 18% in the last year, to about 2,000, and company 
officials admit a return to profitability isn't right around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
That is partly because of the growing competition, but Frawley said the company 
has been hurt even more by recent cutbacks in insurance coverage for chemical 
dependency treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Employers and insurance companies are increasingly favoring outpatient care 
over inpatient programs, which often are more than twice as expensive. That's 
bad news for Schick's drug and alcohol programs, which require patients to stay 
for about two weeks and which cost $12,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're doing is trying to save dollars, not do what's best for the 
patient," said David Batt, Frawley's vice president, treasurer and secretary. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Waldron, spokesman for the Health Insurance Assn. of America, a 
Washington-based trade group, said insurers are justified in emphasizing 
outpatient treatment, because recent studies show that outpatient programs are 
as effective as inpatient programs for most addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Frawley isn't the only company in the industry that's suffering. Comprehensive 
Care Corp. of Irvine, the nation's largest alcohol and drug treatment concern, 
has been losing money; its stock has plunged, and it's trying to stave off 
creditors who want payment of $25 million in overdue loans. 
</P>
<P>
Frawley, who refused to have his photograph taken for this article, will talk 
of little else but his method of treating addictions. 
</P>
<P>
When a visitor asked him recently about plans for the company, he launched into 
a discourse about Kitty Dukakis, the wife of former presidential candidate 
Michael Dukakis, and her much-publicized substance abuse. Frawley maintained 
that Kitty Dukakis could be cured by the Schick method. 
</P>
<P>
This method uses negative reinforcement to teach the subconscious mind to 
dislike the addictive drug -- sort of a twist on Pavlov's dogs. Patients are 
confronted with the substances they are addicted to, while small electric 
shocks and drugs that induce nausea are administered. 
</P>
<P>
This technique is markedly different from the abstinence, counseling and "talk 
therapy" favored by Alcoholics Anonymous and well-known detoxification centers, 
such as the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage and Hazelden in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
But Max A. Schneider, medical director of family recovery services at St. 
Joseph's Hospital in Orange, said there is no single treatment that works for 
all people. "Most of us feel there is a place for aversion therapy," he said. 
"Our problem is in appropriate selection of patients." 
</P>
<P>
P. Joseph Frawley, Patrick's son and a doctor who runs the Schick Shadel 
Hospital in Santa Barbara, admitted that the Schick method isn't foolproof. One 
year after treatment, 65% of the patients treated at Schick for alcohol 
dependency, 52% of the smokers and 51% of the cocaine addicts remain free of 
their habits. Still, he said, those results compare favorably with many other 
drug programs. 
</P>
<P>
Frawley's departure into drug treatment capped a long and varied career. He 
started in the import-export business in San Francisco more than 40 years ago. 
When a loan he made to a company that made ballpoint pen parts wasn't paid 
back, he took over the business, which became the Papermate Pen Co. 
</P>
<P>
Frawley sold Papermate to Gillette in 1955 for $15.5 million, which back then 
was a considerable fortune. In 1958, he became chairman and chief executive of 
Schick Safety Razor Co., where he stayed until 1970. From 1961 to 1970, he was 
also chairman of Technicolor, a North Hollywood company that makes film prints 
and videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
While he was at the Schick razor company, Frawley earned a reputation for 
tempestuousness. Frawley "was a temperamental individualist whose erratic 
traits were magnified by a drinking problem," wrote Russell Adams in his book 
"King C. Gillette, the Man and His Wonderful Shaving Device." 
</P>
<P>
It was during his tenure at Schick that Frawley realized he was an alcoholic 
and sought treatment at Shadel Hospital in Seattle. He was so impressed with 
the program that he bought the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Frawley sold the Schick razor blade business to Warner-Lambert, but 
kept the hospital, which he had renamed Schick Shadel. "I couldn't keep my mind 
on it so I sold it," he said of the razor business. "People were dying. What 
would you do?"

COURT PAPERS ACCUSE IACOCCA OF IMPROPER AUTO PROFITS

<P>
In documents filed in support of a lawsuit, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca 
has been accused of using his position to improperly profit on sales of 
Lamborghini cars sold through an Orange County dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Jasjit Singh Rarewala alleges that Iacocca and another Chrysler executive, H.F. 
Carlini, channeled a number of specially built Lamborghini Countachs to a 
Newport Beach dealership co-owned by Carlini's nephew, Anthony Carlini. 
</P>
<P>
Rarewala filed a $50-million suit against Chrysler in Los Angeles Superior 
Court in April, alleging that Chrysler breached a contract to sell him 
franchise rights by granting an exclusive Orange County dealer franchise to 
Newport Auto Center. Chrysler bought the Italian car maker in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Rarewala added the allegations against Iacocca and Carlini in October after 
discovering that Carlini owned 50% of that dealership, which is partly owned by 
Steven Bren, son of Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca and Carlini have not been named as defendants in the suit. The 
allegations against them were made in response to a motion by Chrylser to move 
the trial to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Rarewala's attorney successfully argued that the case should remain in Los 
Angeles because of related litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The new filing contends that "Lee Iacocca . . . is personally involved in 
Newport Auto Center through at least the attempted sale at an enormous profit 
of at least $100,000 of a 1989 25th Anniversary Edition Lamborghini Countach." 
</P>
<P>
Those cars are part of a limited run of about 30 units available for U.S. sale 
that are said to be commanding more than three times their $156,000 price in 
the California market. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spokesman Tom Kowaleski said he could not comment on the suit because 
it is pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
However Ward's Auto Dealer, a monthly trade publication, on Wednesday quoted 
White &amp; Case, Chrysler's legal counsel, as saying in court documents that 
any suggestion Iacocca would try to profit on a run-up in Countach prices is 
"slanderous" and "rank hearsay." 
</P>
<P>
The manager of Newport Auto Center could not be reached for comment.

WHAT TO DO IF YOUR PARENTS FALL ILL; 
</P>
<P>
GERONTOLOGY: CARE-GIVING CAN BE A BACKBREAKING TASK. HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS 
ON HOW TO EASE THE BURDEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most elderly Americans are hale and hearty. But when illness or infirmity does 
strike seniors, their children come running. Better Homes and Gardens magazine 
provides the following tips on how to prepare for that day. 
</P>
<P>
Care-giving is a backbreaking task. The sheer work and worry involved in caring 
for an aging parent can quickly exhaust the most stalwart care giver. Paper 
work required by public services agencies and insurance companies can be a 
nightmare. That's why experts urge care givers to seek public or private aid to 
ease the burden. Home-based help includes: 
</P>
<P>
* Home nursing. Visiting nurses handle many medical needs -- changing bandages, 
even some intravenous therapy. In addition, some home health agencies help with 
toileting, bathing, dressing, medications and other constant chores. 
</P>
<P>
* Home health aide and homemakers services. Maybe all the parent needs is an 
aide to be a companion, do light housework and help with shopping while their 
children are at work. Home health agencies sometimes provide these services. 
Check with the city or county social services department for public and private 
referrals. 
</P>
<P>
* Respite care. Care givers often deny their own need for a break. That's a 
major mistake. Call a local Area Agency on Aging office to find someone who 
will come to sit with the parent for a few hours, or even stay over one or more 
nights to allow for a vacation. Costs vary widely, but some volunteer 
organizations will offer a few hours of respite care for free. 
</P>
<P>
* Barrier removal. An architect with experience in removing barriers can advise 
on widening doorways for wheelchair access, installing a chairlift, adding 
grab-bars in the bathroom, or lowering counters. Bath chairs, adjustable beds 
and the like can be rented at home health equipment centers. Medicare sometimes 
helps pay rental costs for prescribed, so-called "durable" equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Either free-standing or located in nursing homes, churches, community centers 
or hospitals, elderly day-care programs are appropriate for seniors (including 
Alzheimer's patients) who require some assistance with their basic physical 
needs and support during emotional downturns. Be warned, however, that some 
adult day-care centers refuse to accept clients who are incontinent. 
</P>
<P>
In adult day care, patients socialize, exercise, play games, sing, enjoy a hot 
meal and even get a permanent or a haircut. Often, participants also receive 
personal care, nursing, and therapy. Fees, usually adjusted to the patient's 
ability to pay, average $28 a day, with a number of subsidies available within 
many communities. Transportation to and from the center may cost extra. Check 
the local aging, social services, or health departments for information on 
nearby programs. 
</P>
<P>
Two insurance companies, Travelers and Aetna, sell policies covering day care 
(and many other) expenses. Generally these policies are made available by 
employers and may cover both the workers and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Don't rule out help from work. The responsibility of caring for parents can 
cause absenteeism and stress. A few companies support respite programs or allow 
extended leaves of absence. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 7% of people between 75 and 84 require nursing home care. Sometimes, 
however, out-of-home care is the only solution. Some types of care to consider 
are: 
</P>
<P>
* Skill care. For folks requiring around-the-clock nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
* Intermediate. For people too frail to live alone who are prone to health 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
* Custodial. For elderly who need companionship and help with eating, dressing 
and hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
Intermediate and custodial care often are not covered by insurance, so consider 
in-home care or group living before turning to a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
If a nursing home is the answer, investigate thoroughly before making a 
commitment. Some things to look for and ask: 
</P>
<P>
* Is the home equipped to care for the patient's specific condition? 
</P>
<P>
* Notice if the staff is helping the residents eat. How close is the 
supervision? 
</P>
<P>
* Is the home clean and pleasant? 
</P>
<P>
* Is the home certified for Medicare and Medicaid? Ask to see a copy of the 
state licensing inspector's latest report.

SCHIMMEL LEAVING AS NEWPORT CURATOR FOR POST AT MOCA; 
</P>
<P>
MUSEUM: HIS RESIGNATION AT NEWPORT HARBOR FOLLOWS THAT OF ITS DIRECTOR AND 
COMES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF A MAJOR FUND DRIVE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Schimmel has resigned as chief curator of the Newport Harbor Art Museum to 
become chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second resignation of a major Newport Harbor Art Museum official -- 
director Kevin Consey left in October to become director of the Chicago Museum 
of Contemporary Art -- at a time when the museum is in the early stages of a 
$50-million building and endowment campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But museum trustee Harry Bubb on Wednesday downplayed the effect of the 
resignations on fund-raising efforts. Individuals and corporations already 
solicited "know (the museum's) history, background and level of (community) 
support," Bubb said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the museum will refrain from approaching foundations 
and other funding sources unfamiliar with the museum until a new director is in 
place. The museum hopes to hire a director "by the end of the first quarter of 
the (new) year," he said. Ground breaking for the new building, designed by 
Renzo Piano, has been scheduled for late 1990 with the opening slated for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that Paul Schimmel certainly did an outstanding 
job for the museum," Bubb said. "He is very highly regarded nationally. . . . 
It is a loss one would have preferred not to have occurred, but it does enable 
us to say to (the) new director, 'You will have a substantial say in the hiring 
of a new curator.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although Schimmel won't assume his new position until April 16, he will begin 
the transition later this month by working at MOCA one day a week. He is 
succeeding Mary Jane Jacob, who left MOCA in October to pursue independent 
curatorial projects. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits at Newport Harbor are scheduled through December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
During his eight-year tenure at Newport Harbor, Schimmel, 35, organized a 
retrospective of Chris Burden's work and several exhibitions of post-war 
American art. He also initiated the "Newport Biennial" and an ongoing 
exhibition series, "New California Artists." 
</P>
<P>
Schimmel called his appointment "a great honor. . . . MOCA is an institution 
which in less than 10 years has become recognized as one of the top museums 
internationally." 
</P>
<P>
He said Newport Harbor has been "a richly rewardly experience" and noted that 
while he was there the museum "was transformed from a regionally known 
institution to an internationally recognized contemporary art museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Newport Harbor has provided the most significant opportunity a curator can 
have: the freedom and support to create programs and build a collection in an 
original manner," Schimmel said. 
</P>
<P>
He singled out the 1988 Burden exhibition and a 1986 show, "The Interpretive 
Link: Abstract Surrealism Into Abstract Expressionism -- Works on Paper 
1938-1948," as "the most significant" exhibits he curated at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Acquisitions of California postwar art increased 300% during his tenure, 
including works by James Turrell, Bill Viola, Ed Kienholz, Ed Ruscha, Billy Al 
Bengston, Tom Marioni and John Baldessari. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Koshalek, director of MOCA, said Schimmel was hired after an 
"international search" for "an individual who had the energy, creativity and 
experience in dealing with contemporary art that would continue MOCA's program 
into the second decade of its history. 
</P>
<P>
"The founding of MOCA had to to with the '80s; now we're moving into the '90s. 
The buildings are built, the core (works) for the collection are now in place. 
. . . As we move into a new decade we were looking for the appropriate person 
to lead the curatorial staff. We feel Paul is the right person." 
</P>
<P>
Schimmel holds a BA in museum studies from Syracuse University and did graduate 
work in modern art at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. He was 
an intern at the Whitney Museum of American Art and a curator at the 
Contemporary Art Museum in Houston from 1975 to 1978.

RILEY ASKS STUDY OF O.C. ARTS TO ASSESS NEEDS; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: THE FINDINGS COULD BRING ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS' HISTORICAL HANDS-OFF POLICY.

Supervisor Thomas F. Riley has asked county officials to conduct a study of the 
arts in Orange County. "The county has not played an active role (in the arts) 
in the past, and the supervisor has decided to evaluate what kind of role it 
should play in the future," said Courtney Wiercioch, Riley's executive 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have an arts policy . . . so we're trying to gather information and 
determine if we should have a policy and if so what it should be," Wiercioch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The study, to be conducted by the county administrative office, probably will 
be completed by late February, Wiercioch said. 
</P>
<P>
Wiercioch said Riley requested the study in response to the "momentum" of the 
local arts scene. She cited the $73-million Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, construction of an $18-million theater at UC Irvine, and a 1,500-seat 
performing arts hall proposed for South County. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, as Wiercioch said, county support of the arts has been somewhere 
between "slim and none." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the Board of Supervisors designated the Orange County Arts Alliance, 
an organization meant to promote and support local arts, as the county's 
official arts planning agency. But the board never funded the alliance, which 
dissolved after 14 years last December without having achieved its goals. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have made, and still make, individual grants to arts groups with 
money from their personal discretionary budgets or revenue-sharing funds. And 
last year, the board established a task force to study the possibility of an 
art program at John Wayne Airport. Supervisors are scheduled to vote in January 
on the task force's recommendations to create an ambitious ongoing art program 
at the airport's new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
However, none of the county's $2.9-billion budget is earmarked for the arts. By 
contrast, Los Angeles County has set aside $35 million for arts projects this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The study requested by Riley will address funding and will analyze the various 
ways other counties support the arts, financial or otherwise, as well as 
existing municipal arts agencies in and outside of Orange County, Wiercioch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's request for the study has won praise yesterday from the local arts 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Weil, an arts management consultant and director of the ad hoc Committee 
to Form an Orange County Arts Council, said its members are "strongly 
supportive of this step." The committee of 27 local arts officials is working 
to establish a countywide arts support organization to take up where the 
alliance left off.

A REMARKABLY FRANK RENDITION OF 'LES LIAISONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
"Les Liaisons Dangereuses" should be played lusty, unzippered, untouched by 
moral reserve. If a director pulls back, the sexual adventurism and venal 
boudoir politics won't carry much weight; they might as well be a series of 
randy skits on the Benny Hill show. 
</P>
<P>
Director Gary Krinke unlaces "Liaisons"' corsets at Fullerton College. 
Actually, "unlaces" is polite -- at times, he just about rips them free. 
Especially considering the campus setting, this is a remarkably frank 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Krinke doesn't let things go too far. Everything is more suggested than 
realized (and there isn't any nudity). The actors startle at times but they 
shouldn't offend, unless your point of view is especially conservative. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, one particularly unsettling scene. Valmont's mental and 
physical assault on the young, virginal Cecile does leave an itch, as it is 
played primarily for laughs. To a college audience that probably has been 
counseled on "date rape," these moments may seem a coarse trivialization of 
sexual confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, though, "Liaisons" should be seen as a piece set in its own period. 
In Christopher Hampton's play, on which both the "Dangerous Liaisons" and Milos 
Forman's recently released "Valmont" films are based, Paris of the 1780s is a 
city bloated with desire. Sex and conquest are the favorite sports, and the 
nobles are particularly good at both. They're ignorant of the coming 
revolution; they'd rather play games. 
</P>
<P>
None is better than the Marquise de Merteuil (Kat Van Schaik) and Valmont 
(Brian Kojac), former lovers who are so effete that they can only be energized 
by exploiting their fellows. 
</P>
<P>
"Liaisons" rotates around a bet. The Marquise offers herself to Valmont if he 
can seduce the lovely but chaste Mme. de Tourvel (Julie Guevara), and Valmont 
accepts. Other liaisons erupt and are left in his wake. Valmont finds his own 
Waterloo in all this busybodying. 
</P>
<P>
Krinke's cast is competent enough, though some of the actors may seem too young 
for such sophisticated maneuverings. Van Schaik brings a hardened appetite to 
the Marquise that serves well, and Kojac's Valmont is a preening sensualist of 
the first order (just look at him writhe during his massage). This Valmont is 
too glib, though, a trait that lowers the currency on his supposedly 
inestimable charm. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Liaisons" is such a visual period piece, the costumes had better be 
good. Mela-Hoyt-Heydon's are very good. Bob Jensen's pristinely white sets are 
graceful, as is Dan Michelson's clever lighting.

CAMARILLO'S FISCAL WOES FADING AFTER 1987 INVESTMENT DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By JOANNA MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bond brokers from around the country still call Camarillo City Hall every day 
looking for Donald Tarnow, the investments officer accused of single-handedly 
losing all the city's money and then some in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The calls continue nearly two years after the discovery that $25 million in the 
city's treasury had been wiped out, turned from assets into debts through 
Tarnow's high-risk and high-stakes trading in the bond market with public 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We get calls all the time from all over the country from people who worked 
with Camarillo in its heyday, people who knew Donald Tarnow," said Finance 
Director Robert Cole, who joined the staff six months ago. "I tell them we have 
no money to invest today." 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. Camarillo has almost dug itself out of what seemed a 
bottomless pit when the losses were revealed to stunned city residents in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The general fund is still $450,000 in the hole, but it was down $4.2 million in 
July, 1988. The city still owes money to its employees' pension fund and to the 
fund in which developers' fees accumulate. But two very lean years with 
no-frills budgets that omitted capital improvements, some maintenance tasks, 
and the replacement of city staff as they quit, have brought the city within 
sight of fiscal balance. The city expects its general fund finally to be in the 
black in February. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo once again can fix its roads and talk about building a long-needed 
police station. Officials can begin planning again for capital improvements 
such as widening the city streets where they intersect with Highway 101, 
projects that were put on indefinite hold two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And with the notable exception of the position of investments officer, jobs 
left empty are now being filled. 
</P>
<P>
The city has controls on top of controls in the finance department, said Cole, 
who will return to his home city of Long Beach and a more lucrative position 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Two of four official signatures -- no facsimiles allowed, as they once were -- 
are required on every check that leaves City Hall. The books are balanced every 
day; auditors found them six months in arrears in 1987. A finance committee 
that includes council members, the finance director and the city manager 
reviews every investment decision the Finance Department makes. That contrasts 
with 1987 when only Tarnow knew the extent of his trading -- and his losses. 
</P>
<P>
A national firm audits the city's books annually, replacing a one-man company 
from Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Never again will the city invest as it did in 1987, said City Manager William 
J. Little. An auditor's report prepared in May, 1988, by Arthur Andersen &amp; 
Co. showed that the previous year, Tarnow had moved the city's reserves from 
safe but low-yielding investment instruments such as certificates of deposit, 
into higher-paying, long-term government securities. 
</P>
<P>
With millions borrowed from the brokerage houses to increase the city's 
earnings, Tarnow promised to buy interest-paying bonds weeks before the bonds 
were issued, the Andersen report said. When prevailing interest rates were 
lower on the day the bonds were issued, the city made money by selling. But the 
spring of 1987 brought rising interest rates and falling values for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tarnow was trading furiously. With every borrowed dollar, he put the 
city in greater danger, according to the auditors. From December, 1986, to 
July, 1987, the Andersen report shows, Tarnow bought and sold nearly $1.7 
billion in bonds, more than 70 times the cash available to the city. 
</P>
<P>
He began selling off his holdings at losses. 
</P>
<P>
He also dropped more than $3 million in what auditors found to be inappropriate 
investments for public funds. With a former broker named Anton Nayagan as his 
adviser, Tarnow bought an interest in a run-down Desert Hot Springs hotel and a 
convalescent hospital management company, which Nayagan ran, auditors said. 
</P>
<P>
Former owners foreclosed on the city's interest in the hotel and the hospital 
company is in the final stages of selling off its two hospitals in Utah, a 
transaction that will yield no money for the city, said Dennis Burke, a Los 
Angeles attorney hired by the city. 
</P>
<P>
But the hospital company could wind up costing the city more money still. 
Attorneys are now preparing for trial the city's defense against a lawsuit in 
which Union Bank claims the city owes it $1.3 million. The suit is based on 
promissory notes Tarnow wrote on behalf of the city to help Nayagan's hospital 
company. Nayagan traded the notes in for money at Union Bank, which now wants 
its money from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city claims it owes the bank nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The city's efforts to collect on the losses from three brokerage houses it held 
responsible have nearly concluded, Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo settled the suits for a total of $700,000. United Capital Corp. of 
Little Rock, Ark., agreed to pay the city $550,000 as compensation for its 
losses. It has paid $300,000, but defaulted on its $11,000 November 
installment. Two other firms have agreed to pay a combined $150,000, although 
final papers are not yet signed. 
</P>
<P>
The city's $25-million suit against Tarnow and Nayagan will probably go to 
court this summer, said C. Stephen Howard, a Los Angeles attorney handling the 
litigation. However, Nayagan filed for bankruptcy three weeks ago in 
Philadelphia and is no longer a target. Tarnow, on the other hand, has about 
$500,000 in equity in his home in the Santa Rosa Valley and eight other real 
estate holdings, Howard said his search of records showed. 
</P>
<P>
That lawsuit has Tarnow more than a little concerned, the former 18-year city 
employee said in an interview at his home last week. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his two former superiors at the city, Tarnow, fired two years ago this 
February, has not found full-time employment. Former City Manager Thomas 
Oglesby, who resigned in June, 1988, works as management assistant to the solid 
waste director at the Ventura Regional Sanitation District. And former Finance 
Director Larry Weaver, whose resignation came immediately after Tarnow's 
dismissal, heads the finance department for Perris, a small city in eastern 
Riverside County. Weaver said the events in Camarillo have taught him to keep a 
much closer watch on his department. 
</P>
<P>
But Tarnow said he works sporadically as a consultant on financial matters for 
local firms, where, he said, his reputation always precedes him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they recognize the name," he said. A private and soft-spoken man, he 
declined to name clients, saying only that they were not municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
Tarnow refused to comment on the lawsuit. But he acknowledged that even with 
his wife still working as a registered nurse, things have been difficult at the 
Tarnow house. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier conversations before any suits were filed, Tarnow contended he had 
sought the best return on the city's money in accordance with instructions from 
his superiors. Now, with a suit that threatens to take his home, he says of 
city officials: "I just don't think they care." 
</P>
<P>
Tarnow says he'll take the stand in his own defense, but finds it futile to 
speak up now. "It's been my experience that what people read in the paper they 
accept as gospel and never forget. I just don't think it makes any difference 
at this point," he said.

VENTURA TO OFFER DAY CARE FOR COUNTY WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County employees in Ventura will be offered guaranteed day care for their young 
children starting in March. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors Tuesday approved a lease for an east Ventura building that 
will serve 50 children, aged 2 through 6. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope the preschool will help the county recruit new workers and 
retain the ones it has, said Supervisor Madge Schaefer, one of the program's 
primary advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the county being responsive to employees in ways other than salaries, 
which we can't afford to do a lot of times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county will lease the former Richard's Preschool at 15 S. Petit Ave. for 
$4,200 per month. Employees will pay about $70 a week per child, said Debra 
Bergevin, the county's child-care coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
One supervisor will be on hand for every eight children, compared to the more 
common state-required ratio of one supervisor for every 12 children, Bergevin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The county now will concentrate on setting up day-care operations to serve its 
employees in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Oxnard and Port Hueneme, Bergevin 
said. The county also wants to establish day care for infants. 
</P>
<P>
It already operates the Hickory Dickory Doc day-care center for mildly ill 
children. And the county buys 15 guaranteed spaces for children 2 to 5 years 
old through a joint agreement with Santa Paula schools. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of employees at the Ventura Government Center showed that 50 spaces 
would be enough, Bergevin said. However, should fewer employees than expected 
sign up, the county likely would offer the extra spaces to a private employer 
in the city.

NEW BOARD SEEKS TO END COLLEGE SPATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pledging a renewed focus on classroom instruction and an end to internal 
divisiveness, the Ventura County Community College Board of Trustees this week 
seated two new members and elected a new president and vice president to 
oversee the 33,000-student, three-campus district. 
</P>
<P>
In the November election, Dr. Gregory Cole, 38, a Newbury Park dentist, handily 
defeated Thousand Oaks attorney Joel Bryan for the seat representing Thousand 
Oaks, Westlake Village and Simi Valley. Peter Tafoya, 40, an Oxnard engineer, 
narrowly defeated Timothy B. Flynn for the seat representing Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme. Running unopposed, Gregory Kampf, 37, a Ventura elementary school 
principal, was reelected to the seat representing parts of Ventura, Oxnard and 
unincorporated areas between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Hirschberg was elected vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf, who replaced James T. Ely as board president, heralded the changes as a 
significant turning point for the five-member board that oversees Ventura, 
Oxnard and Moorpark colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in eight years that we've had three new board members," 
said Kampf, who also served on the board from 1981 to 1984. "I think there's an 
extremely positive attitude. We're really concerned about working together." 
</P>
<P>
That has not always been the case. In recent years, trustees have publicly 
squabbled over a range of issues, arguments that led the Ventura County Grand 
Jury to criticize the board for "excessive parochialism." As recently as June, 
a special election was called after four trustees deadlocked over a replacement 
for a fifth member who resigned.

NEW COMMUTER AIRLINE BUCKS ODDS IN OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A commuter air service will begin flights out of Oxnard Airport this month, 
despite the failure of at least four similar efforts in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The California Air Shuttle will provide direct service from Oxnard to San 
Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento and Las Vegas. It adds to the offerings of 
American Eagle, which flies to Los Angeles International Airport, and United 
Express, which services Los Angeles International and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
While all three lines say they expect business to warrant expansion, the 
history is discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many before them," said Nona Makinson, operations manager of 
Ventura County Airports. "They have come and gone." 
</P>
<P>
Those lines flew direct routes to places such as Los Angeles, Sacramento, Long 
Beach and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
But they have struggled to obtain airplanes, gain route approval from the 
Federal Aviation Administration and get permission to land at airports already 
crowded with larger planes, Makinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Desert Air leased counter space at Oxnard Airport for five months last year, 
but never offered any flights because its planes were never delivered, Makinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
California Air Shuttle, though, received three of its planes this week. It has 
received clearance from the U.S. Department of Transportation and awaits 
inspection by the FAA, said Michael Minson, company chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle, the first commuter line to base its headquarters in Oxnard, is 
scheduled to start flights next week on its 19-passenger, pressurized 
twin-turbo jet-propeller planes. 
</P>
<P>
The service is targeting business people who must fly north for a conference in 
the morning and return by evening, Minson said. 
</P>
<P>
Fares will be equivalent to prices charged for flying out of Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Minson picked Oxnard after a marketing study he commissioned indicated growth 
in Ventura County's higher-income, business-executive population. 
</P>
<P>
Further need was indicated by what Minson described as a doubling of commute 
time from the county to Los Angeles International in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
The other two carriers at Oxnard Airport -- the only county airport that 
provides commuter service -- also plan to tap into the potential market. 
</P>
<P>
United Express, which has operated out of Oxnard for almost two years, started 
direct service to San Francisco in September. 
</P>
<P>
And American Eagle, a subsidiary of American Airlines that has leased space at 
Oxnard for more than a year, plans to offer direct flights to San Jose sometime 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Minson already is thinking of expanding California Air Shuttle services to 
Orange County, Bakersfield, Oakland, Santa Rosa and Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is trying to avoid becoming another statistic by providing cushy 
comforts to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
To drown out plane noise, each passenger will have earphones to tune into a 
compact-disc player system offering pop music and classic radio comedies. 
</P>
<P>
The high-gloss, cardboard ticket jackets are designed to be reminiscent of 
those handed out on the Concorde, and the planes are decorated in bright red, 
royal blue and light beige. 
</P>
<P>
"They look like rockets," Minson said. 
</P>
<P>
Minson said he expected to see a return on his investment within the first 
three months of service. 
</P>
<P>
"People that travel have been waiting for this," Minson said. "There seems to 
be a lot of enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
But the shuttle service will help not only residents trying to leave Ventura 
County. It may aid in promoting Ventura County to tourists, said Rob Varley, 
executive director of the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The direct Sacramento flight will help convention business, while Las Vegas 
residents looking for an escape from soaring temperatures may be attracted to 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a real plus for getting people into the area," Varley 
said.

JOSEPH N. BELL: MYSTERY OF MAGAZINE ADS HINTING OF PEARL HARBOR ATTACK LINGERS 
48 YEARS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today is Pearl Harbor Day -- the 48th anniversary of the Japanese attack on 
Pearl Harbor that brought the United States abruptly into World War II. The 
prevalent game to play on Pearl Harbor Day among those of us old enough to 
remember was where-were-you-when-you-heard-the-news? But this year's 
anniversary reminded me of something quite different, a mystery I've carried 
around with me for more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
In 1944, I was flying Navy transport planes in the South Pacific. Along with 
the cargoes we delivered to combat areas, we often carried military passengers, 
and during the long hours between islands, I would often turn the plane over to 
the co-pilot and go back into the cabin to talk with the passengers. One of 
them was a young naval intelligence officer on his way to Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
We had some engine trouble on that trip and had to lay over unexpectedly in 
Guam. The trouble wasn't serious, and we were booked out the next morning. So 
my new intelligence friend and I went to the local officer's club to tip a few 
before we turned in. And there, over the third drink, he told me a story that 
he probably shouldn't have that stayed with me until I was home after the war. 
</P>
<P>
He told me that the Nov. 22, 1941, issue of the New Yorker magazine -- two 
weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor -- carried an advertisement that in 
retrospect was full of double meanings and was considered by the intelligence 
community as a warning to someone about the timing of the upcoming Japanese 
offensive. He described the ad as best he could from memory and said it was 
accompanied by a pair of dice with the numbers 12 and 7 -- the date of the 
Pearl Harbor attack -- exposed. 
</P>
<P>
He had been assigned to investigate the ad and ran into nothing but dead-ends. 
It had been placed across the counter in New York and paid for in cash. Both 
the main ad and the smaller lead-in ads had been set in type somewhere else and 
a matrix pulled for delivery to the New Yorker. The clerk who had accepted the 
ads had no recollection of who placed them, and neither the game that was 
offered in the double-entendre copy nor the company whose signature was on the 
ad existed. So my friend had drawn a total blank, and it was still eating at 
him. He was convinced that someone -- for reasons he couldn't fathom -- had 
been instructed to convey information about the upcoming attack in this manner. 
</P>
<P>
I never forgot that conversation, and when I returned to college after the war, 
I went to the library and found bound editions of the New Yorker. Although it 
was only a one-column ad in a thick magazine, it was easy to spot. And it was 
every bit as mysterious as the intelligence officer had described it. 
</P>
<P>
The illustration above the ad copy showed an air raid in progress and, 
immediately below it, a group of people in an air raid shelter playing a dice 
game. The headline is "Uchtung, Warning, Alerte!" And the copy begins: "We hope 
you'll never have to spend a long winter's night in an air-raid shelter, but we 
were just thinking . . . it's only common sense to be prepared. If you're not 
too busy between now and Christmas, why not sit down and plan a list of the 
things you'll want to have on hand. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Then followed a list of items useful in an air raid shelter that concluded with 
this sentence: "And though it's no time, really, to be thinking of what's 
fashionable, we bet that most of your friends will remember to include those 
intriguing dice and chips which make Chicago's favorite game: THE DEADLY 
DOUBLE." This was followed by the sign of the double cross: two X's inside a 
shield -- and a tag line that the game was available in department stores 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Then, scattered throughout the issue, were a half-dozen small ads repeating the 
headline and referring to the main ad, surrounding a pair of dice -- one black, 
one white -- containing numbers not found on conventional dice on which 12 and 
7 and the double cross were prominently displayed. The small ads were signed by 
the Monarch Publishing Co., New York. I remembered the assurances of the 
intelligence officer that there was no such company and no such game in the 
stores, and the ads took on a significance -- and a malevolence -- to me that 
has been very real ever since. 
</P>
<P>
It has been many years since I first read those mysterious ads, and when I 
remembered them the other day, I went to the UCI library to make sure this 
story wasn't some wartime three-martini fantasy. It wasn't. I pulled the bound 
copy off the shelf, and there were the ads, just as I remembered them. The 
principal ad is on page 70 of the New Yorker for Nov. 22, 1941, and the small 
ads are scattered through the book. You can look them up for yourself, just as 
I first did more than 40 years ago. And then you can carry the mystery around 
in your own head as I have all these years.

HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: 'THAT AIDS TEST' SUFFERS FROM SOME COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When acquired immune deficiency syndrome first made headlines in the early 
1980s, many Americans looked upon the devastating disease as something that 
happened only to other people. But as AIDS continues to spread, a growing 
number have become concerned -- realistically or not -- that somehow they might 
have been exposed to the virus. 
</P>
<P>
From heterosexual singles to gay men to friends, relatives and even casual 
acquaintances of people with AIDS, more and more Orange County residents are 
inquiring about "that AIDS test." Some ask their family doctors; others call 
the AIDS Response Program's hot line, the Red Cross or other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"That's actually one of the most frequent things people call us about," says 
Tim Miller of the AIDS Response Program. "They think they may have put 
themselves at risk, or they've already decided but they're looking for a test 
site, or they want more information about anonymity vs. confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
But misconceptions abound when it comes to AIDS, and the same holds true for 
AIDS testing. 
</P>
<P>
First, what is generally referred to as an AIDS test is actually a test for 
antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There is no direct test 
for the virus itself. And if a person does have HIV antibodies, that is not the 
same as having either AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). Someone who is 
antibody-positive may have no symptoms at all for years after being exposed, if 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Those at risk for HIV exposure include: men who have had sex with other men; 
intravenous drug users who have shared needles and sexual partners of such drug 
users; transfusion and blood-product recipients between 1977 and March, 1985, 
as well as their sexual partners; and people who have had multiple sexual 
partners or engaged in unprotected intercourse or unprotected oral sex, Miller 
says. 
</P>
<P>
For several years after the HIV-antibody test was developed in 1985, many of 
those in legitimate risk groups avoided taking it because they felt there was 
nothing to be gained. Now, however, "there is a very good body of medical 
research which tells us that early intervention and treatment of people who are 
HIV-positive but asymptomatic can effectively delay or maybe even prevent the 
onset of the disease," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many of those at risk remain reluctant. "We know that there are a lot of 
people out there who are still very scared to take the test," Miller says. 
"There are so many implications with it: discrimination, people rejecting you, 
and also just a lot of fear about knowing. Despite the fact that there's this 
very optimistic news, a lot of people look at a positive diagnosis as the next 
thing to a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"But something can be done if you're HIV-positive. We're looking at the place 
where we may be able to make HIV infection a chronic manageable disease on the 
order of diabetes. And we really need the people to step forward who have put 
themselves at risk. We have people who can assist them in discussing their 
fears and help them see the benefit of taking the test." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, there are those who aren't in any high-risk category -- and some 
who have no possibility of exposure -- who insist on being tested. AIDS can be 
transmitted only by direct contact with blood, semen or vaginal secretions of 
an infected person, Miller explains. "And that potentially infected fluid has 
to have contact with your blood system. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get AIDS from a doorknob, or if a person with AIDS is in the same 
room or on the same planet with you," Miller says. "But we still get calls from 
people who don't understand that. It gets pretty far-fetched." 
</P>
<P>
Miller says many of the calls to the AIDS Response Program are from people who 
"have had a casual sexual encounter that they feel guilty about, when in fact 
they didn't put themselves at risk at all, or that risk was extremely minimal." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Schaaf, a family practitioner who works out of Saddleback Memorial 
Medical Center, says the question "comes up quite a bit" in his practice. 
"Patients bring it up in a lot of different circumstances," he says. "Most 
commonly, it's someone who is young, single and still out in the dating world 
who really doesn't know what their exposure has been, and they're having a 
little trouble sleeping at nights worrying about it. Or you have somebody who's 
been married for a couple of years, and they're starting to worry about their 
dating life before they got married. And you also get people who have a 
relative or friend who has come down with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
For those who are confused, Schaaf explains how the disease is transmitted. 
"But generally, if they're worried, we go ahead and have (the test) done." 
</P>
<P>
Although the HIV-antibody test is more than 99% accurate, false positives are 
possible. To be certain, the blood of all those who test positive is put 
through another kind of test for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there is a "window" of about six months in which a person who has been 
exposed may not yet have developed antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, if the patient brings the subject up, I'm kind of nosy," says Dr. 
John Quinn, a family practitioner in Garden Grove. "I want to know if they have 
a risk factor, and if it's a valid one, then by all means we do the test." 
</P>
<P>
With callers to the AIDS Response Program's hot line, Miller says: "We try to 
determine whether there's any need for testing based on where, and how 
frequent, the exposure may have been. If a person has had a blood transfusion 
prior to 1985, or if a person has used IV drug needles, particularly in 
high-risk geographical areas such as New York, any time in the last seven 
years, definitely. 
</P>
<P>
"In any situation where a man has had sex with a man, we would always recommend 
HIV-antibody testing. For heterosexual intercourse in Orange County, there's 
less of a chance that they had contact with an infected person than in 
someplace like New York." Of course, contact with a person from a high-risk 
area, or someone who has had contact with that person, makes exposure more 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
Although California law requires that HIV-antibody test results be kept 
confidential, Miller believes that complete anonymity is the best guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
"We only recommend that people go to the . . . test sites around the county 
where testing is done anonymously," he says. "We still do not have 
discrimination protection for people who are HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, (these) test sites use the highest quality testing procedures, so that 
by the time a person gets back a positive test result, the blood has been 
divided four ways and tested three times by one test and one more time by 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another advantage to these test sites is the counseling that is an integral 
part of the process, Miller says. "All the sites we recommend have both 
pre-test and post-test counseling. And that's very important both for 
understanding the process and for risk reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, however, says there are advantages to being tested through your family 
doctor. "Whenever the subject comes up, that gives me the opportunity to bring 
up safe sex, even if the test is negative. Even if we find out that AIDS is not 
much of a risk in this particular patient, we can talk about other matters, 
such as birth control, for example." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his patients may blush, but Quinn says he uses questions about AIDS as 
a springboard to explain the proper use of condoms ("Most guys don't know how 
to use them properly -- you should always leave a little room at the end, 
withdraw immediately and hold the condom as you do") and explain the risk 
factors. "People may listen to us when they might not be willing to hear it 
from anybody else," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, experts say, those who have been at risk for AIDS should never use 
blood donation as a testing method. Although all donated blood is tested for 
HIV antibodies, there is always the slight possibility that infected blood 
could slip through undetected, particularly if a person has been exposed but 
has not yet developed antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross does notify donors who test positive, but it is legally required 
to wait 60 days before doing so. The delay is intended to discourage blood 
donations for the purpose of AIDS testing. 
</P>

TIPS ON HOW TO LIGHT UP YOUR LIFE -- SAFELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Strings of lights can work wonders for those decorating their homes for the 
holidays, but they can also be dangerous if not used properly, cautions 
Kathleen Cha, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you've decorated wisely and thought of precautions beforehand, that 
will help ensure your safety," Cha says. She offered a checklist for holiday 
lighting safety: 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure strings of lights are UL listed. That means they have passed 
certain safety tests at Underwriters Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not use lights labeled for indoor use outdoors and vice versa. For outdoor 
use, make sure lights are labeled "weatherproof." 
</P>
<P>
* When installing exterior strings of lights, never nail or tack through the 
wiring. Special brackets are available that can be used to secure the lights. 
Install these first, then the lights. 
</P>
<P>
* Check old and new lights for frayed wiring, broken plugs and loose bulb 
sockets. Discard strings of lights with any of these conditions because a short 
could occur and cause a fire. 
</P>
<P>
* If several lights on a string aren't working, it could be an indication of a 
loose connection and it may be time to discard that string before a short 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
* Use extension cords sparingly and do not plug in more than three strings of 
lights per single extension cord. 
</P>
<P>
* A grounded outlet strip with an on-and-off switch (available in hardware 
stores) is safer than extension cords when you have to plug several strings of 
lights into one socket. The grounded strip is set up to redirect current and 
avoid circuit overload. And the switch makes it easy to turn lights on and off. 
</P>
<P>
* Bubbling lights are an attraction to children, who may grab them, break them 
and drink the fluid. Make sure this type of light is out of the reach of small 
children. 
</P>
<P>
* Despite what you might think, even mini-lights generate heat. The more lights 
used on a Christmas tree, the faster it will dry out. If a tree becomes very 
dry, it may be a good idea to leave lights turned off. 
</P>
<P>
* Never leave holiday lights on when you go to bed or leave the house. There is 
a danger that overheating or an electrical short could cause a fire. 
</P>
<P>
* When placing lights on a fresh tree, position bulbs so they are not touching 
branches or pine needles. Plastic strips (the kind used to fasten garden plants 
to stakes) or pipe cleaners can be used to fasten the cord to the tree. Just 
make sure these fasteners are located on the insulated cord, away from the 
light itself. 
</P>
<P>
* Never use lights on a metallic tree. A faulty string of lights could cause 
the tree to become charged with electricity and create a danger of 
electrocution.

ILLUMINATING WAYS TO MAKE SEASON BRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL, Nancy Jo Hill is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas is a light show. Twinkling lights -- outdoors on rooftops and 
shrubbery and indoors on wreaths, garlands, entryways, mantels and stairway 
banisters -- herald the season and illuminate the county. 
</P>
<P>
They help set a special mood for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Used sparingly indoors combined with soft lighting or a fire in the hearth, 
Christmas lights can create a warm glow for intimate moments. Used bold and 
bright, they help create a sparkling, festive atmosphere for larger 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
And for the more whimsical, there are lights with special plastic covers that 
turn them into novel interior decorations. Styles available include Santas, 
teddy bears, candles -- even red chili peppers and exotic-looking lizards for 
lovers of Southwest decor. 
</P>
<P>
Elin Pittman, manager of the Pottery Barn in Newport Beach, says some customers 
hang the chili pepper and beige, orange and black lizard lights on their 
patios, while others blend them in with their interior Southwest decor. 
</P>
<P>
The chilies, for example, can add a bit of color and whimsy when wound around a 
lodge pole ladder draped with a serape or they can give a Christmas tree a 
Southwest theme. Or the lizards can adorn a mantle, mixed among candle holders 
and other objets d'art from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular lights, however, are the white mini-lights that blink on and 
off in quick succession and seem to chase each other all the way along the 
string. 
</P>
<P>
"The mini-lights are very attractive," says Jan Abajian of Flowers and Things 
in La Habra, "especially the clear ones that go with everything." Abajian 
creates floral decorations and other Christmas decor for her clients and uses 
the lights in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
"You can drape them in and out of your greenery. . . . It really makes it 
festive," she says. Sometimes she intertwines the lights into greenery framing 
a mirror; a Christmas wreath hung on a wall; a garland on a stairway banister 
or mantle or even on a sideboard in a dining area. Or she may drape them in the 
branches of an indoor ficus tree, using twisted pipe cleaners to hold them in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
When Dale Fahrney of Dale Fahrney and Associates Interior Design in Corona del 
Mar does holiday decorating for his clients, he likes to use a lot of lights 
for more impact. One trick he says he learned from florists is to bunch 
mini-lights in clusters to adorn a garland, wreath or Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
Clusters of red lights on a garland, he says, look a bit like bunches of little 
berries. He says the clusters are formed by grouping a few lights together and 
then wrapping the string around itself a time or two. "I've seen a whole set of 
35 used in a cluster, and that was quite nice," Fahrney says. 
</P>
<P>
A small strand of lights on a large poinsettia, he says, is decorative and 
gives the poinsettia "a little more personality." (Take care to keep lights 
dry, however.) 
</P>
<P>
Both Fahrney and Abajian like to use lights in table centerpieces for parties. 
The best approach to avoid dangling extension cords around tables, they say, is 
to get battery-operated mini-lights, which usually last about four hours. 
</P>
<P>
Interior designer Patricia Mickey of PMA Design Group in Costa Mesa also likes 
the mini-lights, but suggests using them only to supplement existing lighting. 
</P>
<P>
"Our approach is to utilize the lighting to assist in the conveyance of the 
mood and to highlight those areas you want to highlight, rather than using the 
lighting as a focal point," Mickey says. "Just because you already have it 
doesn't mean you can't work with it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Using existing track lighting is one approach. For example, a track light can 
be redirected to spotlight a tree or a special display area, she says. 
</P>
<P>
She also suggests the use of little portable spots as "up lights." The spot can 
be hidden in garland or in a special display of Santa, a Nativity scene or even 
a porcelain deer. "It can be a little more interesting," Mickey says, "because 
if you hide the source, it's almost like it's glowing from within." 
</P>
<P>
People who want more elaborate holiday lighting sometimes turn to firms such as 
Dekra-Lite in Irvine for help. Dekra-Lite plans to adorn the exteriors of about 
2,400 Orange County houses with lights this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average Dekra-Lite charge for holiday lights was $340, according 
to owner Arnold Mahler. The minimum price was $165, while the most expensive 
lighting design was $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
The more extensive designs may include lighting a boat dock, spelling out 
"Merry Christmas" on a rooftop or lighting shrubbery and trees. 
</P>
<P>
A basic minimum design, he says, would include lighting the roof line of a 
home, the front door and perhaps a small window. A large window might cost an 
additional $45, while lighting an exterior tree would be about $65. 
</P>
<P>
Tricks of the trade, according to Mahler, include putting lighting on timers 
and using special adapters to draw power from outdoor light fixtures or 
landscape lighting. He also suggests using extension cords and strings of 
lights that are exactly the right length. 
</P>
<P>
Safety is a primary consideration when designing holiday lighting indoors or 
outdoors, says Vandie Gervais, owner of Elf &amp; Magic in Santa Ana. Her staff 
takes care to make sure lights are carefully secured and will not fall on 
anyone, that the amount of wattage needed won't overload circuits and that any 
extension cords used are out of the way and won't be stepped on. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not like to use extension cords, especially around children," Gervais 
says of indoor installations. She also says it's not safe to use mini-lights on 
something in the middle of a room, because there is no way to safely run an 
extension cord to it. 
</P>
<P>
Gervais also says care should be taken when using mini-lights with fresh 
garland because it dries out and can become a fire hazard. She uses fresh 
garland only when she can replace it regularly or make sure it is still moist 
every 10 days or so. She suggests using artificial garland if decorations will 
be up more than a week or so. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't understand electricity," she says. In fact, she says 
some people hire her company to do lighting for them because they are concerned 
about electrical safety or perhaps don't want to climb into that tree in the 
front yard and string lights. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone planning on doing extensive holiday lighting themselves should at least 
consult with an electrician first, Gervais says. She suggests having an 
electrician come out and discuss what you plan to do, the best way to do it and 
what the limitations of your electrical circuits might be. Not doing this may 
result in tripped circuit breakers or more serious problems, she cautions.

WOMAN POSING AS NURSE STEALS NEWBORN GIRL; 
</P>
<P>
KIDNAPING: THE BABY IS TAKEN FROM A COVINA APARTMENT WHILE HER MOTHER'S 
ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED. POLICE ARE SEEKING WITNESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A woman posing as a postpartum hospital nurse snatched a newborn baby girl from 
a Covina home Wednesday morning while the mother's back was turned. 
</P>
<P>
Covina police officers were combing the area for the woman and child late 
Wednesday, while at the same time seeking witnesses to the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, Leslie Kang, 22, was in the kitchen of her apartment in the 1300 
block of San Bernardino Road when the woman disappeared with her 8-day-old 
baby, Sara. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the woman had also visited the Kang apartment Monday. She had 
identified herself as Susan White and told Kang that she was a nurse sent by 
Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina to check up on Kang and her baby. 
</P>
<P>
"She took our temperatures and blood pressure," Kang said, sitting on a sofa 
next to her husband, Paul, 22. "She was very friendly. She helped a lot and 
answered a lot of my questions." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, described by Kang as a heavy-set person wearing a light blue or 
off-white maternity top with "baby" printed vertically across the left side, 
arrived at the apartment about 10 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
After about 45 minutes, Kang said, the woman told her she was going to try for 
a job promotion and asked Kang to write a letter of recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat down (at the kitchen table) to write the letter," Kang said through 
tears. "She said she forgot the blood pressure kit and said she was going 
outside to her car to get it. A minute or two later, I went to check on the 
baby and she was gone. They were both gone." 
</P>
<P>
Between 11 and 11:30 a.m., a woman carrying a baby was seen walking north on 
Lark Ellen Avenue, a short distance from Kang's apartment, but as of Wednesday 
afternoon there was no other clues to their whereabouts, Covina Police Sgt. 
Dennis Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Composite pictures of the woman have been sent to nurses' registries in Covina 
and surrounding cities, Murray said. Lt. Ron McKee said police were also 
calling local hospitals to see if there were any recent miscarriages or 
still-born infants. He explained that suspects in some similar cases have 
turned out to be women who recently suffered such a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Turner, a nursing supervisor at Queen of the Valley, said the hospital 
contracts with an outside agency to send nurses to the homes of newborns when 
physicians deem it necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The woman being sought was further described as white, 25 to 35 years old, 
5-foot-9 to 5-foot-11, with curly brown shoulder-length hair and "distinctive 
bangs." She was wearing turquoise pants and a blue ribbon in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
The five-pound infant is of Filipino ancestry and has black hair. She was in a 
white jumpsuit and white receiving blanket. She had recently had her ears 
pierced, with white strings through the holes. Her right ear has two holes. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kang said he had thought the woman "was someone who could help us. She 
seemed real nice." 
</P>
<P>
"I just want our baby back, that's all," he said. "We'll give her anything she 
wants. I just want the baby back."

WASHINGTON JUST MISSES GRANADA HILLS RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Granada Hills High's poor performance in a 16-9 quarterfinal playoff loss to El 
Camino Real on Friday cost junior fullback Brett Washington a school record. 
Washington entered the game with 1,131 yards in 154 carries, an average of 7.3 
yards a carry. Yet he rushed for only 25 yards in 12 carries against the 
Conquistadores, lowering his average to 6.96. The school record of 7.1 yards a 
carry was set in 1986 by Khalid Ali, who had 1,370 yards in 192 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Washington should break some of Ali's career marks next season, however. 
Washington, a two-year starter, has rushed for 21 touchdowns (Ali had 26) and 
1,772 yards (Ali had 2,062). 
</P>
<P>
Late-season improvement propelled Granada Hills quarterback Bryan Martin to a 
school passing mark. Martin, a junior, finished the season with two 
interceptions, one less than Jeremy Leach threw as a junior in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Martin completed 100 of 194 attempts for 1,414 yards and 14 touchdowns. Leach, 
in his junior season, completed 114 of 198 for 1,325 yards and 14 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: Despite missing the first three games of the season because of injury, 
Canyon tailback Chris Peery rushed for 1,220 yards and 23 touchdowns in 181 
carries (6.7 average). Peery also had 20 receptions for 232 yards and four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's senior pass combination of quarterback Tim Beidle and wide receiver 
Clint Beauer was the Valley's best. Beauer hauled in an area-high 75 passes for 
1,235 yards and 13 touchdowns. Beidle completed 152 of 271 passes for 2,198 
yards and 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy running back Ontiwaun Carter finished the season with 1,563 yards, tops 
in the area among City Section players. Last year as a sophomore, Carter gained 
1,190 yards. He has a two-year total of 2,763 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball: Simi Valley is getting offensive balance from its three returning 
starters: Kenny Hood, Mike Wawryk and Steve Carnes. After three games, only 
nine points separate the top scorer from the No. 3 scorer. Wawryk has averaged 
18 points for a total of 54. Hood has 52 and Carnes 45.

CAP Scores/CAP Scores Ranking 
</P>
<P>
The California Assessment Program (CAP) is the statewide testing program that 
provides information on the academic achievement of students in public schools 
for grades 3, 6, 8, and 12. Only two years of data are available because a new 
grade 12 test was administered in 1988. The relative percentile rank compares a 
school's performance with that of similar schools. The statewide rank expresses 
how a school performs in comparison with all other schools in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Course Enrollments 
</P>
<P>
Enrollments in advanced courses are viewed as an indicator of academic rigor 
for high schools. The reported figures reflect enrollments among 11th and 12th 
graders in advanced math (geometry, calculus and trigonometry) and advanced 
science (all science courses certified by UC as meeting the "a-f" requirements, 
such as biology, zoology, advanced physics (see UC Required Courses below)). 
</P>
<P>
For chemistry and physics, the percentage of seniors enrolled is reported. The 
(+) or (-) symbol indicates whether the enrollments in these courses have 
increased or decreased since 1983-84. For fine arts and foreign language 
enrollments, the (+) or (-) indicates an increase or decrease in senior 
enrollments since last year only. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropout Rate 
</P>
<P>
This figure represents the rate by which students who were enrolled at the 
beginning of grade 10 (1985-86) dropped out during the following three years. A 
dropout is defined as any student who has been enrolled in grade 10, 11, or 12 
but who left school before graduation or completion of a formal education, or 
legal equivalent, and who did not within 45 school days enter another public or 
private educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attendance Rate 
</P>
<P>
The rate reported is the actual yearly pupil attendance rate as disclosed 
annually by local boards of education. The statewide percentile rank is also 
reported. The 1987-88 statewide value is 91.3%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) 
</P>
<P>
The SAT includes a verbal section and a math section, each of which is scored 
on a scale of 200 to 800. In California, 450 verbal and 500 math are considered 
average scores; higher scores are achieved by those students doing well on the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
For comparative purposes, the SAT data is reported for 1984 and 1988. Included 
are the percentage of seniors taking the test; the average verbal score, and 
the percentage scoring 450 and above; and the average math score and the 
percentage of seniors scoring 500 and above. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advanced Placement 
</P>
<P>
The Advanced Placement (AP) exams are given in 24 academic subject areas, such 
as biology, physics, French, calculus, music theory and computer science. 
Students who pass these rigorous tests (by obtaining a score of 3 or better, on 
a scale of 1 to 5) receive college credit. The figures reported for each school 
are the percentage of tests passed for 1984 and 1988, and the average score for 
all tests taken at the school for those years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UC Required Courses 
</P>
<P>
School principals report the number of graduates who complete the courses 
accepted by the University of California as requirements for admission, known 
as the "a-f" requirements. The courses include U.S. history, four years of 
English, three years of math, a laboratory science, two years of foreign 
language and elective courses. The statistic reported is the percentage of 1986 
and 1988 graduates who completed the a-f course sequence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public University Attendance 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported here are college attendance rates for the University of 
California (UC) and the California State University (CSU) for the graduates of 
1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extracurricular Activities 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported are the percentages of students who report that they are 
enrolled in one or more extracurricular activities and those enrolled in 
non-sports extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Ethnicity 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic breakdown of the school population is reported and compared with 
enrollments in advanced mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher Ethnicity 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported are the average years of service for the teachers at the 
school and the percentage of teachers having a master's degree or a doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parent Education 
</P>
<P>
Parent education level is used as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The 
first three statistics show the percentage of students at the school whose 
parents have attained certain educational levels. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide percentile rank shows where the overall parent education level at 
the school ranks among all other schools with a grade 12.

$5-MILLION FIRE IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire swept through an apartment building under construction and spread to an 
adjacent condominum complex in Pasadena overnight, forcing 50 people out of 
their homes and causing $5 million in damage, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
With flames springing at least 75 feet into the night sky, the fire late 
Wednesday torched palm trees lining a sidewalk and could be seen from as far 
away as downtown Los Angeles, about 10 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
No serious injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents said they heard an explosion immediately before the fire was 
reported and saw three men in jogging suits running from the construction site. 
Fire officials said the cause of the blaze was under investigation. The 
construction site was hit by an arson fire that caused $5,000 in damage last 
Friday, they said.

Police today arrested a man suspected of firing a shotgun into a car and 
injuring three teen-agers Wednesday evening at a Placentia intersection, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Estrada, 20, was arrested at his Placentia residence and booked on 
suspicion of attempted murder, Placentia Police Sgt. Russ Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Believed to have been a passenger in a compact pickup, Estrada allegedly fired 
two shotgun blasts into a white sedan at Tafolla Street and Orangethorpe 
Avenue. The blasts blew out the windshield and rear window of the car, and 
pellets struck three teens, who were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. 
Another teen was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the case was being investigated and may be related to gang activity.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec resigned today after failing to placate an 
increasingly bold democracy movement that drove the previous hard-line 
leadership out of office two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation came less than 24 hours after Adamec said he would quit rather 
than be subjected to a barrage of "hasty deadlines, strikes and demonstrations" 
by opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition led by the Civic Forum coalition rejected Adamec's latest 
Cabinet as an inadequate attempt at power sharing with non-Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak President Gustav Husak accepted the resignation and named as 
Adamec's replacement Marian Calfa, the first deputy prime minister in the new 
government unveiled Sunday, state radio said. Calfa was asked to immediately 
begin talks on forming a new government, the official news agency CTK said. 
</P>
<P>
Before being promoted to deputy prime minister Sunday, Calfa was minister 
without portfolio in charge of legal affairs, and was in charge of the plans 
for a new constitution and other legal reforms. He has lukewarm support among 
the Civic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec's resignation, which followed by one day the resignation of East German 
leader Egon Krenz, was announced at a meeting of the National Front, an 
umbrella group representing political parties and social groups traditionally 
allied with the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec had presided over several major political reforms in the weeks since the 
resignation of hard-line leader Milos Jakes, and his resignation could cast a 
pall over reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The main opposition group Civic Forum had said Adamec was the only credible 
leader in the current government with whom they were willing to work. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec announced his decision after failing to reach an agreement with 
pro-democracy groups on the makeup of a new government he was expected to 
unveil Friday, Czechoslovak news reports said. Civic Forum had demanded Adamec 
appoint at least seven non-Communists to Cabinet posts. 
</P>
<P>
The new government was to replace a Cabinet named Sunday that was immediately 
denounced by democracy activists because 16 of its 21 members were Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Adamec threatened to quit unless the opposition stopped using strike 
threats and other high-pressure tactics in an attempt to rush the government 
into implementing reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I am for maximum flexibility but I cannot agree to negotiations under time 
pressure, under the permanent pressure of hasty deadlines, strikes and 
negotiations," he said in a televised address. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum rejected Adamec's claims, saying in a statement today that 
opposition groups have been "very much restrained," having made no concrete 
demands until this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We only recommend that the composition of the new government should reflect 
the fact that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has lost not only its 
constitutionally anchored role in society, but above all the confidence of the 
public," the statement said.

UNOCAL ORDERED TO PAY $23,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first conviction in the city under a new state environmental law, the 
Unocal Corp. was ordered today to pay $23,000 for air pollution violations at 
its Wilmington refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The fine was imposed by Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph Spada after Unocal 
attorneys pleaded no contest to violating the new state law that created 
stiffer monetary penalties for negligent discharge of hazardous pollutants into 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
Spada ordered Unocal to pay a $10,000 fine plus a $13,500 penalty assessment. 
Under the old law, Spada could have fined Unocal a maximum of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn said the case stemmed from incidents Feb. 7 and April 
13 in which hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans released from the Unocal refinery 
caused victims in the surrounding area to suffer nausea, burning eyes, 
headaches and respiratory problems.

Iraq said today it launched a rocket capable of carrying satellites into space, 
a development that would have profound implications for the military balance in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel, minister of industry and military industrialization, said on 
state-run Baghdad radio that the three-stage rocket was launched at 8:30 a.m. 
Tuesday from the Al Anbar space research center. 
</P>

He also claimed that Iraq has developed two surface-to-surface missiles with a 
range of 1,240 miles. If true, this would double the reach of Iraq's missile 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
There was no independent confirmation of the launch. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is the only Arab country to have claimed it has the capability of 
launching satellites into space. If true, this could enable it to develop a 
military satellite to spy on Israel and Iraq's rivals in the region.

MULTIPARTY SYSTEM IS LEGALIZED BY LITHUANIA

Rebel Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to legalize a multiparty 
system today in its most extreme act of defiance against Moscow to date. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic republic's Parliament threw out a constitutional article 
guaranteeing the Communist Party's leading role and legalized other parties and 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was likely to anger the Kremlin, which has opposed calls for a 
multiparty system. It could also spur similar defiance in other republics and 
encourage deputies who want to remove the same article from the Soviet 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and other deputies have called a 
two-hour strike Monday to back demands for the Congress of People's Deputies, 
the top legislative body, to discuss that article when it convenes Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, voted 243 to 1 to dump Article 6 
and replace it with a clause allowing political parties, public organizations 
and movements, provided they operate within Lithuanian law. There were 39 
abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, deputies said they would merely be legalizing the many parties 
and movements that have already sprung up in the Baltic republic in the past 14 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue has long been solved for all Lithuania," Deputy Romualdas Ozolas 
told the Parliament, according to a Lithuanian journalist who was present at 
the session. "It is only the Supreme Soviet that has not yet made the 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Ozolas, a Communist who is also a member of the Lithuanian mass movement 
Sajudis, said he recognized that most members of Parliament are Communists and 
hated to give up an article guaranteeing the party's supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
"But we should make a distinction between being a party member and being a 
deputy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sajudis is the most popular of the political organizations that have come to 
life in Lithuania as it led demands among outlying Soviet republics for more 
autonomy from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Sajudis candidates won the majority of seats in the Moscow 
Parliament representing Lithuania. Lithuania also has Christian Democratic and 
Social Democratic parties and a Greens movement. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania is preparing for local and republic elections Feb. 24. Today's 
decision made it likely they would be the first multiparty elections in the 
Soviet Union since 1917, when several parties contested seats in a Constituent 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolsheviks, who won fewer seats than their rivals, the Socialist 
Revolutionaries, dissolved the assembly by force in January, 1918. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian journalists said the Parliament had not been influenced by recent 
decisions in East Germany and Czechoslovakia to abolish the Communist Party's 
leading role. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, while tolerating such changes in Eastern 
Europe, has consistently rejected introducing a multiparty system at home for 
the moment although he has not flatly ruled it out for all time. 
</P>
<P>
In response to calls for a discussion of the Soviet constitution's Article 6, 
Gorbachev has said this could be done as part of a comprehensive review of the 
entire constitution in light of recent changes in Soviet society, but he has 
warned against haste.

The government's massive cholesterol education program places too much emphasis 
on drug treatments that may do more harm than good, a congressional panel was 
told today. 
</P>
<P>
But a federal official defended the National Cholesterol Education Program, 
saying its guidelines will improve the health of Americans and reduce the risk 
of heart attacks -- the nation's leading killer. They recommend diet as the 
treatment of first choice. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Moore, an investigative reporter whose article in the September issue 
of the Atlantic magazine inflamed the controversy over cholesterol monitoring, 
said he questions the value of what he says is aggressive treatment recommended 
by the federal program. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious and expensive mistake in public policy," he told the 
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health.

India's new prime minister made a dramatic peace overture in the strife-torn 
northern state of Punjab today, praying in the holiest Sikh shrine and 
expressing regret for years of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
The streets of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar were clogged as tens of thousands 
of people welcomed Vishwanath Pratap Singh who rode in an open Jeep, stopping 
to shake hands and hug people. 
</P>
<P>
"I express my regrets for whatever happened in the past," Singh said after 
praying at the Golden Temple, the most sacred Sikh shrine. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever mistakes were made, I will try to correct them," he told a news 
conference later. "Problems cannot be solved with bullets, but they can be 
solved with love." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have been killed since Sikh militants began a ruthless 
campaign in Punjab for an independent homeland they call Khalistan (Land of the 
Pure).

Kelsey-Hayes Corp., formerly known as Freuhauf, said today it will begin 
cutting its payroll next week by more than 15%, or 1,000 hourly and salaried 
jobs, as it undergoes a major corporate reorganization into four business 
units. 
</P>
<P>
K-H Chairman John F. Devaney said further declines in the automotive industry 
could cause the Romulus, Mich., vehicle parts maker to cut its 6,500-member 
work force even further. 
</P>
<P>
Devaney also cited the company's $16.9-million net loss during the first nine 
months of 1989 for the cuts, to be done through layoffs, early retirements, 
voluntary resignations and terminations. 
</P>
<P>
K-H was acquired by Varity Corp. of Toronto for $579 million last month. The 
company abandoned the Freuhauf name last August after it sold off its slumping 
truck trailer operations to Terex Corp.

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. stock fell sharply today amid reports of a huge 
recapitalization plan that would inject up to $1 billion into the ailing 
brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson was down $1.62 1/2, or about 9.85%, at $14.87 1/2 a share in late New 
York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson has been under increasing pressure in recent weeks to take steps to 
improve its profitability and avoid a credit downgrading that would tarnish the 
firm's reputation and increase its borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
American Express Co., which owns 61% of Shearson, reportedly is planning a 
public sale of 10 million to 22 million shares of Shearson stock and a direct 
investment of about $300 million to raise new capital. In addition, Revlon Inc. 
Chairman Ronald O. Perelman reportedly is holding talks about buying a 9.9% 
stake in Shearson for about $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence A. Armour, an American Express senior vice president, confirmed his 
company is "reviewing a number of options" in regard to Shearson. But he said 
it would be "inappropriate to discuss any details." 
</P>
<P>
Armour said the review process has been under way for several weeks.

An appeals court has cleared Maurizio Gucci, former chairman of the Italian 
fashion firm Guccio Gucci SpA, of attempted fraud in the inheritance of company 
shares, a Gucci spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The decision overturned a judgment last month under which Gucci was given a 
one-year suspended jail sentence after being charged with forging his dead 
father's signature on documents transferring 50% of shares in the leather goods 
and fashion firm to him. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said Gucci had sought to avoid paying inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling can only fill me with satisfaction. . . . After five difficult 
years, justice has finally been done in respect of my father's wishes," the 
spokesman quoted Gucci as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Gucci was ousted as company chairman in July, 1987, and replaced by his cousin 
Giorgio.

USAir Group Inc. said today it plans to hike its cheapest domestic air fares, 
joining the major U.S. carriers in a move that will force leisure travelers to 
pay more for their wanderlust. 
</P>
<P>
USAir, the nation's seventh-largest airline, became the last of the major U.S. 
airlines to unveil hikes of up to $20 on domestic excursion fares effective 
Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
But the Arlington, Va.-based carrier said it would raise prices on its shortest 
flights by just $6, rather than the $10 hike planned by its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Excursion fares, highly restricted round-trip tickets that generally require 
advance purchase and minimum stays, are used mainly by leisure travelers and 
are the cheapest and most popular tickets sold. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines, faced with rising fuel, maintenance and labor costs, are lifting 
fares to boost revenues in a period of sluggish air traffic, analysts said.

A heavy-metal rock singer was charged with killing a chicken on stage and 
simulating a lewd act with the carcass during the song "Voodoo Chile."

Police said the incident was so disgusting that some members of the audience 
helped them gather evidence against the singer, Charles (Chip) Owen, 25, of the 
Popcycle Love Sponge band. 
</P>
<P>
The rock singer's lawyer said the chicken was already dead and that the act was 
only "suggestive" of a sex act but Owen was charged with felony animal cruelty 
and three misdemeanor sex charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a lot of bands but this is the sickest thing I've ever seen," said 
Lance Brown, 21, a security guard at the Phoenix Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The incident allegedly occurred early Saturday while Owen and his band were 
performing a Jimi Hendrix song, "Voodoo Chile," at a theater before an audience 
of about 60 people.

'DESIGNING WOMEN' WILL TAKE ON WEIGHTY ISSUES

<TEXT>
<P>
As a teen-ager, she won 18 beauty pageants. In 1975, as Miss Florida, she won 
the Miss America talent contest with a dramatic presentation. 
</P>
<P>
But she was forever fighting extra pounds, and this television season it is 
obvious that "Designing Women's" Delta Burke, although still beautiful, has 
grown heavy. Plump. Chunky. Stout. Fat. 
</P>
<P>
Burke does not deny it. On a recent edition of "Entertainment Tonight," she 
said that she had used so many diet pills and amphetamines that she has 
disturbed her body's chemical balance and now gains weight even more easily. 
</P>
<P>
So this week "They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?" is an episode that creator 
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason calls "our valentine to overweight people 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But the CBS series looks at both sides of a coin: people who get fat and people 
who are starving. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's installment, Burke, as Suzanne Sugarbaker, attends her high-school 
reunion and finds that her extra avoirdupois has become the topic du jour among 
former classmates. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she is rather cruelly voted "Classmate Who Has Changed the Most." Her 
off-the-cuff acceptance speech reveals how much she has really changed. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Burke's husband, actor Gerald McRaney, Marine-fit for his role on 
another CBS series, "Major Dad," attended the taping of that installment. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodworth-Thomason combines Suzanne Sugarbaker's story with that of a 48-hour 
fast by her slimmer sister Julia (Dixie Carter) and tiny colleague Mary Jo 
Shively (Annie Potts) as part of the "Primetime to End Hunger" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The series will offer a clearinghouse telephone number to provide viewers with 
information on local groups participating in the campaign against hunger, 
homelessness and poverty.

WAYNE NEWTON ASKS U.S. COURT TO UPHOLD $5.3-MILLION AWARD

<P>
Entertainer Wayne Newton has asked a federal appeals court to uphold his 
historic $5.3-million jury award growing out of NBC News reports that he was 
linked to organized crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
Newton's attorney has filed a 120-page brief with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco, saying that overturning the award would have "dire 
consequences to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Morton Galane said if the jury verdict is overturned at the appeals 
level, "victims of malicious defamation by the mass media will have no 
effective remedy and the media will not be deterred from disseminating knowing 
or reckless falsehoods." 
</P>
<P>
If upheld, Newton's award would be the largest in history arising from a news 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Newton sued the network in 1981, claiming that a series of broadcasts in 1980 
defamed him. The broadcasts, titled "Wayne Newton and the Law," linked Newton 
to alleged crime figures and centered on his purchase of the Aladdin Hotel 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The series was presented by NBC reporter Brian Ross and producer Ira Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy jury trial in Las Vegas in 1986, the jury awarded Newton a 
record $19.2 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker cut the award to $5.3 million 
but upheld the jury's libel findings.

'FULL HOUSE' EPISODE TO DEAL WITH EARTHQUAKE TRAUMA

The San Francisco earthquake shook up a lot of kids all over the country, and 
Jeff Franklin, creator and executive producer of ABC's "Full House," has 
written an episode to reassure them and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
The "Aftershocks" episode airs at 8 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are not familiar with the show -- the most popular series on 
Friday night and the most popular of all among the 2-to-11 year-old set -- it 
deals with a young widower with three children who has brought in two male 
friends to help him raise the motherless brood. 
</P>
<P>
It is set in San Francisco, and in this episode, the middle child, Stephanie, 
7, suffers aftershocks of fear about the earthquake and also, because of the 
earthquake, fears of separation from her remaining parent to whom she clings. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Full House' is set in San Francisco and, of course, we were all deeply 
affected by the tragedy there and we didn't want to ignore the fact on our 
show," Franklin said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to see if we could be of some help to both the people in San 
Francisco who were chiefly affected and also everyone around the country who 
watched the footage on the earthquake, day in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
In writing the show, Franklin consulted Dr. Robert Pynoos, director of the 
prevention/intervention program in trauma, violence and sudden bereavement of 
the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the UCLA School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are not always able to articulate their feelings and problems, and 
that's very frustrating for parents who want to help them," Franklin said. "We 
wanted to say to parents, who may not feel like good parents because they are 
not able to solve children's problems, that they shouldn't be afraid to seek 
professional help." 
</P>
<P>
The show includes a scene in which Stephanie sees a therapist who offers 
positive steps parents can take to deal with some of these fears. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to put some element of the child-parent relationship into every show," 
Franklin said.

"I don't look to him very simply because everybody goes to him with their 
business and personal problems," Warner, who plays Cosby's son, Theo, said in

his own."

"I've been planting seeds for post-Cosby," the 19-year-old actor said. 
"Carefully choosing roles because I want them to be different from Theo."

Jason McCallum, the adopted son of actress Jill Ireland, died after playing 
"chemical roulette" by ingesting a combination of painkillers and muscle 
relaxants, the coroner's office said today. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum's death was attributed to a drug overdose late last month, but it was 
unknown what drugs were involved until today's announcement of the results of 
toxicological tests. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's office spokesman Bob Dambacher said the tests found evidence that 
McCallum, 27, ingested codeine and a prescription muscle relaxer called 
carisoprodol. 
</P>
<P>
Two other drugs, morphine and meprobamate, were also found in his body. Those 
drugs were not directly ingested by McCallum, but turned up in his body after 
the codeine and carisoprodol broke down, Dambacher said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a chemical roulette, you take one drug and then another drug and 
they gang up on you," Dambacher said. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, was found dead in the 
bathroom of his Hollywood Hills apartment Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
His death has been listed as an accident.

As expected, England was designated today as one of the six seeded teams in the 
1990 World Soccer Cup, along with defending champion Argentina, host Italy, 
West Germany, Brazil and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
The International Soccer Federation, which announced the seedings, assigned 
Argentina to play in Naples, Italy in Rome, West Germany in Milan, Brazil in 
Turin, Belgium in Verona and England in Cagliari on the island of Sardinia. 
</P>
<P>
The designation of England as a seed and its assignment to Cagliari were done 
because of security reasons to keep better control of the English fans, the 
federation said. 
</P>
<P>
The World Cup, involving 24 teams, begins in Milan on June 8 and ends in Rome 
on July 8. The other 18 teams have been split into three groups, and the draw 
for the cup will be made in Rome on Saturday.

Americans Scott Hoch and Tim Simpson and South African David Frost shot 
5-under-par 67s today to share the first-round lead in the Million Dollar 
Challenge, which offers the largest prize in golf. 
</P>
<P>
The total purse for the four-day, 10-player event is $2.3 million, including $1 
million for the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, a leading money-winner on the U.S. pro tour, fired five birdies on the 
back nine to catch Hoch and Simpson. They each had 32s on the front nine, 
including eagles at the par-5 9th, and 35s coming in. 
</P>
<P>
No one else in the field broke par on the 7,665-yard course designed by South 
African golfer Gary Player. 
</P>
<P>
Three Americans were tied for fourth at par 72: Ken Green, Scott Simpson and 
Chip Beck. American Don Pooley shot a 73, Scotland's Sandy Lyle had a 75, 
defending champion Fulton Allem of South Africa opened with a 76 and veteran 
Andy Bean of the United States shot an 81. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 10 golfers is assured of a big pay day. In addition to the winner's 
check, prizes range from $300,000 for the runner-up to $70,000 for the 
last-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australian Peter Senior, who won the Australian PGA last month and 
the Australian Open last week, shot a 65 today to take a three-shot lead after 
the first round of the $800,000 Johnnie Walker Classic in Melbourne, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
American Jim Benepe and Chris Moody of England are tied for second after 
shooting 68s on the par-72, 6,977-yard Royal Melbourne course. 
</P>
<P>
Australians Mike Clayton and Rodger Davis, New Zealand's Frank Nobilo and 
former American Walker Cup player Doug Martin are four shots behind Senior 
after rounds of 69. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman, who earlier in the week was named Australian Sportsman of the 
Decade, had a 73. 
</P>
<P>
And in Inzai, Japan, Bobby Gage of East Tennessee State defeated Japan's 
Yoshiki Takagai 69-78 as a team of NCAA players won eight matches, tied three 
and lost one today to capture the 54-hole NCAA-Japan Collegiate Golf 
Championship 43-17.

U.S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WARY OF 1991 PAN AM GAMES IN CUBA

The U.S. Olympic Committee has asked federal agencies to help lessen tension 
that might surround the American team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana, 
the panel's president said today. 
</P>
<P>
USOC chief Robert Helmick said the committee had been in contact with various 
departments and offices in Washington about providing the best possible 
atmosphere when U.S. athletes make a rare appearance in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries lack diplomatic relations, and contacts between them remain 
strained 30 years after the Communist takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Helmick, during a break in a meeting of the International Olympic Committee's 
executive board, said he is certain that Havana can stage the games despite the 
U.S. Treasury Department's refusal to allow ABC to pay $9 million in television 
rights fees to Cuban organizers. ABC sued the Treasury Department Monday over 
the refusal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always felt that the cost of production of the TV program would 
outweigh the rights fees," Helmick said. "Our main concern is that our athletes 
are given the chance to perform in an atmosphere where tension is such that 
they can perform to the best of their abilities." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens with the television money, Helmick said, the United 
States would send a team to Havana. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed this with the Cubans before they agreed to send a team to (the 
1987 Pan Am Games in) Indianapolis," he said. "We agreed that the day of 
boycotts is behind us."

Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran both made the middleweight limit of 160 
pounds, but Duran's World Boxing Council middleweight title apparently will not 
be at stake tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Sulaiman, WBC president, said Tuesday that if Duran and Leonard made the 
middleweight limit, that title would be at stake as well as Leonard's WBC super 
middleweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman changed his mind, however, during the mass confusion that followed 
today's weigh-in, at which Leonard scaled 160 and Duran weighed 158. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Acri and Tom Mara, representatives for Duran, became upset when promoter 
Bob Arum announced that both titles would be on the line. They did not want the 
middleweight title to be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't give a damn about that title," Mike Trainer, Leonard's attorney, told 
Acri and Mara. "Duran can keep the belt."

SEIFERT'S CALM MELTS AS 49ERS PREPARE FOR FACE-OFF WITH RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. L. PRICE, MC CLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
SANTA CLARA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first season as the San Francisco 49ers' coach, George Seifert has been 
the picture of calm, unfazed by injuries, player complaints or the NFL's weekly 
apocalypse. No game, whether the opponent was a division leader or a 
coach-killer, was more important than any other. Emotions had no place. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday all that changed. Seifert, with a chance to beat an archrival and 
clinch a division and home field advantage through the playoffs, made it clear 
that he considers Monday night's showdown with the Rams in Anaheim the 49ers' 
most important game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
As the club practiced Wednesday morning, team official Rodney Knox walked into 
the pressroom and told reporters that Seifert was considering closing practice 
to the media. No one could remember Bill Walsh, even in the tensest moments of 
his regime, closing practice. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert relented, but Knox hinted that the reporters shouldn't report what they 
saw on the field. And two writers from Los Angeles were barred from practice -- 
a first. Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because of all this secret stuff we're putting in," Seifert said. "All the new 
formations and plays and defenses. We don't want the Rams to know about it. 
Things are pretty tight. There are a lot of things we'd just as soon keep to 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Such an action by Walsh would not have been surprising. His mind games with 
players and media were legendary. But Seifert's relatively straightforward 
approach has been one of the major differences between his style and Walsh's, 
and Wednesday's weirdness seemed to come from nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert said it has nothing to do with the fact that the Rams have won two 
straight over the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be Atlanta or the New York Giants or Denver or anybody," he said. 
"This just happens to be the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of the last three games is monumental, and this just happens to be 
the first to see if we can make it to the playoffs. That's where we're at. 
We're trying to get there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited, anxious about it, just like everyone else is. It should be a 
great game. They're a great football team. They have a great quarterback, a 
great offense, and their defense is playing well. And we've done some good 
things, too, so it's a classic situation. It's a fun thing for a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
But not for Seifert. "No, not right now it's not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Few players said they found Seifert to be any more intense this week. For the 
most part, they appreciate his low-key style. Then again, low-key isn't exactly 
what this game is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"You need the little bump in the road so you know it's something special," 
quarterback Steve Young said. "I'd like George to do something weird just 
because it would be fun. Week after week, it does get a little monotonous. 
</P>
<P>
"Preparing our game plan, it was like, 'Remember what happened to us four games 
ago? Remember what the Rams did to us?' You know them like your in-laws -- what 
you like about them, what you don't like about them and what you can expect. 
The one thing we do know about the Rams is that we can expect the unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
Said running back Roger Craig: "We're in a good position right now, and he 
doesn't want any distractions. If we win this game, we'll clinch our division. 
It's crucial for us to keep our momentum going and not start relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Brent Jones said it's not going to take "anything extra" to get up 
for this game. "If you can't get excited on your own, just by the things going 
on around you, you don't belong here. Everybody knows what's at stake." 
</P>
<P>
With Seifert admitting to a case of pregame paranoia, only one 49er professed 
not to care at all about clinching the division. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing special about this week," wide receiver Jerry Rice said. "This 
week is just like any other week. You don't think like that; you're going to 
lose. What you want to think about right now is the Rams. You don't want to 
think about clinching the division. Everybody has their own way of looking at 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
49ers Notebook -- Quarterback Joe Montana, who has never lost in seven starts 
in Anaheim, said he'll take a cortisone shot for his bruised ribs, if 
necessary, in order to play Monday. Montana took a pain-killing shot earlier 
this year. He skipped Wednesday's practice but hopes to work out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for support on the defensive line, the 49ers signed former Chicago 
Bears defensive end Sean Smith. Smith started three games for the Bears last 
season but was waived before this season. He played two games for Dallas and 
was waived, then signed with Tampa Bay and played three games before being 
waived again. Seifert said he'll use Smith primarily at defensive end, but with 
nose guard tackle Pete Kugler bothered by a sore lower back, Smith could help 
out there, too. "I've been calling myself 'The Bag Man' because I've gone from 
team to team," Smith said. "I'm glad I'm ending up with a team that's going to 
the playoffs. I prayed and prayed, and my dream came true." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Terrence Flagler missed practice Wednesday, apparently because his 
flight back from Atlanta -- via Sacramento -- was delayed by fog. Flagler had 
permission to remain behind after the Atlanta game to visit with family in 
northern Florida. Seifert said that the absence was excused and that Flagler 
should be at practice today. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Chet Brooks and linebacker Charles Haley didn't practice Wednesday 
because Seifert wanted to rest them. Jones missed practice because of a 
partially dislocated right shoulder, and tight end Jamie Williams may be 
activated for the first time this season.
