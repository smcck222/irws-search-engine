VOTE ON BERNHARDT RECALL QUALIFIES FOR S.D. BALLOT;

<P>
Drawing the battle lines for San Diego's first recall campaign, city election 
officials announced Thursday that a group seeking to oust Councilwoman Linda 
Bernhardt has narrowly qualified the issue for the ballot early next year. 
</P>
<P>
By an unexpectedly slim margin of 49 signatures, the Recall Bernhardt Committee 
surpassed the 11,240 valid names of registered voters needed to force a recall 
election. Bernhardt will battle to retain her 5th District seat while would-be 
successors compete in a tandem race to possibly replace her. 
</P>
<P>
A possible recount and likely legal challenge from Bernhardt, however, loom as 
potential hurdles to what would be the first recall campaign since the City 
Charter was approved early this century. If the recall attempt survives those 
obstacles, the election probably would be held in March or April. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's 49 names or 4,900 -- who cares?" said an exuberant Bob Trettin, 
one of the recall committee's consultants. "All that matters is that we made 
it. To paraphrase Joe Kennedy, we certainly didn't pay for a landslide. Let her 
go to court. This election's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
A visibly discouraged Bernhardt, who was at a late-afternoon council committee 
meeting when City Clerk Charles Abdelnour revealed that the recall committee 
had succeeded, described herself as "saddened, frustrated but determined to 
survive" the challenge to hold on to the seat to which she was elected only 13 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"For the people who opposed me in the first place to use the recall procedure 
to attempt to oust me is politics at its worst," Bernhardt said. "It's going to 
be very expensive for the taxpayers and disruptive for the city. I'm a little 
disappointed, but still confident." 
</P>
<P>
Verification of the 18,097 signatures on the recall petitions showed that 
11,289 names were valid, barely exceeding the 11,240-signature requirement, 
which represents 15% of the registered voters in Bernhardt's district. 
</P>
<P>
Those signatures were gathered by the anti-Bernhardt group in a two-part 
process that began last summer and ended in late November. In October, 8,265 of 
the 11,240 names that the group solicited over a 39-day period were found to be 
valid by the county registrar of voters' office. An additional 6,274 names were 
collected on so-called "supplemental petitions" after the first batch proved 
insufficient. On Thursday, 3,024 of those were certified. 
</P>
<P>
"It was much closer than we anticipated, but I guess that just meant we should 
have worked a little harder," said Kathy Gaustad, the recall committee's 
chairwoman. "But we knew it was going to be tough when we started. Maybe we got 
a little cocky and slacked off at the end. That's not going to happen in the 
election." 
</P>
<P>
The quirk in local law that gave the recall group more than six additional 
weeks to circulate its supplemental petitions could figure prominently in 
Bernhardt's likely legal attempt to block the City Council from scheduling a 
recall election, as it is legally bound to do when the issue comes before it 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say there's enormous potential for a lawsuit and many legal questions," 
Bernhardt said, adding that she expects a citizens' group supporting her to 
mount the challenge. "It's also close enough that we might go for a recount 
first." 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether the recall election would be held in Bernhardt's former 
district or the new one created under a redistricting plan approved by a 
federal judge last month also could face a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, City Atty. John Witt ruled that the recall petitions should be 
circulated in Bernhardt's now-former district, prompting principals on both 
sides of the issue to speculate that the election itself also will be confined 
to the old 5th District boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
That upcoming legal decision is a crucial one, because it not only will 
determine which voters will cast ballots, but also will establish residency 
requirements for possible successors. 
</P>
<P>
Recall leaders, however, dismissed Bernhardt's talk of a possible recount or 
lawsuit as, in Trettin's words, "the last straws blowing in the wind that she 
can grasp for." 
</P>
<P>
"All she's doing is trying to delay the inevitable," Gaustad added. "I find it 
ironic that she complains about the cost of a special election at the same time 
that she's talking about running to court, which would cost the city even more. 
What it comes down to is, this woman will do anything, at any cost, to hold 
onto her office." 
</P>
<P>
Under procedures governing recall campaigns, once a qualified recall petition 
is presented to the City Council, the council must schedule an election within 
60 to 90 days. According to Abdelnour, Jan. 7 is the next available regular 
council docket on which the item could appear, a timetable that would produce 
an election in either March or April, assuming that legal challenges or other 
events do not delay the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
When the recall issue comes before it, the council's only discretion would be 
over the timing of the election, not whether there should be one, according to 
City Election Officer Mike Haas. 
</P>
<P>
The council "doesn't appear to have the discretion not to call a recall" in 
cases where sufficient signatures are collected, Haas said. At the same time, 
the council also must schedule a tandem race to determine Bernhardt's possible 
successor, which would appear on the same ballot as the recall. 
</P>
<P>
Some recall leaders, however, have expressed concern that the council's 
so-called "Gang of Five" -- the majority, which includes Bernhardt, that 
dominates the body on most major policy issues -- might seek to delay action or 
otherwise resist scheduling the election. But city lawyers and election 
officials view the potential for any such council recalcitrance to be, at best, 
an exceedingly remote possibility. 
</P>
<P>
A simple majority vote would determine Bernhardt's political fate. If she 
received more than 50% of the vote, Bernhardt would retain her post, rendering 
the outcome of the companion election on possible successors moot. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Bernhardt were ousted, the candidate drawing the most votes in the 
other race -- in which Bernhardt cannot compete -- would serve the rest of her 
four-year term that expires in December, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The potential candidates mentioned include two former councilmen: Ed Struiksma, 
the two-term incumbent whom Bernhardt upset in November, 1989, and lawyer Floyd 
Morrow, who previously held the same seat. Other possible contenders include 
lawyer Mike Eckmann, who lost in last year's 5th District primary; lawyer Tom 
Behr; Mira Mesa activist Lucy Gonzalez and employment agency owner Mel Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Recall leaders have cited a number of factors as the impetus behind their 
effort. Prominent among the reasons is their dissatisfaction with Bernhardt's 
approval of a controversial redistricting plan that would shift several 
high-growth neighborhoods from her district into another council district, and 
that would divide Pacific Beach among four districts. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponents also have complained that, since her election, 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt has accepted campaign contributions from developers after pledging 
not to do so in last year's campaign, and they fault her for hiring her 
roommate as her City Hall chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the recall effort "a second swing at me after they missed the first 
time," Bernhardt argues that the campaign is being largely orchestrated by 
individuals who opposed her during last year's election. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want me last November (1989) so it's no surprise they don't want 
me now," Bernhardt said. "My key message to voters is going to be that I am 
what I said I was. I'm probably the staunchest advocate for environmental 
protection on the council, a strong supporter of neighborhood empowerment, and 
someone who's pushed for strong growth-management policies. When I get a chance 
to give my side, voters will be fair." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-recall consultant Trettin, however, contends that Bernhardt will confront 
daunting financial and strategic obstacles in the recall election. Still facing 
a $100,000 debt from her last campaign, Bernhardt probably would see that 
deficit -- which includes a $50,000 personal loan -- grow in any recall 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by law, Bernhardt cannot gain access to the names on the recall 
petitions -- a provision designed to prevent elected officials from trying to 
intimidate or punish those who sign. That information, however, is in the hands 
of the recall committee -- an asset of inestimable value in a low-turnout 
election, as the recall most likely would be, given that it would be the only 
issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting out with the names and addresses of more than 11,000 people who 
say they want Linda Bernhardt out of office," Trettin said, noting that she 
received only about 14,000 votes when she was elected in November, 1989. "Linda 
doesn't know who those people are, so it's going to be a lot more expensive for 
her to reach them. Anything can happen in a campaign, but I'd rather be 
starting where we are than where Linda's at."

FOR A MIRA MESA MOTHER, A PHONE CALL BROUGHT CHRISTMAS AND ANSWERED PRAYERS

<P>
For four months, Betty Hampson of Mira Mesa said, she has felt sick at her 
stomach. But Thursday morning, she felt ecstasy, hearing news that for her 
meant an early Christmas and answered prayers. 
</P>
<P>
It was her youngest of three sons, Randy, on the phone from Iraq, where he had 
been held captive since Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom! Mom! Did you hear? I'm coming home! I don't know when, but they told us 
we'll be leaving!" 
</P>
<P>
And, his phone time limited, the 32-year-old electrical engineer asked his 
mother for one quick favor: Please call his employer so that money can be sent 
to him in London, where he wants to stop and see his girlfriend before coming 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise I'll be home by Dec. 26," he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Betty Hampson's burden lifted and her phone began ringing off the 
hook with calls of relief and joy from friends, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been praying every day. After a while, that's all you would do. Pray. 
And now they've been answered," said the 64-year-old woman. "He said he'll be 
home the day after Christmas, but, for me, Christmas came today." 
</P>
<P>
Randy had been calling home somewhat frequently recently, she said. The first 
time was to wish her a happy birthday just before her Nov. 3 birthday. That was 
the first she had heard from her son since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by 
Iraq. Randy had spent four years in Kuwait as a contract employee for a company 
doing work for private businesses there. 
</P>
<P>
It was with that phone call, she said, that she learned that Randy had been 
captured Sept. 4 by Iraqis, when he tried to sneak across the border into 
Jordan with others. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Iraqis allowed him and others to call home -- but presumably 
they monitored the calls and often would cut them off in mid-sentence, Betty 
Hampson said. 
</P>
<P>
She was able to learn, though, that her son apparently was one of five men 
living in a five-bedroom house not far from an oil refinery, about 25 miles 
from Baghdad. Randy presumably was part of Saddam Hussein's human shield. 
</P>
<P>
The men ate three meals a day -- often chicken and rice -- and played 
volleyball and ran laps for their daily exercise. There were no indications of 
mistreatment, she said. Other hostages who had been freed in recent weeks had 
called her, Hampson said, to share news about Randy, and they, too, said he was 
in good health and good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
The phone calls from her son were more frequent in the past month. "And I've 
heard more from him in the last week than I did in three years," Hampson said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
She said she feels confident that Hussein will not back out of his promise to 
release Randy and the other captives. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Hussein) is wising up a little bit. I think he knows he has to do 
something."

LUCY DAWIDOWICZ; AUTHOR, HOLOCAUST HISTORIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucy S. Dawidowicz, a distinguished historian whose accounts of the Holocaust 
are considered among the definitive works of that atrocity, died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
She was 75 when she died of unreported causes in New York City, where she held 
a chair in the interdisciplinary studies of the Holocaust at Yeshiva 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"A Holocaust Reader" and "The War Against the Jews" were eyewitness accounts of 
the Holocaust, gleaned from her early years and postwar travels to Europe, 
where she helped survivors of Nazi concentration camps rebuild schools and 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Those books and others, including the 1989 "From That Place and Time: A Memoir, 
1938-47," were based on interviews and research with survivors and her own 
recollections of Vilna, Poland, where she had lived in her youth. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of Polish immigrants, she was born in New York in 1915. She moved 
to Poland while in her 20s and managed to escape Nazi invaders because she had 
an American passport. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the war she came back to Europe, she told Publisher's Weekly last 
year in connection with the publication of "From That Place and Time," hoping 
to establish a center for Yiddish culture. 
</P>
<P>
When she found that Jewish culture and life had been nearly extinguished by the 
death camps, she helped recover some of the Hebrew literature seized by the 
Germans and returned to the United States to write and study. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dawidowicz, who attended Hunter College and Columbia University, was often 
at the center of disputes within the Jewish community over the nature of the 
Holocaust and the responsibility of American Jews for not doing more to prevent 
it. 
</P>
<P>
She was critical of historians who postulated that European Jews were too 
passive and cowardly in allowing the Holocaust to occur. 
</P>
<P>
She argued that it was unfair to judge in hindsight those who actually went 
through the experience. She also believed that European Jews were too isolated 
and too militarily and materially weak to overcome the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Her central work, "The War Against the Jews," argues that destruction of her 
people was not a byproduct of Germany's World War II strategy but a central 
force in Hitler's plan to conquer Europe. 
</P>
<P>
She had met her husband, Szymon, while in Vilna. He escaped from Poland and 
died in 1979.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ATHLETIC CLUB IS READY TO DRAW A NEW LINE IN THE SAUDI SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Note to Saddam Hussein: You should consider immediate capitulation. OMBAC may 
be on its way. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Mission Beach Athletic Club, that fabled pack of aging jocks and beer 
swillers, is talking with the Marine Corps about taking Over-the-Line to the 
troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
A deal is being cooked up for OMBAC to provide both equipment and expertise. 
Including an OMBACer or two to make sure the game is treated with all the 
irreverence and rowdiness it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
From Fiesta Island to Operation Desert Shield. Who'd have thought it? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for one, Michael Neil, the trial lawyer and reserve brigadier general who 
is now in command of Camp Pendleton. As a San Diegan, he's familiar with the 
annual OTL bacchanal that mixes softball and madness. 
</P>
<P>
"Over-the-Line is perfect for Saudi Arabia," said OMBACer Ron Price, 47, 
bartender at the Pennant in South Mission Beach (unofficial OTL headquarters). 
"You've got a lot of sand and a lot of bored guys with no recreation. They need 
us." 
</P>
<P>
So far, nothing is nailed down. The Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations 
may yet mess things up. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the word is go, OMBAC is ready. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be fairly easy to do," said OMBACer Mike Curren, 60, a surveyor. 
"Nobody knows more about Over-the-Line than OMBAC. Six guys, a bat and a ball 
and you're in business." 
</P>
<P>
There will, however, have to be certain modifications from the OTL original. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for a lot of drinking. And don't look for a Ms. Emerson Contest, 
which, as you may know, is based on an old knock-knock joke and involves close 
anatomical inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi customs frown on public displays of beer and bust lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
So Sue Me 
</P>
<P>
Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
* Your legal system at work. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney is suing the owner of a moving company that does 
business in L.A. and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
The owner: Louis Porcaro. His company: A Nice Jewish Boy Moving &amp; Storage 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Not that nice. Forty-four customers complained about late deliveries, breakage 
and overbilling. 
</P>
<P>
* The legal drunk limit has been 0.08% for nearly a year now. 
</P>
<P>
But the Department of Motor Vehicles has yet to change the multiple-choice test 
given in San Diego for a driver's license. It lists as options: 0.10%, 0.01% 
and 0.09%. 
</P>
<P>
DMV's solution: Everyone gets credit for a right answer. 
</P>
<P>
* Among the Christmas gifts available at Grossmont Center in La Mesa: A pillow 
shaped like huge lips. Makes a kissing noise when you sit down. 
</P>
<P>
Retail price: $29.98. 
</P>
<P>
* Playing through. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force sergeant has written to Taylor Made, the Carlsbad golf equipment 
manufacturer, about golfing in Saudi Arabia. No greens, no trees, no water 
traps. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a local hazard: Camels often stroll through the makeshift course. 
</P>
<P>
* The Guardian Angels will provide crowd control for Sunday's San Diego 
Marathon in North County.

Marathon organizers had hoped for 200 Marine volunteers from Camp Pendleton, 
but they've all shipped out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Had a Good Teacher? 
</P>
<P>
 Plus ca change ... 
</P>
<P>
 Let's review: Sheriff John Duffy is bad because he liked to travel rather than 
mind the store. 
</P>
<P>
He's also bad because he's supposedly not helping Sheriff-elect Jim Roache, the 
reform candidate, learn the ropes before he takes over next month. 
</P>
<P>
But wait: The state Commission on Peace Officer Standards &amp; Training is 
holding a four-day seminar right now in San Diego for newly elected sheriffs. 
There are 23 of them statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Roache is one of only two new sheriffs not attending. He's vacationing in 
Puerto Vallarta.

MAINTENANCE WORK WILL SHUT WATER LINE TO OTAY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scheduled maintenance on the water treatment plant at Lake Skinner in Riverside 
County will require the shutdown of a critical pipeline and force the Otay 
Water District to tap into other sources in order to meet the needs of about 
100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County Water Authority officials announced Thursday that water 
delivery from Lake Skinner will be suspended for five days, beginning Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which owns the 
treatment plant, will perform modifications and routine maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Otay Water District spokesman Charlie Cassens said that the lake is the only 
source of drinking water for the district, and that the agency provides 28 
million to 30 million gallons of water daily for 130 square miles at the 
southeastern end of the county, from Suncrest to Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Cassens said the Otay Water District will obtain water from the Helix Water 
District, the Sweetwater Authority and the city of San Diego while the 
maintenance is being done. 
</P>
<P>
However, agency officials said they will be able to meet only about half the 
daily demand and will cut off all water service for irrigation and construction 
purposes from Dec. 16 to Dec. 21, or until the maintenance is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to produce a 30% reduction in demand, and residential 
users will be asked to curb their demand by 20% to prevent the agency from 
dipping into its emergency reserves, Cassens said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials do not expect any water outages during the period, he said, noting 
that the district normally has three days' worth of water in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
While the Metropolitan Water District works on the Lake Skinner facility, the 
Otay district will take advantage of the situation by performing routine 
maintenance on the pipeline that links it with the lake, Cassens said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: THEFTS BY CON ARTISTS IN ROLE OF REPAIRMEN 
MOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Con artists who often pose as utility repairmen to gain entry into homes in 
East Los Angeles have stolen more than $37,000 in cash from at least 23 victims 
since April, 1989, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
About $26,000 was taken in just one of the thefts. Sgt. Dave Tellez said the 
victims have been mostly elderly Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest reported theft, $1,700 was stolen Tuesday from an 86-year-old 
woman in the 600 block of La Verne Avenue, just three blocks south of a 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Tellez said the thieves usually pose a utility repairmen, but have also posed 
as building inspectors or roofing repairmen. Investigators said the con men 
mostly operate in teams of two, and in some cases have included women.

Photo, For Safety's Sake: A new pedestrian bridge over the Metro Rail Blue Line 
at 105th Street and Grandee Avenue in Watts was dedicated Thursday. Serving as 
color guard for the ceremonies were members of the California Cadet Corps from 
nearby Markham Intermediate School. The steel walkway replaces a street-level 
pedestrian crossing and was designed in harmony with the Watts Towers. Another 
pedestrian bridge has been built over the tracks in the city of Compton and is 
scheduled to be dedicated next week. PATRICK DOWNS/ Los Angeles Times

BROKER GETS 6 YEARS IN $12-MILLION FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: CALIFORNIA ANCHOR GROUP'S EX-PRESIDENT HAD ASKED TO SERVE 1 WEEK A 
MONTH IN JAIL FOR 10 YEARS.

<P>
The former president of a Woodland Hills real estate investment company that 
defrauded more than 200 investors out of an estimated $12 million was sentenced 
Thursday in federal court to six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Alan R. Keranen, 42, to federal prison, U.S. District Judge 
William Matthew Byrne rejected an unusual request from Keranen that he receive 
a 10-year sentence during which he would be jailed one week of every month and 
be free the rest of the time to work to pay back the investors. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne rejected the proposal, saying the fraud was too serious not to merit a 
standard prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Anita H. Dymant also opposed Keranen's proposal and had 
asked Byrne to sentence the once-flamboyant salesman to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Keranen to six years, Byrne also ordered him to make restitution 
of $3.5 million to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen, who used to live in Woodland Hills but now resides in Oregon, was 
charged in June with taking nearly $4 million in cash and real estate from 
California Anchor Group after fraudulently enticing investors with claims of 
25% yearly returns on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
The company was supposed to build and sell San Fernando Valley apartment 
complexes, but prosecutors said only about 3% of the investors' money went into 
such developments. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen later pleaded guilty to two counts of bank fraud and two counts of mail 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"I committed the crimes," Keranen said tearfully during his sentencing hearing. 
"I did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dumas and Ronald Stoliar, California Anchor vice presidents, pleaded 
guilty to lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
Stoliar was placed on five years probation by Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, who was scheduled to be sentenced Thursday, did not appear and a warrant 
has been issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen has filed for bankruptcy and his attorney said he had about $100,000 
available for restitution. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of California Anchor investors watched the sentencing and left with 
little hope of ever getting much of their money back. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances are about as good as getting a glass of ice water in hell," said 
Terry Thomason, a Canoga Park investor who said his family lost $250,000 in the 
scam.

CAT 'RESCUER' MAY GET JAIL IN FREEING OF 45 FELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Vailette, according to Lancaster authorities, is a brand-new kind of cat 
burglar. 
</P>
<P>
They're accusing him of burgling cats. 
</P>
<P>
Vailette illegally let the cat out of the bag -- actually, about 45 cats -- on 
the night of Nov. 6, when he turned loose the feline inmates from more than 16 
cages at the Antelope Valley Animal Care Shelter, alleged Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Sheilah Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
He was familiar with the shelter, having spent several weeks working there in 
October as court-mandated community service in lieu of a fine for a traffic 
infraction, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vailette was found on the premises with a kitten on his shoulder after the 
cages were opened, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vailette neither admitted nor denied the break-in in an interview Thursday. But 
he said that while working at the shelter, he was disturbed by the conditions 
in which the cats lived, especially the feral cats -- those classified as wild. 
They were kept 10 to 12 in a cage, and when they were fed, "only the big cats 
got to eat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not a member of any animal rights group, but has saved cats from 
harm in the past. A year and a half ago, he rescued a cat from pit bulldogs 
that were killing other cats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said Vailette -- who faces six misdemeanor charges including grand 
theft, trespassing and interfering with an officer -- could face up to a year 
in jail if convicted. She noted that those convicted of petty theft in Antelope 
Valley courts routinely receive a minimum of two days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Up here, we don't just give them a fine and say bye-bye," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter manager Dan Sturkie said that although Vailette may have wanted to help 
the cats, "he didn't do them any favor." His act will cause more cats to suffer 
in the end by leading to the births of more feral kittens, Sturkie said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Vailette also inconvenienced shelter personnel, now burdened with 
trying to hunt down the escaped cats. 
</P>
<P>
So far, they've found only six.

SANTA ANA WINDS TO BRING WARM WEEKEND WEATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana condition caused by high pressure over southern Idaho is the cause 
of San Diego County's unseasonably warm weather, according to the National 
Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana will begin to weaken Saturday, but the warm, sunny days and 
clear, cool nights associated with the high pressure will linger through the 
weekend, forecaster Terry Schmeichel said. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury reached 77 degrees Thursday at Lindbergh Field, 10 degrees above 
the norm for a Dec. 6. The overnight low early Thursday was 46, more in line 
with the norm of 50. 
</P>
<P>
Expected winds of 30 m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h in the mountains failed to materialize 
Thursday. However, winds of up to 25 m.p.h. along the coast and 30 m.p.h. in 
the mountains and deserts are predicted for today, though they will die down by 
Saturday, Schmeichel said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches are expected to range from 70 to 76 today, 
decreasing to 68 to 74 over the weekend. The water is 61 degrees and the surf 
will be 2 to 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal regions will experience highs of 75 to 81 today, dropping to 74 to 79 
degrees over the weekend, Schmeichel said, and night temperatures will dip to 
38 to 47. 
</P>
<P>
Inland areas will have highs of 79 to 86 today and through the weekend, with 
nighttime lows of 37 to 46, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the mountain will peak at 57 to 67 today, Saturday and Sunday, 
dipping to 26 to 36 at night. Desert highs will be 68 to 77, with lows of 37 to 
43.

A North Hollywood man was arrested on suspicion of mail fraud for swindling 
credit card applicants out of nearly $100,000, the U.S. attorney's office said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Oberman, 50, who also uses the name Helmut Brunjes, faces nine felony 
counts of mail fraud, said Carole Levitzky, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Oberman could receive a maximum sentence of five years in prison 
and a fine of $250,000 on each of the counts, she said. Prosecutors said 
Oberman ran advertisements for his Goldcard Services Inc. in Latino newspapers 
across the country for five months in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The ads promised that "he could get his clients credit cards regardless of no 
credit or bad credit," Levitzky said. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants received a letter from Oberman stating that they had "received 
preliminary approval for a VISA or a Mastercard when he had no authority from 
VISA or Mastercard to solicit cards," Levitzky said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the applicants were then asked to pay a "service fee" amounting to 
$60. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,600 people nationwide paid the fee, but received no cards, Levitzky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Oberman was arrested Wednesday and held in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
He was expected to be arraigned today.

REGISTRATION OF ASSAULT GUNS

<P>
In response to "Gun Owners Ignoring Law on Registration," Part A, Nov. 28: 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice claims that owners of these guns are not registering 
them as required. 
</P>
<P>
I sent in the form and my check two months ago, and have heard nothing. I can't 
believe they are that inefficient (not even cashing the check). I rather expect 
to see a lot of "sorry, we never received it" advice after Jan. 1, while lists 
of would-be registrants are sent to local police departments for weapons 
seizure at the first excuse. Those who are registering should do so by 
registered mail.

TRADE BETWEEN U.S., MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report published about the outcome of the meeting between U.S. President 
George Bush and Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Monterrey, 
Mexico, states that "the Mexican government showed a new willingness to give 
American companies a role in its state-owned oil monopoly" (Part A, Nov. 28). 
That view is further stressed in your editorial ("President Salinas Shows the 
Oil Card," Nov. 29), by presenting Salinas as gambling with a new card, "the 
oil card," which, in turn, is seen as "a stunning crack in long-held Mexican 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Such an interpretation springs from a guarantee loan requested by PEMEX, the 
Mexican oil company, to the U.S. Export-Import Bank, in order to finance oil 
drilling plans in Mexico. The $1.5-billion guarantee loan request is part of a 
much broader investment program that PEMEX has been negotiating recently with 
several international financial institutions. In fact, the possible credit has 
already been included in the 1991 budget submitted to the Mexican Congress on 
Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, foreign participation in PEMEX drilling activities is far from 
being new. The presence of both domestic and foreign private companies in the 
Gulf of Mexico drilling wells has been common since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of international credits aimed at financing goods and services 
provided by foreign firms, PEMEX's practice has been to extend payments to 
contractors with financial resources. At no time has the practice been, nor 
will it ever be, sharing or compromising oil reserves ownership or PEMEX's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Let it be stressed once again that the free trade negotiations will not include 
two issues: oil and migrant labor. 
</P>
<P>
It should be evident that there is no "oil card" being played by President 
Salinas. Mexico's oil policy is firm and straightforward.

TRADE BETWEEN U.S., MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the author of the Americas Watch Report on Human Rights in Mexico referred 
to in the interview with President Salinas (Opinion, Nov. 25), I would like to 
correct a misleading impression left by him concerning improvements in human 
rights conditions in his country. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the creation of a National Human Rights Commission and the proposing 
of new legislation to reduce the incidence of torture by police are positive 
developments. But the case President Salinas selected to illustrate the human 
rights improvements made by his administration in fact reveals that these 
improvements are more cosmetic than real. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves Mexican attorney Antonio Valencia Fontes who was arrested in 
Mexicali on Nov. 22, 1989, by federal judicial anti-narcotics officers. He 
alleges that he was tortured and coerced into confessing to crimes he did not 
commit. The attorney general has denied that Valencia was in federal custody 
prior to Nov. 27. The Human Rights Commission investigated Valencia's case and 
determined that the earlier arrest date was probable. It called on the attorney 
general to investigate whether his human rights had been violated by the 
police. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo refused. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia Fontes remains in jail, the police officers who illegally detained and 
tortured him are still on duty. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for President Salinas to demonstrate that he is serious about 
halting human rights abuses. He must insist that the recommendations of his 
National Human Rights Commission be carried out -- even when that means 
releasing alleged criminals whose human rights were violated during their 
arrests. He must punish police officers and their commanders who engage in 
torture, incommunicado detention and other serious abuses. And, having hinted 
that he has done so already, he should immediately take steps to ensure 
Valencia Fontes' release.

REGISTRATION OF ASSAULT GUNS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Rifle Assn. has shown that its understanding of "civil 
disobedience" is about as accurate as its interpretation of the Second 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The basic element, as demonstrated by Thoreau, Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., is that you accept the punishment after openly disobeying the "bad" 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Surreptitiously breaking the law, by not registering their assault weapons, has 
another name. It is called "crime," and its practitioners are criminals to the 
same extent as those who they claim to protect us from.

TRADE BETWEEN U.S., MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Salinas' free trade agreement initiative is not the product of vision 
and courage, but rather a desperate attempt to find an overnight solution to 60 
years of neglect, incompetence and abuse that has produced discontent among 
Mexican people and has seriously undermined the ruling party's (PRI) grip on 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas' failure to properly address grave domestic problems ranging from an 
exploding population growth (expected to double by the year 2010) to widespread 
corruption, nepotism and inefficiency in government and industry makes his free 
trade proposal questionable at best. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented challenge by the opposition during the last presidential 
election sent a clear and sobering message to Mexico's power structure to begin 
producing positive results. The desired results will only come about with good 
judgment, integrity and hard work, and not by a single stroke of the pen.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RENO CITY MANAGER TAKES JOB IN LANCASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reno City Manager Harold Schilling accepted the same job with the city of 
Lancaster on Thursday, receiving an open-ended contract and a $100,000-a-year 
starting salary, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Pursley said Schilling, 51, who has 16 years experience managing 
four cities, was the unanimous choice among about 50 applicants. Schilling will 
replace former City Manager Steve West, who was forced to resign by the council 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
Schilling said he learned of the job from Jim Gilley, a co-owner of Mid Valley 
Real Estate, the Lancaster business where Pursley works as an agent.

HAS THE OTHER GUY BLINKED?; 
</P>
<P>
SADDAM PLAYS THE HOSTAGE CARD: PLOY OR RETREAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it the beginning of the end of the Persian Gulf crisis? Does Saddam 
Hussein's decision to free the thousands of foreign hostages he holds in Iraq 
imply an early readiness to accept U.N. demands that he get out of Kuwait? Or 
is the surprise announcement simply another gambit by the wily dictator, 
intended to weaken the anti-Iraq coalition and erode political support for 
possible U.S.-led military action that could destroy his regime? 
</P>
<P>
Take the optimistic assessment first. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's decision came only a day or so after he received a group of friendly 
Arab leaders, including Jordan's King Hussein and the PLO's Yasser Arafat, who 
are almost surely in firmer touch with global realities than the insulated 
dictator. It's quite possible that the message they brought to Baghdad is that 
last week's Security Council resolution authorizing force against Iraq after 
Jan. 15 must be taken seriously, and so must the Bush Administration's 
readiness to use the war option as a last resort. Saddam Hussein may also now 
be facing the fact that the near-total interruption in Iraq's international 
trade, if less than crippling so far, is nonetheless producing pain, with more 
damaging and demoralizing results sure to come. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, it may be that Saddam Hussein has once again simply shown great 
shrewdness by a well-timed move to manipulate public opinion to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Releasing the Western and Japanese hostages (Soviet citizens were told earlier 
that they could leave) removes what for many people is the most emotional 
element arising out of Iraq's aggression. People are far more likely to 
identify with -- to care about, to put it bluntly -- fellow citizens who are 
being held hostage than they are about the plight of the exiled emir of Kuwait, 
or even the frightful treatment Iraq is inflicting on the emir's hapless 
subjects. Take that visceral component out of the equation and, for many, 
Iraq's aggression becomes less immediate, more abstract. It's not easy to 
mobilize support for going to war against an abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage-taking, it will be recalled, was an afterthought, an opportunistic 
reaction to the unexpected global condemnation of Iraq's aggression. Letting 
the prisoners go now will cost Hussein nothing of substance. But it does let 
Iraq claim that it is being humane, that it is being reasonable, and that it 
has made a significant concession. That sets the scene for it to insist that 
now it is the turn of its antagonists (mainly meaning the United States) to 
make a concession -- say giving Iraq control of some Kuwaiti territory. There 
will be a lot of people, and not just in the Arab world, ready to applaud that 
demand as fair. 
</P>
<P>
Two equally reasonable assessments, then, of what the promised hostage release 
may mean. One points toward Saddam Hussein's possible retreat, the other toward 
a shoring up of his political position. Of course the news of freedom for 
thousands of prisoners is welcome, always assuming that their release will come 
quickly. What's still far from clear is whether this is the beginning of the 
end of the crisis.

AT USC: HELLO TO SAMPLE . . .; 
</P>
<P>
. . . AND GOODBY TO ZUMBERGE, WHO HANDS OVER A MUCH IMPROVED PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Southern California is in the right place at the right time 
to lead its region through years of ethnic and intellectual ferment that are 
just starting in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
Now the school's trustees think they have found the man to lead the university 
itself through those years, Steven B. Sample, whose interests range well beyond 
his degrees in electrical engineering -- to administration, teaching literature 
and community work. 
</P>
<P>
The Times welcomes Sample, who will leave the State University of New York in 
Buffalo for his new job as president of USC next March, and wishes him well in 
a venture as important for its community as any campus could undertake. 
</P>
<P>
We also extend somewhat early thanks to James H. Zumberge, who will retire as 
president at the end of next March, for his success in raising both the quality 
of the faculty and the university's intellectual horizons. 
</P>
<P>
At least as important to Sample, we suppose, will be his sense of gratitude -- 
not at all uncommon among incoming presidents -- for the $641 million in funds 
that Zumberge raised during the past six years to help USC's crusade for 
academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Heady days lie ahead for Sample, not only on campus but in Southern California 
generally. This region faces a period of profound demographic and economic 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is positioning itself to be the financial and banking capital of 
the United States in its dealings with Pacific and Asian nations. The region 
must scramble to expand its research and development capabilities while the 
emphasis in manufacturing veers away from defense to consumer products and 
services on a global scale. 
</P>
<P>
At age 50, Sample is sure to be at the USC helm when the region plunges into a 
future no longer dominated by white suburbanites. Helping guide the region in a 
transition on such a scale will demand tact, wisdom, patience and limitless 
energy. Sample seems to understand the implications of the task he takes on. We 
say again, good luck and go to it.

FIXING AN AWKWARD PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may not be any easy or quick fix to the pathetic Gilbert Lindsay 
situation. It's sad, but that's how it looks. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley opposes, with good reason, the city attorney's suggestion 
that the Los Angeles City Council can appoint a temporary replacement for their 
incapacitated colleague. Nice try, but no dice. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th District certainly needs representation, but not from a temporary 
caretaker who serves until Lindsay recovers or his term expires in 1993. Now 
that Bradley has shot down that option, he should vigorously support an 
amendment to the city Charter, which would allow the removal of council members 
who are incapacitated. Council President John Ferraro and Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, to their credit, are working on an amendment that would prevent 
this disgraceful and tragic situation from happening again. The council should 
move quickly on the Ferraro and Flores proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was partially paralyzed by a stroke on Sept. 2 and has remained 
hospitalized for more than three months. The 90-year-old councilman cannot 
speak, and according to his stepson, does not recognize visitors. 
</P>
<P>
In his current state, the veteran councilman cannot effectively represent his 
district, which includes downtown and much of South-Central Los Angeles. The 
Charter, however, provides no way to remove him from office before his term 
ends unless his constituents mount a successful recall, a difficult and 
expensive process. 
</P>
<P>
The Charter does allow, however, the removal of a member who is out of the city 
without excuse for 60 days. In an effort to remove Lindsay on those grounds, 
the council stopped excusing his absences last month. Lindsay was in an 
Inglewood hospital, but he has since been moved to a Los Angeles hospital. 
</P>
<P>
After 27 years of public service, Gilbert Lindsay can no longer perform his 
duties. The residents of the 9th District deserve better, and that includes a 
chance to vote on their next council representative as soon as possible. 
Unfortunately, that can't happen until voters approve a Charter amendment. 
That's the way city government sometimes works. Poorly.

WASTE FIRM WINS REDONDO BEACH CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Western Waste Industries, which already has an exclusive contract to pick up 
trash and recyclables from single-family homes in Redondo Beach, this week was 
awarded the contract to service most of the city's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, however, had to make several concessions to the city, including a 
promise that none of its new commercial clients will face a rate increase when 
the contract takes effect in April. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also exempted two of the city's largest waste generators, TRW 
and the Galleria at South Bay, which will be free to negotiate their own trash 
collection contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, businesses solicit trash collection services from about 11 
companies, but the council this year decided on an exclusive contract to better 
regulate the industry and to ensure that the city would be able to comply with 
state-mandated recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Western Waste, according to a study done by the city's Resource Conservation 
Commission, was rated the best of the four trash haulers that had bid for the 
commercial contract. Browning Ferris Industries came in second, followed by 
Waste Management Inc. and Haig's Disposal Co. 
</P>
<P>
Still being negotiated is the trash hauling contract for Redondo Beach's 
apartments and condominiums, which have not yet been included in the city's 
curbside recycling program.

BRODERICK LABELED 'EVIL MONSTER' IN BAIL HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick an "evil monster," her ex-husband's 
brother urged a San Diego Superior Court judge Thursday to deny bail to the La 
Jolla socialite. 
</P>
<P>
If Betty Broderick -- who stands accused of murdering her ex-husband and his 
new wife -- is freed on bail, she is likely to contact her two sons, the 
younger two of her four children, which would "destroy them emotionally," said 
Larry Broderick, a Denver-area forest products executive. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Broderick also claimed at a brief hearing Thursday that Betty Broderick 
has threatened him and the two boys -- who now live with his ex-wife in 
Colorado -- with physical harm. He said Betty Broderick is an "evil monster in 
a harmless-looking package who will murder again if given an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan put off a decision on bail until 
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, 43, who did not speak at Thursday's hearing, faces two counts 
of murder in the Nov. 5, 1989 shooting deaths of her ex-husband, Daniel T. 
Broderick III, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
After a monthlong trial, a San Diego Superior Court jury announced Nov. 20 that 
they were deadlocked, 10 for murder, two for manslaughter. Prosecutors have 
indicated that Betty Broderick will be tried again. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Jack Earley argued at Thursday's hearing that Betty Broderick 
should not face first-degree murder charges at a second trial because jurors 
told him they had decided against that charge. 
</P>
<P>
To lodge first-degree charges again would violate the guarantee against double 
jeopardy, Earley contended. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan put off deciding that unusual request until next Tuesday, too. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, the prosecutor in the case, said Tuesday that 
she would oppose any reduction in charges or bail for Betty Broderick.

SUIT BY BEVERLY HILLS CHARGES DECEIT IN CIVIC CENTER PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY KNEW ITS BID WAS TOO LOW AND DID SHODDY WORK, 
THE CITY ALLEGES. THE FIRM DENIES THE CHARGES AND PROMISES A COUNTERSUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Beverly Hills is suing a general contractor and a construction 
management firm for $8 million, charging fraud, negligence and breach of 
contract in the building of the $120-million Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the contractor, J. A. Jones Construction Co., denied the 
allegations, saying that the city owes the firm between $13 million and $14 
million, and that Jones plans to file a countersuit by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city's complaint, Jones Construction knew all along that its 
winning bid vastly understated the actual cost of building the Civic Center's 
computerized library, Italianate courtyards and high-tech police station and 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The city charged that Jones conspired with JLH Construction Inc., which oversaw 
the project, and with John N. Hartsock, site manager for JLH, to approve 
substantial payments that were not authorized by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also said that Jones failed to supervise the job, failed to hire 
competent managers, failed to provide experienced engineers and failed to build 
the project to the specifications of the contract. The suit also charges that 
Jones managed the work of its employees and its subcontractors "in an 
inefficient, uneconomical and dilatory manner." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson Welch, senior business development manager for Jones, dismissed the 
allegations as "generalizations that are absolutely not supported by the 
facts." 
</P>
<P>
Welch said his company was surprised by the lawsuit, since it had expected to 
work out its differences with the city in a mediation session that Jones 
proposed for Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"We're surprised to see them take this tack on the eve of mediation," he said. 
"Our attorneys feel that when you're on the doorstep of mediation and one side 
sues the other, it generally indicates they have a weak case. It's kind of like 
beating your chest." 
</P>
<P>
Welch also said his company had acted in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of ironic at this point that they think we owe them money," he 
added. "It's kind of bizarre. Our attorneys really feel that the city kind of 
is defrauding Jones." 
</P>
<P>
Phone calls to JLH seeking comment on the suit were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
Hartsock, who now works for a construction firm in Portland, Ore., declined to 
comment on the allegations, saying only that he had not known about the lawsuit 
and that he found it "interesting." 
</P>
<P>
The legal action is the latest development in a dispute between Jones 
Construction and the city that erupted nearly a year ago. Jones staged a 
two-month work stoppage early this year to dramatize its claims that the city 
owed it $13 million to $14 million because of delays and change orders that 
increased its costs of construction. 
</P>
<P>
With about $61 million already spent on Jones' portion of the Civic Center job, 
work resumed only after the two sides agreed to put off their legal wrangling 
while the company finished the job for an additional $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the Civic Center is completed and occupied, and with little else 
but landscaping work remaining to be done, the legal briefs are flying. 
</P>
<P>
The city was not the first to go to court. Steiny &amp; Co. Inc., the 
electrical subcontractor on the job, has sued Jones and the city for $2.2 
million in unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
The city's suit, filed Nov. 19, cites its 1986 contract with Jones, a 
German-owned, North Carolina-based firm, to build the library, courtyards and 
police station for $43.6 million, and complete it by April 6, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But after the discovery of asbestos in an old library building and water in the 
ground below the new police station, the completion date for the final phase 
was pushed back to Dec. 22, 1989, and price was raised to nearly $53 million. 
Subsequent amendments to the contract raised the price and extended the job 
even further.

MARATHON: WHEELCHAIR ATHLETE SEEKS PERSONAL BEST IN SAN DIEGO.

<TEXT>
<P>
The brief exchange by sibling rivals is broken up by a sweet kiss to the cheek 
of sister DeAnna Sodoma. Moments earlier, brother John Batchie, whose 501 Levis 
and military-style boots make him look like an refugee from MTV, sat at the 
kitchen table and listened to DeAnna discuss her upcoming marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be on TV," said DeAnna, dressed casually in flowered leggings 
and a long-sleeved gray T-shirt. "I just hope they show a lot of the wheelchair 
races." 
</P>
<P>
John takes a good-natured jab: "You always want prime time, dude." 
</P>
<P>
"Not prime time, just equal time," DeAnna counters. 
</P>
<P>
Sodoma, 23, will be shooting for her best time when she competes in the San 
Diego Marathon, beginning at 7 a.m. Sunday in Oceanside. In less than six 
months of wheelchair racing, an endeavor she undertook after being paralyzed 
two years ago by a spinal condition, the Escondido resident has won all but 
three of the 21 races she has entered. The most recent triumph was a half 
marathon in Oita, Japan, the largest and most prestigious event of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Sodoma fast becoming a champion wheelchair racer, she is 
championing the cause of wheelchair racers everywhere, defending what she said 
is their right to be recognized in the same light as their running 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"I work just as hard as any other athlete," said Sodoma, elated that her story 
will be told in the sports and not the lifestyle section of the newspaper. "I 
am an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Her weekly workout regime -- she swims three days, lifts weights four days and 
pushes or wheels 60-100 miles -- supports that contention. She still is unsure 
whether she will race the half or full marathon, because her training was 
curtailed for three days by a bout of flu. 
</P>
<P>
When the flu bug bit, she bit back harder, as is her style. She's a Rocky on 
wheels with a will the size of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Japan may be light years away from Texas, but that was there Sodoma 
demonstrated the kind of iron will that can catapult athletes with a lot less 
talent to the top of their sport. 
</P>
<P>
The night before she left San Diego for the October race, Sodoma suffered a cut 
on the outside area of her hand, the part used the most to push the wheels. The 
injury required five stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pain, she was determined not only to compete, but to break into the 
top 10 of the women's finishers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my goal," she said. "I compared my best times to the top three or 
four seeds, and I didn't think, realistically, I could do much better than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Not knowing the strategy of the top woman, a racer from Denmark, Sodoma simply 
wanted to keep her in sight. But Sodoma turned out being the one looking over 
her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I started passing everyone into the first mile," she said. "(The woman from 
Denmark) kept trying to whiz by me, but just kept working hard the whole race. 
I never let up." 
</P>
<P>
Her time of 1 hour, 30 seconds bettered the personal best she had clocked in 
August's America's Finest City Half Marathon by five minutes and beat the 
runner-up by one. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad had never seen me race. He cried at the finish line," Sodoma said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Sodoma, a Los Angeles County firefighter, made the trip at his daughter's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one proud papa," he said. "She's only been in a chair two years and 
hasn't been racing that long. She just toughed it out and was able to do 
extremely well." 
</P>
<P>
According to Steve Meiche, Sodoma's ex-boyfriend and current training partner, 
her success can be measured in direct proportion to her natural ability. 
</P>
<P>
"She has the perfect road-rider's frame," Meiche said. "She has lots of natural 
talent and strength. It's genetics. Some people have what it takes and can all 
the sudden pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
It is Sodoma's hope to pick it up enough to earn herself a spot in the 1992 
Paralympics in Barcelona, and eventually make a living as a professional racer. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she does have the potential to get to the top," Ken said. "She's 
always been real competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Sodoma had dabbled in competitive sports throughout high school but didn't 
begin seriously training as a cyclist until she and Meiche began working out 
together in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But like her father, Sodoma was intent on becoming a firefighter first, and 
most of her energy was focused toward getting her certification. It would have 
taken her years, she realized, to reach a world-class level of elite racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Those women at the top had been doing it five or six years longer than I had," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she had a solid background on which to draw when she broke into the 
world of wheelchair racing. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept's the same," Meiche said. "The speedwork, strength training, 
endurance, the drafting, the thing was to adapt it. I had never even seen a 
race itself, but from what she had seen, we tried to put it all together. There 
was a lot of trial and error. We'd go round and round about what she thought 
would work and what I thought would work." 
</P>
<P>
But the work itself never stops. And with enough of it, Sodoma believes the 
odds of her making some money and making it as a professional are good. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing is the most important thing; I'm obsessed," she said. "I don't mind 
making the sacrifices it takes to be the best. I'm dedicating all my time, 
everything to this. I don't want to let life pass me by, but it's a thing you 
have to decide you're going to do or not. It's what I want, it makes me happy. 
Besides, I don't know what else I'd be doing." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, her life was panning out in completely different directions. 
</P>
<P>
She was a waitress by night, a college student by day, and had a relationship 
that centered around cycling training -- with Meiche, a competitive cyclist who 
placed second in the men's sprint race at nationals -- crammed in between. She 
shared a two-story house near the beach with Meiche, where she ran with her 
dog, drove a Nissan 200SX and hung out with friends she sees very little these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
It all melted like wax in March 1989, when she awoke one morning with numbness 
in her feet, a feeling she said spread quickly to her knees and eventually her 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, she leafed through the yellow pages and found the name a 
neurologist, who recommended she undergo a series of tests. 
</P>
<P>
She walked into Tri-City Hospital on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so weird," she recalled. "I begged the nurse that night to let me walk 
around, 'cause I could just feel I was losing it." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors diagnosed her condition as transverse myelitis, but nobody is quite 
sure what caused her paralysis, or whether her condition is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Sodoma thinks the paralysis may have been the result of an accident in Long 
Beach a year earlier, when she was hit by a car while on her bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt quite right after that," she said, suspecting a spinal injury. 
"My lower back hurt a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Sodoma went through the cycle of denial and depression she described as 
typical, but said she snapped out of it sooner than most. 
</P>
<P>
"I accepted it a lot quicker than the average person," she said. "I didn't 
really feel sorry for myself. I believe that things happen for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ken Sodoma: "She dealt with it real well." 
</P>
<P>
What it did was force her to look inside and re-examine her priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"You always hear people say, 'You never know what you have until you lose it.' 
That is such a strong statement," she said. "I lost everything that was 
important to me -- my house, my dog, my career, school, my car, surfing, 
running on the beach . . . But I survived. I'm a better person internally. I'm 
fulfilled with myself. It's a real peaceful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Sodoma said it's not glamorous being in a chair, it is strictly a mode of 
transportation, but that she, at least, has known the joy of walking. 
</P>
<P>
"What people forget is that I had 22 years of walking, running, skipping and 
jumping," she said. "Some people never even get that. I'm consider myself 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
What would make her even luckier is finding a coach to help her train. Two of 
the top women wheelchair racers along with the best coaches, are at the 
University of Illinois, Sodoma said. As long as she is in San Diego, her 
options are limited. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," she said. "You can't just buy a book. I'd love to find a 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
Sodoma is taking classes at Palomar College, and is studying to be an adaptive 
physical education teacher, in hopes of passing her active lifestyle on to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in a chair, you'll have so many more problems if you're not physically 
fit," she said. "It's helped my life so much."

<P>
The Padres made a trade proposal Thursday night to the Kansas City Royals in an 
attempt to acquire power-hitting outfielder Danny Tartabull, a source 
confirmed, and are awaiting a response. 
</P>
<P>
Joe McIlvaine, Padre general manager, would not divulge specifics of the trade 
proposal, saying there are several, but revealed the teams had trade 
discussions involving Tartabull. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, according to a source, provided permission this week for the Padres 
to speak with Tartabull and his agent, Dennis Gilbert, to discuss Tartabull's 
interest in a trade. 
</P>
<P>
When reached at his home in Malibu, Calif., Tartabull said: "It's no secret I 
want to play there. To me, it's the best place to be. It'd be close to home, I 
love the ballpark, and I want to play for (Padre manager) Greg Riddoch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting on pins and needles hoping it'll come through. I thought my chance 
of going there was done when they traded Joe (Carter), but I guess it still has 
a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull, 28, long has been attractive to the Padres. Jack McKeon, who was 
fired two months ago as the Padre general manager, has attempted to trade for 
him the past three seasons. And McIlvaine attempted to trade for Tartabull in 
1986 when Tartabull played for the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Although hampered by hamstring and groin injuries the past two years, Tartabull 
is considered one of baseball's top power-hitting outfielders. He hit 60 homers 
and drove in 203 runs during the 1987 and 1988 seasons. But the past two 
seasons, during which he missed 103 games, he combined for 33 homers and 102 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like him," McIlvaine said. "He can hit. He can drive in runs. He's 
got a great ratio of RBIs to hits. What's not to like?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Riddoch: "Man, would I like to have him. He'd be great for our ballclub. 
We'd stick him in left field, and let him deal." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' dilemma in acquiring Tartabull, 28, is that he is eligible to file 
for free agency at the end of the 1991 season. It's a similar to a year ago 
when they traded for Carter, conditional on Carter signing a multi-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
In their private meeting this week, Gilbert also expressed Tartabull's interest 
in the Padres, almost pleading for the Padres to make a trade offer. Gilbert 
also met two hours with Herk Robinson, Royal general manager, informing him 
that Tartabull will not re-sign with the Royals after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull earned $1.6 million this past season and is eligible for arbitration, 
where he's expected to submit an offer of $1.8 to $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' specific proposals to the Royals remain unknown, although an 
American League general manager revealed Thursday that the Padres offered 
infielder/outfielder Bip Roberts and were turned down down. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Padres made another proposal late Thursday night, possibly including 
right-hander Greg Harris, and were awaiting a response from the Royals. 
Robinson was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, however, continue to show vast interest in Roberts. They are 
seeking a leadoff hitter, preferably a second baseman or third baseman, and 
have talked about several other players besides Tartabull. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Bo Jackson, Raider running back and Royal left fielder, is mentioned in 
one of the Padres' proposals. 
</P>
<P>
But yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That is the longest of longshots," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
If provided the choice, who would McIlvaine desire? 
</P>
<P>
"Tartabull is the better player right now," he said, "but Jackson has unlimited 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also have proposals, a Royal club official revealed, that include 
third baseman Kevin Seitzer and right-handed reliever Jeff Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Seitzer, 28, batted .275 this past season for the Royals with six homers and 38 
RBIs. Montgomery, who beat out Mark Davis for the bullpen stopper's job, saved 
24 games and was 6-5 with 2.39 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got several possibilities," one Royal official said, "but we're not 
trading Montgomery." 
</P>
<P>
One of the obstacles that could delay the Padres' bid in acquiring Tartabull is 
the Raiders' season. The Royals are hesitant in making a trade involving 
Tartabull until the Raider season ends, making sure Jackson is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they want to see what happens in the NFL," McIlvaine said, "and I 
can't blame them. But they know our interests and what we're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll (Robinson) make up his mind when he's ready. He'll do what he wants to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine said the Padres also have dicussed a trade with the Baltimore Orioles 
in an attempt to acquire third baseman Craig Worthington and possibly 
right-handed reliever Mark Williamson. Worthington, who was selected Rookie of 
the Year by The Sporting News in 1989, batted just .226 with eight homers and 
44 RBIs this past season. The Orioles, according to a member of their coaching 
staff, are seeking Roberts in return. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also made a contract offer Thursday night to left-handed starter 
Dennis Rasmussen, who filed for free agency after going 11-15 this season with 
the Padres. McIlvaine said that he is expected to learn today whether Rasmussen 
will accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
If Rasmussen turns down their offer, the Padres have the option of offering him 
arbitration. Yet McIlvaine is reluctant to offer arbitration, realizing that if 
accepted, Rasmussen could receive an award of as much as $1.5 million in a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres refuse to offer arbitration, they lose their rights to negotiate 
with him until May 1 and will receive no compensation if he signs with another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine already has determined that he will not offer arbitration to 
free-agent left-handed hitter Fred Lynn and free-agent third baseman Mike 
Pagliarulo, effectively ending their brief careers with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also had trade discussions Thursday with the New York Mets, 
Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos. Sources said the Padres inquired about 
third baseman Gregg Jefferies of the Mets, right-handed reliever Rick Aguilera 
of the Twins and outfielder Tim Raines of Montreal. Yet McIlvaine conceded it's 
highly unlikely they could work a deal with the Mets or Expos, although he 
still will continue to talk with the Twins about Aguilera. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres are to acquire a left fielder, a void created by the departure of 
Wednesday of Joe Carter -- in the trade that sent Carter and Roberto Alomar to 
Toronto for shortstop Tony Fernandez and first baseman Fred McGriff -- 
McIlvaine acknowledged that it would have to be via a trade. He also said he'd 
have to fill the vacancy at third base with a trade, and is uninterested in any 
free-agent third basemen, including probable second-look free agent Gary Gaetti 
of the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible, of course, that the Padres could wind up keeping Roberts. If he 
stays, McIlvaine said, Roberts will be the starting second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be a feasible spot for Bip to play every day," McIlvaine said. 
"He's just not a prototype third baseman." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine and his assistant, John Barr, are scheduled to leave the winter 
meetings today and will return to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to wait and see what happens from there," McIlvaine said.

KEARNY NEAR TOP AFTER A LOOK AT BOTTOM

<P>
Last August, Coach Willie Matson made clear his expectations for his Kearny 
High football team in the 1990 season. "Our goal is to win the CIF 
championship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Komets (11-1-1) are now one victory away from that San Diego Section 2-A 
crown. They face Avocado League champion El Camino (9-4) at 8 p.m. Saturday at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. And from the outside looking in, things seemed 
to develop for Kearny without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first week of the season, the Komets have been considered the best 
2-A team in the county. They drew the No. 1 seed in the playoffs and demolished 
Coronado, 45-7, in the first round. Kearny, co-champion of the City Western 
League, then eliminated two teams from the usually dominant North County: San 
Marcos, 14-13, and Ramona, 35-22. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to have been a season of triumphs for a team blessed with a blend of 
exciting young players and three seniors -- wide receiver Darnay Scott, 
linebacker Eric Diato, and lineman Aaron Mertens (6-foot-6, 230 pounds) -- who 
rank among the best players in the county. 
</P>
<P>
But from the inside looking out, reaching Saturday's finale has been a long 
struggle. The Komets have had to learn a new offense, suffer through growing 
pains and do some serious soul searching. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing like being in that stadium," Matson said in August. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium, it seems, is the symbolic pinnacle of the dreams of every high 
school football coach and player in San Diego. Yet Matson, who became head 
coach in 1987, concedes his most successful season may also have been his most 
emotionally trying. 
</P>
<P>
There have been days when the often-moody Matson, 34, would stand and stare 
from the sidelines during practice, speaking to no one. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (at one point) the kids were not into it or making too many mistakes 
or not emotional enough," he said. "(Other coaches were) a little more patient, 
but (they were) wondering the same things. 
</P>
<P>
"We were wondering what the heck was going on. Was our philosophy wrong? Were 
the kids not what we thought they were?" 
</P>
<P>
The Komets were riding high into the sixth week of the season. They were 5-0 
and averaging 30.2 points a game, allowing 3.8. Then they had an Oct. 12 date 
with No. 1 Morse, which will face Orange Glen Saturday for the 3-A 
championship. The Tigers (13-0) were the measuring stick by which Kearny would 
determine how good it was. 
</P>
<P>
And in front of 3,800 mostly partisan Kearny fans at Mesa College, Morse 
blasted the Komets, 57-6. It took Morse only three possessions and 11 plays to 
build a 22-0 lead. And with one minute left in the game, the Tigers were still 
rubbing the Komets' noses in the dirt when fullback Conan Smith scored on a 
two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Kearny went into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
The following week against underdog La Jolla, the Komets settled for a 7-7 tie. 
Because it won the overtime tiebreaker, Kearny earned the Western League's top 
seed in the playoffs. But the tie in regulation meant the Komets would share 
the championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were scared of going out and playing football again," said Scott, a 
Times All-County split end who has 34 catches for 736 yards for an average of 
21.6. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later against University City, a 2-4 team, Kearny earned a lackluster 
20-7 victory. It wasn't until a crucial 28-0 victory over USDHS in Week 9 that 
Kearny had found itself again. By then, the Komets had made several changes and 
suffered through some in-house turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of individuals out here," said Diato, the 1989 league's 
defensive player of the year who has played all season with a separated left 
shoulder. "We were playing for ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Morse game, we started to realize that. But we were still going 
downhill. We were still thinking about how bad we got beat. It really affected 
us pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
It apparently wasn't enough that Kearny had a competent quarterback in Sam 
Page, who has passed for 1,459 yards and 15 touchdowns, talent and depth at 
running back and an explosive four-way threat in Scott, who, with his 4.4 
speed, has scored on runs, kick returns and interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to matter that the Komets had perhaps the biggest line in the 
county: Matt Whitcomb (6-0, 220), Lee Lewis (6-4, 255), Joe Allan (6-6, 270), 
Frank Hoffman (6-6, 310) and Mertens. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently had no bearing that two of Matson's assistants had head coaching 
experience. Steve Miner came in after five years (and a section championship in 
1981) at Clairemont and another five years at Madison, and installed a new 
offense. Defensive coordinator Tom Barnett, Matson's former coach at Kearny, 
turned over the reins to him after 10 years, which included a loss in the 1977 
2-A final. 
</P>
<P>
And the uncanny progress of four sophomore starters seemed of little 
consequence. James Curtis emerged as a running back who has rushed for 1,112 
yards on 101 carries for an average of 11.1 a run. Defensive end Rashad Wright 
has 22 sacks. Defensive back Billy Baker is All-Western League. Lewis is a 
two-way starter. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny was suddenly a team that had found adversity and wasn't taking it well. 
Matson changed personnel. Miner simplified his offense, and all waited to see 
what this team would do next. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best things that ever happened to us was getting our butts kicked 
by Morse," Miner said. "The team had a pretty high opinion of itself. We found 
out maybe we needed to work a little bit harder." 
</P>
<P>
For two days after the La Jolla tie, Matson stood stone-faced in practice and 
brooded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd get out there and say, 'Coach Matson . . .' and he'd just sit there and 
look at me," Scott said. "I said, 'Coach!' He wouldn't give me an answer, so I 
just walked away." 
</P>
<P>
Scott got the message, though. It was time for he, Diato, and the other seniors 
on this team that starts 11 underclassmen to get into the team's psyche. They 
started identifying teammates in practice that needed a little refocusing. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric Diato took charge of it," Scott said. "He's the big man. He'd come up to 
us during practice and say, 'Who do we need to talk to today?' If somebody was 
acting a fool, we'd get him in Coach Matson's classroom, and if he didn't 
straighten up he was off the team. Because we decided it was our football team 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a players' union," Diato said. "If a player had a problem he'd 
come to us and we'd settle it. A lot of players had a lot of frustration inside 
of them. We gave them a little talk in how to deal with it. The young players 
had to start believing in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"And now we care about each other a lot more than we did." 
</P>
<P>
Kearny has won six straight since that troubled eighth week after La Jolla. The 
biggest victory of all may have come its second-round 14-13 playoff victory 
Nov. 23, when Diato and the six underclassmen that surround him on defense 
stopped a late drive by San Marcos before the Knights could get into field-goal 
range. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Komets will face the final test that separates them from their 
preseason goal, a game against defending section champion El Camino, which 
defeated Lincoln, 38-6, in the stadium a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
And although Matson still wore the look of a traumatized coach this week, he 
praised his players for finally putting the Morse defeat and their midseason 
troubles behind them. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids bounced back more than anything," Matson said. "Now we can say it was 
a positive experience. It wasn't fun to live through . . ."

DAVE DISTEL: ORANGE GLEN WILL HAVE A DIFFICULT JOB MAKING NAME FOR ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Orange Glen High School's football team must feel a little like a truck driver 
from a repertory theater in Upper Sandusky who's going on stage with an Olivier 
or a Burton. 
</P>
<P>
If Saturday's CIF 3-A football championship game was a party, the poor Patriots 
would be the hors d'oeuvres . . . or ashtrays. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows someone other than Morse High School will be on the field at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, but no one knows exactly who that might be. What's 
more, it's as if it really doesn't make much difference. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen has to hope it can make one or two fans nudge their neighbors and 
ask, "Say, who are those other guys?" 
</P>
<P>
You see, Orange Glen came out of what might be called The Other Bracket in the 
3-A semifinals. This was roughly equivalent of coming out of the AFC 
championship game into the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It was kind of a lose-lose deal, meaning the loser got to go home and the 
winner had to be high school's version of the Denver Broncos against the 49ers. 
This was like winning the lottery and being told you had to go into that cage 
and take the money away from the tiger. 
</P>
<P>
Figuratively, Orange Glen is up against Tigers, assuming Morse's nickname 
should be taken in a mere figurative sense. Maybe this case deserves a more 
literal definition. 
</P>
<P>
There is talk, you see, that this Morse team is the greatest ever to roam the 
county's landscape. You get that kind of rhetoric when a team has won 13 
straight games and scored points at the rate of better than one a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Among teams in The Times' final San Diego County Top 10, Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 
have fallen to Morse by an average score of 39-15. It also played four other 
playoff teams and scored 56, 57, 44 and 57 points. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it played the best 1990 had to offer . . . and pummeled them 
all mercilessly. Ominously, Orange Glen came to the playoffs unranked. 
</P>
<P>
Having heard about this awesome Morse team, I went to watch a late-season game 
at Point Loma. This figured to be a good test because Point Loma was ranked No. 
2 at the time. It lost, 40-13, and remained No. 2. After all, there is no shame 
in being routed by Morse. 
</P>
<P>
My initial reaction after that game was that Morse could not be that good 
because it did not seem to have an appreciable passing attack. Upon further 
reflection, I concluded that giving Morse a passing attack would be like 
putting wings on a bull elephant. 
</P>
<P>
Why bother? 
</P>
<P>
If Morse could pass, it wouldn't be in the CIF 3-A championship game. It would 
be in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, who says Morse cannot pass? 
</P>
<P>
It has this quarterback with a cuddly name who seems to be able to do whatever 
might be his pleasure. Teddy Lawrence threw all of 48 passes, seven for 
touchdowns, in 10 regular-season games. When a team is winning games by such 
wide margins, there is etiquette in not passing. 
</P>
<P>
What Lawrence does best, other than gentlemanly not passing, is run. He 
averaged 19 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence is also Morse's punter. Somebody, of course, had to be designated 
Morse's punter, and it may as well have been the homecoming queen for all the 
Tigers had to punt. On those few occasions when Lawrence dropped back to punt, 
opponents prayed for good snaps so he would not do something improvisational . 
. . like run. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence has no intention of playing quarterback in college, because he stands 
5-9 and weighs 175 pounds and aspires to play in the National Football League. 
He knows there will be little call for quarterbacks of that physical stature in 
the NFL. Thus, he hopes to continue his career as a college running back or 
wide receiver or defensive back. Playing quarterback in college, to him, would 
be like majoring in graphic arts to prepare for a career in stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Lawrence isn't even Morse's most prolific running back. That would be 
Gary Taylor, a surprisingly punishing wisp of a mere 165 pounds. Lawrence is 
the dancer, and Taylor is the grinder. 
</P>
<P>
The two of them do their work behind people such as Salua Poutoa, who looks 
like a mesa with legs. He stands 6-0 and weighs 300 pounds. You could build 
condos on this guy. A sharp-eyed developer would sell his shoulders as view 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
Poutoa has a sidekick in the line named John Moe, and there's a whole lot of 
Moe, too. He weighs 270 pounds, spread slightly more thinly over a 6-2 frame. 
He plans to go to the Naval Academy, where he will study to be an aircraft 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
There is more to these guys than just these guys, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
The fellow who has put this all together is John Shacklett, a veteran coach who 
has this nervous sideline habit of neatly folding little pieces of tape and 
either chewing them or eating them. I couldn't be sure. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Shacklett is making a habit of getting whatever he has in a given 
year into the championship game. He could almost make his reservations a year 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, John Shacklett is a little evasive about just where this team 
might rank among the county's all-time great teams. He knows it is a little 
stupid to try to make such assessments. 
</P>
<P>
All he hopes is that Morse is San Diego County's best team this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Other Team will try to have a say in the matter. What was the name again?

SOCKERS DUO WORKING WITH USSF ON WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States Soccer Federation has recruited two members of the San Diego 
Socker hierarchy to aid this country's preparation for the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Sockers Coach Ron Newman will serve on the coaching committee, and Randy 
Bernstein, the club's vice-president, will sit on the finance/resource 
development committee. 
</P>
<P>
The coaching committee had its first conference call Tuesday. Newman is the 
only representative from the professional ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing," Newman said, "is I and our league are being recognized as part 
and parcel of soccer in this country. In the past it was 'Oh, they're from that 
indoor league.' We weren't associated with (the USSF). It got to be very much 
college-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
The coaching committee will be in charge of reviewing and establishing 
licensing requirements and curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
The finance committee is scheduled to meet for the first time in January. Its 
prime focus will be on marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about having input," Bernstein said, "because I think I have a 
feel for the buying habits of both the public and of commercial sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein worked with USSF President Alan Rothenberg when both were with the 
NBA Clippers in the early 1980s. The two remain friends, and during the summer 
Bernstein helped persuade Major Soccer League owners to give the USSF new 
direction by voting out former President Werner Fricker in favor of Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
While Newman is excited about taking part in the development of outdoor soccer, 
he is also upbeat about a development that is occuring in the indoor game: MSL 
teams are playing overseas exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, when Baltimore on Tuesday defeated Oldham Athletic, 6-1, in 
Manchester, England, it was bittersweet for Newman. 
</P>
<P>
He says the eight-time champions should have a chance to trumpet the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Newman spent last year trying to get in touch with Andy Williams, an English 
Football League official who helped arrange Baltimore's trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I called him, sent letters to him, talked to his secretary, but he never got 
back to me," Newman said. "Now that the Blast beat Oldham, I'll have to write 
to him and tell him, 'Good thing you didn't get the champions over there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Newman is also somewhat bitter that St. Louis was chosen over the Sockers to go 
to Zurich, Switzerland, for a FIFA-sponsored indoor tournament in early 
January. FIFA is footing St. Louis' bill. 
</P>
<P>
The Storm was picked, Newman said, because owner Milan Mandaric last year tried 
to arrange a European trip for his club that was thwarted by Commissioner Earl 
Foreman because of scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
Newman believes that Foreman made it up to Mandaric by selecting St. Louis for 
the Swiss tournament. Mandaric did not deny that. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I even came into the league, I told Earl I had interest in playing in 
one of the European tournaments," Mandaric said. "And I tried to get something 
done last year, but couldn't because of scheduling difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"So when this came up this year, my desire was known." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Newman is unhappy about the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"That really ticks me off," he said. "I thought it was a little unfair. There 
have been a few teams, Dallas, Baltimore and us, that have been trying really 
hard to take trips to Europe. We've been doing it quietly, and we didn't go 
through the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to take our team to Europe. We've made this game a science, and 
we're put down all over Europe. I just wanted to go over there and kick some 
butt." 
</P>
<P>
Europe may not be the only destination of MSL teams this year. Dallas has been 
invited to Japan, and Newman is working on a home-and-away series between the 
Sockers and a Mexican club. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he has been asked to conduct a seminar in Mexico City for 150 
teams. The seminar, originally scheduled for earlier this month, has been 
postponed until the middle of January. 
</P>
<P>
When and if he does make it down there, Newman said he will attempt to arrange 
the exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why we can't do a swap," Newman said. "We'll play down there, and 
they'll play up here." 
</P>
<P>
A league source said Baltimore has signed national team goalie Tony Meola. 
</P>
<P>
Meola, who became the hero of an impotent U.S. team during World Cup qualifying 
last year and led it to the finals in Italy, had been playing with Watford 
(England), a last-place second division team which likely will drop down to the 
third division next season. 
</P>
<P>
Blast officials could not be reached in England, but a USSF spokesman said 
Meola has been released by Watford. 
</P>
<P>
Another league source said that the Blast earlier this season arranged a deal 
with Meola, but could not work out a loan agreement with the USSF. Meola is 
under contract to the USSF's national team until Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers made a goaltender move of their own Wednesday, releasing 
developmental player Chris Wilson and signing Savva Biller to a developmental 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Biller has no indoor experience, but Newman called him a natural goalkeeper. He 
spent six months recently training in England with Peter Shelton, considered 
one of the top goalies in the world.

AZTEC VOLLEYBALL TEAM PLANS TO GIVE STANFORD THE FULL SERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way Rudy Suwara sees things, every team still alive in the NCAA women's 
volleyball playoffs is 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the reasons Suwara believes his San Diego State team can upset 
Stanford at 8:30 tonight in a West Region semifinal at UCLA's John Wooden 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU (24-11) is the sixth-seeded team in the region. Stanford (26-3) is seeded 
second. Top-seeded UCLA (32-1) plays No. 4 New Mexico (22-6) in the other 
semifinal at 6:30 p.m. The winners play Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford's real good, but in this tournament, they're 1-0 just like us," 
Suwara said. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU became 1-0 by upsetting third-seeded Brigham Young, 3-1, last Friday at 
BYU in the first round. Stanford, whose only losses this year were to UCLA 
(twice) and Pacific, advanced easily over No. 7 Wyoming, 3-0. SDSU has not 
played the Cardinal this season but leads the series 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing in our favor is we've got one of the best-serving teams in the 
nation," Suwara said. "We have Gracie Schutt, who some people think is the 
hardest server that's ever been in women's volleyball on the college level. 
We've got Sandy Thompson, who also hits a hard spinning serve. We've got Angela 
Martin and Kim Lester, who hit really tough flip serves. 
</P>
<P>
"We think our serving, hopefully, will rattle Stanford and throw their passing 
off. If we can throw their passing off, we can play with anybody. That was our 
game plan against BYU, and that's our game plan against Stanford." JIM LINDGREN

NELLCOR MOVING PLANT FROM THE BAY AREA TO CHULA VISTA 
</P>

<P>
Nellcor, a manufacturer of hospital patient monitoring equipment, announced it 
is moving all its remaining manufacturing operations to Chula Vista from 
Hayward, a move that will cause the layoffs of 160 of its San Francisco Bay 
Area employees. 
</P>
<P>
The move will complete a shift of manufacturing capacity to the San 
Diego-Tijuana area that Nellcor began four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company already has a Chula Vista plant as well as a Tijuana maquiladora 
employing 450 workers where the disposable parts of its instruments are 
assembled. 
</P>
<P>
Nellcor, whose principal product is a pulse oximeter, a device that measures 
the oxygen in a patient's blood, will soon move into a 90,000-square-foot plant 
in Chula Vista now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Nellcor is one of many medical instrument and product firms that have moved to 
the San Diego-Tijuana area in the last few years to take advantage of low-cost 
Mexican labor, said Michael Smith, a real estate broker with John Burnham &amp; 
Co. in downtown San Diego who represented Nellcor in its Chula Vista 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
A publicly owned company, Nellcor has increased its sales from $46 million in 
1986 to $142 million for the fiscal year ended last June 30. Its blood oximeter 
was one of the first devices to measure blood oxygen on a real-time basis, 
enabling hospital clinicians to avoid the time-consuming process of sending 
blood samples to laboratories for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Nellcor will keep its administrative headquarters in Hayward, where, after the 
layoffs, the company will still retain 320 employees. About 80% of those losing 
their jobs are manufacturing workers, and the rest are administrative 
employees, said Michael Downey, Nellcor's chief financial officer.

UNION STAGES NORDSTROM DEMONSTRATIONS IN 6 CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A union's prolonged war with the Nordstrom department store chain in Washington 
state spilled into Los Angeles, San Diego and three other cities Thursday, with 
demonstrations intended to pressure Nordstrom into signing a new labor 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The negative publicity campaign, coordinated by the international office of the 
1.3-million-member United Food and Commercial Workers Union, was timed to make 
a dent in Nordstrom's holiday sales. 
</P>
<P>
The old contract between UFCW Local 1001 and six Nordstrom stores in the 
Seattle-Tacoma area expired in mid-1989. Since then, the two sides have been 
unable to come to terms on a new pact. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Local 1001 has accused Nordstrom of encouraging sales 
associates to perform many of the chain's famed customer-service activities on 
their own time. Since the workers are paid by the hour, such practices would be 
illegal. Washington state labor officials have sided with the union, and many 
workers have confirmed the allegations in interviews with newspaper reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-Tacoma area is the only part of the country in which the 63-store 
chain's sales associates are unionized. Thursday's demonstrations were held at 
the Nordstrom stores in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Ore., 
and Tysons Corner, Va. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, a rally sponsored by UF&amp;CL Local 135 drew about 75 people to 
Nordstrom's Fashion Valley store, according to Local 135 President Tom 
Vandeveld. 
</P>
<P>
At the rally, one former Nordstrom employee from San Diego "complained about 
the fact that the company still (forces employees) to work off the clock," said 
Vandeveld. 
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose was to bring attention to the fact that the off-the-clock business 
is still going on even though (Nordstrom executives) claimed they won't be 
doing it anymore," Vandeveld said. 
</P>
<P>
While some Nordstrom employees elsewhere in the country are represented by 
unions, Local 135 does not represent any San Diego-based employees of the 
store, Vandeveld said. "We've had inquiries (from employees), and it seems to 
me there's a lot of dissatisfaction," he said. "But we've not made any attempt 
to organize" in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A Nordstrom spokesman said persistent union criticism of the store is an unfair 
attack on the company's "entrepreneurial environment," in which successful 
sales associates can earn substantial commissions. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Nordstrom employees in Washington state who are opposed to union 
representation have mounted a campaign to decertify Local 1001. However, that 
effort was stalled earlier this year when the union complained to the National 
Labor Relations Board that Nordstrom was illegally assisting the employees. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom last month agreed in a settlement with the NLRB to refrain from 
showing preferential treatment to employees involved in the decertification 
campaign.

Speaking Up: Gennady I. Gerasimov, whose statements of "new thinking" in Soviet 
foreign policy made him a familiar figure on the world stage, will be presented 
the National Assn. of Government Communicators' "communicator of the year" 
award tonight in Washington, D.C. Gerasimov, 60, chief spokesman for the Soviet 
Foreign Ministry, is the first-ever foreign recipient of the award. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking Out: It was the not-so haunting theme from the old "Andy Griffith 
Show" that led police in Ft. Walton Beach, Fla., to Coco the stolen cockatiel 
and his alleged abductor, Frankie LaDel, 20. Coco was lifted Monday during a 
home burglary, along with $100 in change and $4,715 worth of camera gear, 
electronics equipment, jewelry, shoes and food. The next day, patrolman Jim 
Walker heard the unmistakable strains of the tune, punctuated by squawks, 
coming from a local tattoo parlor and remembered that the report on the 
birdnaping mentioned it was one of the bird's specialties. LaDel was located 
and arrested nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Animals: Britain's Prince Philip stopped briefly at Orly Airport 
outside Paris Thursday to inaugurate an exposition of the World Wildlife Fund. 
The exhibit will be on view at Orly Airport until Jan. 15, during which time 
passengers at both Orly and at Charles de Gaulle Airport can place their coins 
into a transparent globe of the world held up by a model of a panda, the World 
Wildlife Fund's emblem.

The Eyes Have It: Mademoiselle magazine looked into the eyes of some 
celebrities and learned quite a bit. A behavioral analyst says that Tom 
Cruise's left eye is bigger than the right one, showing a sense of 
spirituality, while Julia Roberts' long eyebrows mean she is artistic and 
independent. Warren Beatty's eyes reveal that he lacks commitment, and Anjelica 
Huston's powerful gaze says that she is straightforward while Meryl Streep's 
shows intelligence and dedication to family. Paul Newman's trademark blue eyes 
haven't faded, a sign of good health.

With the school year in high gear, it's a good time to consider new additions 
to children's home reference libraries. 
</P>
<P>
For children ages 8 to 14, there is the new "The Kids' World Almanac of the 
United States" (Pharos-World Almanac; $14.95 hardcover, $6.95 soft-cover), with 
the history, facts and trivia about each of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
This easy-to-use reference book features brief sketches of each state's origin 
and how it became part of the United States. Also included: state capitals, 
geography, symbols, special state events and attractions -- and just plain 
trivia. 
</P>
<P>
For example: In Oklahoma, it is against the law to get a fish drunk. Montana 
was named from the Spanish word for mountainous, which originated in the Latin 
montanus. The first capital of Utah was Filmore (1851-1856); Salt Lake City was 
selected in 1856. 
</P>
<P>
The almanac was written by Thomas G. Aylesworth. John Lane's informative and 
amusing illustrations highlight each chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Also new from Pharos-World Almanac: "The World Almanac InfoPedia," a 
single-volume visual encyclopedia designed for ages 8 to 16. It covers history, 
science, animal life, art, sports, language and more. It was compiled by 
Theodore Rowland-Entwistle and Jean Cooke ($17.95 hardcover, $8.95 soft-cover). 
</P>
<P>
The InfoPedia contains 12 chapters, each of which is divided into appropriate 
sections with relevant information about the topic. For example, the 
Communications chapter includes terms in the history of writing, a chronology 
of printing, key dates in telegraphy and photography, and radio and TV facts. 
</P>
<P>
The book has black-and-white illustrations, and also includes a world atlas and 
flags of the world in full color. 
</P>
<P>
Pharos-World Almanac also publishes Aylesworth's "The Kids' World Almanac of 
Baseball"; "The Kids' World Almanac of Animals and Pets" by Deborah Felder; and 
"The Kids' World Almanac of Records and Facts" and "The Second Kids' World 
Almanac of Records and Facts" by Margo McLoone-Basta and Alice Siegel (all 
available in soft-cover, $6.95 each). 
</P>
<P>
"The Doubleday Children's Encyclopedia," designed for youngsters 7 to 11, 
bridges the gap between single-subject picture books and formal reference 
books. The four-volume set, edited by John Paton and Roberta Wiener, is indexed 
and cross-referenced, and contains more than 2,000 color illustrations 
($69.95). 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 entries cover presidents and world leaders, geography, health 
and biology, space, politics, nature, history and social issues. There are 
brief summaries of basic statistics, colorful charts, maps and diagrams. 
Detailed photo captions augment the main text. Simple home experiments are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Also of note: 
</P>
<P>
"The Lost Wreck of the Isis" by Robert Ballard is the latest adventure in the 
Time Quest Series from Scholastic-Madison Press ($15.95 hardcover). 
</P>
<P>
Designed for children 8 to 12, it tells the story of Ballard's 1988 discovery 
of an ancient Roman shipwreck deep in the Mediterranean Sea. Ballard and his 
team explored the 20-mile wreck site with Jason, a high-tech, deep-water robot. 
</P>
<P>
"Exploring the Titanic," the story of Ballard's discovery of the R.M.S. 
Titanic, was the first in the Time Quest series. Ballard is a senior scientist 
at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Each Time Quest book focuses on a recent scientific discovery, using 
easy-to-understand text, full-color photographs, illustrations and paintings. 
Upcoming titles include: Ballard's "Exploring the Bismarck," "The Spirit of 
Columbus" by John Dyson, "The Secrets of Vesuvius" by Sara Bisel, and "The Lost 
Expedition" by Owen Beattie and John Geiger.

Seven South Bay residents and a Long Beach man have been honored for their 
suggestions on ways to improve traffic, mobility and transportation in Los 
Angeles. They are among 90 people whose ideas were selected by a panel of nine 
judges in a contest sponsored by the RTD, the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestions ranged from providing tax incentives for ride-sharing (Robert 
Chirpin, Hermosa Beach) and posting of laminated route maps and timetables at 
bus stops (Cheryl E. Dent, Rancho Palos Verdes) to urging the Coroner's 
Department to shorten investigative time on freeway fatalities. Willis C. 
Hendrick of Long Beach noted: "This is a necessary job, but whatever can be 
done to minimize freeway closures would be a big help." The other South Bay 
residents honored are Sandy Quine of Manhattan Beach, Pauline Shea of El 
Segundo, Ernie H. Valdovinos of Redondo Beach and Dora Beale and Olga Polk of 
El Segundo, who jointly suggested that the RTD offer "a systemwide map printed 
on quality paper so it can be carried and frequently handled without falling 
apart."

Love Letters to Screen: A. R. Gurney's intimate, two-character play "Love 
Letters" is also going Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The popular play is set for a movie version, to be produced for Columbia 
Pictures by Leonard Goldberg and Martin Starger. No cast has been announced. 
Gurney's agent, Gilbert Parker, said that the playwright, who wrote "The 
Cocktail Hour" and who has never before sold a play for a feature film 
adaptation, will not be involved in the project. "Love Letters," which is 
currently playing in Beverly Hills, with Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker of 
"L.A. Law," is unusual for its constantly changing casts. It has played in 25 
American cities and internationally. CLAUDIA PUIG

Vanilligate Continues: The lead singer of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears filed a 
$120-million copyright-infringement lawsuit against Milli Vanilli on Thursday, 
claiming the scandal-beset lip-syncing duo stole the melody from his 1960s hit 
"Spinning Wheel" and turned it into their rap-infused song "All or Nothing." 
"This lawsuit is about the song they never wrote on the album they never sang," 
said Robert Marcus, a lawyer who filed the suit in state Supreme Court in 
Manhattan on behalf of singer David Clayton-Thomas.CLAUDIA PUIG

Show Will Go On: The daughters of slain civil-rights leader Martin Luther King 
Jr. and black activist Malcolm X have decided to keep a scheduled date to 
perform in a musical play at the University of Arizona on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Arizona voters rejected a referendum that would have created a paid 
state holiday honoring King. The vote triggered a nationwide reaction. A 
spokesman said Wednesday that Yolanda King and Attallah Shabbazz, daughter of 
Malcolm X, would perform their musical play, "Stepping Into Tomorrow." CLAUDIA

Paradise Cinema: "Cinema Paradiso," one of the most commercially successful 
foreign-language films ever released in the United Sates, is going to be remade 
as an American movie. New York-based Miramax Films, which picked up the Italian 
picture following its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival last year, has 
obtained the rights to a remake from producer Franco Cristaldi and 
writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore. 
</P>
<P>
Miramax President Harvey Weinstein said that the remake will be reset in the 
U.S., but will not be directed by Tornatore. No other creative decisions have 
been made. "Cinema Paradiso," which stars Mario Leonardi and tells the story of 
a young boy's love affair with movies in a small Sicilian village, won this 
year's Oscar for best foreign-language film and, still in release after 44 
weeks, has grossed more than $11 million. CLAUDIA PUIG

'ROOKIE': EASTWOOD SERVES UP WARMED-OVER COMPOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a moment early on in "The Rookie" where Clint Eastwood, playing a 
grizzled, combative cop named Nick Pulovski, looks over at Sonia Braga and 
mutters, "They don't make 'em like that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The moment could just as easily apply to Eastwood himself. At least that's what 
he seems to be banking on here. Who else besides Eastwood freaks would want to 
see this bummer? As a cop thriller, "The Rookie" (citywide) is sub-par even by 
TV series standards. As a buddy movie -- Eastwood, who also directed, is paired 
with Charlie Sheen -- it's one more tired entry in an already terminally 
fatigued genre. Even as an Eastwood vehicle -- an appropriate term for a movie 
about a cutthroat car-theft ring -- the film is a warmed-over compost. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the lethally enticing Braga and a few of second-unit director Buddy 
Van Horn's car-crash set pieces, the film (rated R for violence and strong 
language) has almost nothing to recommend it. Unless, of course, your idea of a 
good time is watching people being plugged continually between the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is an excuse to string together as much mayhem as possible. Nick 
Pulovski is a direct-action kind of guy, and the movie is molded to his manias. 
When his first partner is blown away by the car-theft honchos, Nick's vengeance 
is unleashed. His new partner, David Ackerman (Sheen), is, of course, 
everything Nick isn't -- polite, well-dressed, thoughtful -- but it turns out 
he also harbors his own restless soul (big surprise). David, it turns out, has 
a shadowy past, which, in the Eastwood universe, means you were brought up with 
money and manners and the ability to read. 
</P>
<P>
The universe also includes the usual pulp polarities. The two cops' excursions 
into East Los Angeles are heavy on the Mexican xenophobia; the biker bars and 
pit-bull matches might have come out of a Cheech &amp; Chong fever dream. 
</P>
<P>
It comes as a surprise, then, that the leader of the car-theft ring, played by 
none other than Raul Julia, is supposed to be German. I'm all for 
cross-cultural casting but, despite the best efforts of the dialogue coach, 
Julia is about as German as Ruben Blades. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, what Eastwood does in this film seems hopelessly recidivist, 
right down to the "dumb Pole" stereotyping of his own character. Still, you've 
got to hand it to him. Making this film's chief villain German seems hopelessly 
outdated, but maybe Eastwood is on to something. In the search for 
post-glasnost era movie meanies, the Germans could be staging a comeback. 
Eastwood, in his Dirty Harry heyday, used to beat up on psychopathic hippies. 
Now he's hot for the Huns.

'MARIA'S STORY' IS SALVADOR'S STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Maria's Story" (Monica 4-Plex), an example of the documentary at its most 
illuminating and succinct, introduces us to a remarkable and engaging woman, a 
dynamic 39-year-old Salvadoran peasant -- a wife and mother of three who has 
become a charismatic guerrilla leader. 
</P>
<P>
Short and stocky, possessed of an inner radiance, a ready wit, a healing touch, 
a strong intellect and matter-of-fact common sense, Maria Serrano is a kind of 
ultimate earth mother, a natural poet who can compare the flowering of 
revolution with giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
Once we've made her acquaintance, felt her impact and been given a sense of her 
constantly roving -- and highly dangerous -- daily life, filmmakers Monona Wall 
and Pamela Cohen follow her on a visit to her hometown, Arcatao, which becomes 
a journey into the past that allows us to see how a farmer's wife was 
transformed into an implacable rebel. As we approach the ruins of what was once 
an attractive mountain community of 10,000, now reduced to a 1,000, 
black-and-white flash cuts of archival footage reveal its systematic 
destruction by the military. 
</P>
<P>
It was here that as a child Maria, in her hunger for education that her family 
could not afford, agreed to sit on the floor of the local school so that she 
might learn. It was here that she met and married her husband Jose, to whom she 
remains passionately devoted, and later was forced to hear the shrieks of the 
tortured from the nearby headquarters of the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Although on the move since the destruction of Arcatao in early 1979, Maria did 
not formally join the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) until 
1987, the same year that her eldest daughter was killed in an ambush. "If you 
adopt the armed struggle it's because you have no other choice," she says, 
"when you see the possibility of saving your life you save it, and if that 
means picking up a gun, you pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
Maria herself observes that her story is the story of the Salvadoran guerrilla 
movement, and in giving it shape and meaning, the filmmakers, which include the 
graceful cinematographer John Knoop, confront us with our country's 
responsibility in the ongoing ordeal of Maria and her people while taking us 
way beyond political rhetoric. Maria insists that the Salvadoran civil war is 
not a struggle between the East and West -- i.e., communism vs. capitalism. 
Rather, it's about "not having enough to eat, not having a roof over your head 
and not having justice." The sobering end crawl of "Maria's Story" (Times-rated 
Mature) states that the United States has given the Salvadoran government $4.5 
billion to try to crush the FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
The 53-minute "Maria's Story" is effectively complemented by "Graffiti," 
Matthew Patrick'sq 28-minute 1986 Oscar-nominated adaptation of a Julio 
Cortazar story. In a shining display of pure visual narrative, Patrick tells us 
of a young man (E. J. Castillo) in an unnamed South American country under 
military rule, who daringly taunts the regime with his liberation slogans 
painted on walls during the dark of night. In the course of his activities he 
encounters another artist, a young woman (Ivy Broya), as elusive as he, who 
sketches in pastels whimsical surreal images. An American Film Institute 
production, "Graffiti," beautifully shot by Zoli Vidor, emerges as a romantic 
political parable, as powerful as it is poetic.

'KARMA' SKEWERS YUPPIES NICELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are countless young people trying to make their mark in the motion 
picture and television industries who will identify with the Angst-ridden hero 
of "Instant Karma" (Regent, Westwood), yet what fledgling writer-producers 
Bruce A. Taylor and Dale Rosenbaum have to say applies to every yuppie on the 
make. 
</P>
<P>
A modestly budgeted independent venture picked up by MGM/UA, "Instant Karma" 
can't be expected to have the incisiveness and polish of a "Network," but it 
has substance and rigor and unfolds with a wit and insight that holds attention 
and commands respect. Film school alumnae Taylor and Rosenbaum, and their 
feature-debuting director, Roderick Taylor, -- a TV veteran who is also a poet, 
singer and composer; he is heard effectively on the soundtrack -- are off to a 
solid start on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
Refreshingly, their film is not another saga of show-biz struggles but a 
parable on the perils of illusory early success. Writer-producer Zane Smith 
(Craig Sheffer) would seem to have it all -- at least for the moment: a TV 
series that's among the top 10, a luxurious home in the Hollywood Hills and a 
brand-new bright red Mercedes convertible. The house and the car, of course, 
aren't paid for, and as for the series, it's not exactly what Zane had 
originally envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
What Zane has ended up giving the network is something called "Rock 'n' Roll 
P.I.," in which the lead actor, known simply as Reno (David Cassidy), is a rock 
star by night and a private eye by day. His sidekick is his foster father 
(William Smith), a retired cop. Zane is too smart not to feel he's hit it big 
more by luck than talent and has a tough time telling himself he hasn't sold 
out. Making matters worse, he's up for an IRS audit, his girlfriend has left 
him, and Reno, deep into a coke habit, is becoming increasingly egomaniacal. 
The only bright spot on Zane's horizon is a beautiful aspiring young actress 
(Chelsea Noble), uncomplicated and down-to-earth. 
</P>
<P>
The filmmakers are at their most assured and sophisticated in the "Rock 'n' 
Roll P.I." sequences. The series concept is meant to strike you as ludicrous, 
but glimpses of it persuade that it could actually go over on TV. This is very 
fine-tuned satire, with Cassidy a scene-stealer as the thoroughly rotten Reno, 
smarmy on camera and nasty off, and Smith amusing as his long-suffering 
co-star. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the film work, however, is Sheffer, who is also the film's 
co-executive producer. He is able to show us the underlying decency in Zane, 
whose self-absorption borders on the total and whose immaturity is 
considerable. Foiling Zane with an increasingly nagging conscience is Glenn 
Hirsch's sharp, on-the-button portrayal of his cynical writing partner, who 
says of writing for TV that it "doesn't matter whether it's good or bad, just 
as long as you get the bread." 
</P>
<P>
That's a remark that could never be applied to "Instant Karma" (rated R for sex 
and language), which probably won't make much money -- it has no hard action, 
big names or high gloss -- but was made with a caring integrity.

STAGE BEAT: HYPNOTIC FOCUS ON RURAL POOR IN 'MUD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not easy for the urban mind to conceive the reality of the bitterly 
disenfranchised world of Maria Irene Fornes' "Mud," at Waterfront Stage. But 
for those of us who have seen that world first-hand, it's all too real. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the hills of Appalachia, the three-character drama focuses on the 
hopeless quest of a young woman named Mae to educate and free herself from the 
shackles of ignorance and oppression that bind her endlessly in the futility of 
false dreams. She goes to school but isn't beyond the simplest rudiments of the 
three R's. 
</P>
<P>
Mae is also hog-tied to Lloyd, a boy her father brought home years ago to keep 
her company. "Like animals," she says, when they were old enough to "mate" -- 
they did. Lloyd is now riddled with infection and his resulting impotence is 
like a stake driven between them. Enter Henry, to drive the stake further. 
</P>
<P>
"Mud" creates an uneasiness in the mind, but it's the uneasiness of recognizing 
counterparts outside its primitive setting. The mud in which Mae is sinking 
still seeps into the lives of America's uneducated. The expert delineation of 
motifs and moods in Frederique Michel's direction helps settle this uneasiness 
in the hypnotic warmth of the production. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is an immeasurable part of the effect. Katherine Burke's marvelous 
honesty and power as Mae are excellent counterpoint to the delicious naivete of 
John Blevins' beautifully modulated Lloyd. Duane Whitaker unfailingly reads the 
simpleton's pomposity in Henry's sense of superiority in the trio's colorful 
dance of death. 
</P>
<P>
"Mud," Waterfront Stage, 250 Santa Monica Pier, Fridays-Sundays, 8 p.m. 
Indefinitely. "12.50; (213) 393-6672. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Candles' Waxes Poetic as 'Carlotta' 
</P>
<P>
Wallace Stevens' 1919 theater-piece "Carlos Among the Candles" translates well 
into "Carlotta," the opening one-act in the Fountain Theatre's "Alone." Under 
Leslie Paxton's taut direction, Deborah Lawlor is intricate and imposing as a 
lonely soul who finds visions of her self-imposed psychic estrangement in the 
dim flickering of mesmerizing candles. 
</P>
<P>
The poetic brevity and scope of "Carlotta" makes an interesting contrast to the 
longer "Lit 305," which follows. Ralph Hunt's one-man play zeroes in on another 
private world, that of Prof. Feeney, a poetry instructor whose life is falling 
apart and has left him to hold on to his last iamb for dear life. We watch his 
final class as he injects among his few remaining students his deep, 
debilitating fears of failure in life. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Mason is monumental as Feeney, his quick glances at his students and the 
anger in his physical movements illuminating the character as much as his 
words. This compelling performance is directed by Guy Giarrizzo. 
</P>
<P>
"Alone," Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood; Tuesdays-Wednesdays, 
8 p.m. Ends Dec. 11. $12; (213) 663-1525 TDD (213) 663-2235. Running time: 1 
hour, 35 minutes.

Rites of Passage for a Gay Chicano 
</P>
<P>
Growing up gay and Chicano is bad enough -- but Luis Alfaro did it in Boyle 
Heights. Fortunately he had a couple of cholos as guardian angels. They're only 
two of the characters that populate Alfaro's memories, characters which he 
views with the exact, discerning eye of a poet. 
</P>
<P>
In his performance piece "Downtown," Alfaro digs into his formative years for 
the building blocks of his personality, and it's a tasty selection of images, 
from his rotating electric Virgin Mary that turned on its pedestal to bless the 
whole room, to the night his mother broke taboos and dragged his father from a 
neighborhood bar, to his image of Lupe -- an illegal alien who slaves all week 
at a sewing machine to dance in splendor on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Dennison's direction is imaginative and forthright, and the one quibble 
would be that Alfaro hasn't given himself enough time to expand the images that 
flash too quickly across the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown," Highways Performance Space, 1651 18 St., Santa Monica; 
Friday-Sunday, 8:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $10; (213) 453-1755. Running time: 1 
hour.

Snappy Satire at the blak &amp; bloo 
</P>
<P>
After a delightful satire on the opening numbers of musical revues, the cast of 
"Cut to the Chase" promises not to do that kind of show. Then they go ahead and 
do that kind of show, right on the tiny stage at blak &amp; bloo. 
</P>
<P>
Most of it is charming, some of it is funny, and the cast of five sparkles. 
Most of the sparkle comes from Judy Nazemetz and Rick Crom. Both are good in a 
familiar sketch about a restaurant where the waiters sing opera -- and so do 
the customers -- in which Crom has a hilarious operatic death aria after 
stabbing himself. His characters throughout are funny and dead on, particularly 
in the quickies "Dean Martin Forgets" and as a Bogart Santa testifying in "The 
Candy Cane Mutiny." Nazemetz breaks the place up with her incisive portrait of 
a soused employee bemoaning Christmas in general and her office party in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
If all the sketches (by Crom and Mike Colasuonno) aren't laugh-getters, the 
original score by Crom is, and it fills in the gaps brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
"Cut to the Chase," blak &amp; bloo, 7574 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood; 
Wednesdays-Thursdays, 8 p.m. Ends Dec. 20. $7.50 (two drink minimum); (213) 
876-1120. Running time: 1 hour. 10 minutes.

'Firing Chamber' an Exercise in Banality 
</P>
<P>
The script of David Matzke's "The Firing Chamber," a play about untalented 
pseudo-artists in L.A., should have been left in the artists' studio when it 
was burned down for the insurance money. Even two directors (Jim Holmes and 
John Otrin) couldn't pull it together. 
</P>
<P>
The actors don't have any better luck surviving the banality of the writing, 
though one scene between Ron Max (who hammers a lot on a strip of metal trim) 
and Bo Zenga (an "IBM sculptor") does provide a wonderful lesson in how boring 
Method acting can be when no shred of technique is involved. 
</P>
<P>
The "art" provided by Tim Callahan for the central character's "gallery 
installation" would be turned down by a yard sale. 
</P>
<P>
"The Firing Chamber," Coast Playhouse, 8325 Santa Monica Blvd.; 
Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m.; matinee Sun., 3 p.m. Ends Dec. 23. $10-$12; (213)

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: AN OLIVE FOR THE TERMINALLY COOL 
</P>

<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week, the hippest restaurant in Los Angeles is called Olive, or The Olive, 
depending on whom you ask. Last week, it was known as Tiny's, which was 
appropriate because the restaurant is run by the people who put together the 
grunge-hip Hollywood bar Small's. (Also, the restaurant is tiny -- just a bar 
and fewer than 20 tables.) 
</P>
<P>
One more thing: Tiny's Olive wants to be an underground restaurant, which means 
the phone number is unlisted and when you call, you're politely asked for 
references (vague mumblings about "a friend" usually do). Of course, there is 
no sign on the purposely nondescript building, which once was the Pigalle 
restaurant and is practically in the parking lot of the Farmer's Daughter motel 
across the street from Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Olive, the very cool might munch on a Brie sandwich as the Audrey Horne 
music from "Twin Peaks" plays over the sound system. A deep-toned multicolored 
Harlequin pattern covers some of the walls, paintings of Ghandi, Stalin and 
other world figures are lined above the red leatherette booths. Dress is 
Hollywood-cool, which means that jeans and a sloppy shirt are OK, as long as 
you're the kind of person who can pull off a look like that and still be 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
On the menu are things like pork chops and filet mignon and omelets. One night 
the fish dish might be seared tuna, arranged on the plate like shark fins, 
another night it might be a good piece of salmon. There are vegetable plates 
and a Caesar salad and sandwiches (smoked chicken breast and a 
tomato-mozzarella-and-basil). Not all the food is good, but some of it is, and 
besides, food isn't why most people go to Olive. The chef is Fred Eric, who 
used to cook at the now-defunct Flaming Colossus underground nightclub, so he 
knows his audience.

A SIDE OUT BURGER, CALIFORNIA STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What do you think?" my waitress proudly asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, sure, it's a great hamburger," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said, looking mystified, "what do you think about the place?" 
</P>
<P>
Let's keep things in perspective. Yes, Randy and Sinjin's Side Out does serve 
an excellent burger, half a pound in weight and about half a foot wide. The 
lettuce may be a tiny bit tired and the pickle a little unexpected (a sour dill 
sliced lengthwise), but this is a good beefy handful anyway, which you just 
have to eat kind of fast or the whole-wheat bun will decompose in your hand. 
</P>
<P>
But I doubt many people come here for the food, even on Saturdays, which are 
Buck-a-Burger days. They come because Randy Stoklos and Sinjin Smith are top 
professional volleyball players, and they have seen fit to lend their names to 
this huge El Segundo bar. 
</P>
<P>
My volleyball informants tell me the local players actually boycott the place 
(or at least boycotted it when it opened last summer), because El Segundo is 
the home territory of Stoklos and Smith's chief rivals. No matter; 
non-volleyballers are extensively catered to. Any beachy sport will do -- along 
with the abundant volleyball paraphernalia, there are tables made from 
surfboards and Body Glove stickers pasted here and there on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
People come for the continuous sports videos and the Wednesday night 
invitational knee-volleyball tournaments. Or maybe they come for the pool table 
and the arcade games, or the $1 cocktails on Sunday, or the disco with an 
announcer who gives away Side Out T-shirts. Or maybe they come for a touch of 
class; this is one sports bar where you can buy a shot of any of about 20 
perfumes or colognes in the rest rooms. The puny wine list does offer Dom 
Perignon ($125 a bottle). 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they come for the happy-hour buffet, 4 to 8 p.m. on weekdays, although 
(apart from vegetables and dip) the free eats are not exactly sports training 
food, being mostly pretzels, potato chips, chowder crackers and two hot 
casseroles a night. Some of the casseroles aren't bad (for instance, the 
chicken with onions and bell peppers), but one night I had something stunningly 
vague that might have been scalloped potatoes, or maybe scalloped tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
In our gourmet-conscious age, the house salad is known as "Our Signature 
Salad." To tell the truth, lettuce with grated cheese is not really the most 
distinctive signature in the world; anyway, nobody is claiming the nachos or 
the tostada salad, with their gooey brown chili beef, are anybody's signatures. 
Or the blue cheese-less chicken wings. 
</P>
<P>
However, Side Out does have good oysters and steamed clams, the latter with 
both drawn butter and an intriguing sauce that tastes like clam juices mixed 
with Italian dressing. And there are some pretty good sandwiches. The chicken 
croissant comes with either teriyaki or a (particularly viscous) barbecue sauce 
on the side; the tender steak seems to be served on only one half of a roll, 
but it's hard to tell -- the rest might be down there somewhere under the 
forest of salad stuff and cantaloupe slices. The vegetable croissant sandwich, 
which is mostly mushrooms and sprouts, pales beside them. 
</P>
<P>
There are two desserts to choose from: chocolate-chocolate cake sprinkled with 
walnut or vanilla ice cream -- a full pint of Haagen-Dazs. You know it's a full 
pint because it's served in the carton, with a shot of either Kahlua or 
Amaretto on the side. 
</P>
<P>
One of the volleyballers who dined with me sniffed at the place. "This is just 
what somebody from the Midwest thinks California is like," she said. Hey, it's 
what a lot of Californians think California is like. 
</P>
<P>
Randy and Sinjin's Side Out, 2171 E. Rosecrans Ave., El Segundo; (213) 
640-2727. Lunch and dinner 11 a.m.-2 a.m. Monday-Saturday, noon-2 a.m. Sunday.

ROBERT CRAY'S BURNIN' SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Cray, blues savior, didn't show up at the Universal Amphitheatre on 
Wednesday. But young Bob Cray and his burnin' Memphis soul band sure did. 
</P>
<P>
Cray has made several personnel changes since his last L.A. appearance -- the 
Memphis Horns and guitarist Tim Kaihatsu are now full-time members, along with 
newcomers Kevin Hayes and Jimmy Pugh -- but nearly two hours of Bodyglove-tight 
arrangements and razor-sharp playing Wednesday dispelled any doubt about the 
wisdom of those moves. 
</P>
<P>
That punchy Memphis soul sound has always been an integral component of Cray's 
roots-nouveau style -- particularly his underrated singing -- but it's been 
overshadowed by rock's blues-guitarist fixation since his 1986 breakthrough hit 
"Smoking Gun." But not Wednesday. The soul element was apparent in everything 
from O.V. Wright tapes to the intricately slick licks of the Memphis Horns and 
Cray's feral, gospel-rooted howls on "All These Things." 
</P>
<P>
Cray didn't cut a particularly charismatic figure, but he reached a level of 
stagecraft that projected effectively to the audience. A couple more up-tempo 
barn-burners in the repertoire wouldn't hurt, but the varied assortment of 
kickin', mid-tempo grooves earned a richly deserved standing ovation from the 
better than half-filled house. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed Joe Ely is still searching for the "Smoking Gun" that will enable 
him to match Cray's commercial breakthrough, but his set only sporadically 
connected. Old Ely fans probably found the arrangements of his current quartet 
too monochromatic for the Texan's literate tales, but lead guitarist David 
Grissom brilliantly fused guitar-hero technique with a roots-rocker's economy 
and Keith Richards' chordal surges. DON SNOWDEN

OPERA STARS SHINE IN PBS SPECIAL 'SPIRITUALS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spirituals are one of the most complex of our native art forms. Forged in the 
agonies of slavery, their all-encompassing texts range from exuberant joy to 
deepest pain, at once personal and universal. 
</P>
<P>
The music is equally wide-ranging and, despite drawing on many sources, 
astonishingly fresh and original. As such, spirituals served many singers as 
show-stoppers long before anyone thought of them in terms of "crossover" 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Spirituals as show pieces are the subject of "Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman 
Sing Spirituals," airing tonight on PBS' "Great Performances" (9 p.m., Channels 
28, 15 and 24). Although Marian Anderson provides some roots for the show in 
introductory clips, and Carnegie Hall is even decked out in quasi-church 
fashion, with a large choir in robes and a pew up front for the stars, the 
package is ultimately an entertainment extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
The two stars leave the viewer with no doubts about their personal connection 
to their material, however. Particularly in the introspective songs at the 
center of the 90-minute program, they are both supremely expressive of 
otherworldly ecstasies. 
</P>
<P>
Vocally, Norman and Battle are in peak form, in a true singing spectacular. 
They take risks in making the music immediate in utterly compelling, vivid 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
The repertory is mostly familiar ("Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," "There Is a Balm 
in Gilead," "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands"), in wonderfully varied 
arrangements, such as Battle's chamber jazz number with flutist Hubert Laws and 
harpist Nancy Allen built around "Play on Your Harp, Little David," or the 
starkly dramatic combination of "Calvary" and "He Never Said a Mumblin' Word" 
for Norman and the choir. Accepting the inherently inflated nature of 
spirituals with a full orchestra accompaniment, the numerous arrangers allowed 
the traditional character of the music to emerge readily. 
</P>
<P>
James Levine conducts with accommodating nuance, bouncing on the podium and 
singing along. The large chorus that he formed for the Met production of "Porgy 
and Bess" contributes mighty, occasionally blurred sounds in supporting work. 
</P>
<P>
The production in this video relic from a live concert last March -- with an 
audio recording from Deutsche Grammophon on the way -- seems to aim at 
informality, to the point of pseudo-naive amateurishness. Levine's hand 
flutters across a camera focused on Battle at one point, and the few attempts 
at artifice, such as Norman's face in two split-screen images in "Deep River," 
prove equally awkward.

DREDGING NEAR HARBOR WILL HELP BEACHES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1 million cubic feet of sand will be scooped from the ocean floor 
north of Channel Islands Harbor and piped to two county beaches as part of a 
periodic project to offset erosion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The dredge, pumping around the clock, will remove up to 2,000 cubic feet of 
sand an hour, spitting it out on Silver Strand Beach and areas south of Port 
Hueneme Beach, said Capt. Jack Peveler of the Channel Islands Harbor Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a big water vacuum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sand Bypass Project, expected to begin Wednesday and last until mid-March, 
will require boaters to radio harbor police before passing the 55-foot-wide, 
300-foot-long dredge, Peveler said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1.5 million cubic feet of sand will be removed from an area directly 
north of the harbor and the harbor's main entrance area. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 200,000 cubic feet will be removed from the entrance to Port 
Hueneme, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Western Pacific Dredging, a subsidiary of an Oregon-based company, will do the 
project for the Army Corps of Engineers and the Navy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment scoops the sand with a giant blade, sucks it up and pumps it to 
the beaches through pipes linked for more than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers will block areas of the beach to recondition the sand. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the sand settles, you could get stuck pretty bad," Peveler said. KIRSTEN

MOUND SCHOOL GETS LESSON IN RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAJA RADEVICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five-year-old Michael Cole of Ventura was a member of the disposable society 
until Earth Day hit in April, prompting Michael to change his wasteful ways. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was littler, I drew pictures on paper and then I threw the paper away. 
Now I put the paper in a box to recycle it," the conscientious youngster said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael's interest in preserving the environment led his mother, Debbie Cole, 
to organize a recycling program at Mound School, where Michael attends 
kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
To introduce the 560 students to the program, the school held an assembly 
Monday in which representatives from the city of Ventura told them what can and 
cannot be recycled and what recycled products are used for. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers will keep a recycling bin, donated by a local store, in each classroom 
and will remind students that paper with crayon and marker drawings should be 
put in the bin, while paper with glue on it goes in the trash. In addition, a 
large container will be kept in the cafeteria for lunchtime recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
Mound is the first elementary school to work directly with the city program 
called Waste Alternatives for Ventura's Environment. 
</P>
<P>
The part of the assembly that drew the most "oohs" and "aahs" from 
kindergartners to fifth-graders was when Heidi Whitman, an environmental 
specialist with the Ventura Regional Sanitation District, explained that 
today's used aluminum soda can might be part of the next airplane the students 
fly in; that an empty can of cat food could go toward building their parents' 
next car, and that six plastic bottles can be shredded to make the stuffing for 
one ski jacket. 
</P>
<P>
"My generation was not taught to recycle, we just threw away what we didn't 
use," Debbie Cole said. "But ever since Earth Day, Michael became very 
interested in recycling and turned out to be the watchdog in the family, going 
through the garbage and picking out the cans and paper. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taught my husband and I a lot. That's where I got the idea that if we 
teach the children about saving their environment, they'll take what they know 
home and teach the parents." 
</P>
<P>
And to help teach the new generation the new attitude toward waste, the city of 
Ventura gave each student at Mound school a ruler bearing the motto: "Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle." MAJA RADEVICH

JUDGE CHANGES HIS MIND, ORDERS TRIAL FOR MORTICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that the murder case 
against David Wayne Sconce could go forward, flip-flopping from a tentative 
decision last week to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce, a 34-year-old Pasadena crematory operator, is accused of using oleander 
to poison Timothy Waters, 24, a rival Burbank mortician who died in 1985 after 
becoming seriously ill at his parents' home in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Diamond, Sconce's lawyer, has argued that the case should be handled by 
deputies who are overseen by the district attorney in the county where the 
trial would take place. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Frederick A. Jones tentatively decided last week to throw out the case on 
the grounds that Sconce was being denied due process of the law because his 
case was being handled by prosecutors from Los Angeles County instead of 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's tentative decision, Jones said it appeared that Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury made no active decisions in the case before deputizing two 
Los Angeles deputy district attorneys as special prosecutors and turning over 
all authority in the case to Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury testified Thursday that he made the decision to charge Sconce with 
murder and a special circumstance of murder by poison, which could allow 
prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
But he also admitted that he turned over authority to Los Angeles County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss to decide whether to seek the death penalty and had 
never discussed the case with Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said he realized it was a mistake to give up the authority and decided 
to take it back when Diamond argued that relinquishing it was grounds for 
dismissal. Bradbury said he has not decided whether to seek the death penalty 
for Sconce. 
</P>
<P>
After Bradbury's testimony, Jones reversed his tentative ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also gave Diamond permission to exhume Waters' body from a Burbank crypt 
on an undisclosed date to test it for residue of oleander, the poison that 
medical experts testified caused his death.

COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON DEVELOPERS' FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unable to agree on who should pay the most for citywide street improvements, 
the Simi Valley City Council has delayed voting on a plan to charge all 
developers a fee to help pay for such projects. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed transportation plan, commercial, industrial and residential 
developers would be charged $95.73 for each daily vehicle trip generated by new 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if a business generates an average 100 visits a day, it would pay a 
onetime fee of $9,573. Fees would not be applied to developers who already have 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing on the issue Monday, council members agreed that a 
traffic fee is needed but said they are not sure whether all developers should 
be charged the same rate. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Greg Stratton and Councilman Bill Davis said they believe residential 
growth is the primary cause of increased traffic, not commercial or industrial 
development, so residential developers should pay more in traffic fees. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Boland, president of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce, and 
representatives of the Building Industry Assn. agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The additional fees would force an additional economic stress on start-up 
businesses and could drive away prospective larger businesses from locating 
here," depriving the city of jobs and increased tax revenues, Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, the council asked its staff to explore other ways to fund 
street improvements, including shifting the brunt of the traffic fees to 
residential developers. They also asked for a study on traffic generated by 
residential and commercial developments to determine what the differences are. 
</P>
<P>
The staff is scheduled to report back to the council at its meeting Dec. 17.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE LEARNED IT'S NOT MERELY A PAPERWEIGHT

Former defensive tackle Merlin Olsen, the 1961 Outland Trophy winner from Utah 
State who was a fixture in the Rams' Fearsome Foursome, appeared at Wednesday's 
Outland Trophy ceremony at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, where he received a 
special presentation and introduced each finalist. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, told the audience how the 
Outland statue, a 40-pound, two-foot-high, solid cast-iron sculpture by former 
NFL defensive back Jim Ridlon, embodies the quintessential lineman. 
</P>
<P>
After handing Russell Maryland the trophy, Olsen began a short interview with 
the Miami defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Said Maryland: "I'm so happy right now. I don't know what to say. I'd like to 
thank my parents. . . . Let me put this thing down. . . . James and Rita 
Maryland." 
</P>
<P>
Add Outland Trophy: Maryland thanked a number of people, adding that he hoped 
he hadn't missed anyone inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
His father, James, a district sales manager for Chrysler Corp. in the Chicago 
area, was sitting in the front row. He called out: "Leo Levine." 
</P>
<P>
Said Maryland: "My father reminds me to thank Leo Levine of Mercedes. Get that, 
he's a Chrysler guy!"

Dial-a-ride: For the past two rodeo seasons, the Bucking Bull of the Year has

</P>
<P>
The Pacific Bell we've known for years is one tough customer, but how tough is 
this guy? According to the Associated Press, in 35 events last year, no rider 
was able to stay on the 1,800-pounder for a full eight seconds. And Russell 
expects him to three-peat as Bull of the Year this week at the National Finals 
Rodeo in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Russell also said of his 7-year-old animal: "He may go until he's 12 or 13, but 
when it gets to the point where they start riding him, I'm not going to let him 
play the game any more. I'm going to let him quit when he's on top."

Rocket vs. Rocket: If Notre Dame's Raghib (Rocket) Ismail accepts an invitation 
to run the 50-meter dash in the Sunkist Invitational track meet at the Sports 
Arena on Jan. 18, credit Notre Dame assistant track coach John Miller with a 
crafty sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The meet is less than three weeks after the Rocket and the Fighting Irish take 
on Colorado in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Miller told meet officials that when Ismail heard about the chance to begin his 
indoor track season in Los Angeles, he said: "Do I really need to start with 
Ben Johnson?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Yale, with 100.

NHL ROUNDUP;

CANADIENS DISCOVER POWER PLAY JUST IN TIME TO BEAT BRUINS, 6-4 
</P>

<P>
The Montreal power play, once the best in the NHL, is now the worst with only 
17 goals in 137 chances. But it was working Thursday night as Stephan Lebeau 
and Brian Skrudland scored power-play goals at Boston to lead the Canadiens to 
a 6-4 victory over the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Montreal to within a point of the Adams Division-leading 
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Brunet, Eric Desjardins, Stephane Richer and Guy Carbonneau had the 
other goals for Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Byers, Dave Christian, Craig Janney and Randy Burridge scored the Boston 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Rick Vaive scored on his own rebound with 4:02 
remaining to lift the Sabres over the Flyers at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia had rallied from a 3-0 deficit to get even on a second-period goal 
by Mike Ricci and third-period goals by Scott Mellanby and Derrick Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 2, Minnesota 1 -- Doug Shedden tied the game with 1:23 to play, and Rob 
Ramage scored the winning goal with 2:03 remaining in overtime as the Maple 
Leafs gained a split in their home-and-home series with the North Stars at 
Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Maple Leaf goalie Peter Ing made 29 saves as Toronto stopped Minnesota's 
three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, New York Islanders 2 -- At Chicago, Steve Larmer had two goals and 
three assists, and goaltender Ed Belfour earned his NHL-leading 17th victory as 
the Blackhawks extended the Islanders' winless streak to seven games.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: AS USUAL, MARKET FAILS TO STOCK ALL BEST MERCHANDISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here we go again. Most of the nation will get an attractive NFL doubleheader on 
CBS Sunday -- San Francisco at Cincinnati at 10 a.m., PST, followed by Chicago 
at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles viewers will see only the first game. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: The Rams are playing at home. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has a longstanding policy that does not permit a network doubleheader 
in a market where a game is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
So, in a two-team area such as Los Angeles, where either the Rams or the 
Raiders are at home on most Sundays, there is usually one fewer game from which 
to chose. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's thinking: One fewer game on TV helps protect the live gate. 
</P>
<P>
But does it? Would maybe a dozen people choose not to attend the Rams' game 
against the New Orleans Saints Sunday at Anaheim Stadium if there were one more 
game on TV? 
</P>
<P>
Television overall, contrary to early fears, hasn't had an adverse effect on 
attendance. It has had a positive effect. Because of television, the NFL is 
healthier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I can remember when it was feared that radio would hurt attendance," 
said Charlie Jones, the dean of network pro football announcers. "But 
everything has changed. Fan interest is higher than ever, and with all the 
money the teams make off television, I think the fans in NFL cities deserve to 
get that extra game." 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect any changes soon, said Val Pinchbeck, the league's director of 
broadcasting. Los Angeles will continue to get two daytime games instead of 
three whenever the Rams or the Raiders are at home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go back to the '60s, no telecasts were permitted in a market where the 
home team was playing," Pinchbeck said. "Then we went to one, and then two. 
Where do you stop?" 
</P>
<P>
How about at three? 
</P>
<P>
That way everybody would be treated the same. It's unfair to penalize fans who 
happen to live in an NFL market, and doubly unfair to those in a two-team 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL game on NBC Sunday will be Denver at Kansas City at 1 p.m., PST, with 
Jones and Bill Walsh reporting. Jones is filling in for Dick Enberg, who drew 
another assignment this weekend. He's in Landover, Md., for the World Pro 
Figure Skating Championships, to be taped for future showing. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, when reminded that if the Chicago-Washington game were shown in L.A. on 
Sunday it would cut into the NBC audience, quipped: "Well, let's qualify this. 
I'm 100% in favor of getting rid of the no-doubleheader policy, except this 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
There's been speculation that Walsh might leave the broadcast booth to take 
over as coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh repeatedly has said he doesn't want to go back into coaching, nor does he 
want to leave the Bay Area, where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
But he is in the second year of a two-year contract with NBC, and if the 
network doesn't give him a new one, he might take Buccaneer owner Hugh 
Culverhouse's money and run to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
NBC might be making a mistake if it gives up on Walsh already. Sure, he 
stumbles and forgets names. Last Sunday, after a leaping catch by Raider tight 
end Ethan Horton, he said, "It took an excellent catch by Horton to make the 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
Say what? 
</P>
<P>
And during the confusion over the clock near the end of the first quarter, he 
said it was hurting the Rangers' momentum. Wrong team, wrong sport. 
</P>
<P>
However, Walsh's critical observations are often refreshing, although sometimes 
overdone. But he is usually right. For instance, he said the Raiders should 
have been passing more against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's rough spots should smooth out with more time. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC cameras Monday night were right on top of the New York Giants' Phil 
Simms and San Francisco's Ronnie Lott as they jawed at each other. 
</P>
<P>
What was needed, though, was some kind of explanation. ABC had to leave the air 
before providing one. 
</P>
<P>
It was later reported that Lott called Simms a "choker," but Simms said, "Had 
he called me that, I would have killed him." 
</P>
<P>
But Lott did razz Simms about losing. Such showboating was hardly necessary 
after the close 49er victory. 
</P>
<P>
All the intimidating, high-fiving, dancing and carrying on in the NFL has 
gotten ridiculous. Why not go back to the good old days when players let their 
performances do all the talking? 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, players go into their rituals even when their team is losing, 35-0. 
</P>
<P>
Radio talk: While KABC continues to audition prospective "Sportstalk" hosts, 
KMPC has decided to drop its "Sportsline" show. It will go off the air on Dec. 
28, KMPC General Manager Bill Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just too many sports-talk shows," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Whittington will be on the air before and after Jim Healy's 5:30 show, 
with Paul Olden providing periodic sports reports, beginning at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Trying out at KABC this week were Steve Garvey, on Monday and Tuesday, and Tony 
Hernandez the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Green will get a shot Monday, then come Jay Johnstone on Tuesday and 
Wednesday and Greg Wyatt next Thursday and Friday. They will all be paired with 
Eric Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
Times columnist Mike Downey will make another appearance on the show on Dec. 
17-19. This time, he will work with Steve Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Al Downing will get his turn Dec. 20-21, working with Ira Fistel. 
</P>
<P>
Program director Michael Fox said, besides those invited to try out, the 
station has received between 60 and 70 applications. He said all will be 
considered, and the top ones will get auditions. Fox said he hopes to make a 
decision by the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Talley, a former "Sportstalk" host, this week began doing a sports-talk 
show on KVEG (840), a 50,000-watt Las Vegas station that can be heard in Los 
Angeles at night. 
</P>
<P>
Talley is on from 7 to 9 p.m., the first two of five hours of sports talk. 
Peter Vent, formerly of KIEV, is on KVEG from 9 to 10. Fred Wallin, another 
former "Sportstalk" host who has been at KVEG for a while, wraps things up from 
10 to midnight.

TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
After the Julio Cesar Chavez-Kyungduk Ahn fight and before the bout between 
Mike Tyson and Alex Stewart on HBO Saturday night there will be a 
controversial, seven-minute Spike Lee tribute to Tyson. Promoter Don King takes 
some shots at white America in the piece. "We've never had anything quite like 
this on HBO," executive producer Ross Greenburg said. The HBO show will begin 
at 7 p.m., with the Tyson fight scheduled for 8:15. The first fight figures to 
be the better of the two. . . . Tyson will be featured in a segment on "Screen 
Scene" tonight at 5 on the Black Entertainment Network. Co-host Suzette 
Charles, a former Miss America, will do the interview. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's last fight of the year has Michael Carbajal facing Leon (Fiero) Salazar 
on "SportsWorld" Saturday at 1 p.m. . . . SportsChannel America will show a 
tape of last Saturday night's World Boxing Assn. junior welterweight bout 
between champion Loreto Garza and Vinnie Pazienza Monday night at 6. . . . 
Baseball broadcaster Tim McCarver and co-anchor Paula Zahn of "CBS This 
Morning" will be the co-hosts of CBS' coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday's San Francisco 49ers-New York Giants game drew a 27.0 national 
Nielsen rating, the second-highest rating ever for a regular-season NFL game. 
The highest was a 29.6 for Miami-Chicago in 1985. . . . Monday's game was shown 
live in Great Britain -- at 2 a.m. Tuesday. . . . NBC didn't need to show 
Denver wide receiver Michael Young getting sick on the sideline last Sunday. "I 
didn't throw up, but I sure thought I was going to," Young said. . . . 
Announcers for the San Francisco-Cincinnati game on CBS Sunday will be Dick 
Stockton and Merlin Olsen. . . . The Clippers' Bo Kimble will be on "NBA Inside 
Stuff" on NBC Saturday at 11:30 a.m.

DETMER AIMING FOR ANOTHER HEISMAN AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ty Detmer, the third consecutive junior winner of the Heisman Trophy, claimed 
his award Thursday, saying he'll be back for another season if not for another 
statue. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a different team and a whole new season," the BYU quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're losing quite a few players. We've got a young team next year. I'm going 
to enjoy it now, while it's here." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer received the award at the Heisman dinner Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just an overwhelming night for me and my family," he said in his 
acceptance speech. "This is the greatest award any individual can receive. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in awe of the Heisman Trophy and I'm still in awe of it." 
</P>
<P>
Archie Griffin, the Heisman winner in 1974 and 1975, is the only player to win 
the award twice. Ironically, two of Detmer's chief rivals for the trophy this 
year -- Houston's David Klingler and Notre Dame's Raghib "Rocket" Ismail -- are 
also juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer rode a string of 23 consecutive 300-yard games to college football's 
most prestigious award. His resume includes 25 NCAA passing or total offense 
records. The 13th-ranked Cougars (10-2) will meet Texas A&amp;M in the Holiday 
Bowl on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Detmer recalled the moments before he found out he had won it last 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before, I felt a rush of adrenaline and my stomach turning," he said. 
"Then you hear your name. It was a great feeling. I was surprised because you 
don't want to get your hopes up." 
</P>
<P>
When Detmer decided he was going to be a quarterback, he went shopping for the 
appropriate program rather than waiting to be recruited. "I committed before my 
senior year in high school," he said. "I recruited them because of the 
quarterback situation."

<P>
FOR LIONS, 'EVERY DOWN IS THIRD DOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Adolph, the Raiders' defensive coordinator, thinks the Detroit Lions' 
run-and-shoot offense will present problems in Monday night's game at Pontiac, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something unique that you don't play against every week in the NFL," 
Adolph said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every down you play against them is a third down and we have to approach it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Lions use four wide receivers, will the Raiders employ an extra 
defensive back throughout the game? 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams play it with at least five defensive backs and possibly six," 
Adolph said. "I'm not going to divulge how we're going to play it. It's hard 
enough as it is." 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders can't concentrate totally on stopping the Lions' passing attack 
because of running back Barry Sanders, the NFL's No. 4 rusher with 905 yards 
and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be very alert for him running the ball because if there's a seam 
(Sanders) will find it," Adolph said. 
</P>
<P>
Lion injury update: Linebacker Dennis Gibson is out because of an ankle injury. 
Cornerback Bruce McNorton will miss the game because of a broken left forearm 
and wide receiver Aubrey Matthews has a bruised shoulder and is questionable.

PARAMOUNT STREAK ON THE LINE AGAINST CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, Saturday night's Southern Section Division II football title 
game looks more like a mismatch than a matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount (13-0) comes into the game with the section's longest winning streak 
at 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates are also going for their third consecutive championship. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (11-2), meanwhile, finished third in the South Coast League 
this season behind Mission Viejo and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
But the 7:30 p.m. showdown at Santa Ana Stadium could be the best of a long 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount lost most of its top players from last season to graduation, but 
Coach Ken Sutch overcame that, proving that he reloads rathers than rebuilds. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Leon Neal has been the key offensive player in playoff victories 
over Rio Mesa, Pasadena Muir and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley rebounded from its slow start in league play, defeating 
Mission Viejo, 26-24, in the playoff semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' leaders are quarterback Tony Solliday and receiver Dave Poltl.

CITY FOOTBALL SEMIFINALS;

PRELIMINARIES LEAVE ONLY THE HEAVYWEIGHTS

<P>
Three weeks ago, the City Section 4-A Division football playoffs began with all 
12 teams qualifying. Many thought that the first two rounds were warmups for 
the four dominant teams in the division: Carson, Dorsey, Wilmington Banning and 
Granada Hills. They were right. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, those four teams will play in the semifinals, Banning (8-3) meeting 
Dorsey (9-2) at Gardena High, and Carson (10-1) playing Granada Hills (10-1) at 
Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing three of its first five games, Banning has become one of the 
hottest teams in the City. The Pilots, who did not make the playoffs last year, 
have a six-game winning streak, including a 21-0 victory over Dorsey, the 
defending City champion, late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Davis, a senior tailback, has been the force behind the second-seeded 
Pilots' streak. In Banning's 20-10 quarterfinal victory over Kennedy of Granada 
Hills, Davis rushed for 108 yards and a touchdown, intercepted two passes and 
returned a kickoff 97 yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, which defeated Carson in last season's final, 26-15, has changed 
quarterbacks since its last meeting with Banning. Lamont Warren, last year's 
City player of the year at tailback, now calls signals for the Dons, having 
replaced Ronald Peebles, who has a thumb injury. In his two games as a starter, 
Warren has passed for 313 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In Dorsey's 21-7 quarterfinal victory over San Fernando, Warren rushed for a 
touchdown and passed for scores to Keyshawn Johnson and Chris Miller. Junior 
tailback Sharmon Shah rushed for 112 yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
In Coach Gene Vollnogle's last season, Carson will take an eight-game winning 
streak into its game with Granada Hills. The Colts are led by quarterback John 
Walsh, who has passed for 3,678 yards, 42 touchdowns and broken 22 school 
records this season. 
</P>
<P>
In Carson's 54-0 victory over Woodland Hills El Camino Real last Friday, Abdul 
Muhammad had 140 return yards and a touchdown, and Latario Rachel caught five 
passes for 88 yards and scored five touchdowns, among them an 83-yard kickoff 
return and a 76-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, which last won the City title in 1987, is led by Bryan Martin, 
who has passed for 1,718 yards and 19 touchdowns, and Brett Washington, who has 
rushed for 1,554 yards and 23 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A Division semifinals, Lincoln (8-3-1) will play Belmont (10-1) at 
East Los Angeles College, and Poly (9-3) will play Fairfax (11-0) at Venice 
High. 
</P>
<P>
All games will start at 7:30 p.m.

QUARTZ HILL SEEKS TO ESTABLISH ITS IDENTITY AGAINST LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A question asked this week concerning tonight's Southern Section Division I 
football championship game between Loyola and Quartz Hill high schools: "Where 
is Quartz Hill?" 
</P>
<P>
Prep football fans are familiar with tradition-rich Loyola, but one news 
release called its opponent Coltz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Quartz Hill is located in the Antelope Valley, about 70 miles 
north of downtown Los Angeles. The best-known player to come out of the school 
is former USC running back Aaron Emanuel. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels compete in the Golden League and enter tonight's 7:30 game at 
Anaheim Stadium with an 11-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill, making its first championship appearance, has outscored its 
opponents, 110-40, in the playoffs, including last week's 37-7 dismantling of 
Santa Ana Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola is 131-38-4 in the last 15 years under Coach Steve Grady, but the Cubs 
are playing in the title game for the first time since 1975. After opening the 
playoffs with an easy 42-14 victory over Long Beach Jordan, Loyola relied on 
defense in beating Fontana, 10-7, and Canyon Country Canyon, 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola is led on defense by senior linebacker Drew Casani, the defensive player 
of the year in the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
Casani will have his hands full trying to stop a potent Quartz Hill running 
game spearheaded by junior Erik Thomas, who has gained 1,394 yards and scored 
17 touchdowns, and senior David Nelson, with 917 yards and 12 touchdowns.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY (11-2) 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Ana Stadium 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This may be the best matchup of the weekend. Paramount, which has the section's 
longest winning streak at 21 games, is going for its third consecutive 
championship. The Pirates lost most of their top players from last season to 
graduation, but Coach Ken Sutch overcame that. Running back Leon Neal has been 
the key offensive player in playoff victories over Rio Mesa, Pasadena Muir and 
El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley finished third in the South Coast League this season behind 
Mission Viejo and El Toro, but rebounded in the playoffs and defeated Mission 
Viejo, 26-24, in the semifinals. The Cougars' leaders are quarterback Tony 
Solliday and receiver Dave Poltl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division III 
</P>
<P>
SANTA FE SPRINGS ST. PAUL (8-3-2) 
</P>
<P>
vs. ANAHEIM ESPERANZA (13-0) 
</P>
<P>
At Cerritos College 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul's drop from Division I to Division III this year helped the Swordsmen. 
After struggling in nonconference losses to Loyola, Fontana and Serra, St. Paul 
turned things around, won the Mission League and hasn't lost in seven weeks. 
The offensive leaders are quarterback Albert Borunda, who has passed for 1,200 
yards, and running back Carlos Ramos, who has rushed for 850 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza, making its first appearance in the finals in six years, is the 
division's top-seeded team. The Aztecs are coming off a 38-35 victory over Hart 
in which Reid Pullen scored on a seven-yard pass from Keith McDonald with three 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division IV 
</P>
<P>
BALDWIN PARK (10-2-1) vs. 
</P>
<P>
RIVERSIDE ARLINGTON (10-3) 
</P>
<P>
At Riverside Ramona HS 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team was expected to make it to the finals after failing to win league 
titles. Baldwin Park finished second in the Sierra League, and Arlington was 
third in the Ivy League. 
</P>
<P>
In Arlington's ride to the championship, the Lions had to defeat second-seeded 
Nogales in the quarterfinals and third-seeded Glendora in the semifinals. 
Baldwin Park's key was a 21-7 upset of top-seeded Canyon Springs in the 
quarterfinals. Baldwin Park beat previously undefeated Santa Margarita, 13-7, 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division V 
</P>
<P>
NORCO (12-1) vs. 
</P>
<P>
ETIWANDA (12-0) 
</P>
<P>
At Citrus College 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:30 
</P>
<P>
Etiwanda has a distinct advantage tonight because it didn't have to play last 
week. The school's scheduled semifinal game against El Centro Central was 
canceled because it had used an academically ineligible player during the 
playoffs. Etiwanda received an automatic bye and was charged with a home game. 
Norco beat Palm Desert, 36-28. 
</P>
<P>
Both schools are playing in the finals for the first time. Top-seeded Etiwanda 
is led by running back William Taukieaho, the Hacienda League player of the 
year. Norco linebacker Shay Muirbrook is equally as talented on defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division VI 
</P>
<P>
TUSTIN (13-0) vs. 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON SUNNY HILLS (10-3) 
</P>
<P>
At Orange Coast College 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:30 
</P>
<P>
Tustin hasn't played in a football championship game since 1948, when it 
defeated Vista, 20-13. This season has been one to remember, however. The 
Tillers went undefeated and are seeded No. 1 in the division. Tustin is coached 
by Marijon Ancich, the winningest active coach in the section. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills lost three of its first five games before turning things around in 
midseason to win the Freeway League. It beat Savanna, Newport Harbor and 
Valencia in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division VII 
</P>
<P>
LOMPOC (12-1) vs. 
</P>
<P>
ARROYO GRANDE (11-1) 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:30 
</P>
<P>
The biggest worry tonight is whether the stadium at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is 
big enough to handle the expected crowd of 10,000. The game is a battle between 
Northern League rivals. Lompoc defeated Arroyo Grande, 35-24, in the 
regular-season finale on Nov. 9 to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo Grande has been impressive in the playoffs, stunning top-seeded Serra, 
31-0, last week to end the Cavaliers' 24-game winning streak. Lompoc, led by 
All-American running back Napolean Kaufman, is returning to the finals after 
losing to Serra in last year's championship game 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division VIII 
</P>
<P>
PALOS VERDES (8-5) at 
</P>
<P>
TEMECULA VALLEY (10-3) 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
After starting the season 3-0, Palos Verdes lost five of its next six games, 
including a four-game losing streak in which the team was shut out twice. The 
Sea Kings finished third in the Ocean League but have been impressive in the 
playoffs with victories over Santa Paula, Bloomington and top-seeded Cabrillo. 
Palos Verdes hasn't won a football title since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula Valley, which beat Palos Verdes' rivals Rolling Hills, West Torrance 
and Morningside in the playoffs, is led by multipurpose running back Ronnie 
Long, who has scored 20 touchdowns, rushed for 907 yards and caught 32 passes. 
The Bears are in the finals for the first time since the school opened six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division IX 
</P>
<P>
WHITTIER CHRISTIAN (12-0) vs 
</P>
<P>
TEHACHAPI (12-1) 
</P>
<P>
At Bakersfield College 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
These are two of the most dominant schools in lower-division football. 
Tehachapi is making its fourth consecutive trip to the finals and seventh since 
1980. Whittier Christian won sectional championships in 1979, '83 and '84. The 
game was originally scheduled at Tehachapi High but was moved to Bakersfield 
when Whittier Christian administrators convinced the Southern Section that it 
would need a bigger stadium for all of its fans. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are hungry for a title, because Tehachapi lost to Carpinteria in 
last year's championship game and Whittier Christian was eliminated in the 
quarterfinals by Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division X 
</P>
<P>
MALIBU CAMP KILPATRICK (9-3-1) 
</P>
<P>
vs. VAN NUYS MONTCLAIR PREP (9-3) 
</P>
<P>
At Valley College 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:30 
</P>
<P>
Two teams that each have won eight consecutive games meet for the first time in 
the first Division X title game. Both teams won easily in the semifinals, 
Montclair Prep defeating Village Christian, 34-0, and Camp Kilpatrick beating 
Mammoth, 52-20. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep is led by Eliel Swinton, who has gained 1,716 yards. Camp 
Kilpatrick's threat is Michael Black, who has rushed for 1,969 yards and 25 
touchdowns.

COMPARISON: CANYON'S HARRY WELCH, WHOSE COWBOYS LOST TO BOTH TEAMS, SEES NO 
CLEAR FAVORITE.

<P>
Looking for inside information on tonight's Southern Section Division I 
football championship? 
</P>
<P>
Why not ask Canyon High Coach Harry Welch? He knows the competitors -- Quartz 
Hill and Loyola -- as well as most. 
</P>
<P>
Welch's Cowboys were 11-2 this season, losing only to Quartz Hill, 12-6, in the 
Golden League opener at Canyon on Oct. 12 and to Loyola, 10-3, in a Division I 
semifinal last week at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"Quartz Hill is definitely peaking, but there's a double edge to that sword," 
Welch said of the Rebels, who have won eight consecutive games. "You just don't 
do what they've been doing -- making one big play after another in the last 
couple of weeks -- all the time. They've just had it too easy. That could hurt 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Loyola has had to scratch and claw its way past its last two 
opponents. But the Cubs made a breakthrough of sorts when they beat Canyon 
after suffering semifinal losses to Bishop Amat and San Gorgonio in 1988 and 
'89. 
</P>
<P>
"Loyola is deceptively good on defense," Welch said. "What I mean by that is 
their worst athlete is a good athlete, but their best athlete is not 
sensational. If you watch them on film they look pretty good, but then you try 
to block them live in a game situation and your guard doesn't block their 
linebacker and your tackle doesn't block their defensive end." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Gutierrez, a 6-foot-3, 215-pound junior defensive tackle and fullback, 
and Selves Smith, a 5-11 1/2, 205-pound senior inside linebacker and running 
back, are the heart and soul of Quartz Hill's defense, which has allowed only 
9.5 points and 207.4 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Loyola (11-2) and Quartz Hill (11-2) have powerful rushing 
attacks, but the Cubs are apt to grind it out in time-consuming marches and 
Quartz Hill has a penchant for the big play. 
</P>
<P>
"Quartz Hill has the ability to explode at any time," Welch said. "That's a big 
difference between the teams. Loyola doesn't believe in their offense, they 
believe in their defense. Quartz Hill believes in their offense and their 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback matchup between Quartz Hill's Jake Haro (1,033 yards and 13 
touchdowns passing) and Loyola's Corby Smith (1,059 yards and five touchdowns) 
will play a crucial role, according to Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"Haro is not an accomplished passer, but he is a very good quarterback," Welch 
said. "He reminds me of Doug Flutie. . . . If he passes like he did against 
Mater Dei, no one has a chance against Quartz Hill. But I don't anticipate that 
happening again." 
</P>
<P>
Although Quartz Hill, the Golden League champion, has been more spectacular 
than Loyola this season, the Rebels could be at a disadvantage mentally because 
of their victory over Mater Dei, which defeated Loyola, 3-0, earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Quartz Hill has a real big problem in that Loyola only finished third in (the 
Angelus) league," Welch said. "No matter what they say, and no matter what the 
coach says, it's in their players' minds that they blew out Mater Dei, and 
Mater Dei beat Loyola." 
</P>
<P>
So which team is going to win tonight? It depends, Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
"Loyola if it's close," he said. "Quartz Hill if it's a blowout."

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACK HARO THE UNSUNG HERO AT QUARTZ HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about making the most of an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The running game has garnered most of the attention for Quartz Hill High this 
season, but junior quarterback Jake Haro has established himself as a fourth 
threat in the Rebels' power I attack. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-8 junior has mastered the big play through the air in addition to 
rushing for 290 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Haro has averaged just eight passes a game, but his 49 completions have amassed 
1,033 yards -- an average of 21.1 yards a completion. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Hart's Ryan Connors and Westlake's Todd Preston -- the area's two 
most prolific passers based on yardage -- averaged 14.6 yards a completion. 
</P>
<P>
Haro has thrown 13 touchdown passes, giving him a touchdown for every 3.76 
completions. By contrast, Preston threw a touchdown pass every 7.9 completions 
and Connors threw a touchdown pass every 6.45 completions. 
</P>
<P>
Haro's effort against Mater Dei on Friday underscored his big-play ability. He 
attempted only six passes in the Rebels' 37-7 victory but completed four for 
114 yards and two touchdowns. He threw an 84-yard scoring strike to Dehryen 
Mabry with 3 minutes 58 seconds left in the second quarter and a 24-yard 
touchdown to Rob Keller on the final play of the half. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, the adrenaline just gets to you," Haro said. "I just thought to 
myself, 'This is an important game, so I'd better have a good one for our 
coaches and for our seniors.' " 
</P>
<P>
Myth exposed: Canyon High football Coach Harry Welch was adamantly opposed to 
the Golden League's move from Division II to I this season, but now that the 
playoffs are almost over, Welch admits that his concerns were unwarranted. "I 
think we all bought into the Citrus Belt (League) and Orange County football 
myth," Welch said. "They play very good football down there, but so do we up 
here. I think the playoffs have proved that." 
</P>
<P>
Two (Quartz Hill and Canyon) of the four teams that qualified for last week's 
Division I semifinals were from the Golden League and only one (Mater Dei) was 
from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Edison, the No. 4-seeded team entering the playoffs, was 
beaten in the first round, and Citrus Belt powers Eisenhower and Fontana, the 
Nos. 1- and 3-seeded teams, were eliminated in the second round by Mater Dei 
and Loyola, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised when (those teams) lost in the early rounds, but that was 
because of the hype," Welch said. "I saw Fontana on film, and they were a very, 
very good high school football team, but they weren't unstoppable. Loyola 
proved that. . . . I think the two best teams (Quartz Hill and Loyola) are 
still playing. That's why we have a tournament." 
</P>
<P>
New and improved: Taft senior linebacker Cornell Hill (6-1, 170) was in the 
midst of a superlative season when physicians detected a problem in his right 
forearm. Season-ending surgery was required to remove a large hematoma. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Hill was granted medical clearance and he made an improbable 
return -- to the basketball court. Hill, who had not practiced with the 
basketball team, came off the bench to score 12 points in Taft's 79-56 opening 
victory over Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Although his arm was heavily taped, Hill was deadly from the free-throw line, 
making all six attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he made that many all last year," Taft basketball Coach Jim 
Woodard said. "As a matter of fact, I think he shot about 48% from the line." 
</P>
<P>
Hobbling Bulldogs: Buena's basketball roster, which listed 10 players at the 
start of the season, dipped to six last week and left the Bulldogs barely able 
to conduct a practice. 
</P>
<P>
The latest victims were Doug Wilder (fractured wrist), Russell Rose (knee 
surgery), Joey Young (twisted knee), and Matt Egan (disciplinary reasons). 
</P>
<P>
The losses forced Buena Coach Glen Hannah to bring Matt McSorly, a 6-4 
sophomore, up from the junior varsity. But McSorly wasn't available to practice 
last Friday because he had played in the junior-varsity game. 
</P>
<P>
That same junior-varsity game also took most of the players Hannah needs for 
varsity practice. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to go with our junior-varsity guys, which isn't our best, but it's 
all we can do," Hannah said. "Friday there wasn't a whole lot we could do with 
just six guys." 
</P>
<P>
Eight players were in uniform Wednesday for Buena's 74-67 loss to St. Anthony 
in the Loyola tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, but the kids are hanging in there and they're looking a lot 
better," Hannah said. "It makes for some long practices, but at least we had 
eight bodies out there Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
Add injuries: Channel Islands' Brian Schemelpfhing, a projected sixth man for 
the Raiders, suffered an ankle sprain and will miss the Nordhoff tournament 
this week. Schemelpfhing, a 6-3 senior forward, is expected to return next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Jaqua out: Simi Valley's progress during the preseason was slowed last week 
when senior point guard Tim Jaqua, a returning starter, suffered torn ankle 
ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
Jaqua, who will be sidelined for at least three weeks, was expected to provide 
the inexperienced Pioneers with leadership, and his loss was evident during 
Simi Valley's shoddy offensive play last weekend. Simi Valley dropped two 
consecutive games in its tournament, the last a 62-61 decision to 
Douglas-Juneau (Alaska). 
</P>
<P>
"We just could not get into anything offensively," Simi Valley Coach Dean 
Bradshaw said. "Every time we scored, it looked like recreation ball. Getting 
Jaqua back will really help." 
</P>
<P>
It also will be a necessity if Simi Valley, which has won at least a share of 
the past five league titles, expects to cash in on Pick Six -- the slogan 
Bradshaw has attached to this year's goal. 
</P>
<P>
Slumber party: The Oak Park soccer team has been able to rest easier since the 
school's football team lost, 34-7, to Beaumont in the Southern Section Division 
IX playoffs two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The soccer team had been practicing at 6 a.m. because the football team used 
the field in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer Coach Dick Billingsley, however, was not too thrilled about the loss -- 
Billingsley also happens to be the football coach. 
</P>
<P>
"(The soccer team) was a little more shocked that we lost than thankful," 
Billingsley said. "It's been pretty tiring waking up every morning. It'll be a 
little warmer practicing at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I just wish the 
football season ended on a better note." 
</P>
<P>
Globetrotter: The success of first-year Oak Park basketball Coach Nate Sims 
could affect his performance on another job. 
</P>
<P>
Sims plays semi-pro basketball in Australia for five months of the year and is 
scheduled to leave for Australia on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The first round of the playoffs begins Feb. 15, and, if Oak Park advances to 
the semifinals scheduled 11 days later, Sims might have to revise his travel 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be tight," said Sims, who played at Santa Monica College and Cal 
State Long Beach in the late '70s and early '80s. "If we keep on winning, I'm 
going to have to cancel the flight and stay."

State Northridge men's soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
The most valuable offensive player was Bobby Reyes, a junior forward, and the 
most valuable defensive player was Matt Ziegler, a freshman wingback. Junior

<P>
The Hart High boys' cross-country team jumped from ninth to third in The 
Harrier magazine's final national rankings by virtue of the Indians' 58-113 
victory over Madera in the state Division I championships last month. 
</P>
<P>
Madera, a Central Section team that was ranked third nationally and first in 
California before the state meet, dropped to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
After its second-place finish in the state Division II final, the Camarillo 
boys' team, unranked in the previous poll, moved to 20th on the national list. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura girls' team maintained its No. 2 ranking after winning the state 
Division I championship. The Chargers remained behind Mountain View High of 
Orem, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale College, which defeated host Citrus, 23-16, in the Southern California 
Bowl on Saturday, is the 13th-ranked team in the J. C. Grid-Wire's final 
national poll.

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: PAY THE PRICE, NAME BOWL OF YOUR CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
THE BOWLS 
</P>
<P>
All these new bowl sponsors have raised several suspenseful questions. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, if no one scores within 30 minutes in the Domino's Pizza Copper 
Bowl, will fans get their money back? Will Notre Dame mail in its victory in 
the Federal Express Orange Bowl? Can fans get in to see Blockbuster Video's 
Blockbuster Bowl without a membership card? And will it be shown live? 
</P>

Then there's the former Sun Bowl in El Paso. First it was renamed the John 
Hancock Sun Bowl. Next it became the John Hancock Bowl. What now? Will the 
avaricious insurance company insist that the city be renamed John Hancock, 
Tex.? 
</P>
<P>
As for the Poulan Weed Eater Bowl, the easy thing would be to say that 
Louisiana Tech and Maryland belong there. So let's say it. 
</P>
<P>
One of the last holdouts against sponsors is the Rose Bowl. But just wait until 
its agreement with the Pacific 10 and Big Ten runs out. Then one of L.A.'s most 
famous landmarks will get involved. Coming soon: The Tommy's Original World 
Famous Hamburgers Rose Bowl!

LIBERTY BOWL PROMO: Ohio State split end Bobby Olive, on learning his school

going to be kind of hard getting up for the game."

Warning to NFL coaches: Winning can be hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, Tampa-at-Bay owner Hugh Culverhouse declared that "even if 
we lost every game the rest of the year, even if (Coach) Ray Perkins wanted to 
quit, I wouldn't let him." 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? Tampa beats Atlanta and Culverhouse fires Perkins, replacing 
him with assistant Richard Williamson (not his real name). Of course, many fans 
had called for the ouster of Perkins, who was 19-41 with the Buccaneers, and 
some even boycotted the first quarter of the Falcon game. (So did Tampa Bay's 
offense, going scoreless in that period.) 
</P>
<P>
The 331-yard passing performance by Tampa's Vinny Interceptaverde was further 
proof, by the way, that Atlanta has the worst pass defense in the NFL. And you 
thought that cornerback Deion (Knee On) Sanders wouldn't make an impact with 
the Falcons.

ART BREAKS OUT FROM BEHIND BARS; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBIT: PRINTS AND POETRY BY PRISON INMATES WILL BE ON DISPLAY AT CAL STATE 
NORTHRIDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The image is simple -- a woman's face on a black background. Touches of red and 
gold highlight the crude visage. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the 
monotype is the artist's signature: 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Van Houten. 
</P>
<P>
The former Manson family member is one of several dozen prison inmates whose 
art and poetry will be on display at Cal State Northridge beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of styles are included in the exhibit, "Perimeters: Prints and 
Poetry," which also features pieces by prison art teachers. The quality of the 
work varies -- from amateurish to sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
But with a show such as this, the attraction goes beyond mere color and line, 
or words put to paper. This art arrives imbued with powerful social context. 
</P>
<P>
"It's coming from a prison," said Louise Lewis, director of CSUN's art 
galleries. "On a very basic level, there's an element of curiosity. What kind 
of art will we get?" 
</P>
<P>
Several of the works follow an expected theme. Shattered images of violence and 
iron bars fill Q. Langston's hand-tinted lithograph. Wallace W. Williams' poem, 
"The Front," is an angry litany: 
</P>
<P>
 I saw him thru his fist in the air as he talked 
</P>
<P>
 about how many heads he busted and seemed proud of. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw him push the little guys around. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw him curse guards. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw him do a thousand push-ups a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly predictable sadness and desperation cloud a junkie's lament by Megan 
Silva Gaiduk: 
</P>
<P>
 I know I love you 
</P>
<P>
 because 
</P>
<P>
 I habitually let you fix first 
</P>
<P>
 I insist you do more 'cause you're bigger 
</P>
<P>
 . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I fret about your weight while mine dwindles 
</P>
<P>
 . . . 
</P>
<P>
 and I know you love me 
</P>
<P>
 because 
</P>
<P>
 you allow me to do these things. 
</P>
<P>
 But such themes do not hold true for every print or poem. Some works have 
color and joy and figures drawn with soft lines. 
</P>
<P>
C. McDonald creates human figures from swirling colors, set against blocks of 
pale red and turquoise. Joe Shaver's linocut, "Indian Signs," is constructed of 
basic reds, whites and maroons. Enrique Roquigo draws faces beneath brightly 
colored hats. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the expectation is to see grotesque, gruesome stuff," said Jim Carlson, 
a state corrections official. "We have some angry people inside the 
institutions, just like there are angry people on the street. But we also have 
a full range of people inside. A lot of the inmates' work reflects 
sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson manages the Arts-in-Corrections program, which employs art teachers in 
21 California prisons. Some 9,000 inmates regularly attend art workshops and 
classes, and the resulting work has shown at galleries across the state. 
</P>
<P>
More important to prison officials, the program appears to have a 
rehabilitative effect. A 1983 study showed that inmates with behavior problems 
were far less likely to commit rules infractions while working in the arts. A 
1987 study showed that parolees who had participated in Arts-in-Corrections 
were significantly less likely to be recidivists. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole artistic process helps them in thinking through situations. It 
raises their self-esteem," Carlson said. He also believes that the art can 
teach a thing or two to people on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to diminish the crimes, but the art allows us to view inmates 
differently," he said. "It speaks to the potential of some of the people in 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Program officials approached Lewis last fall to ask if CSUN would be host to an 
exhibit. There had been numerous inmate shows in Southern California recently, 
at such places as UC Riverside and Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was immediately taken with the idea. The concept has inspired her to 
think about art and notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder what the Keating 5 would produce?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perimeters: Prints and Poetry" will show Monday through Feb. 16. CSUN design 
faculty will exhibit accompanying pieces that explore various forms of media 
and communication. The gallery, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge, will be closed 
Dec. 22 to Jan. 2 for university holidays and will open Jan. 7 to 27 by 
appointment only. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, and 
noon to 4 p.m. Mondays and Saturdays. Call (818) 885-2156.

FROM DICKENS TO PINK PANTHER; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY EVENTS: PROGRAMS RANGE FROM CLASSICAL TO COMICAL, FROM MUSICAL TO 
DRAMATIC, FROM TRADITIONAL TO POP.

<P>
Try as it might to finally overtake the holiday season completely, pop culture 
is still dominated this year in the San Fernando Valley by more traditional 
arts and entertainment events. Contemporary music and even some cartoon 
characters join in the celebration, but it's such vintage standbys as "The 
Nutcracker" and Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" that set the tone. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday-themed events this month are scattered across a wide spectrum, 
including the re-creation of a Christmas dinner in the court of a 17th-Century 
English monarch at Cal State Northridge, assorted plays and carolers, and an 
all-star "Country Christmas" at the Universal Amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
* Headlined by mother-and-daughter country music duo the Judds, the "Country 
Christmas" concert Saturday will benefit the Love Is Feeding Everyone charity. 
Also on the bill are Charley Pride, Garth Brooks, Hoyt Axton, Jim Stafford and 
others. On Dec. 19 and 20 at the Amphitheater, Mannheim Steamroller performs "A 
Fresh Aire Christmas." For information on both programs, call (818) 980-9421. 
</P>
<P>
* At CSUN, the 11th annual "Madrigal Dinner" transforms visitors into the 
dinner guests of a medieval queen. While seated in a room decorated with 
banners, shields, candles and Christmas holly, visitors are fed and entertained 
by a costumed cast of 30, all acting out parts of the royal entourage, 
including jesters, musicians and other entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
Presented in and by the University Student Union, the dinner is open to as many 
as 240 guests for each of its six nights. Visitors are encouraged to dress in 
period costume, particularly on "Costume Night" on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it took me out of the time period where I was," program director 
Sharon McKenzie said of her first "Madrigal Dinner." "I thought, 'How strange 
to be back in the 17th Century.' It took me out of modern times to another time 
and place." 
</P>
<P>
The program will be presented Dec. 15, 16, 18, 19, 21 and 22. Doors open at 7 
p.m. for the 7:30 p.m. show. Tickets are $26.50 and $30.50, $20 and $22 for 
students. For ticket information, call (818) 885-2488. 
</P>
<P>
* Another tradition is continued at the Glendale Centre Theatre, which is 
offering its long-running production of "A Christmas Carol" through Dec. 22. 
The two-hour, theater-in-the-round presentation features a 30-member cast, many 
wearing vintage costumes of Dickens' late-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
This three-decade-old version of "A Christmas Carol" was originally adapted by 
Ted Lehmann, a former director-actor at the theater, who filled the role of 
Scrooge until the mid-1970s. The program begins with a group of carolers 
singing traditional holiday songs, and they return during set changes in the 
play, theater spokeswoman Robyn Sunshine said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very close to being sold out," she said. "It's because of the longevity 
of the show. We have been putting it on for so long, people know it is always 
going to be here. 
</P>
<P>
"The audiences love it. They call as early as June to get tickets. It provides 
a good Christmas atmosphere during the hectic holidays." 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Centre Theatre is at 324 N. Orange St. For information, call (818) 
244-8481. 
</P>
<P>
* "Humbug!" is a musical adaptation of the Dickens classic at the Actors Alley 
Repertory Theatre in North Hollywood. Featuring music by Barry Fasman, Arthur 
Hamilton and Robert Caine, the play is being performed through Dec. 16 at the 
theater, 12135 Riverside Drive. Show times are 8 p.m. Tuesdays through 
Saturdays, 2 and 7 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $15. For information, call (818) 
508-4200. 
</P>
<P>
* The Valley College stage presentation of "A Christmas Carol" offers the same 
Dickens story, but with a twist. Using an adaptation by Pete Parkin, the tale 
unfolds in a contemporary alley on Christmas Eve with a group of homeless 
people who have found the Dickens book. They decide to act out the story rather 
than burn the book for warmth. The play is performed at 8 p.m. Thursdays 
through Saturdays through Dec. 15 in the Little Theater on the Van Nuys campus, 
5800 Fulton Ave. Admission is $5, $3 for students and seniors. At Thursday 
performances, a can of food will be accepted for use by the North Hollywood 
Food Pantry to feed the homeless during the holiday season. For information, 
call (818) 781-1200, Ext. 353. 
</P>
<P>
* At the Granada Theater, "A Christmas Carol" is presented as if being told in 
the home of Dickens in 1843. Performances of the Michael Paller adaptation 
begin Saturday and continue through Dec. 23 at the theater, 10648 Balboa Blvd., 
Granada Hills. Show times are 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, 7 p.m. Saturdays, 1 
and 5:30 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $8 and $10, and includes refreshments at 
intermission. For information, call (818) 363-6887. 
</P>
<P>
* Meanwhile, it's "A Pink Panther Christmas" at the Shinbone Alley Gallery in 
Studio City, where animation cels on display through January have the sly 
cartoon character dressed as Santa Claus and in other disguises. There are so 
many Pink Panther cels, gallery owner Celeste Wilson said, that a good portion 
of her animation and fine art gallery is smothered by them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have Christmas panthers, and panthers taking baths, and skiing panthers and 
panthers with real long tails because dogs have pulled on them," she said, 
laughing. "I have all kinds of panthers." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, this pink-hued monument to American pop culture has done little to 
diminish her fascination with the gallery's other featured exhibit, a show of 
Ukrainian animation cels. 
</P>
<P>
Shinbone Alley came into possession of the works after the gallery owner's 
husband, animator John David Wilson, traveled to Kiev to aid Soviet animators 
in their work for Fox Television's daytime cartoon show "Peter Pan and the 
Pirates." What he brought back were cels displaying a rare intricacy little 
seen in modern Western animation.

"When you look at it, you know it's not from here," Wilson said. "It doesn't 
look Western, it looks sort of eastern European. Also, they don't have any of 
the modern technologies to make cels like we have. So every single thing, from 
a shadow or special effect, is painted right on the cel, which makes for 
beautiful, beautiful work." 
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 Soviet cels from an original cache of about 60 remain on the 
gallery's walls, accompanied by a small display of Ukrainian folk art also 
brought back by Wilson's husband. Among those are miniature watercolor 
paintings, hand-painted eggs and ceramic figures, and wall hangings. 
</P>
<P>
"The animation is what strikes me the most," Wilson said. "It's what is 
beautiful and exciting. It's fine art, and it's not just for the animation 
collector. There are some of these animation works that would be wonderful 
hanging in someone's home." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the gallery is presenting a small display of oil and watercolor 
paintings by John David Wilson depicting mostly urban scenes of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The show opens today with what the gallery owner is calling a "Panther Party," 
highlighted with a free drawing for a Pink Panther cel, from 7 to 9 p.m. 
Shinbone Alley is open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays, and is at 
4350 Tujunga Ave. Admission is free. For information, call (818) 506-0095.

* The Westside Ballet brings its 17th annual production of Tchaikovsky's "The 
Nutcracker" to Burbank for two performances Saturday. The classic holiday story 
is directed by Yvonne Mounsey, the company's artistic director and a former 
ballerina with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and the New York City Ballet. 
Rotating in the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy this year are 15-year-old dancers 
Christina Gibbs and Romanian-born Anna Liceica. 
</P>
<P>
The Westside Ballet is the training company for the Westside School of Ballet 
in Santa Monica. It will appear at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Saturday at John Burroughs 
Auditorium, 1920 Clark Ave. Performances will continue Dec. 15 and 16 in Santa 
Monica's Lincoln Auditorium. Admission is $10 adults, $5 children. Parking is 
free. For information, call (213) 828-6211. 
</P>
<P>
* The Santa Clarita Dixieland Jazz Club celebrates its Christmas party on 
Sunday with six live sets of jazz music from the 1920s, '30s and '40s. The jazz 
concert-dance at the San Fernando Elks Lodge, 804 Pico St., will be presented 
from 1 to 5:30 p.m., with food available. Admission is $3 club members, $5 
non-members. Organizers request that those attending bring a child's gift for 
the Elks' children's Christmas party the next week. Parking is free. For 
information, call (213) 256-5828. 
</P>
<P>
* Also Sunday is the seventh annual Christmas concert by the Granada Hills 
Chorale at Granada Hills High School. Accompanied by harpist Elaine Litster, 
the 35-voice chorale will perform classical and international holiday carols, 
director Maryann Mendenhall said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those is Randall Thompson's "Alleluia," the traditional Spanish carol "Ya 
Viene la Vieja" and a Sioux tribal song titled "Stars Lead Us Ever On." 
</P>
<P>
"I built a chorale that would have some diversity," Mendenhall said. "I think 
it's culturally sound to present music from various ethnic backgrounds to our 
people to promote understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The Granada Hills Chorale was founded in 1984 when the retirement of local high 
school vocal teacher Jean Chamberlain left a musical void in the community, 
Mendenhall said. Chamberlain was then urged by former students, parents and 
local music lovers to organize the new group. And in its first six years, the 
chorale has performed at the Hollywood Bowl and Los Angeles Music Center. In 
July, the chorale will perform at New York's Carnegie Hall as part of an event 
marking the venue's 100th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas concert begins at 6 p.m. in the school's Highlander Hall, 10535 
Zelzah Ave. Admission and parking are free. For information, call (818) 
360-2209. 
</P>

PREVIEW: DANCE ENSEMBLE DEDICATES 'PASSINGS' TO DEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEATHER W. MORGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From falling in love and a baby's first smile to stiffening bones and the loss 
experienced by a death, life is a powerful leap -- flexing and dynamic, 
sometimes contorted and often painful. 
</P>
<P>
It's a dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Dance is movement, and not just the physical aspect, either. It's thoughts and 
emotions. More than any other art form, it's something that everyone does. We 
all dance, we all move, in one form or another," said Larry Attaway, 41, 
associate dean of the CalArts School of Dance. 
</P>
<P>
Attaway, who has taught at CalArts for 19 years, is also producing "Passings," 
the CalArts Dance Ensemble's fall concert tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 11th year, the ensemble is choreographed by and composed of faculty 
members Tina Yuan, Laurence Blake, Rebecca Bobele, Kurt Weinheimer and Mary Ann 
Kellogg. Also dancing are Hiroko Hojo and Colleen O'Callaghan, along with 
students Vincas Greene, Makram Hamdan, Jacques Heim and Lisa K. Locke. The 
program's five individual pieces are dedicated to Ed Emshwiller, the school's 
film and video dean who died of cancer in July at 65. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's theme was that we had no theme," Attaway said. "It was all very 
vague except that we kept coming back to Ed's life, his work, his creativity." 
</P>
<P>
Emshwiller, a pioneer video artist, used the camera to capture dancers with 
radically different points of view than what an audience would witness, and 
developed computer graphics in film and video. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all created our own material, with different staging and lighting, but 
somehow the threads are loosely tied into life, from birth to death. This 
concert is a circle and ultimately a celebration," said Yuan, this year's 
artistic director for the modern dance company, and a faculty member 10 years. 
"It's quite dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
Yuan's piece, "The Revenge of the Lonely Ghost," is a duet she performs with 
Kurt Weinheimer. Taken from a Taiwanese folk tale, the story is about a married 
woman who is killed by her husband after he learns that she's fallen in love 
with another. The woman returns as a ghost to bring her lover back to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm curious as to how the pieces will unfold," said Yuan, a stickler for 
details, who said she takes about three months to perfect the intricacies of a 
choreographed work. "Rehearsing in the studio is so different. All you see is 
the structure. But on stage, with lighting and costumes, the movements breath. 
They take on their own life." 
</P>
<P>
Attaway and Yuan know they will be asking their audience to stretch along with 
the visual power of "Passings." 
</P>
<P>
"Dance is something of a paradox. It's often best experienced by those with 
little technical understanding because it's such an emotional art. Yet, that 
same emotion often frightens people with its vicissitude," Attaway said. "But 
as long as the audience is moved, and really moved passionately, that's all 
that matters." 
</P>
<P>
"Passings," a dance concert dedicated to the memory of Ed Emshwiller, at 8 
tonight and Saturday at CalArts' Modular Theatre, 24700 McBean Parkway, 
Valencia. Tickets are $6, $3 seniors and students. Call (805) 255-1050. HEATHER

FUROR AT SPANISH-LANGUAGE TV STATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: EMPLOYEES SAY KMEX, KVEA BOWED TO ADVERTISERS BY AIRING FAVORABLE 
REPORTS ON LEGAL REFERRAL SERVICES AFTER COVERAGE OF ALLEGED INDUSTRY ABUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bitter controversy has erupted at Spanish-language television stations KMEX 
and KVEA this week after the stations broadcast laudatory follow-up stories to 
news reports about alleged abuses at legal referral services, some of which 
advertise on the stations. 
</P>
<P>
Several news employees at the two Los Angeles stations told The Times they 
complained to news executives that the follow-up stories compromised the 
integrity of their broadcasts. They said the stations bowed to pressure from 
their largest local advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
One advertiser, Centro de Proteccion Legal, withdrew its commercials from KVEA 
Channel 52 for one week after the broadcast of a report about an investigation 
of legal referrals. 
</P>
<P>
The report generated a flood of calls to both stations from immigrants who said 
they had complained about attorneys contacted through some of the services. 
</P>
<P>
Station executives denied that they were pressured to run the follow-up 
stories. They said the original reports, aired Nov. 28 and 29, were accurate 
and fair and included interviews with industry representatives. But station 
officials said the stories needed further clarification. 
</P>
<P>
"Our news department runs a completely independent operation," said KMEX 
station manger Larry Gonzales. "We're pleased with the work they've done." 
</P>
<P>
The first broadcasts reported that a "summit conference" on the alleged abuses 
by Los Angeles legal referral services was held by the State Bar of California, 
the Mexican-American Bar Assn., the Los Angeles city attorney, the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office and others. 
</P>
<P>
The services place Spanish-speaking clients in contact with attorneys who 
represent them in lawsuits involving everything from auto accidents to 
immigration matters and work injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The State Bar and others have launched a campaign to protect the 
Spanish-speaking community from uncertified legal referral services. State law 
requires the agencies to ensure their lawyers meet minimum professional 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Centro de Proteccion Legal, Los Defensores and other advertisers in the Spanish 
media maintain they do not need to be certified as referral agencies because 
they are "advertising cooperatives." 
</P>
<P>
On the day after the broadcasts, several key members of the news staffs at both 
stations said they were forced to air the follow-up segments because station 
executives feared offending the advertisers. The staff members all spoke on 
condition of anonymity , saying they feared they would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a slap in the face to us," said one staff member at KVEA. "We have more 
responsibility than other television stations in town because there's such a 
large Latino community that doesn't understand anything else and looks to us 
for information." 
</P>
<P>
George Dale, chief counsel for Centro de Proteccion Legal, said he met with 
executives at both stations after the original broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly felt that they had run a lousy story," Dale said. "We said this is 
not right. And the way for you to make it right is for you to come in and to 
ask as many questions as you want and give us a chance to answer these 
questions directly." 
</P>
<P>
Dale said Centro de Proteccion -- a major advertiser that spends more than $9 
million a year in the Spanish-language media -- withdrew its ads from KVEA for 
a week, but said that it was not a punitive action. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 29 report on KVEA featured an interview with a representative of the 
Mexican-American Bar Assn. who said that some referral services have names that 
make them appear to be government agencies. Dale said the accusations were 
false. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned that having this ad on the air while this story was running 
was wasting our money," he said. "We were not trying to put economic pressure 
or punitive pressure on the station." 
</P>
<P>
Dale said that advertising was not withdrawn from KMEX Channel 34 because its 
report was not as "outrageous" as KVEA's. 
</P>
<P>
At KVEA, the Nov. 30 follow-up story announced in Spanish: "Our journalistic 
work has revealed that these services provide a great help to many of our 
viewers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The legal assistance has been outstanding in immigration matters and also in 
recovering compensation for injuries," the broadcast said. "The help provided 
by these services of legal assistance has been from all points of view of 
singular value for our community." 
</P>
<P>
The station also ran a second follow-up on its evening news broadcast on 
Wednesday. The three-minute segment -- longer than the original broadcast -- 
featured an interview with Tito Alvarez, president of Centro de Proteccion 
Legal, but did not mention the previous allegations. 
</P>
<P>
KVEA news director Jesus Javier said that he had not been pressured to run the 
follow-up stories. But he said representatives of the legal referral services 
were "concerned about how their image is projected, about their image being 
misrepresented." 
</P>
<P>
"Like any normal media organization, we're sensitive to our clients," Javier 
added. "I'm sure that other stations confront the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Key news staff members at KVEA and KMEX said that when Centro de Proteccion 
Legal threatened to pull its ads from the stations, news executives agreed to 
grant their spokesmen extensive air time on evening news programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If the viewers are being duped and misled, they have a right to know (about 
any problems with the referral agencies)," said one member of the KMEX news 
staff. "I don't care how many millions of dollars these companies are pouring 
into KMEX or KVEA. It doesn't mean they own the airwaves." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the advertising sales department at KMEX oversaw the production of a 
"follow-up" story that consisted of extensive interviews with spokesmen for 
Centro de Proteccion Legal and Los Defensores, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
A station official denied that advertising personnel were involved with the 
follow-up story. 
</P>
<P>
One staffer described the scene in the newsroom before the Nov. 29 follow-up 
broadcast as "chaotic," with the representative of one referral service engaged 
in a heated exchange with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
KVEA station manager Steve Levin denied that advertising considerations played 
any role in the decision to run the follow-ups.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FARRAKHAN ASSAILS BUSH FOR SENDING TROOPS 
TO GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Thursday accused President George 
Bush of being "spiritually blind" and said the Bush Administration was 
furthering the "erosion" of American families by sending young fathers and 
mothers to Saudi Arabia for possible military action. 
</P>
<P>
"I am seeing television film of young men holding bottles in their babies' 
mouths because their wives are off somewhere in the Middle East," Farrakhan 
told reporters in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not right that this government should be destroying families." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to Operation Desert Shield as an effort by Western powers to 
"preserve the lifestyles of the rich and famous." 
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan made the remarks at a news conference called to discuss his group's 
"Save the Family Day" rally scheduled for Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REAL ESTATE EXECUTIVE GETS 6 YEARS IN FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former president of a Woodland Hills real estate investment company that 
defrauded more than 200 investors out of an estimated $12 million was sentenced 
Thursday in federal court to six years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Alan R. Keranen, 42, to federal prison, U.S. District Judge 
William Matthew Byrne rejected an unusual request from Keranen that he receive 
a 10-year sentence during which he would be jailed one week of every month and 
be free the rest of the time to work and pay back the investors. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne would not agree to the proposal, saying that the fraud was too serious 
not to merit a standard jail sentence. In sentencing Keranen to six years, 
Byrne also ordered him to make $3.5 million in restitution to investors.

ONLY IN L.A.

<TEXT>
<P>
We wondered aloud the other day about a reference in a 1941 L.A. tour guide to 
a former "pest farm" in Chavez Ravine. Irene Dalrymple of Gardena knew what it 
was: A hospital for contagious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an inmate there when I was 12," she writes. "There was an outbreak of 
smallpox in the summer of 1924. My sister and I and a number of kids from St. 
Cecilia's grammar school at 42nd and Normandie caught the disease. I remember 
being a little frightened when the ambulance arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"However, it turned out to be more like a summer camp. We had a great time 
playing in the sun, clad only in a pair of coveralls so the pustules would dry 
up. We slept in dormitories and ate at long tables. Our parents visited us 
behind a high wire fence across a strip of no-man's-land." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the sisters recovered within two weeks. Summer camp was over for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The board game "U.S.C.opoly," which we discussed the other day, makes a crack 
about the school's tradition of crooked student elections. 
</P>
<P>
"U.C.L.A.opoly," which we must mention in journalistic (and civic) fairness, 
jokes about Bruin students ditching class for the beach, the lack of campus 
parking ("You've been towed! Lose one turn") and rowdy fraternities ("You are 
assessed for room damages . . . "). 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA game outsells the USC version, says Bill Schulte, a spokesman for the 
manufacturer. But he noted that in Orange County, home of about 20,000 USC 
alumni, "We have stores tell us they wouldn't consider carrying the UCLA game." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, the area's nickname: Baja USC. 
</P>
<P>
Cyndi Mitchell, the Westchester woman who placed 500 signs on city poles 
appealing for information on her three lost dogs last week, still hasn't heard 
whether the city will follow through on its threat to fine her $1,000. The 
signs were on city poles in violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
She's since removed most of the signs. "And I've stopped receiving calls from 
people who think they've seen them," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs -- a black Doberman mix, a gray German shepherd and a white cocker 
spaniel -- are still missing. But her searching hasn't all been in vain. She 
said she was able to return five other stray dogs to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
When they placed an 1840s-style covered wagon outside their entrance, the 
owners of a country music saloon in Long Beach unwittingly exposed the vehicle 
to some 1990s-style hazards, notes resident Barry Colman. 
</P>
<P>
The canvas of the wagon has been covered with gang graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
With a full moon on Dec. 1, and another scheduled for Dec. 31, we could be in 
for some wacky behavior. Maybe that explains why two guys were punching it out 
in the fast lane of the Hollywood Freeway during a traffic jam Thursday 
morning.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE 5 LITTLE KINGS WHO ARE NO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County supervisors used to be called the five little kings, a 
title that in fact underestimated their power. 
</P>
<P>
That was more than a decade ago. Today, the Board of Supervisors is a shadow of 
its mighty predecessors. The perks remain and the salary is substantial -- 
$94,344 a year, going up to $99,297 Jan. 1. But anyone in the county Hall of 
Administration will tell you that much of the supervisors' authority is gone. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to understand that as you listen to the rhetoric beginning to 
emanate from the Jan. 22 special election campaign for the 1st District 
supervisorial seat. The district covers East Los Angeles and part of the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
There are four candidates -- State Sens. Charles Calderon of Whittier and Art 
Torres of Los Angeles, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina and Sarah 
Flores, former aide to retiring incumbent Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure they'll make a lot of promises. Purer water. No more toxic dumping. 
Improved county health care for the poor. Swift punishment for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
But watch out for too many promises. Major changes in the nature of Los Angeles 
County government have drastically reduced supervisorial ability to keep 
pledges made so fervently on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change was voter approval in 1978 of Proposition 13, which limited 
the property tax, then the main source of county revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, supervisors spent like mad. Every year, they'd plan construction 
projects for the next 12 months. Only after completing the list would they add 
up the cost. The final step in the budget process, believe it or not, was 
setting the property rate. 
</P>
<P>
Monuments to the big spending days can be seen throughout the county. The 
county art museum, swimming pools, branch libraries, parks, the County Jail, 
hospitals, health clinics and broad highways were built when the supes didn't 
worry about paying the bills. 
</P>
<P>
The lavish construction spending generated political patronage that flowed as 
steadily as the water in the fountain at the county Music Center. Building, 
architectural and engineering contracts went to friends and political 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Such patronage built political machines. With their vast network of 
contractors, donors, friends, staff members and other associates, supervisors 
were big men when it came time to choose candidates for city councils, the 
state Legislature or even Congress. The supervisors could kill bills in 
Sacramento or get them passed. That era produced their present salary 
arrangement. They pushed through legislation tying their pay to that of 
superior court judges. When the judges get a raise, so do the supes. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors were generous to the unfortunate as well as to their political 
friends. The needy weren't forced to stand in line all day at county hospitals, 
as they are today, nor were the mentally ill turned away from county clinics. 
</P>
<P>
That no-priority, anything-goes style budgeting soon was eating up so much 
property tax that the people rebelled. One of the rebels was Howard Jarvis, a 
loud-voiced, angry businessman who used to attend those free-spending 
supervisorial sessions. The supes dismissed him as a gadfly -- or even a crazy. 
So Jarvis went out to the Los Angeles County suburbs, where property taxes were 
exploding, and began organizing homeowners. They were the first troops in his 
Proposition 13 crusade. 
</P>
<P>
The second most-important loss of supervisorial power was in the area of 
regulating land use. 
</P>
<P>
In the fast-growth '50s, '60s and '70s, the supervisors made 
multimillion-dollar zoning decisions for vast areas of land under county 
control -- unincorporated territory, adding to their political clout. 
</P>
<P>
Now, much of the county has been incorporated into cities, leaving the 
supervisors' with a much smaller role in shaping development. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that county government has been stripped of these powers doesn't mean 
it will remain the same after the election. 
</P>
<P>
The new supervisor, no matter who wins, will emerge as a political power. As 
one of the nation's highest-ranked Latino elected officials, the winner will be 
an automatic force in Hispanic politics, a star on the political banquet 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
A new supervisor will change the dynamics of the board. Democrats Calderon, 
Molina and Torres are more liberal than Schabarum. Even former Schabarum aide 
Flores, a Republican, doesn't share her former boss' hostility to health and 
welfare spending. 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for much more. 
</P>
<P>
The Proposition 13 limit on property tax revenues made counties dependent on a 
deficit-ridden state government for the money needed for those health and 
welfare programs. The five little kings are now supplicants, and there's little 
hope of getting much help.

HELP FIND KILLER, CABBIES PLEAD; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DESPITE FIRM'S $25,000 REWARD, FEW WITNESSES HAVE COME FORTH WITH 
INFORMATION ON THE OCT. 12 SLAYING OF LA TAXI DRIVER. 
</P>

<P>
He struggled hard to rein it in, but cab driver Philip Howitt was fast losing 
his grip on his grief Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tears brimming and his voice cracking, Howitt groped for the words to 
characterize his friend and fellow driver Stanley R. Kolsky, who was shot and 
killed in a robbery of Kolsky's cab two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He . . . he wanted to meet people out on the street," said Howitt, 51, who 
drove with Kolsky at LA Taxi. "He wanted to be where they were. He liked 
people. He was a nice guy who used to encourage the new drivers like me. You 
couldn't meet a nicer guy." 
</P>
<P>
Still enraged by the slaying, Howitt and other cabbies stood with Los Angeles 
police officials Thursday morning in the 500 block of Coronado Street where 
Kolsky was killed to sound a fresh call for help in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers said that few witnesses have come forth since the Oct. 12 
slaying, despite a $25,000 reward LA Taxi has offered for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of Kolsky's killer. 
</P>
<P>
"LA Taxi put out the reward some time ago," said Los Angeles Police Department 
spokesman Lt. Doc Warkentin. "We just haven't received the response we'd hoped 
for. We think there are witnesses out there who know something." 
</P>
<P>
Warkentin said Kolsky, 53, was attacked by a robber who police suspect also 
held up another cab driver only hours before. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a struggle and Kolsky was shot in the head," said Warkentin. "The 
cab slowed, the guy climbed over the back seat and pushed (Kolsky) from the 
cab. Then the suspect sped off." 
</P>
<P>
Huddling around one of the lemon-colored LA Taxi station wagons that lined the 
block, drivers in neckties and Windbreakers bearing their company logo 
discussed the anxiety that has washed over their ranks since the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a little fear," said Calvin Williams, 29. "I screen my passengers very 
carefully now. I'm always looking." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman Gilbert, president of LA Taxi, said the slaying has compelled his 
company to intensify its standard safety-education program for drivers. He said 
drivers are encouraged to surrender fares quietly if robbed at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want them to be shot over money," Gilbert said. "Robberies are, 
fortunately, rare -- but one is one too many. And a killing. We are extremely 
upset that one of our own would be murdered in such a brutal way." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the company-sponsored program, the cabbies said, drivers are 
taking precautions of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep my crowbars up in the front seat with me," Williams said. "It's not 
visible to the passengers but it's visible to me. You also got plenty of guys 
who ride around with their 'Roscoe' on them. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, their gun."

JUDGE RULES THAT MADONNA CAN'T JUSTIFY HER HEDGE; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUITS: THE POP STAR MUST CUT BACK SHRUBBERY AND A PINE TREE AT HER HOLLYWOOD 
HILLS HOME, ENDING A TWO-YEAR BATTLE WITH NEIGHBOR.

<P>
When you live in a neighborhood where high walls, stately trees and imposing 
hedgerows can block a neighbor's million-dollar view of the city below, the 
question is: How tall is too tall? 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a posh section of the Hollywood Hills where rock star Madonna and 
neighbor Donald J. Robinson have been squabbling over the height of trees and 
bushes surrounding the singer's home, comes the answer from Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Sally Disco: Eight feet for the driveway hedge. At the 
roof line for the offending pine tree. 
</P>
<P>
In a written ruling released Thursday, Disco ordered Madonna to trim her hedges 
and the tree -- and pay real estate broker Robinson's attorneys' fees too. 
</P>
<P>
So ended a two-year legal dispute that wound up in court last week, as Robinson 
sought to prevent the pop diva from blocking his panoramic view with her 
protective landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very pleased," Robinson said after Disco's ruling was made public. "We 
all have these magnificent views, and whatever it takes to protect, I will do." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson sued Madonna, whose last name is Ciccone, in March contending that she 
had failed to comply with a written agreement about the trimming and height of 
the pine tree, driveway hedges and other landscaping on her property on Oriole 
Way. 
</P>
<P>
By failing to control her shrubbery, Robinson contended, she had reduced the 
value of his $3.5-million property, on the hillside above Madonna's, by $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The singer countersued, accusing Robinson of trespassing and making "abusive 
and derogatory statements." Her attorney charged that the neighbor "cut a hole" 
in the hedges separating the two properties to "stare at her." 
</P>
<P>
Disco rejected Madonna's charges of trespassing or "peeking," but agreed with 
the singer that six cypress trees interfering with Robinson's view had already 
been removed. 
</P>
<P>
"Judgment is to be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against defendant to 
trim the acacia hedge at the bottom of the driveway . . .," Disco said, "not in 
excess of eight feet at any time . . . and to trim the pine tree to the south 
of the pool. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if an appeal was contemplated, Madonna's attorney, Meghan Serwin, said: 
"I don't know at this time." 
</P>
<P>
At Madonna's home, the bottom of the driveway was sealed by an electrically 
controlled iron gate. Over an intercom system, an unidentified woman said there 
would be "no comment."

INATION: Monday is the deadline for the first of two property tax payments, but 
if you miss it, don't get upset. The county tax collector doesn't. . . . Late 
penalties -- 10% for the first payment, 10% and $20 for the second, plus 1.5% 
interest per month after July -- brings about $15 million into local government 
treasuries each year. . . . And there's no question the taxes will be paid, 
says Tax Collector Bob Citron. This year, 23,649 property owners were 
delinquent, but all except 14 paid up before their property was auctioned. Zan

NEWPORT BAY ALGAE BLOOM TRACED TO FERTILIZER RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Enormous amounts of fertilizer waste are still flowing into Newport Bay despite 
major improvements this year, sparking increased concern about the mysterious 
sources of the pollution that often produces a thick, green slime of algae on 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The wastes, known as nitrate-nitrogen, which wash into the bay via San Diego 
Creek, declined by 73% this year because of new anti-pollution rules at large 
nurseries in Irvine. But more than half a ton a day still gets in, and the 
sources of most of that remain unknown, according to a new report to be 
discussed today at a meeting of the region's water quality board. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a considerable amount, and we don't know where it's from," said 
Joanne Schneider, environmental programs manager for the state's Regional Water 
Quality Control Board. "It can come from anywhere in the whole Orange County 
coastal plain up to the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
The substances, found in animal waste and human sewage, nourish algae in the 
upper bay, a state wildlife sanctuary used by many varieties of birds and fish, 
as well as the lower bay, a popular recreational area and boating harbor 
surrounded by multimillion-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
Although some algae is normal, the waste contains nutrients that make algae 
much thicker and widespread than normal. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely culprits are agricultural fields and residential yards, 
greenbelts and golf courses where fertilizer is used. Other possible sources 
include the natural rising of ground water and construction sites where old, 
underground water containing agricultural waste is disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
The water quality board is expected to review the findings of its latest tests 
at a meeting in San Bernardino today, although no action will be taken on 
recommendations. The regional agency and the Orange County Environmental 
Management Agency have been conducting an ongoing sampling of the creek. 
</P>
<P>
The staffs of both agencies are recommending that the Irvine Co. -- the largest 
agricultural landowner in Orange County -- assist in the search, perhaps by 
installing gauges in its fields to measure runoff. They also recommend an 
investigation of urban sources and a discussion of more stringent controls on 
nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Bay is one of the most entrenched water-pollution problems in the 
county because it contains such a wide variety of wastes, from sewage dumped by 
boats to toxic metals from industrial runoff. Officials from Newport Beach and 
environmental agencies have been striving to clean up the bay since the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen or 20 years ago, we didn't have algae blooms in the bay at all," said 
David Harshbarger, Newport Beach's marine director. "There's been a significant 
decrease in nitrogen loading this year, but it needs to be decreased even 
further, to the point where you don't have those noticeable algae blooms." 
</P>
<P>
The algae has been a problem mostly in still-water areas, such as Newport Dunes 
and at Lido and Balboa beaches. The algae carpet is sometimes two inches thick, 
disgusting swimmers and sometimes blocking boats in Newport Harbor. It often 
also carries a strong fishy or rotten-egg stench. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost a mat on the bay, like a green indoor-outdoor carpet," Harshbarger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The peak period for the algae is April to July, when bright sunshine and warm 
water speed growth. But it can also be a year-round phenomenon. In fact, algae 
slicked the bay and beaches as recently as a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"As it got warmer, it appeared -- lots of dark green stuff all over the water 
and on the beach," said Shannon Martins, a sales representative at Newport 
Dunes Resort, where the beach was coated with algae one day last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's here a lot," she said. "I think most people here are used to it by now." 
</P>
<P>
Officials and citizens working to clean Newport Bay say algae blooms have been 
less noticeable in the lower bay in the last two years. But algae in the back 
bay -- the ecological preserve -- is worse. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a considerably worse problem in the upper bay," said Lane 
Waldner, supervisor of the county's environmental studies section. "We're not 
sure why. Maybe the bay has finally reached the point where it can't assimilate 
the nitrates coming out of San Diego Creek anymore. Maybe it's reached its 
saturation point." 
</P>
<P>
Officials are worried that extremely thick algae blooms can cut off oxygen and 
suffocate fish and small marine life in the back bay. 
</P>
<P>
"If the algae got really heavy or dense, it would actually keep life beneath it 
from surviving," said John Scholl, naturalist for the state's Upper Newport Bay 
Ecological Reserve. "If that happens, I would expect to see some crabs or other 
tidal invertebrates dying off in massive quantities." 
</P>
<P>
The wastes wash into the bay via San Diego Creek, its main tributary. The 
concrete-lined creek winds through residential, business and agricultural areas 
of Irvine and is fed by dozens of other storm channels that collect runoff from 
Newport Beach, Irvine, Tustin, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Samples in San Diego Creek at Campus Drive -- right before it flows into the 
bay -- showed an average daily flow of 1,150 pounds of nitrate-nitrogen, a 
record low in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jack Skinner, a physician and longtime Newport Beach resident credited with 
spurring efforts to clean up the bay, said: "We're going in the right 
direction, but we really have significant problems still. That's more than a 
healthy bay can really handle." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, three Irvine nurseries that irrigate about 750 acres -- 
Bordier's Nursery, Hines Wholesale Nursery and El Modeno Gardens -- were the 
primary sources of the problem, the report says. But four years ago, the water 
quality board limited the companies' discharge into the creek, and the 
nurseries installed recycling or irrigation monitoring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Their fields are now responsible for less than 35% of the waste, or about 400 
pounds a day, the report says. That means that most of it -- an average of 750 
pounds a day -- is coming from unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Anne Groot Beall, vice president of operations for El Modeno Gardens, said 
her company installed a computerized system that controls irrigation and 
fertilizer, cutting water use on its 95 acres by 30%. She said the 
environmental agencies should now concentrate on targeting other sources. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the sole contributor," she said. "We're just an easily identifiable 
source. The nurseries have done a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
Waldner of the county's environmental agency said Irvine Co. agricultural 
fields are prime suspects. But the report shows that a channel running through 
urban areas of Tustin also has high concentrations of the pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials said they are willing to discuss their role in the 
investigation, but they doubt that their fields are a large source. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our areas don't lose water," said Sat Tamaribuchi, senior director of 
environmental planning for the company. "There is no runoff from drip 
irrigation, and 80% of our 10,000 acres of agricultural fields use drip 
irrigation. There are 2,000 acres where we use sprinklers, and maybe we should 
take a look at them." 
</P>
<P>
There are no existing regulations on farm or residential runoff in Orange 
County, although the federal Environmental Protection Agency this year required 
local U.S. officials to begin addressing urban runoff into waterways. 
</P>
<P>
The bay in recent years has become a high priority for cleanup, with various 
agencies joining to work on the project. Bacteria from sewage, which is a 
health threat to swimmers, and toxics such as pesticides and lead, which can 
kill marine life, are considered serious pollutants, along with the fertilizer 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newport Bay Pollution 
</P>
<P>
About 1,150 pounds of fertilizer wastes flow from San Diego Creek into Newport 
Bay daily,according to new samples of the creek taken at Campus Drive. The 
amount is down from previous years, but the nitrate-nitrogen still frequently 
creates a thick carpet of algae on the bay.About 35% comes from three upstream 
nurseries, but the sources of the rest are unknown. The most likely suspects 
are Irvine agricultural fields and urban runoff that flows into the creek.

WAYNE WITNESS: PLAN DIDN'T CALL FOR VIOLENCE

One of the men involved in the attack on John Wayne's daughter and her 
then-boyfriend two years ago testified Thursday that he did not know that his 
partner was going to use a knife on Luby and smash Aissa Wayne's face into a 
concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We were only supposed to go in there and scare her," Jeffrey K. Bouey said. 
"Our plan did not call for any violence." 
</P>
<P>
He was the final key witness for the prosecution at the trial of Dr. Thomas A. 
Gionis, 37, accused of ordering the Oct. 3, 1988, assault on Roger W. Luby and 
Wayne, who is his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey also steadfastly insisted that he was told by the man who hired him that 
the mission was on orders from "the woman's husband." He and Jerrel 
Hintergardt, 38, were hired by private detective Dan Gal, Bouey testified. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey, 38, said he never heard Gionis' name and did not know the victim by name 
or that she was the daughter of John Wayne. Gionis, 37, is charged with eight 
felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy, false imprisonment 
and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, 34, and Luby, 52, were attacked after they returned to Luby's Newport 
Beach estate after a workout at a health club. The two assailants, armed with 
loaded guns, slipped onto the grounds when the gate to the property opened for 
Wayne's car. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend Gionis wanted Wayne "roughed up" because he was losing a 
custody battle over their daughter, who was nearly 2 at the time. Since Gionis' 
arrest last year in the incident, Wayne has had primary custody of the little 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey's testimony is critical to the prosecution's case, primarily because he 
claims he saw Gal on the car telephone with "the client" shortly before the 
assault. Phone records show Gal, 32, made two calls then to Gionis' car phone, 
and a third to Gionis' house. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' defense attorney, John D. Barnett, contends that the doctor never took 
any of those calls. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans rested his case after just four days of 
testimony, without placing Gal on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, convicted at a separate trial, is already serving an eight-year 
prison sentence for his role in the assault. Gal and Bouey are awaiting trial. 
Bouey is expected to plea-bargain in exchange for his cooperation with 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey took the witness stand late in the day Wednesday. Defense attorney 
Barnett began his cross-examination with an aside to him: 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bouey, you seem like a nice enough fellow, how'd you get mixed up in 
something like this?" 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of his cross-examination Thursday, Barnett had Bouey glaring at 
him and accusing him of grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey testified that he went along with the Gal-Hintergardt plan because he was 
going to be paid $1,500 -- he eventually got $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett: "For $1,500, you drove down to Newport Beach and endangered the lives 
of two people you didn't even know? For $1,500?" 
</P>
<P>
Bouey: "That's right. I needed the money for a career change." 
</P>
<P>
Bouey said he was an accountant but hated the work and wanted to set up some 
kind of business of his own. He said Hintergardt wanted to get into a new 
business too. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on Barnett's motion that the case against Gionis be dismissed is 
scheduled for this afternoon. Unless Superior Court Judge Theodore E. Millard 
grants the motion, the defense will begin its case Monday.

DANA PARSONS: A RAMBO-ORIENTED HOOSIER SEES WAR WITH '80S EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent afternoon and the living is easy in Southern California. Marty 
Shanahan has the entire outdoor basketball court to himself and is doing one of 
the things he likes most in life: shooting hoops. He makes a spin move to the 
basket and hits the shot. He goes out 15 feet and hits a jumper. He dribbles 
between his legs and practices another move to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
He came out of the small Indiana town of Hebron and, like lots of other Hoosier 
kids, has been shooting baskets since he was 3 years old. He plays pickup games 
almost every night on this court across from Edison High School in Huntington 
Beach. He's got some other things going too. He left Indiana after high school 
and a stint in a Chicago steel mill, deciding to give California a shot. Now, 
at 21, he's got a job in a sporting goods store, a fiancee and a baby on the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting hoops alone, he says, is "almost like meditation." It gives a guy a 
chance to think about things. 
</P>
<P>
These days, he says, he's been doing a lot of thinking about the Persian Gulf 
crisis. It doesn't take much prompting: The Marines from Camp Pendleton who 
used to regularly show up to play way up here in Fountain Valley haven't been 
around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got about 15 friends over in the gulf, just from Indiana," he says. "It's 
a scary situation. This war ain't going to be no little war, like Panama. This 
one is going to be decided with nuclear. That guy (Saddam Hussein) is totally 
insane." 
</P>
<P>
There's a part of him, he says, that feels guilty about not being there with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I saw them was on graduation night from high school (in 1988). 
There are a bunch of guys over there from the basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the guys signed up with the Marines because life in a small Midwest 
town doesn't offer many opportunities, he says. Doing a military hitch is a 
good way to save enough money to go to college. Instead, his buddies find 
themselves staring at war. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go if I wasn't getting married and didn't have a baby on the way. I'd have 
nothing to lose. My parents would be all I have, and my Mom and Dad would be 
100% behind me. I'd definitely go. I'd fight for my country." 
</P>
<P>
I mentioned that when I was college age, most of my friends were trying to find 
ways to stay out of Vietnam. He reminds me that guys of his age have grown up 
during the '80s watching Rambo and Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have signed up for Vietnam," he says. "I never grew up with war like 
people did in the '70s and '60s, but I've seen films of the protest 
demonstrations. If they didn't like it, why didn't they go over there and help 
out and help get it over with? Don't sit here and smoke dope and get high. Go 
help somebody. To me, they were bums. That's how I look at it." 
</P>
<P>
I asked where he developed his patriotic bent. He's not sure but remembers 
watching TV programs about the Vietnam War -- documentaries showing real 
footage. "Watching Vietnam movies caught my eye when I was about 12 or 13 years 
old. Seeing guys going over there straight out of high school and then seeing 
things like booby traps. That was the kind of thing we played when we were 
playing war as kids, and then to see the real thing and see guys lose their 
legs. That's when it hit me. I would have said, 'I've got to go help out.' " 
</P>
<P>
He's convinced that a war with Iraq wouldn't last long. "I figure we are going 
to go to war. I say it's going to last a month, at most." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt it would be a U.S. victory? "No doubt," he says. "Nobody has the 
weapons and training we do." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his sense of duty, Shanahan says he has no thirst for war: "Watching 
movies, especially Vietnam movies, is pretty scary. Just the thought of having 
grenades or bullets hit you. . . . I lie in bed and think what happens to all 
the guys who die." 
</P>
<P>
And while he says he would gladly fight for his country, he also assumes that 
he would be afraid. His grandfather once told him it's the cocky guys in war 
who get killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel really sorry for those guys over there. We've got it made over here, 
and they get to suffer. Life's a bitch over there, I bet. I think about them a 
lot and say a little prayer for them at night. That's about all you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 I let him get back to his hoops. He's got the fluid shot of a kid who's played 
the game a long time. It's too bad that young kids have to go into combat, I 
suggested. "I figure it's like a basketball game," Shanahan says. "When you're 
called into the game, you go in and do the best you can."

UNSEASONABLE HOT SPELL WILTS HOLIDAY SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Pumpkin City's Christmas Tree lot in Santa Ana on Thursday, the sun had 
apparently sapped much of the holiday mood, not to mention sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people just aren't in the Christmas spirit when it's 80 degrees 
outside," said Harold Derentz, a salesman at the lot. "We do more business from 
6 o'clock (p.m) to 9 o'clock (p.m.) than we do all day when it's warm." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's unseasonably hot weather wilted sales, said Derentz with a frown. 
"By about 20%." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Orange County experienced temperatures in the 80s on Thursday. San Juan 
Capistrano recorded the highest temperature in the nation Thursday at 88 
degrees, with Santa Ana close behind at 86, according to weather officials. 
Newport Beach recorded a high of 78 degrees while Anaheim recorded an 83, and 
El Toro logged an 81. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts to 
The Times, said Derentz can expect sales to slump again today. "The highs may 
even be a couple of degrees warmer in places." 
</P>
<P>
The weekend may bring some relief. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be less intense and the winds will be light," Burback explained. "It 
will still be dry, but we're expecting a gradual cooling off on Saturday and 
Sunday. There won't be any real change until Tuesday, when it may be 10 degrees 
cooler." 
</P>
<P>
And that, said Burback, will depend entirely on a cold front now off Vancouver 
Island in the Gulf of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look like that front is going to reach Southern California," said 
Burback. "But you can always hope." 
</P>
<P>
It is unusual but not unheard of for San Juan Capistrano to post the nation's 
high. It has already happened once or twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists have long attributed San Juan Capistrano's propensity for 
blistering temperatures to a precise and unusual mixture of several different 
factors. Chief among them is the city's proximity to the mountains that run 
through Camp Pendleton and on up through the eastern edge of Orange County.

DISABLED WORKERS' TREE FARM RAIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Grinch tried to steal Christmas from the Daybreak Tree Farm and Nursery 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of the nursery, a nonprofit business that employs and trains the 
handicapped, had worked all year potting plants and tending trees to prepare 
for Christmas, their busiest season. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Monday night, burglars sliced through a chain-link fence, chopped down 
Christmas trees and stole $4,000 worth of wreaths, ornaments and potted plants 
from the farm at 1550 N. Glassell St. 
</P>
<P>
The profits from the plants were to benefit the nursery's handicapped 
employment program. Hoping to save part of the season, the nursery immediately 
ordered more plants from its supplier, Santiago Greenhouses in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
But Santiago Greenhouses ended up playing Santa Claus, replacing the nursery's 
losses for free. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't believe it. We were in tears," nursery director Mary Lou Bayle 
said. "They turned a very bad day into a very good day." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Greenhouses donated Daybreak's order, threw in an additional 150 
plants and later offered more poinsettias. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Tursini, manager of Santiago Greenhouses, said owner Mark Stansbury made 
the donation without thinking twice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not anything that extraordinary," Tursini said. "It's just helping people 
who are trying to help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Daybreak Tree Farm and Nursery has trees on 2 acres in north Orange. The 
farm, a division of the nonprofit Speech &amp; Language Development Center in 
Buena Park, offers job training to the mentally, physically and emotionally 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Daybreak program is to help participants learn to be 
financially independent, said Dede Ginter, spokeswoman for the Speech &amp; 
Language Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
This week, they learned a tougher lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"They learned a lesson about the real world and that there are rotten people 
who cut down Christmas trees," Ginter said. 
</P>
<P>
But the lesson had another moral, said Tursini. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of the times and it's sad," he said. "There's really not much you 
can do -- but you can try to help a little bit."MARY HELEN BERG

FOUR PEOPLE HURT IN FREEWAY PILEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four people were taken to local hospitals Thursday after a tractor-trailer and 
seven cars collided in a chain-reaction pileup on the Artesia Freeway, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known how the 7:25 a.m. accident at the Orangethorpe Avenue exit 
started, CHP officer Linda Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
The four unidentified drivers were treated at two nearby hospitals and 
released, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said that accident made the morning rush hour miserable on both the 
westbound and eastbound sides of Artesia Freeway while cleanup crews removed 
the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 feet of the center divider was damaged when the truck nearly tore 
through it, Burrus said. It was unclear if the truck caused the accident or if 
it plowed into the center divider to evade the colliding cars. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said the investigation is continuing.

<P>
MEETING WILL DECIDE MEASURES FOR BALLOT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Voters may be asked in March whether they want to triple council members' 
salaries and pay a special tax for more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is also discussing whether to ask voters in the special 
election to drop the requirement that the mayor be a member of the council, 
thereby opening the race to any Anaheim resident. 
</P>
<P>
The council will hold a special meeting today to meet the Dec. 7 deadline for 
deciding which measures to include in the March election, which was called to 
vote on a proposed mobile home rent control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The salary proposal would increase council members' monthly pay to $1,200, one 
of the highest rates in the county. The mayor of Newport Beach receives just 
over $1,370 monthly, and council members in Santa Ana, Orange and Irvine make 
about $600 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
That proposal was shelved in the November election when it became a heated 
campaign issue among council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Irv Pickler recommended doubling the council salary to $800, which 
the mayor now receives. The council also will consider that today. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Fred Hunter proposed the tax for more officers, which he dubbed the 
Public Safety Assessment, and suggested taking an advisory vote in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department estimates it needs 40 more officers and 20 other 
employees to work as dispatchers, clerks and mechanics and in other supportive 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter estimated that the proposal would cost $4.15 million a year, and that 
the tax would be needed for 10 to 15 years. City officials have not estimated 
what the tax would be per person or household, nor do they expect to offer an 
estimate on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Tom Daly and William D. Ehrle expressed support for Hunter's 
proposal. "The longer we procrastinate, the worse it'll get," Ehrle said. 
</P>
<P>
Additional measures that failed in the November election, or were not put on 
the ballot because of space considerations, may also be included in March. LISA

TOXIC SPILL CLOSES STREET FOR 2 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A toxic chemical spill closed a half-mile stretch of Madero south of Los Alisos 
Boulevard for two hours Thursday, but no one was injured or evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Two 4-liter glass bottles of highly flammable liquid dichloromethane broke open 
at 12:40 p.m. in the trailer of a truck, which was delivering the chemical to a 
nearby light industrial complex, Orange County Firefighter Terry Gorgen said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Motor Cargo of Montebello truck called 911 and the Orange 
County Fire Department's Hazardous Materials team, three engine companies and 
seven Orange County sheriff's deputies responded, Gorgen said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was confined to the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgen said dichloromethane is used in organic chemistry and in paint solvents. 
Besides being explosive, it can cause respiratory distress, vomiting and burns, 
he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
</P>
<P>
FOR JAPANESE INTERN, A WHOLE NEW WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Accustomed to the quiet and strictly disciplined students of her native Japan, 
teaching intern Miwako Nishiyama went into culture shock when she arrived 
recently at Harold Ambuehl Elementary School and was exposed to its typical 
American students. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are so frank and friendly," she said. "When I ask a question, the 
children all raise their hands to answer, even if they don't know the answer. 
In Japan, students hesitate to answer even if they have the knowledge because 
they are afraid to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Nishiyama, a 25-year-old trading company clerk and prospective English teacher 
in her native Tokyo, arrived at Ambuehl in October for a six-month stay. Her 
internship is sponsored by the Japanese School Internship Program, a nonprofit 
group that places 200 Japanese annually as unpaid interns in American and 
Canadian schools. 
</P>
<P>
Nishiyama helps Ambuehl's teachers with their regular lessons, gives 
presentations on such staples of the Japanese culture as the paper-folding art 
of origami and teaches Japanese to a group of gifted students. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Kathy George, in whose home Nishiyama is living, said she volunteered 
her school for the program because students need to learn about other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"With the growing influence of the Pacific Rim, exposure to the Japanese is 
invaluable," she said. "And the enthusiasm of the children has been wonderful. 
Adults fear trying to learn a new language, but for the children it has been 
pure enjoyment." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Nishiyama worked with a group of six gifted students, teaching them 
how to ask for items they would find in a department store. 
</P>
<P>
And while words such as zubon (pants) and hon (book) were unfamiliar, the 
students were surprised to learn that the Japanese have borrowed English words 
such as nekutai (necktie), hankachi (handkerchief) and kamera for items not 
native to their culture. 
</P>
<P>
Students in a sixth-grade class said they were shocked when Nishiyama told them 
of life in a Japanese school. 
</P>
<P>
"She told us that if a student talks or gets out of his seat, that is 
considered an embarrassment to his family," Shawna Draper said. "That's really 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of school, Nishiyama said she is enjoying American life, although she 
misses Japanese food and Tokyo's transit system. One twist, she said, was 
discovering microwaves, dishwashers and other Japanese-made kitchen gadgets 
that one never sees in Japanese homes. 
</P>
<P>
Another is the American preoccupation with holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"For Halloween and Thanksgiving, everyone was so excited," she said. "And now 
it is 'Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.' But all of this is very nice." TERRY

Veterans and elderly citizens throughout the county spoke out Thursday against 
a proposed reorganization of county agencies, claiming that the budget-cutting 
plan would bury their programs in the bowels of county bureaucracy and 
ultimately diminish services now available to them. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report to be presented to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, 
the financially strapped county could save $195,000 annually by eliminating the 
relatively small Community Services Agency and shifting its duties to larger 
county divisions, such as the Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges that the county created the Community Services Agency 
in 1979 to oversee a small number of programs, such as the Veterans Services 
Office and the Area Agency on Aging, after concluding that such groups would be 
better served by a small, independent agency. 
</P>
<P>
But last summer, the board ordered county planners to consider disbanding the 
CSA as a means of streamlining services and cutting costs. The county faced a 
$46-million shortfall last summer and next year's outlook is even bleaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to be buried so deep in lower levels of management that we 
will have no visibility," said John Kumbera, 69, a Brea widower and chairman of 
the Area Agency on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to see the supervisors, we'll have to go to four or five levels above 
us just to get permission," Kumbera continued. "What a lot of seniors are 
saying is that this means that we're no longer very important in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
The Area Agency on Aging provides services available to all county residents 
over 60. The agency makes about 20,000 referrals a year for seniors seeking 
medical, legal or other help. It also testifies before the board on issues 
affecting the elderly and reviews and comments on scores of bills introduced at 
the state and federal level, Executive Director Peggy Weatherspoon said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition the agency, administers $7 million in federal funds, most of which 
is contracted out to providers of a wide range of services for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see any benefits (in the reorganization)," Weatherspoon said. "We 
are very efficient. . . . We served 1 million meals at 61 sites last year." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed reorganization plan has already drawn fire from women activists 
around the state because it calls for the elimination of the Commission on the 
Status of Women, created 15 years ago to monitor issues ranging from child care 
to spouse abuse. 
</P>
<P>
A summary of the report presented to supervisors' aides earlier this week 
suggested that the reorganization would save about $122,000 by disbanding the 
women's commission and $73,000 by reductions in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those cost savings, the report says the county could claim an 
additional $150,000 to $230,000 in federal and state funds by shifting some the 
agency's programs into the county's Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans protesting the the reorganization Thursday said that it would create 
the stigma that the services they receive are welfare, rather than benefits 
earned. Some also expressed the fear that as part of the Social Services 
Agency, the veteran's office would lose out to other programs that the county 
is required to provide under state or federal law. The veterans office is not a 
so-called mandated program. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're under the welfare program and it comes to a crunch about money, who's 
going to lose?" asked Major Anderson, 75, a retired Marine officer who served 
in World War II and the Korean War. Anderson is now chairman of the Orange 
County Veterans Advisory Council. "We need someone in there fighting for us," 
Anderson continued. "We've lost damn near everything. I can't even get buried 
anymore."

SCHNEIDERMAN, FORMER DEAN AT UCI, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former UC Irvine dean Howard A. Schneiderman, a top executive for the Monsanto 
Co. who is credited with building the university's nationally respected School 
of Biological Sciences, has died after a lengthy battle with leukemia, 
university officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman died Wednesday night at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard was one of the greatest scientists we've ever had here," said William 
Parker, assistant executive vice chancellor at UCI. "He was one of those 
handful of people who helped characterize the spirit of UCI. Some of his ideas 
made the School of Biological Sciences the quality school it is today." 
</P>
<P>
At Monsanto headquarters in St. Louis, he was remembered Thursday as the chief 
architect of the company's shift from chemicals to biotechnology in the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Schneiderman was the moving force behind the corporation's move into 
biotechnology," Monsanto spokesman Glynn Young said. "There were some programs 
already under way, but what Dr. Schneiderman did was make it (biotechnology) a 
primary research function of the corporation. He gave it strong direction and 
leadership and turned it into the major research of this corporation." 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City in 1927, Schneiderman garnered many appointments and 
awards in his academic career. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Swarthmore College 
in Pennsylvania, he earned his master's degree in zoology and doctorate in 
physiology at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
A specialist in genetics, insect physiology and endocrinology, Schneiderman was 
lured to UCI from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1969 to be 
chairman of the 4-year-old university's department of developmental and cell 
biology. His forceful personality and infectious enthusiasm caught on 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dean of the School of Biological Sciences when Howard arrived," recalled 
longtime friend and UCI psychobiology professor James L. McGaugh. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I saw him, I resigned as dean and recommended that he take over," 
said McGaugh, now director of UCI's Center for Neurobiology of Learning and 
Memory. "I said: 'That's the correct dean. This is the kind of person I will 
work for, that I will listen to and interact with.' Those are very, very rare 
people. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, at the age of 48, he became the second UCI professor to be elected to 
the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. The same year, he was named a 
fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman left UCI in 1979 to become Monsanto's senior vice president for 
research and development projects, a post he held until his death. He 
maintained an unpaid UCI faculty position and close ties with campus 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a giant in academia and in industry," recalled UCI Chancellor Jack 
Peltason, who consulted often with Schneiderman in recent years on varied 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the giants of this campus, one of its builders," Peltason said. 
"Everything he did, he did full bore. . . . He was one of the wise people." 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman is survived by his wife, Audrey; a daughter, Anne Schneiderman of 
Ithaca, N.Y., and a son, John Schneiderman of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. on Jan. 6 in St. Louis, at Washington 
University's Graham Chapel. The family has requested that gifts be made in his 
name to the medical oncology division of Washington University's School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
A separate memorial service is being planned at UCI for early next year, 
Peltason said.

COAST HIGHWAY WIDENING MAY DOUBLE IN COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of widening a two-mile stretch of Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington 
Beach could jump from $4 million to more than $8 million because of unexpected 
construction costs and a higher-than-expected price tag for beach parkland 
along the route, transportation officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, plans to widen the stretch between Beach Boulevard and Brookhurst 
Street on the city's southern edge are so far behind schedule that 
transportation officials fear the segment could become a traffic bottleneck. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the project, originally set to begin in 1989, is not expected to get 
under way until early next year and be completed in 1993, said Walt Hagen, 
deputy district director in Orange County for the California Department of 
Transportation, which is handling the project. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the effort to add a lane in each direction would be completed 
nearly two years after highway sections to the north and south have been 
widened. 
</P>
<P>
Work on Coast Highway in Newport Beach between Highland Street and Newport 
Boulevard is expected to be finished in about a month, Hagen said. An expanded 
six-lane bridge over the nearby Santa Ana River will likely be completed in 
mid-1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach officials, meanwhile, say they anticipate opening an 
additional lane in each direction between Beach Boulevard and Golden West 
Street by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that once it gets opened up to the north and to the south it's 
going to become a problem," Hagen said. "What it could end up becoming is a 
situation where there is an additional wait for motorists at traffic signals." 
</P>
<P>
The project was delayed primarily because of negotiations with the California 
Coastal Commission over various environmental requirements, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the commission wanted to ensure that environmentally sensitive 
sand dunes that will be leveled on the road's eastern edge are re-created 
nearby. The dunes serve as a nesting place for various coastal birds and are 
scattered with a variety of plants. 
</P>
<P>
To re-create the dunes, Caltrans has been forced to purchase extra land along 
the route, which parallels Huntington State Beach, and the cost for right of 
way has risen. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Caltrans and the state Department of Parks and Recreation, which 
controls the beachfront property, have some "differences" over what the 
Transportation Department should pay for the right of way, Hagen said.

MIKE PENNER: HAPPY TO BE HEADING INTO THE TIGERS' DEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louisiana State University, home to Dr. Brown's Profound Mound of Rebound, 
Shaquille (The Unreal) O'Neal, has braced itself for a Saturday night visit by 
No. 2-ranked Arizona. But first, the Tigers get tossed an hors d'oeuvre 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Panther pate, served up by the friendly caterers at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
How in the name of Cal State Fullerton do these things happen? Chapman at LSU. 
Not Rex Chapman. Not Tracy Chapman. Orange County's very own, very small, very 
beatable Chapman -- the little school that couldn't win at Cal State Hayward or 
UC Davis but is going to give it a shot in Baton Rouge, or at least try to make 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, LSU had more talent than Minnesota or Miami -- NBA or NCAA, it 
didn't matter -- and down in the bayou, they're still trying to figure out how 
the Tigers didn't make it to Denver. Chris Jackson, the scintillating point 
guard, did, jumping after his sophomore season to the run-and-lose Nuggets. 
Seven-footer Stanley Roberts also bailed out early, leaving for Europe and 
leaving O'Neal behind, a twinless peak. 
</P>
<P>
"So," says Chapman Coach Bob Boyd, pouncing on the punch line, "we got 'em 
while they're down." 
</P>
<P>
As for Chapman, Boyd's not quite sure yet, although down would be tough after 
last season. The Chapmen went 11-15 and 3-11 in the CCAA. That was also good 
for last place. 
</P>
<P>
Surely Boyd could have thought of a better way to spend a December weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Like, maybe, practicing for Cal State Stanislaus. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, however, has a different way of looking at it. Boyd has a different way 
of looking at a lot of things, which partially explains why, at age 59, he 
traded a life of greens and chlorine in Palm Springs for twice-weekly headaches 
every winter in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd says tonight's presentation would have never been possible without his 
"long-standing friendship with Dale Brown." He says Brown agreed to schedule 
Chapman out of the kindness of his heart, to "do us a favor." 
</P>
<P>
Good thing Boyd hasn't invited Jerry Tarkanian out to the house lately. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, L.A. State played LSU, mainly because their coach is from Baton 
Rouge, and Dale knew him," Boyd says. "Dale played them as a favor to L.A. 
State, and he's doing the same in our case. There aren't many Division I 
schools that will play Division II teams anymore. With the importance of power 
ratings and what that might mean for a postseason berth, they can't afford to. 
</P>
<P>
"Dale's schedule is strong enough to allow a Division II opponent without 
hurting his power rating. LSU plays an 18-game schedule in the SEC, plays 
Arizona and has already played Villanova. They don't mind playing one or two 
Division II teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's why we don't play the Big Sky. The Big Sky can't afford to play us. 
They only send one team to the tournament each year, and their schedules are 
not that strong to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
That still doesn't explain where the favor comes in. 
</P>
<P>
"The guarantee we're going to get for playing these two games (about a combined 
$25,000 from LSU and McNeese State) is going to pay for our trip and leave a 
few dollars left over," Boyd says. "It's a very profitable trip for us, other 
than the effects of the loss. This allows us to get out on the road, see what 
Division I is like and get some good experience." 
</P>
<P>
It will be an experience. But good? Boyd should talk to Gene Murphy. Murphy's 
Cal State Fullerton football team went 1-11 after his athletic director sold 
him out for early-season pay days, and pastings, at Auburn and Mississippi 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like that story line," Boyd says. "I don't like that comparison at 
all. I don't think, down the line, it's going to hurt us to do it. Cal State 
Fullerton did their thing with Auburn, and I don't think it helped them. I 
don't think they'll do it again. 
</P>
<P>
"Relatively speaking, we're in a little better shape. We've improved 
considerably over last year, and we plan to do this every year. Next year, 
we've scheduled Hawaii, Utah and (Texas) El Paso. Maybe later we can get a 
school in the Big Ten, too." 
</P>
<P>
There is one difference between playing Auburn in football and LSU in 
basketball: At LSU, you probably won't need a stretcher to make player 
substitutions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the final score is going to hurt. And how does Boyd plan a defense for 
O'Neal, the 7-foot-1 thunderclap who broke rims and blew minds during last 
summer's Olympic Festival, who averages 26 points and 15 rebounds, who might be 
the best collegiate big man since Mr. Robinson joined the Navy? 
</P>
<P>
"I told Frantz Reyes to shut him down," Boyd says, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz Reyes is a junior forward at Chapman. He stands 6-6, weighs 215. There 
is no truth to the rumor that Reyes drew the assignment when Boyd asked for 
volunteers, and every other Panther took a step backward. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice," Boyd muses, "if we could make O'Neal at least shoot." Of 
course. That would solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd asks for time. He wants to append a footnote. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, he just dunks," Boyd says. "When he catches that thing with 
his back to the goal, he ball-fakes, spins and gets that big ol' body inside 
and slams it in. We'd like to make him work a little harder." 
</P>
<P>
Boyd says he isn't asking for much. "We just don't want to go back there and 
play a complete farce," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, though, he knows his best asset is his 20-year relationship with 
Brown. Before LSU is counting in the triple digits, Boyd is counting on Dale to 
have mercy. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that what friends are for?

FULLERTON DOWNS SACRAMENTO; RILEY GETS 500TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colleen Riley, in her 22nd season as women's basketball coach at Fullerton 
College, got her 500th victory Wednesday when the Hornets defeated Sacramento 
City, 80-68, in the first round of the College of the Sequoias Tournament in 
Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
Riley is the first community college women's coach in the nation to reach the 
500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really glad it's over," Riley said. "The team did some really nice things; 
when I turned around, all the fans and the players had T-shirts saying 'Riley 
wins 500.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm really glad we won it, but I'm most happy that we're 8-0 and 
moving on in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
The victory came with ease. Fullerton led, 43-29, at halftime and increased the 
lead to as many as 26 in the second half. Nikki Durity led Fullerton with 20 
points and 10 rebounds. Vicki Evans added 14 points, Kris Kelly 12 and Christa 
Ramirez eight points and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is 8-0, improving Riley's record is 500-93. 
</P>
<P>
In another College of the Sequoias tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 85, Kings River 52 -- Jenny Sullivan scored 18 points and Elizabeth 
Sirchia had 15 for Golden West (7-0). 
</P>
<P>
In the Golden West men's basketball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 78, Glendale 75 -- Jason Joseph made a free throw with 14 seconds 
left and Toriano James made another with three seconds left to secure Golden 
West's first-round victory. Joseph's point gave Golden West a 77-75 lead, and 
Glendale's Alfonso Pule missed a 10-foot jumper that could have tied the score. 
James was fouled getting the rebound. Scott Campbell led Golden West with 20 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Ric Van Scoyoc added 19 for Golden West (4-5), which plays Cerritos tonight at 
8 p.m. in one semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Barbara men's tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach 104, Saddleback 95 -- Ray Ankton hit a three-point basket with two 
seconds left to give Saddleback an 89-86 lead in regulation, but Long Beach's 
Carroll Thompson made a three-pointer at the buzzer to tie the game. Long Beach 
outscored Saddleback, 15-6, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Jose men's tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 88, Contra Costa 84 -- Brian Spratt made eight consecutive free 
throws down the stretch to help the Pirates (7-3) hold on in the first round of 
the tournament. Spratt, who led OCC with 20 points, made all 12 of his free 
throws in the game. 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference men's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 100, East Los Angeles 88 -- Garrison Hunter had 20 points and Bobby 
Terry had 19 to lead visiting Fullerton (6-4) over East Los Angeles (6-5).

A NEW DETERMINATION DRIVES CYPRESS' STEGALL; 
</P>
<P>
WRESTLING: HE WASN'T AT HIS BEST AT LAST YEAR'S STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
TOURNAMENT. HE HOPES FOR A REVERSAL TODAY.

<P>
Ken Stegall remembers his appearance in the state community college wrestling 
tournament last year in Fresno, but not with a great deal of affection. 
</P>
<P>
He was sick -- had a sore throat -- and in his own words, "was pretty much 
hating life." But he wrestled anyway, lost twice and watched the rest of the 
competition from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Stegall has returned to the tournament, which begins today on his 
home mats at Cypress College. It continues Saturday with the championship 
matches starting at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Stegall's chances of placing high in the 190-pound division are pretty good 
too, mainly because of last year's failure. 
</P>
<P>
"After it was over," he said, "I started to do a little extra so it wouldn't 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
For Stegall, extra meant more running and more time spent on technique, instead 
of relying mostly on upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been impressive. Stegall is 25-2 and has been ranked in the 
top three in the state in his weight class all season. He won his division last 
weekend at the South-Central Regional in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I've beaten all the top people in my class," Stegall said. "So I'm ready for 
this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Stegall graduated from Enterprise High School in Redding in 1989. He considered 
attending nearby Shasta College, but it didn't have a wrestling program. He 
also thought about Lassen College, which has one of the state's top programs, 
but he didn't want to live in a dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress entered into his thinking only because his grandfather had been in 
Southern California about this time in 1988, and read in a newspaper that the 
Chargers had just missed winning the state title. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw that Cypress was pretty good," Stegall said. "I had the chance to move 
down and decided it might be worth a try." 
</P>
<P>
So Stegall moved into his great grandmother's house in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he finished with an 18-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to just overpower people like I did in high school," he said. "But it 
didn't work that much because now they were just as strong as I was." 
</P>
<P>
Stegall started wrestling as a 205-pound high school sophomore in the 
heavyweight division, where he was giving away as much as 40 pounds to 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just too lazy to lose the weight to get down (to 190)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He finished one place shy of the state tournament as a sophomore and junior. In 
his senior year, he decided to make the effort to lose the weight and finished 
fourth in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother helped me a lot," he said. "I got a whole new diet that cut out all 
the fat, and it really wasn't that hard. I guess I should have done it sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Besides Ken Stegall, Orange County's best chances for a state title are with 
Sam Lopez of Cypress. Lopez, who finished third last season, is 30-0 and 
top-ranked at 118 pounds. Jason Booth of Rancho Santiago, also in the 118-pound 
class, has been unranked all season but won the South Regional. Rancho Santiago 
will have 10 wrestlers, Cypress seven and Golden West six in the tournament. 
Golden West had two wrestlers -- Derek Hite (134) and Mike Biss (158) -- place 
second in the South Central Regional. . . . The tournament's two-day schedule: 
Today's first session is from noon to 3:30 p.m., the second from 7 to 9:30 p.m. 
Saturday's first session runs from noon to 4:30 p.m. where third through eighth 
place will be determined. The finals are scheduled for 7 p.m. Saturday. . . . 
Admission is $12 for all four sessions or $5 for adults and $3 for students and 
children for individual sessions.

BRIEFCASE: UPSCALE HOUSING IN O.C. STILL LESS THAN HOMES IN U.K., JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by John O'Dell Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a recent wire service story about executives hunting for homes, a writer in 
Vancouver, Canada, compared the prices of upscale "executive" homes in suburban 
Chevy Chase, Md., with those in "Los Angeles' Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, either the writer needs a geography lesson or Orange County needs a 
better publicist. 
</P>
<P>
The story said that executive housing in Orange County, which hasn't belonged 
to Los Angeles for 102 years, carries a median price tag in the $500,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound like a lot, but it's cheap compared to the cost of executive 
homes in Tokyo and London, which at well over $1 million are among the world's 
most expensive. In contrast, executive homes in Pittsburgh and Belfast, 
Northern Ireland, are among the cheapest at less than $225,000.

ICN LOSES EFFORT TO BLOCK RIBAVIRIN 'HAZARD ALERT'; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: JUDGE SUPPORTS STATE'S CHOICE OF WORDS TO WARN HOSPITALS OF THE DRUG'S 
POSSIBLE DANGER TO PREGNANT WOMEN. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Mesa-based ICN Pharmaceuticals lost a bid in Sacramento County Court on 
Thursday to prevent the state from issuing a "Hazard Alert" to California 
hospitals about the health threat that ICN's controversial drug ribavirin may 
pose for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Department of Health Services said they intend to issue the 
three-page letter today to more than 500 acute-care hospitals, where pregnant 
workers and visitors can be accidentally exposed to the drug, a fine white 
powder used to treat a seasonal childhood respiratory ailment. 
</P>
<P>
The alert cites scientific studies showing that ribavirin causes birth defects 
in animals exposed to even low doses. It warns that the antiviral drug may 
accidentally escape from oxygen tents, where it is administered for long 
periods as an inhalant to children suffering from respiratory syncytial virus. 
</P>
<P>
ICN's primary objection to the health department action, however, had to do 
with the words Hazard Alert printed at the top of the letter. The phrase was 
"inflammatory" and would scare hospital workers into not using ribavirin, 
argued ICN attorney Henry Ben-Zvi of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that babies will die because of this," said Ben-Zvi, in 
asking for a temporary restraining order against the state. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Richard K. Park rejected the company's arguments and 
denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is some risk to pregnant workers, why shouldn't they use a title that 
gets their attention?" Park reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
The legal scuffle over ribavirin is the latest twist in the short history of a 
drug that, at one time, was touted as a potential treatment for persons 
infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation over its efficacy in fighting the incurable disease has continued 
even though the company abandoned its efforts in March to receive Food and Drug 
Administration approval to market the drug to people with AIDS-related symptoms 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that decision, the company announced in June that the country of 
Ireland had approved the sale of ribavirin to AIDS sufferers there -- an 
announcement that touched off an immediate run on ICN stock, which hiked its 
value 86% in just 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision in Sacramento, however, dealt strictly with the use of 
ribavirin to combat the childhood respiratory ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Eileen Ceranowski said the health department had notified ICN 
as early as February about issuing an alert, and even changed some of the 
wording at the company's request to say that ribavirin has been found to be a 
"life-saving drug" in severe cases of the respiratory virus. 
</P>
<P>
She maintained, however -- and the judge agreed -- that the health department 
had every right to use the Hazard Alert phrase at the top of its letter.

HEAD OF PHOENIX GROUP EXPLAINS VENTURE FAILURE; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: CHAIRMAN CHARLES W. MISSLER SAYS SALE OF COMPUTERS TO SOVIET UNION FELL 
APART BECAUSE OF LACK OF CAPITAL AND PROBLEMS WITH THE FIRM'S SOVIET PARTNERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles W. Missler, chairman of the beleaguered Phoenix Group International, 
said Thursday that his venture to sell millions of computers to the Soviet 
Union fell apart because of a lack of capital and problems dealing with its 
Soviet partners. 
</P>
<P>
Missler, in his first interview since the Phoenix Group filed for federal 
bankruptcy protection Tuesday, said the computer sale collapsed earlier this 
year when the company's Soviet partners failed to make promised cash payments 
for an initial sale of 770 computers. He said the Soviet partners also failed 
to abide by agreements to barter Soviet products as payment for additional 
computer shipments. 
</P>
<P>
And he said bad publicity about the deal hurt Phoenix and its subsidiaries' 
ability to raise capital to build the computers. 
</P>
<P>
One Phoenix subsidiary, Netcom Research of Irvine, also filed recently for 
bankruptcy protection from creditors. Netcom was supposed to supply computer 
workstations for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Netcom grew too fast from its domestic orders," Missler said. "The tragedy was 
we couldn't sell Netcom to investors because people were distracted by the 
Soviet order . . . . Phoenix began to get in trouble when we couldn't raise 
working capital to meet its opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Peter von Braun, a Connecticut businessman who was the architect of the Soviet 
deal until he and Missler had a falling out in December, 1989, said Missler 
must share the blame for the deal's failure. The strong-willed Missler, he 
said, "insisted on running things his way" and "drove away some very talented 
people working for him." 
</P>
<P>
Von Braun, Phoenix's former vice chairman, said the Soviets were sometimes 
difficult to work with but aren't solely to blame for the failed venture. 
</P>
<P>
"They're tough but honest people who do not operate in bad faith," he said. "I 
have to disagree with any imputation that the Soviet government showed bad 
faith." 
</P>
<P>
Missler said he personally invested more than $500,000 during the past year to 
try to rescue Phoenix from a worsening cash squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
Missler, a former chief executive of Western Digital Corp. in Irvine, also 
denied a published report that he has resigned from Phoenix. He said he intends 
for "moral reasons" to attempt to turn around Phoenix and Netcom. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Soviet deal is dead, he said: "I think it's proper to label it 
that way. However, if Netcom can get on its feet, I think we could revive the 
relationships in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Missler acknowledged that Phoenix never had a formal contract to sell computers 
to the Soviet Union; rather, he said the company had an informal agreement 
known as a protocol and a formal joint venture with a Soviet education agency, 
Soyuz Occhpribor. 
</P>
<P>
Missler said he began cutting the staffs at Phoenix and Netcom earlier this 
year and fired certain employees who he said made misrepresentations to him. A 
number of former employees and executives have filed lawsuits against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is the last remaining officer of Phoenix. Fred Little, a former 
associate of Missler at Western Digital, has taken over as chief executive of 
Netcom, Missler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Phoenix believes Netcom is worth saving," he said. "Its recovery depends on 
Netcom's success . . . . I've taken six companies out of Chapter 11, and this 
is the first one that I have put into it." 
</P>
<P>
Missler's firm gained national attention in September, 1989, when Soviet trade 
officials announced that Phoenix had been chosen as the U.S. partner in a joint 
venture to supply up to 6 million computers to Soviet schools and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Missler said Thursday that the company shipped a dozen demonstration computers 
to the Soviets, but nothing more.

FORMER KROQ-FM OWNER IS BUYING 2 OTHER STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth J. Roberts, the former concert promoter who built KROQ-FM in Los 
Angeles into a rock radio giant before selling it for a then-record $45 million 
in 1986, has jumped back into the local broadcast scene with the acquisition of 
two small FM stations. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said Thursday that he has agreed to purchase KOCM-FM in Newport Beach 
and its sister station, KSRF-FM in Santa Monica, for $17.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The two stations, both broadcasting at the same frequency -- 103.1 megahertz -- 
now are owned by companies controlled by businessman Steven Udvar-Hazy, 
broadcast executive Jack Siegal and attorney Leonard Weinberg, all of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the transfer of ownership should be completed by March 1 but 
depends on the Federal Communications Commission, which must approve the change 
of ownership application. That process normally takes 30 to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts has been in the market for a new Southland radio property since late 
1988, when an agreement not to compete with KROQ expired. 
</P>
<P>
He said the two small stations are potential challengers for a big slice of the 
Los Angeles radio audience, despite the fact that each is licensed for only 
3,000 watts -- compared to 50,000 watts of broadcast power for most of the top 
Los Angeles stations. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to make this just as competitive in the market as KROQ was," he said, 
by adjusting the current easy-listening formats to attract a larger audience 
and by treating the two stations as one property. Each now carries separate 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts declined to discuss his plans for format or personnel changes, but he 
said the Los Angeles audience seems to favor "urban contemporary and happy 
music. People want to dance." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he was attracted to the deal, proposed by Glendale media broker 
John McLaughlin, because so few Los Angeles radio properties are sold in any 
year and because, with the same frequency and overlapping broadcast ranges, the 
two stations "give me 70% of the (potential) audience of a (larger) station for 
about 30% of the cost." 
</P>
<P>
He said he intends to put "considerable" amounts of money into promotions and 
advertising to help boost ratings and establish a common identity for the 
stations -- which by law must operate under separate call letters. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts already has committed about $500,000 for new equipment, McLaughlin 
said. The broker said that KOCM, in Newport Beach, is the stronger of the two 
stations, with about 100,000 listeners. No figures were available for KSRF, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the two stations declined comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts is a former New York concert promoter who in 1974 gained a minority 
share of the year-old KROQ in payment for bringing a rock group, Sly and the 
Family Stone, to Los Angeles for a concert sponsored by the station. 
</P>
<P>
He soon was named president of the station by his partners -- none of whom had 
any radio or even music business experience -- and after a near-bankruptcy that 
took the station off the air for two years, built it into one of the Los 
Angeles Basin's major radio properties. 
</P>
<P>
He sold the station in 1986 to its current owners, Infinity Broadcasting of New 
York, and set up shop in his 114-acre Mandeville Canyon ranch.

HIGHWAY DEER KILLS ARE PROBLEM FOR STATES; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: AS MANY AS 350,000 DEER DIE EACH YEAR ON AMERICA'S ROADS. LAST YEAR, 
131 PEOPLE DIED IN SUCH COLLISIONS; DAMAGES AND CLEANUP COSTS ARE IN THE 
MILLIONS.

<P>
Thousands of times each day, a white-tailed deer comes nose to grille with a 
motor vehicle, often with disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
And not just to the deer, though as many as 350,000 deer die each year on 
America's roads. Last year, 131 people died in collisions with animals, and 
damages and the costs of cleaning up total in the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife and highway officials say there's no simple way to keep the creatures 
and man from colliding on the nation's roads. 
</P>
<P>
A growing deer population -- there are now 16 million to 18 million 
white-tailed deer in the United States and Canada -- and "human sprawl" is 
forcing traffic engineers and wildlife officials to seek ways to keep the 
animals off the road. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fairly severe problem, particularly if it's your car that's been hit," 
said Richard McCabe of the Wildlife Management Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that with concentrated deer populations, particularly in states 
such as Pennsylvania and northern Wisconsin that are semi-mountainous, you have 
highways that intersect travel routes of deer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In West Virginia, the death rate grew from 2,660 deer in 1979 to 6,326 in 1989. 
The typical animal that was struck caused about $1,300 in damage, said Roger 
Russell of the state Division of Highways. 
</P>
<P>
Pennsylvania, which has a deer population of more than 1.5 million, spends 
about $8 million each year to collect dead deer off the roads, said state Game 
Commission spokesman Ted Godshall. 
</P>
<P>
Game officers picked up more than 40,000 deer carcasses from the highways last 
year; they are given to needy families, fed to fish or buried. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it takes a minimum of two hours to pick up a deer, and they 
usually have to drive 50 miles or more," Godshall said. "It can take two or 
three hours of an officer's time. It's a tremendous bill." 
</P>
<P>
The remedies for road kills are varied. Among them is more careful planning of 
where roads go; re-examination of grasses and shrubs planted along roads; 
dispensing with salt as a way of ridding roads of ice, because deer like salt; 
and more warning signs. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado and Pennsylvania are considering rerouting deer over and under major 
thoroughfares, McCabe said. This seems "to have some benefits, but of course 
deer populations can change," he said. "Underpasses and overpasses are fairly 
expensive propositions if you don't know whether the deer are going to move." 
</P>
<P>
Fences, by all accounts the most effective remedy, also are expensive, costing 
as much as $200,000 a mile. A more recent solution, wildlife warning 
reflectors, costs $7,000 per mile. 
</P>
<P>
"The reflectors light up and set up an unnatural moving light pattern, which 
scares the deer," said John Strieter, president of Strieter Corp., which sells 
the reflectors. "We don't know what's going on in the deer's head, but 
eyewitnesses say the deer react with them and change directions." 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, the reflectors are being used at 30 sites, with a dozen more to 
be added. Susan Mulvihill, accident surveillance safety engineer for the state 
Department of Transportation, said they seem to be working. 
</P>
<P>
"When we figure out a benefit cost, we use 60% reduction as an average, so 
they're pretty effective if you install them right," Mulvihill said. "We've had 
pretty good luck with them here. It's worked better than anything else we 
tried." 
</P>
<P>
But the high cost and mixed results at a 2-mile test-strip along Interstate 79 
have made West Virginia officials skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"It is fairly expensive and it isn't 100% effective in reducing deer kill. . . 
," Russell said. "The only thing that is 100% effective is an 8-foot tall 
fence." 
</P>
<P>
Whistles attached to vehicles to frighten deer by emitting high-pitched sounds 
also have shown limited effectiveness, McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hold much credence in it at all," he said. "It may scare off deer that 
are standing in the roads, but it doesn't do much for those out of the 
periphery of the sounds that are running along the highway. Those tend to be 
the deer that are hit anyway." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been tried, nothing works," Godshall said. "Fencing is the best 
thing, but they're prohibitively expensive." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, wildlife officials say, is not really with the deer at all. It's 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"People are inclined to spread out in attractive areas that are hilly and have 
forests -- areas that are traditionally and ecologically principal and critical 
habitats of deer and certainly other wildlife," McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more traffic, more miles of travel being done each year, and more 
roadways to accommodate that traffic," he said. "What it all comes down to is 
when a deer bangs into a car, people tend to get annoyed at the deer, but it's 
the people who are more or less invading the deer's habitat, and all of this is 
a consequence of human sprawl."

AIRCRAFT: AN EX-GAME SHOW HOST WHO ARRANGED FOR FOUR SOVIET FIGHTER JETS TO 
APPEAR IN U.S. AIR SHOWS LAST SUMMER IS OVERWHELMED BY THE SUCCESS OF HIS FEAT.

Larry Blackmar knew more about prize curtains than the Iron Curtain when his TV 
game show was canceled, but now he has his hands on a new jackpot: bringing 
Soviet fighter jets to American air shows. 
</P>
<P>
The aviation buff was overwhelmed by the success of this summer's four-city 
visit by four sleek MiG-29s. With two years of a three-year contract to go, 
Blackmar is busy lining up sponsors and bids for next summer's tour, expected 
to visit about eight cities. Up to 10 cities will be on the 1992 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for the air shows, no one made a lot of money, but no one lost much, 
either," Blackmar said. "The point was to prove the feasibility and demonstrate 
the popularity of Soviet participation. We certainly did that." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes some of the proceeds from the shows can go to a Soviet 
children's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmar, president and founder of Leading Edge Productions in the Portland 
suburb of Lake Oswego, said the Soviets are offering several planes for future 
shows, including the world's largest aircraft, the 275-foot-long Antonov 225. 
</P>
<P>
Just two of the six-engine behemoths were built to carry the Soviet version of 
the space shuttle. Filling the fuel tanks cost at least $200,000 every time -- 
and that was before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait pushed up gas prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmar began his aviation video production company a year before a Portland 
TV station pulled the plug on his local game show "On the Spot" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But the road to the fighter jet visits really began when Blackmar's group met 
up with Soviet TV producer Yuri Salnikov. Both were working, coincidentally, on 
the same idea: a documentary on helicopter inventor Igor Sikorsky. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to me saying, 'I'd give my right arm to have some Soviet aircraft 
at the (Portland) Rose Festival Air show,' " Blackmar said. "He said, 'I know a 
lot of people in the industry -- let me go home and talk to them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Salnikov did more than that. He showed some of the company's documentaries to 
Soviet aviation officials. When Blackmar went to Moscow in April, he figured it 
would take at least a year to work out all the details. 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"They came back to us after the initial discussions and said, 'Why don't we do 
it this year?' And I said, 'Are you kidding?' " Blackmar recalled. "It takes 
them a great deal of time to get to the point where they trust you. But once 
they are committed, they are absolutely tenacious." 
</P>
<P>
Bringing front-line Soviet fighter jets to the United States and Canada for a 
few weeks can involve as much maddening red tape as one might expect. But 
Blackmar said the first tour came off without any big hitches, even though 
there was not enough time before the shows to land big sponsors to help foot 
the bills. 
</P>
<P>
The plane's designer, the Mikoyan Design Bureau, worked with Blackmar's staff 
to keep costs to a minimum and still expose the Soviet visitors to Americana. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets visited Ottawa, Canada; Kalamazoo, Mich.; Rockford, Ill.; and 
Dayton, Ohio, drawing record-breaking crowds at each event. 
</P>
<P>
One tour highlight came at Kalamazoo, when Soviet fliers and the Navy's famed 
Blue Angels swapped flights in their two-seater jets. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just a ride -- they got quite a bit of 'stick' time in each other's 
planes," Blackmar said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during their travels, an FBI agent visited the Soviet fliers' 
Dayton hotel. Thinking there might be big trouble, Blackmar and the others 
rushed to the lobby -- only to find the agent holding a stack of restaurant 
menus, translated into Russian. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems the local FBI office had heard that the Soviets were having 
difficulty ordering food from the all-English menus and took it upon themselves 
to help make our guests more comfortable," he said.

HAL LANDON'S SERIOUS SCROOGE GIVES MEANING TO SCR'S 'CAROL'; 
</P>
<P>
THE ACTOR'S PERFORMANCE AS THE NOTORIOUS MISER FAR OUTSHINES OTHERS IN A CAST 
MISSING ITS USUAL TOP-NOTCH VETERANS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Ebenezer Scrooge plunges headlong with the rest of us into an apparently 
nasty decade filled with omens of war and hard times, his redemption through 
generosity and kindness would seem to have a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Hal Landon Jr. has turned serious as Charles Dickens' 
notorious miser. He brings a far more provocative dimension to his perennial 
starring role in South Coast Repertory's adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" than 
the caricature he gave us last year. 
</P>
<P>
Landon remakes Scrooge into a tragic figure of sorts, who manages to avoid the 
usual fate of tragic figures. He also has eliminated last year's giddy baby 
talk in a climactic second-act scene, which clearly was intended to entertain 
the 6-year-olds in the audience but which trivialized the meaning of the play. 
</P>
<P>
Landon's deepened performance, however, is not matched by the rest of the 
company, which is nowhere near as crisp as it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the casting of a handful of minority actors in major supporting roles 
-- a commendable, politically correct effort -- the production is measurably 
diminished by the loss of such top-notch SCR veterans as Anni Long, Jarion 
Monroe and Don Took as well as Devon Raymond, one of the brightest newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the romantic byplay -- or even a spark of attraction -- between 
young Ebenezer and Belle is totally lost. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, with Dante di Loreto and Raymond in the roles, it made for one of 
the play's more appealing digressions. But Richard Soto gives a wooden and 
uninviting performance as young Ebenezer, no better here than he was this 
summer as Claudio in the Grove Shakespeare Festival's "Much Ado About Nothing." 
Lucy Rodriguez not only lacks delicacy as Belle but manages the seemingly 
impossible feat of swallowing her words while delivering them with a stentorian 
flourish. Their parting scene as would-be lovers has the flavor of community 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Butler, also a newcomer, fares better in the roles of Marley's Ghost and 
the Spirit of Christmas Yet-To-Come, both heavily disguised by makeup and 
costuming. 
</P>
<P>
SCR veteran Richard Doyle, replacing Art Koustik (who is recovering from a 
motorcycle accident), brings the requisite joviality to the role of Mr. 
Fezziwig and gives us a baudier, less feral portrait of the Fagan-like Joe. And 
while Ron Boussom's depiction of the Ghost of Christmas Past is comically 
effete, it pales by comparison with Monroe's precise elegance in last year's 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party scenes as a whole have lost some of their radiance, 
although director John-David Keller's staging is full of lively details and 
Dwight Richard Odle's costumes are colorful and authentic. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the show's overall technical pizazz is all there, including special 
effects that elicited shrieks from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the supporting cast will improve with more performances. Getting 
accustomed to the chatter from the kids in the seats may help as well. 
</P>
<P>
As a cultural rite of passage, "A Christmas Carol" plays to many kids. The 
veteran actors in this annual holiday show have come to expect interruptions. 
On opening night Wednesday during the second act, however, one young child kept 
up such a long, loud, running conversation with himself, his parents and nobody 
in particular that it would have been hard for Olivier himself to have cast a 
spell. 
</P>

The Crystal Cathedral's annual Christmas pageant, "The Glory of Christmas," is 
celebrating its 10th anniversary, and the drawing power of this living creche 
extravaganza seems undiminished. 
</P>
<P>
Sparing no gilt, the $2-million retelling of the birth of Christ is an 
eye-popping curio maximus -- a clumsy script dressed in spectacular finery 
(costumes, sets and lights are by Richard Bostard, Charles Lisanby, Perry 
Halford and Terry Larson, respectively) and musical anachronisms (by 
arranger/musical director Johnnie Carl) that come soaring through 
state-of-the-art equipment. 
</P>
<P>
It is attended by dozens of supernumeraries, a live menagerie (lambs, goats, 
sheep, horses, donkeys, dromedaries, an ox and a cow), eight trumpeting heralds 
and an aerie of angels made to fly through the cathedral's expanse, like so 
many Peter Pans ("Hark, the herald angels swing. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
Paul Dunn's direction may be too reverential, the choreography (Dorie Lee 
Mattson) may have nothing to do with events on stage, Buddy Adler may be more 
crazed Quasimodo than Herod in his overreaction, and the Christmas hymns and 
carols (including "Greensleeves") may be AD variations played in BC time, but 
spectacle, not historical detail, is the bottom line. And the singers can 
really sing, especially Joseph (Robin Buck), Mary (Debbie Smith), shepherdess 
Henrietta Davis and the children (Christopher Parker, Lyndie Nitkin, Tara 
Sinclair). 
</P>
<P>
Cecil B. De Mille, who was surely the model, might well be envious.

"The Glory of Christmas," Crystal Cathedral, 12141 Lewis St., Garden Grove,

At a glance, Orange Crescent School looks like most schools in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the courtyard, kindergartners play "London Bridge" and giggle. In a 
classroom, eighth-graders struggle with an algebra problem. In the cafeteria, 
teachers fight a losing battle to quiet students. 
</P>
<P>
But on closer inspection, there are striking dissimilarities. 
</P>
<P>
The children start the day with a prayer -- in Arabic. The principal, who also 
serves as the eighth-grade algebra teacher, leads his class dressed in a 
sharwani, a long coat that is part of the native dress of Pakistan. The girls 
in his class, like all girls after the third grade, cover their heads with 
hijabs, a sort of combined shawl and scarf, and are grouped in a semicircle 
behind the male students. Other teachers call out names like Ghada, Amina, Ali 
and Jamal for answers to questions. 
</P>
<P>
With an eclectic mix of American schooling and ancient Islamic traditions, 
Orange Crescent is the county's only school for Muslim students. And it is 
simultaneously thriving and struggling. 
</P>
<P>
Established in September, 1983, the school "is dedicated to foster within each 
student the principle of submission to the will of Allah as the essential 
element in achieving human excellence," the school's brochure says. "The goal 
is to develop self-worth, independence, ethics and moral values, the sense for 
truth, spirituality, self-discipline, self-actualization, and love for 
knowledge and learning." 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, the school is thriving. Muslim parents, many of them immigrants 
hoping to provide their children with a sense of their religious tradition amid 
a decidedly non-Islamic culture, send their children here. While some Arab and 
Islamic nations are split in different Muslim sects, Muslims of all 
nationalities attend the school. 
</P>
<P>
"The students are 90 to 95% born and raised here, but their parents are 
immigrant parents," said the school's principal, Qaiser Imam. "You can name any 
country in the Middle East and you'll find them here. We also have children 
from non-Islamic countries, such as Vietnam, Cambodia and South American 
countries. I would say we cover 70 to 80% of the population of the world. They 
all live together, they play together, very harmoniously." 
</P>
<P>
While the school is heavily steeped in the traditions of Islam -- the term is 
derived from the word salam, meaning peace -- not all of its 320 students are 
Muslims. Some non-Muslim parents, attracted by the school's emphasis on 
traditional values and parent involvement, have taken advantage of the school's 
open-admissions policy. 
</P>
<P>
"They are sending their children here for the good environment," Imam said. 
"They feel their children are more safe here." 
</P>
<P>
One parent, Sayed Hussain, said he brings his 5-year-old daughter, Sana, from 
Inglewood every day to attend kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
"It's secure here," Hussain said. "The reason I send her here is to learn some 
Arabic and about Islam." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to math, science, social studies, language arts and art classes, 
students spend about 90 minutes per day learning Arabic and studying Islam, 
Imam said. Even preschoolers take part in the language lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to teach how to read the Koran and then how to understand the 
Koran," Imam said. "In the Arabic program, we try to teach them the Arabic 
language so they can gain more vital knowledge about Islam. . . . They can read 
Arabic sometimes earlier than they can read English." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the traditions of Islam, all students line up at 8:30 -- the 
start of a seven-hour school day -- to recite in Arabic the Surah Fatiha, a 
prayer of thanks to Allah. The entire student body, along with many members of 
the local Muslim community, also goes to the campus mosque at 1 p.m. for 10 
minutes of worship -- one of five times they'll pray each day. Following 
Islamic law, all who enter the mosque remove their shoes and separate 
themselves by sex -- adult males in front, adult females in the rear. Older 
children are similarly separated in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 60,000 Muslims in Orange County, the mosque and the school 
have become focal points of Islamic activity. In addition to the 320 students 
who attend Orange Crescent daily, another 600 Muslim children attend the 
school's weekend class, and more than 2,000 Muslims gather for prayers each 
Friday, the Muslim Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
Through contributions, fund-raisers and donations from Muslim communities 
around the nation, Orange Crescent raised $2 million and built a modern 
classroom building, which opened in time for the start of the 1988-89 school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But although the Muslim community pulled together for that cause, financing 
remains a struggle for Orange Crescent, despite the yearly tuition of $1,790 
for full-time students. 
</P>
<P>
The old wooden buildings, which once contained classrooms and now house 
offices, a cafeteria and the mosque, need new paint and plaster. Science and 
laboratory equipment is almost non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
Aspects of school life that public school students take for granted are 
conspicuously absent. No lunches are served in the cafeteria; students must 
bring their own. And there are no school buses. "Transportation," the parent 
handbook says, "is the responsibility of parents." 
</P>
<P>
Recreational equipment is also scant. Although the courtyard has a small 
playground with two swing sets and a jungle gym, most students entertained 
themselves during recess playing tag and other games that do not require 
equipment. Some boys made use of discarded tires as playthings, while three 
girls swung on the gate of a wrought-iron fence. 
</P>
<P>
"Public school has some stuff that we don't have here," said Ronnie Nashef, 13, 
a seventh-grader who transferred from a public school. "They have a science 
lab, a computer room and other stuff. Mostly everybody in my class talks about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
For transfer students like Ronnie, much of the allure of public school remains. 
Many acknowledge that they attend Orange Crescent because their parents insist. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Khan, 10, a fifth-grader who transferred from Linda Vista Elementary 
School in Orange, said the advantages here include meeting a variety of 
children of other nationalities and learning a new language. 
</P>
<P>
"Arabic's a pretty language," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But given the choice, Sarah said she would return to public school. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this school because I can learn Islam . . . but I'd go back to public 
school because here they're way too strict," she said.

Continental Airlines may not survive its second visit to bankruptcy court, 
which began this week, but, if it goes under, it won't be for failing to master 
the intricacies of bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
The debt-heavy carrier delayed seeking Chapter 11 court protection until it had 
amassed a $138-million cash hoard and until the Christmas season, when many of 
its passengers were carrying deep-discount, non-refundable tickets. This 
guaranteed that ridership would be high for weeks -- and that initial news 
reports on the bankruptcy would carry the reassuring word that travelers were 
sticking with the airline. 
</P>
<P>
"They handled it just about right," said Russell Thayer, executive vice 
president of Airline Economics, an airline consulting firm in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's strategy reflects corporate America's increasing sophistication 
in tilting the bankruptcy process in its favor. As a growing number of large 
companies have lurched into such proceedings in the aftermath of the debt binge 
of the 1980s, they have learned to fortify themselves with strong cash 
positions and protect their relationships with key suppliers, customers and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Companies have learned that they can return to bankruptcy court -- in what 
lawyers jokingly call "Chapter 22." Others have found how to shorten their 
visits with "prepackaged" bankruptcies, which can compress the expensive 
reorganization process into a few weeks. And companies have become more 
skillful in handling the public relations aspects of bankruptcy, aided by the 
fact that bankruptcy no longer carries the public stigma it once did. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers wonder whether corporations are becoming too adept at playing 
the bankruptcy game, even though two out of three do not emerge from Chapter 
11. Although reviving firms is a top priority of U.S. bankruptcy law, some 
wonder whether it sometimes shields incompetent managers and props up weak 
companies that should be allowed to expire. 
</P>
<P>
"These are questions that should be asked," said Walter N. Torous, an assistant 
finance professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows what the future holds for Continental, but its skilled handling of 
the bankruptcy process this time around is in sharp contrast to the way 
airlines have fumbled through these situations in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff blundered into Chapter 11 in 1982 with no cash, stranding passengers 
with worthless tickets and leaving employees and travel agents unpaid. It 
emerged from bankruptcy court in 1983. But, in part because it had so alienated 
customers and travel agents, it skidded into bankruptcy court for a second and 
last time last year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Continental, too, had a much harder time with reorganization because 
it closed down for three days after its bankruptcy filing, then returned with 
sharply diminished operations. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Continental's big cash balance will help it weather the slow season that 
begins after New Year's, and its firm holiday season bookings will give it 
needed momentum. The Houston-based carrier was clever, too, in telling 
passengers and travel agents that it would continue to honor all tickets and 
operate all flights. 
</P>
<P>
By continuing operations with no interruption, Continental has been able to 
preserve a very important asset: the reservations that are impossible to fully 
recapture once they are lost, consultant Thayer said. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, airline executives believed that any bankruptcy filing would be 
fatal to an airline. They reasoned that customers would avoid a distressed 
airline, fearing that the company would skimp on maintainance and aircraft 
might plunge from the skies. 
</P>
<P>
But the airlines discovered during the first Continental bankruptcy, and the 
bankruptcy of its subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, that many passengers will 
continue to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Other industries have discovered in recent years that customers are blase about 
bankruptcy cases. "With so many household names in bankruptcy court . . . and 
doing nicely, people are behaving much more rationally," said Wilbur Ross, an 
investment banker and leading bankruptcy adviser at Rothschild Inc. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the common wisdom was that retailers had the most to risk from 
frightened customers in a bankruptcy. But, as last year's Chapter 11 filing by 
Allied and Federated department store chains has shown, "people don't care, 
most don't even know the reorganization is going on," said David Rachman, 
marketing professor at Baruch College in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Customers have been largely unfazed by the bankruptcy reorganizations of 
Greyhound Lines, the bus company; Southland Corp., the owner of 7-Eleven 
stores; A. H. Robins, the big drug company, and Allegheny International, the 
maker of Sunbeam and Oster appliances, Rothschild's Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the attendant publicity can even bring in customers. When Donald 
Trump's Taj Mahal casino was briefly in bankruptcy court last month, "it seemed 
like people who just happened to be somewhere near Atlantic City began to drop 
in," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Companies are also increasingly turning to the prepackaged bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
In these prearranged reorganizations, companies negotiate new repayment deals 
to win support from specified majorities of the holders of each class of the 
company's stocks and bonds. With such backing in hand, the company can seek 
bankruptcy court protection and ask for immediate approval of a reorganization 
plan, to end-run the minority objections that often make bankruptcy a long, 
expensive and bitter process. 
</P>
<P>
Major company reorganizations often take two to three years, noted Mark Roe, a 
bankruptcy-law specialist at Columbia University Law School. With prepackaged 
plans, some have taken less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding the expenses of bankruptcy court is a major advantage of these 
arrangements. Drexel Burnham Lambert, the one-time junk-bond powerhouse that 
failed last February, is expected to pay $75 million in fees for lawyers, 
bankers and accountants in its first year of reorganization, noted Barry J. 
Dichter, bankruptcy lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Companies have also discovered that they can smooth their path through 
bankruptcy by seeking court orders at the outset that will enable them to pay 
employees, continue benefit plans and pay debts owed to suppliers up until the 
moment of the filing, Dichter said. 
</P>
<P>
Such moves enable them to preserve important relationships, while restricting 
the focus of the bankruptcy proceeding to the company's central financial 
problem, which so often today is junk-bond debt rather than any operational 
weakness, Dichter said. 
</P>
<P>
Distressed companies have found new access to financing while in bankruptcy. 
Several banks, such as Wells Fargo and Chemical Bank, have been attracted by 
the profitable return on such lending and the high-priority claim they have on 
corporate assets, said David Minnick, a bankruptcy specialist at Lillick &amp; 
McHose in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ames Department Stores, for example, recently began its way through a 
reorganization by establishing a $250-million credit line from Chemical Bank. 
</P>
<P>
A second trip through bankruptcy court also is an option for companies. But it 
is used rarely and only in the direst circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers contend that executives' new awareness of how to navigate the 
bankruptcy maze has led some to consider Chapter 11 as a choice even before 
their financial distress begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who plays the high leverage game has got to start thinking about it 
from the beginning -- when the junk financing or leveraged buyout takes place," 
said Richard A. D'Aveni, professor of corporate strategy at Dartmouth 
University. 
</P>
<P>
So is bankruptcy court too easy an alternative? 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the debt holders aren't complaining about the system; they 
have usually done better in smoothly run reorganization proceedings in which 
the company is able to get back on its feet and pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the major cases, the suffering debt holders aren't widows and 
orphans "but sophisticated institutional investors who bought junk bonds and 
enjoyed those big 16% coupons," attorney Minnick said. "They went in with their 
eyes open." 
</P>
<P>
Even if bankruptcy reorganization is easier than it was, corporate executives 
can't be enthusiastic about it because, often, they lose their jobs, Columbia's 
Roe said. 
</P>
<P>
They can be fired, like the management of Manville Corp., which sought Chapter 
11 to deal with asbestos-related lawsuits; or they can have the company sold 
out from under them, as happened to the family that owned Robins. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean many top executives don't survive the process. The 
management teams at Texaco and LTV Corp. remain at the helms of their 
reorganizations, and James M. Zimmerman, president and chief operating officer 
of Allied Stores, remains in his post, Joseph Kelly, a New York bankruptcy 
lawyer, noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uncommon to have the same people in there, unless the creditors think 
they're real scoundrels," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most companies don't survive Chapter 11, big companies with a lot 
of momentum -- and particularly those that suffer from too much debt but not 
operating problems -- frequently endure and thrive. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recent celebrated cases, Texaco, Resorts International, A. H. Robins, 
Allegheny International, Public Service of New Hampshire, Wheeling-Pittsburgh 
Steel and Storage Technology are healthy or appear to be recovering. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of problems arise from bad management," said Minnick, a 
lawyer who represents creditors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddam Hussein's order to release foreign hostages seems to have defused a 
vexing and emotional issue, clearing the way for talks with the United States 
that could give Iraq a graceful way to escape the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But there is growing concern among Washington's Arab allies that Hussein may 
propose a settlement that would meet U.S. objectives without hobbling Iraq's 
formidable army. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong perception that a deal can be cut," said an Arab diplomat 
here. "How far that deal will go is causing a panic in all of the gulf states." 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat speculated that Hussein may be ready to cut his losses and agree 
to a total withdrawal from Kuwait, asking in exchange only for assurances that 
the U.S.-led multinational force will not attack and that new efforts will be 
made to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"That isn't much of a concession (to Iraq), but it might look like one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated American assertions that the gulf crisis must not be linked to 
other Middle East issues, it would be very difficult for the Bush 
Administration to refuse such a proposal. It is inconceivable that Congress, 
U.S. public opinion or the world community would support a war if Iraq agrees 
to pull out of Kuwait and allow its legitimate government to be restored. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Hussein's decision to release the foreign hostages removes a 
seemingly insurmountable obstacle to an Iraqi peace strategy and eliminates 
much of the international dimension of the crisis in advance of the upcoming 
face-to-face talks. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Iraq have agreed that Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz 
and Bush will meet in Washington and Secretary of State James A. Baker III will 
confer with Hussein in Baghdad. Dates for the meetings have not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official reluctantly agreed that Hussein can expect a propaganda bonanza 
from the release of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't find it useful to hold hostages any more," the official said. "He 
found it counterproductive. This is a way to defuse one really emotional issue. 
He also may believe that by releasing them now, he can fuel the anti-war 
sentiment in the United States and the international community." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hussein noted growing opposition to war in the United States when 
announcing the hostage release. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for which the foreigners were prevented from travel have diminished 
and have been replaced by something more powerful -- a change in the American 
public opinion which will impose restrictions on the decisions and intentions 
of the evil ones, led by Bush, the enemy of God," the Iraqi president said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said Hussein "wants to make the atmosphere as favorable as 
possible" for the exchange of visits by each foreign affairs chief. 
</P>
<P>
"Just prior to these meetings, you are going to have all these smiling faces on 
television of families being reunited for Christmas," he added. "The Iraqis 
will try to portray themselves as having caused all this happiness." 
</P>
<P>
The official conceded that Hussein may also try to use his upcoming talks with 
Baker to depict Iraq as a regional superpower worthy of meeting on equal terms 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a risk that we decided to take because we had to show domestically and 
within the (international) coalition that we were going the extra mile," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The growing concern among U.S. allies in the Arab world that Hussein will 
emerge with his army intact parallels a growing fear in Israel that Hussein 
will menace the Jewish state if he emerges militarily unscathed from the gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told U.S. Ambassador 
William A. Brown that Israel expects the United States to dismantle Iraq's 
nuclear and chemical warfare capacity. 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, a source close to the government said the Saudis are afraid 
that "peace fever" will break out in Washington, causing the Bush 
Administration to soften its terms for ending the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Arab leaders support an international conference to address the 
Israeli-Palestinian dispute, the source said, they do not want Hussein to be 
able to claim credit for bringing it about. 
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, it's a victory for him (Hussein)," the source said. "He's a 
hero in Amman (Jordan). He's a victor in Tunis." Worse, he said, Iraq lives to 
fight another day. 
</P>
<P>
"If you allow him to keep his military, he's won," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Saudi official said: "The issue is not Kuwait. The issue is Saddam 
Hussein and Iraq." Some Western officials in Saudi Arabia echoed the message. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect," said one, "we won't be content with a withdrawal to a status quo 
ante. Saddam Hussein has shown his true colors too clearly. I don't think 
anybody will be content to let him go back to his lair and stockpile his 
chemical and biological weapons." 
</P>
<P>
In public statements made Thursday, both President Bush and Baker said Hussein 
decided to release the foreign hostages in response to growing pressure from 
the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to continue to keep the pressure on," Bush said in Santiago, Chile. 
"The release of all hostages would be a very good thing, but the problem is the 
aggression against Kuwait, and the man must leave Kuwait without reservation, 
without condition." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me no coincidence that this comes just one week, just one week, 
after the international community has authorized the use of force," Baker told 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult to see how the threat of the use of force could have 
persuaded Hussein to act now. 
</P>
<P>
At the time that Iraq effectively seized the hostages by barring the departure 
of all foreigners from Iraq and occupied Kuwait, Hussein said many of the 
foreigners would be held at strategic sites to deter an attack by the United 
States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
In light of repeated Pentagon statements that the presence of hostages would 
not prevent U.S. military action, the Iraqi leader may have decided that the 
hostages are ineffective shields. But there is nothing in the U.N. resolution 
authorizing the use of force that would make the hostages any less effective as 
a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
However, by releasing the hostages, Hussein eliminates one potential 
provocation. He makes it more difficult for Washington to launch an offensive 
if Iraq makes a peace offer which, on the surface at least, seems to meet U.S. 
objectives and those set forth in the resolutions adopted to date by the U.N. 
Security Council.

<P>
IN THE FAR NORTH, CANADA'S NATIVE PEOPLES HAVE GROWN DISILLUSIONED WITH THE 
'BLACKROBES.' BUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS MAKING NEW EFFORTS WITH CLERGY FROM 
POLAND.

<P>
FT. SIMPSON, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 years ago, the "Francis Xavier of the frigid zone," Father Henri 
Grollier, paddled down the Mackenzie River and beached here, kitted out with a 
long black cassock, a bronze crucifix and the Oblate order's motto of grueling 
devotion, "Usque ad extremum terrae" -- "Even unto the ends of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
He evidently made a compelling sight: Within days, he had blessed five 
marriages, baptized 34 children and heard 11 adults ask to be received into the 
Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
"My trip to Ft. Simpson was a triumphal march," he reported to his faraway 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
All of that belonged to the glory days of Roman Catholicism in the Canadian 
North, a time when the "Blackrobes," along with the rough-hewn fur traders of 
the Hudson's Bay Co. and a few scattered Mounties, made up what there was of a 
Canadian "government" presence in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Single-minded young priests traveled by dog sled in winter and canoe in the 
summer, with bundled vestments and skins filled with holy water and wine. They 
slept on spruce boughs in hide tents, hunted, trapped and fished for their food 
and everywhere sought the nomadic native peoples they hoped to convert, who in 
turn sought the migrating caribou. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Catholic Church in the hard, cold North presents a far less 
invigorating picture. The native peoples of northern Canada -- the Dene Nation, 
the Cree and the Inuit, or Eskimos -- have grown deeply disillusioned about 
white outsiders trying to uplift and "improve" them. Many have turned to their 
traditional legends and beliefs, and in doing so, have rejected the church. 
</P>
<P>
And now, too, there is the sheer scarcity of priests. The earliest Blackrobes 
streamed to the Canadian northwest from France, Belgium and Quebec, bringing 
with them a heartening supposition that as the church took root and flourished 
in the Arctic, a native clergy would rise to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
But not only have Dene and Inuit men proved uninterested in the priesthood; 
these days, even the white Europeans who used to serve in the North are 
unwilling to accept the rigors of celibacy, loneliness, Arctic weather and an 
evermore unreceptive flock. 
</P>
<P>
"I have quite a problem on my hands with recruiting," admits Bishop Denis 
Croteau, sitting in his simply furnished office in Yellowknife, capital of the 
Northwest Territories. Indeed, when Bishop Croteau came here from Quebec as a 
young priest in 1960, there were 62 priests to shrive men's souls in the vast 
775,000-square-mile Mackenzie-Ft. Smith diocese. Now there are only 19. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these are in their 60s and even older. Until recently, a glum reality 
hung over them: When they died, they knew the church in the North was likely to 
die with them. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is a light at the end of the tunnel," the bishop adds. That light is 
being shed by Poland, a country where, in sharp contrast to Canada and the 
United States, Catholic seminaries are full, the church enjoys widespread 
credibility and young men come to holy orders with a zeal to share what they 
have with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a delegation of anxious Oblates from northwestern Canada visited 
Poland, to beg their brethren to send a few good men north of the 60th 
parallel. The appeal worked. By 1995, Poland is expected to have dispatched a 
dozen young priests to take up the work of the aging Blackrobes in the North. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland seems willing to supply us," says Bishop Croteau, whose manpower 
worries were such that he dropped courageous, if futile, hints in the wake of a 
papal visit here that perhaps priests ought to be free to marry. 
</P>
<P>
But in attracting young Polish Oblates to northern Canada, the church is also 
attracting controversy. For northern Canada is marginalized and poor -- a 
little bit of the Third World in North America, people say -- and the 
Blackrobes of yesteryear who grew to understand the region blazed a trail here 
toward the social gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Much in the mold of the liberation theologists of Latin America, priests 
ministering in the Arctic and sub-Arctic have witnessed native misery and 
concluded that if the church were to have meaning in northern lives, it would 
have to get involved in northern, secular struggles. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it was missionary priests who set up the first cooperatives in northern 
Canada and who organized the first native-language radio broadcasts in the 
Arctic. It was priests who devised new alphabets for the indigenous northern 
languages, and priests who were the first to train scholarly eyes on 
traditional spiritual beliefs and practices. 
</P>
<P>
One aging northern Oblate, Father Camille Piche, achieved local fame for saying 
Mass in Slavey, an Indian language, even though some of his congregants were 
unilingual whites. Lately, he has been fighting a proposed pulp mill that 
threatens to pollute traditional fishing waters of the Mackenzie River basin. 
</P>
<P>
Another noted activist priest, the French-born Father Rene Fumoleau, wrote a 
path-breaking study of northern Indian treaties, and thereby sparked 20 years 
of tough land-tenure negotiations with the federal government. Militant Dene in 
the region regard Father Rene, who lives in a two-room cabin in Yellowknife 
with no running water, as one of but a handful of whites they can trust. 
</P>
<P>
"We western missionaries felt we had more to teach than to learn," Father Rene 
says of his early years in Canada, when he was given five dogs, a sled and 
instructions to ride a 2,000-mile priestly circuit every winter. "It was the 
colonial system. The situation changed, so I changed, too -- no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Can the young priests of Poland build on such a legacy? The Polish clergy, 
after all, has encountered problems of a greatly different nature: not neglect 
by Indian-affairs bureaucrats or mindless resource exploitation by huge outside 
concerns, but half a century of totalitarian opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Their thinking, as an unsurprising consequence, tends to the traditional and 
the conservative -- not to say the reactionary. Liberation theology goes down 
poorly with the Poles; leftist biblical exegesis smacks all too much of the 
Marxist dogma that they and their village pastors struggled so long to 
overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the Canadian delegation set out for Warsaw, skeptics worried. Would 
transplanted Polish priests ever fit in? 
</P>
<P>
One answer may eventually be found in the fortunes of 29-year-old Father 
Andrezej Stendzina, now of Ft. Simpson. Father Andrezej is the first of the new 
Polish priests to arrive in the Mackenzie-Ft. Smith diocese, and today is by 
far the youngest priest serving the faithful for thousands of square miles. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Ft. Simpson, I told the people, I have come to learn, not to 
teach," he says in accented English. As yet, no one in Ft. Simpson, aside from 
a few local Canadians of Polish ancestry, has mastered the pronunciation of his 
Polish name. To everyone, he is simply Father Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of his priest-compatriots, Father Andrew is an unstinting 
traditionalist. He has little truck with a married priesthood and believes that 
politics and religion mix at the peril of the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Liberation theology? He shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hear that in some countries (church) people want to bring communism, I 
can't believe it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Father Andrew is the very picture of open-mindedness when it 
comes to the folkways of Ft. Simpson, a traditional Dene meeting place that 
grew apace with the Hudson's Bay trading post here. Already, he shuffles 
rhythmically in traditional Dene drum dances, down by the sacred confluence of 
the Liard and Mackenzie rivers. He has been teaching the young to play soccer. 
He hopes that in a few more months, he'll be fluent enough to say Mass in 
Slavey. 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew may have his quarrel with a politically engaged priesthood, but 
the faith he has brought to northern Canada was shaped in no small part by a 
worldly wise, and militant, Polish church. 
</P>
<P>
"The government was telling us stupid things, but people could learn the real 
facts at church," he says, negotiating his pickup truck along the long, empty 
gravel roads that link the villages of his vast parish, stopping here and there 
to smoke a cigarette or read his daily office from an Oblate breviary. "The 
church was the moral support for everybody who wanted to change things." 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew was still a seminarian, preparing for the work of the church in 
Africa, when the Canadian recruiters reached his hometown of Lubliniec, in 
southern Poland, looking for missionaries for the far north of another 
continent. He thought things through and concluded that the need in Canada was 
the more pressing. 
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, they can get young priests any time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he arrived in Toronto, all his earthly possessions in two suitcases. 
He learned English, was ordained in Ft. Simpson, and said his first Mass in 
Edmonton, Alberta, at a nursing home for elderly missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"You could almost feel their excitement when they saw that finally someone 
young had come to continue their work," he says. "They had sacrificed their 
health, their life, their energy, and they knew that when they had to leave, 
well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
There are eight villages in Father Andrew's parish, some, but not all, 
connected by gravel roads. The biggest is Ft. Simpson, population 1,000 or so. 
It harbors a rectory roomy enough for the half a dozen priests who used to live 
here; there is also a nuns' residence and a wooden church, painted green and 
white. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, the nuns are gone, and the priestly population is down to just 
two: Father Andrew and a 49-year-old colleague, Father George LaGrange, who 
until the Pole's arrival was the youngest priest in the diocese. Gone, too, are 
the dog sleds of years gone by. Father George, a pilot, flies a light plane to 
the roadless villages, while Father Andrew serves the rest in his pickup. 
</P>

Some of Father Andrew's parishioners haven't seen a resident priest in years. 
When he arrives on 40-below winter evenings, he must chip away the ice from the 
doorways, find fuel, scare up a place to sleep, hear confessions and say Mass. 
Some villages have eager beavers who want to help with the liturgy. But others 
have problems that come as quite a shock to him, after Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew had never even heard of child molestation before he left his 
homeland; here, he finds it a spreading concern. 
</P>
<P>
He cannot help but notice the drunkards who dodge him in the streets of Ft. 
Simpson. He has received tearful alcoholics who say they want to dry out -- and 
who leave the rectory and head straight for a bar. He has learned, on pastoral 
visits, to step nonchalantly over heaps of garbage on people's living-room 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible sometimes," he says. "It's really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Still, in every household he visits, the people sooner or later ask him to pray 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who pin a large measure of responsibility for the North's 
rampant social problems on the Catholic Church itself. Angry native Canadians, 
baptized as children, say that in its efforts to "tame" them, the church 
undermined their culture and left them without a sense of who they are. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, these natives blame Canada's so-called residential schools, set 
up by the federal government to assimilate native children, and run by the 
Catholic Church. All across Canada, from 1920 to 1970, native children were 
taken out of their remote hunting villages and compulsorily packed off to the 
residential schools, where nuns cut off their braids, dressed them in uniforms, 
demanded that they speak French and English and made them attend Mass every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Critics now say that at the very least, the institutionalized children were 
robbed of their ability to live normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of family problems now (among native Canadians), because 
people don't know how to parent," says Alice Hill, a social worker in 
Yellowknife who grew up in a residential school. She herself is divorced, and 
adds that she cannot talk to her own Slavey-speaking mother any more, because 
the nuns forced her to speak English and forget Slavey. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, some native adults now charge that they were beaten, malnourished 
and sexually abused in the schools. At one notorious residential school in 
Saskatchewan, the Thunderchild Boarding School, former students allege that one 
boy died after a severe beating, which police and the church deny. 
</P>
<P>
What no one contests is an investigation that revealed 45 deaths out of 605 
children between 1903 and 1948, when four desperate students torched the 
buildings, forcing the school's closure. The deaths were from a variety of 
causes but the main ones were tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough and 
similar diseases. Critics of the residential schools say the children would not 
have contracted these diseases if they had been left in their villages. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, other native Catholics are still stirred by the religious 
discipline and traditions that a priest like Father Andrew represents. One of 
these is Joe Mercredi, the mixed-blood editor of Ft. Simpson's local newspaper, 
the Mackenzie Times. 
</P>
<P>
Mercredi writes provocative native-rights editorials under the pen name 
"Ramjoe;" last summer, he even took up arms against the Canadian army over a 
land dispute in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all that, he also keeps a picture of Pope John Paul II on his office 
wall, and ridicules fellow natives who trace their woes back to the arrival of 
the Catholic missionaries. He insists that residential schools like 
Thunderchild were the exception, not the norm. He worries that the social 
gospel will divide his people, and he admires tough, traditional priests. He 
was thrilled when he heard that the church was sending someone from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, the children are going to have a shield, and that is Father 
Andrew," he says. "He will be like the priests when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, Mercredi turned up at the mission house door, asking Father 
Andrew to say Mass, not in English, not in Slavey, but in Latin. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the old-timers prefer the Mass in Latin," he explains. "Latin had a 
flair to it. By comparison, English seems dead." 
</P>
<P>
Later that afternoon, a surprised Father Andrew complied. 
</P>
<P>
How to sort out the traditional and the modern, the European and the 
indigenous, the political and the personal? That will be Father Andrew's 
biggest mission in the North. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot to learn," he says. "I'll probably be learning for the rest 
of my life."

ELECTRIC CAR PROJECTIONS TO CUT SMOG SCALED BACK; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS ALSO LOWER ESTIMATES OF REDUCED POLLUTION FROM ENERGY 
CONSERVATION. BUT THEY INSIST THEY CAN STILL MEET CLEAR AIR GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Air quality officials have dramatically scaled back estimates of future smog 
reductions from energy conservation and shifts to electric cars but insist that 
they will still be able to realize their goal of meeting federal clean air 
standards in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the South Coast Air Quality Management District said sufficient 
reductions in polluting emissions from other sources will compensate for fewer 
electric cars and they contended that the conservation revisions were not 
significant in terms of overall air quality. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the all-electric fleet of cars envisioned in a sweeping clean air 
plan approved last year, the AQMD is estimating that only 17% of the cars on 
the road in the year 2010 will be powered by electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a 30% gain in energy conservation over the next 17 years in the 
residential and commercial sectors, officials say that a 15% improvement may be 
more realistic. They predict that energy conservation in the industrial sector 
will improve by just 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the revised estimates, however, AQMD officials remained confident 
Thursday. "We don't believe it's going to change the bottom line," said AQMD 
Planning Director Barry R. Wallerstein. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, while fewer electric cars may not seriously hamper the region's 
ability to meet the federal ozone standard, it will make it far more difficult 
to meet the stricter state ozone standard. Unlike the federal standard, 
however, there is no firm deadline for meeting the state limit. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is a health-threatening air pollutant that leads to respiratory distress 
and illness. It accounts for about 95% of smog and is formed when organic gases 
and nitrogen oxides react in the presence of sunlight. The federal standard 
limits ozone to 0.12 parts of ozone per million parts of air for one hour. The 
state standard is 0.09 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in emission reductions from an all-electric fleet and cars 
running on a mix of fuels is comparable to the reductions achieved by some of 
the district's most stringent and hard-fought controls on other pollution 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
One control, for instance, that was approved after protracted negotiations with 
the electrical utility industry will cut nitrogen oxide emissions from power 
plant boilers by 29 tons a day. But a fleet of passenger cars running on 
gasoline, methanol and other fuels will pump 44 more tons of the pollutant into 
the air than would an all-electric fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein also said the mixed-fuel fleet also would produce 17 more tons a 
day of smog-forming organic gases and 519 more tons a day of carbon monoxide 
than the electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
But, Wallerstein said, in the 21 months since the clean air plan was approved, 
there have been a number of technological advances, such as an electrically 
heated catalytic converter that supposedly will reduce tailpipe emissions from 
gasoline-powered cars. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state Air Resources Board in September approved new tailpipe 
emission standards that are so stringent that in addition to electric cars, 
auto makers also may be forced to turn to cleaner-burning alternative fuels 
like methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas or propane. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of advances to other alternative technologies that can get us 
to lower emission levels," Wallerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ARB plan, 2% of all new car sales in 1998, or about 40,000 vehicles, 
must be electric. By the year 2003, 10% or 200,000 of new cars sold would have 
to be electric. 
</P>
<P>
But, these numbers fall far short of those envisioned in the 1989 clean air 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The downward revisions were forced in part by skeptical state officials who are 
members of AQMD task forces assigned to re-evaluate the clean air plan. State 
and federal officials had long complained that a number of the district's 
assumptions about future technological advances were speculative. 
</P>
<P>
Although auto makers and electrical utilities have launched electric car 
research and development programs, formidable problems remain in building a car 
capable of going long distances without being recharged. The AQMD task force 
believes that the lowered numbers more accurately reflect what consumer demand 
is likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
Among the critics of the AQMD's initial energy projections was California 
Energy Commission Chairman Charles R. Imbrecht, who said the district paid 
scant attention to his state agency and others in developing their original 
estimates. As a result, he said, the estimates were "extremely optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
"The 30% conservation goal in the air quality plan is additional conservation. 
It's on top of all existing conservation programs in California -- and we have 
the most stringent conservation program in the nation," Imbrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
To reach such a conservation goal, he said, new laws probably would be needed 
to force homeowners to bring their homes up to the latest insulation standards 
when they sellthem. 
</P>
<P>
"The AQMD has not worked as collaboratively as well as they might," Imbrecht 
said. "They operated on the assumption that everybody was going to do what was 
necessary to make their plan work." 
</P>
<P>
But more recently, Imbrecht said, the AQMD has undertaken new efforts at 
collaboratingwith the energy commission, state Air Resources Board, and 
California Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District in March, 1989, approved a 
far-reaching clean air strategy aimed at bringing the South Coast Air Basin 
into compliance with federal clean air standards by the year 2007. It was based 
in part on more than 100 air pollution controls the AQMD planned to impose, as 
well as technological innovations such as electric cars. At the time, the AQMD 
said every passenger car on the road would be powered by electricity by the 
year 2010. In addition, the plan called for such things as reformulated 
barbecue lighter fluids to reduce smog-forming emissions and new controls on 
oil refineries and electrical utilities.

STATE JUSTICES ASKED TO LIMIT ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The state Supreme Court, reviewing a widely watched environmental dispute, was 
asked Thursday to limit the alternative sites that local officials must 
consider before approving proposed developments. 
</P>
<P>
The case, along with a second dispute argued before the high court this week, 
posed a sharp clash between developers trying to combat needless delays and 
slow-growth forces trying to thwart what they see as environmentally harmful 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for a proposed 400-room resort hotel in Santa Barbara County, backed by 
officials from more than 100 California cities, urged the court to overturn an 
appellate ruling they said would force costly studies of alternative sites that 
a firm did not own and could not easily obtain or develop. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy A. Tosta, an attorney for the Hyatt Corp., said that in a 10-year legal 
and bureaucratic struggle, the developer had undergone 47 public hearings and 
spent about $6 million seeking approval for its hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Barbara County and Hyatt have done everything right, acted in good faith 
and in full compliance with the law," Tosta told the court. "We'd like to put 
an end to what has been a very long and exacerbating process." 
</P>
<P>
Philip A. Seymour of the Environmental Defense Center, representing foes of the 
development, urged that local agencies be required to explore a full range of 
potentially superior alternatives in preparing an environmental impact report 
before deciding on a project. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what those (reports) are for -- to let us know what other options there 
are," Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a proposed hotel and conference center on a 73-acre plot at 
Haskell's Beach, west of Santa Barbara. The plan has been hard-fought by the 
group Citizens of Goleta Valley as potentially harmful to a marsh, vegetation, 
archeological sites and a stretch of beach in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Despite approval by the county Board of Supervisors and other agencies, a state 
Court of Appeal in Ventura twice ruled that, under the California Environmental 
Quality Act, the board's environmental impact report failed to adequately 
consider alternatives suggested by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The board must examine "a reasonable range of feasible alternative sites" that 
could ease environmental concerns and include in its report a "brief 
discussion" of why any such sites are being rejected, the appeal court said in 
a Sept. 22 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Hyatt took the case to the state Supreme Court, arguing that the 
decision was so broad that it would improperly require consideration of sites 
even if they were already zoned for other purposes, beyond the jurisdiction of 
the local agency or not owned or obtainable by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and dozens of other cities 
also urged the high court to overturn the appellate ruling, saying that it 
would force them to make wasteful and "encyclopedic" reports on unrealistic 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the citizens' group, backed by environmental organizations, 
replied that the developers were seeking to effectively eliminate the 
consideration of alternatives in virtually all cases. 
</P>
<P>
In a friend of the court brief, lawyers for state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp joined the citizens' group in urging the justices to uphold the appellate 
decision, saying that a ruling for the developers could "preclude meaningful 
public review" of governmental decisions. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Thursday's hourlong hearing, several court members appeared 
reluctant to affirm the appellate ruling. Justice Armand Arabian noted that all 
the governmental agencies involved ultimately approved the project. "You," he 
told attorney Seymour, "are the only group fighting this development." 
</P>
<P>
"We think a horrible mistake has been made," the lawyer said. "We would rather 
see the natural state preserved or some lesser development." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the justices heard arguments in a separate case that tests the 
legality of a novel local initiative barring any new project that causes 
traffic congestion at key intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved by voters in suburban Walnut Creek, was challenged by 
newspaper publisher Dean Lesher on grounds it conflicted with provisions of the 
city's General Plan favoring growth. Similar challenges have been raised to 
growth-control measures in other communities. 
</P>
<P>
Maria P. Rivera, attorney for Lesher in his bid to build a plant in the city, 
argued that the initiative improperly failed to inform voters how it would 
affect broader community planning. "Comprehensiveness was basically thwarted," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Mark I. Weinberger, representing the city, countered that it was up to 
officials to amend the plan to conform with the intent of the voters who passed 
the initiative. Requiring ballot measures to detail their effects on general 
plans would force voters to wade through initiatives the size of "mini-phone 
books," he said.

EDUCATION: A TWO-YEAR SURVEY FINDS THAT ROUGHLY 150 DISTRICTS HAVE FIELDED 
CHALLENGES TO SCHOOL MATERIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Books, films and other school materials have been challenged as objectionable 
by parents and organized groups in about 150 California school districts during 
the last two years, a Cal State Fullerton professor reported Thursday in the 
state's first comprehensive study on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 421 school districts also found that the number of challenges is 
similar to what it has been in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Education Professor Louise Adler said that more than 54% of the administrators 
who responded reported that the number of challenges during the survey period 
-- autumn, 1988, through spring, 1990 -- is about the same as in previous 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers succeeded in removing the material from schools only 13% of the 
time during the period surveyed, Adler found. In 71% of the cases, schools 
continued to use the material, or excused the child of the challenger when it 
was used. 
</P>
<P>
About half the 300 reported challenges were based on religious grounds, 
including depictions of Satan or witchcraft in such classics as "Macbeth" or 
"Snow White." Popular films, such as "E.T.", and Sports Illustrated's annual 
swimsuit issue also have met with challenges from people who object to their 
being shown at school or available in school libraries. 
</P>
<P>
But far from being a trend on the rise, Adler found that people have objected 
for generations to what children read, something that generally goes unreported 
in all but the most sensational cases. 
</P>
<P>
Adler presented her findings in Sacramento on Thursday to the Educational 
Congress of California, the California Teachers Assn. and the California School 
Boards Assn., the groups that help fund her work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not new -- it's been going on ever since Colonial times in this 
country," Adler said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of having common schools that are meant for everyone in a very 
pluralistic society with many different religious and ethnic groups," she said. 
"There's that inherent tension there." 
</P>
<P>
What is disturbing, Adler said, is that nearly a fourth of the school districts 
responding lack formal policies to handle such objections. "It means that 
either a district will not give someone a fair hearing, or someone will just 
remove a text without really considering what should be done," said Adler, a 
former school board member of the Saddleback Valley Unified District in Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
According to a national watchdog group based in Washington, censorship is on 
the rise in schools and libraries across the country. People for the American 
Way, an advocacy group opposed to what it views as censorship, documented 244 
challenges nationwide during the 1989-90 school year, with California 
accounting for nearly a third of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
But Adler, who did her doctoral dissertation at Claremont Graduate School on 
challenges to school materials, said she launched the survey last year after 
discovering there had been no comprehensive assessment of the number and type 
of challenges in California school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Only 40% of the state's districts responded. Of these, 35.6% reported 
challenges and only about a fourth were covered by the media, the survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
The most-questioned text or material was the "Impressions" reading series for 
elementary school youngsters. "Satanic" and "witchcraft" were the most-cited 
words used by those raising objections. "Religious conflict" was the 
second-most used term. More than 65% of the challengers were parents, and many 
of those were members of religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Foglia, president of the California Teachers Assn., said the findings show 
that the threat of censorship is rife in California. 
</P>
<P>
"These attacks are not just plain challenges," Foglia said. "They are a direct 
attack on our democratic and educational institutions. . . . And it's not 
happening in just a few places. It's happening across the country." 
</P>
<P>
But the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, whose Anaheim-based Coalition for Traditional 
Values led the fight to remove the "Impressions" series in at least 10 school 
districts around the state, accused Adler of deliberately downplaying the 
breadth of the movement.

AMERICAN INFERTILITY RATE NOT GROWING, STUDY FINDS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Despite a widespread perception that infertility is rapidly increasing in the 
United States, the rate actually has remained stable in recent years, 
government researchers reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 4.9 million American women between the ages of 15 and 44 had "an 
impaired ability" to have children, according to a study by the National Center 
for Health Statistics. That represents 8.4% of women in that age group -- the 
same percentage as in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The mistaken perception that the United States is experiencing an "epidemic of 
infertility" could reflect demographic and social changes affecting some groups 
of women more than others, the study suggested. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the number of childless women between 25 and 44 with impaired 
ability to conceive and carry a child to term has increased significantly 
"because of delayed childbearing and the entry of the baby-boom cohorts into 
the age range," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"The increased use of fertility services, the increased number of childless 
older women with impaired fecundity and other factors may help to account for 
the perception that infertility is increasing or that it is more common than it 
actually is," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Infertility is frequently defined as the inability to become pregnant after at 
least a year of trying. Fecundity is a measure of both the ability to conceive 
and the ability to carry a pregnancy to term. 
</P>
<P>
The study said that about 2.2 million women who had never had children had 
impaired fecundity in 1988, along with 2.7 million women who had given birth at 
least once. In 1982, the figures were 1.9 million and 2.6 million respectively, 
the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Among married couples, the overall percentage of infertility decreased from 
11.2% in 1965 to 8.5% in 1982 and to 7.9% in 1988, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2.3 million married women between the ages of 15 and 44 were infertile in 
1988, or slightly fewer than 1 in 12, the study said. These figures were not 
significantly different from the findings in 1982, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of women suffering from infertility has increased, but the 
population base has also increased. The incidence of infertility has not," said 
Joyce Zeitz, a spokeswoman for the American Fertility Society. 
</P>
<P>
Zeitz said she was not surprised by the study's findings. 
</P>
<P>
"We started hearing this so-called 'epidemic' story but when we started 
thinking it through we said, no, it's not going to wash," she said. "The 
reality is that there's more help available and more publicity about help. 
Therefore, more people are actively seeking help. There's a greater awareness 
out there, right down the line." 
</P>
<P>
The study results are based on a series of surveys conducted periodically by 
the National Center for Health Statistics, a branch of the Department of Health 
and Human Services. The 1988 survey involved personal interviews with 8,450 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"In some popular descriptions of infertility, it has been suggested that there 
are 9 or 10 million infertile couples, that 1 in 6 couples is infertile, that 
infertility is increasing rapidly, or that there is an 'epidemic' of 
infertility in the United States," the report said. "The findings of this 
report indicate that these perceptions are inaccurate."

The trustees of American University voted unanimously Thursday to rescind a 
controversial offer to pay nearly $1 million to buy out the contract of Richard 
Berendzen, the school's former president who pleaded guilty to making obscene 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Berendzen had asked the trustees to withdraw the offer after he was offered a 
chance to return as a full professor on the physics faculty in the spring of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement puts Berendzen, 51, on administrative leave with pay at his 
faculty salary for the 1990-91 academic year and the fall 1991 semester. His 
annual salary would be in the range of $70,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
He has continued to draw his annual salary of about $140,000 since resigning as 
president in April. 
</P>
<P>
Berendzen, named president in 1980, pleaded guilty to making obscene telephone 
calls to a woman from his office. Two 30-day jail terms were suspended in lieu 
of psychiatric treatment.

TRANSCRIPT OF NORIEGA TAPES IS RELEASED 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge Thursday released a 72-page transcript of telephone 
conversations of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, tape recorded in his jail cell talking 
to his wife, his daughters, his mistress and his mistress's mother. The talk is 
riddled with cryptic references to the weather, food deliveries, private 
messages and even Frankenstein. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the fragmented conversations, the former Panamanian dictator does 
little but listen and say yes. But in one phone call he seems to discuss 
government policies in his homeland and expresses concern for former allies now 
jailed. In another he complains that he jammed his fingers playing basketball. 
"Damn it," he says, "my hand swelled up." 
</P>
<P>
Release of the court transcripts followed a ruling Tuesday by U.S. District 
Judge William M. Hoeveler that the tapes, obtained in Panama last month by the 
Cable News Network, did not contain any conversations that might impede 
Noriega's right to a fair trial. Only one attorney-client conversation is 
included on the tapes, and that was broadcast by CNN Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
These conversations have already been before the U.S. Supreme Court in what was 
billed as a constitutional battle over freedom of the press and a criminal 
defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
The transcripts were entered into the court record Thursday when CNN decided 
not to appeal Hoeveler's ruling, which followed a motion by four news 
organizations arguing for their release. 
</P>
<P>
As CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said earlier this week, many of the 
conversations between Noriega and family members and friends seemed to be in 
code. In one conversation with a woman identified as Norma, the mother of 
Noriega's mistress, Vicki Amado, she addresses the general as "little soldier," 
and then goes on to tell him that "at any given moment there we have . . . a 
good towel." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, perfect," responds Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"And the important thing," adds Norma, "is that it shouldn't be a hand towel." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Noriega agrees. 
</P>
<P>
CNN has refused to say how it obtained the tape recordings, which were made at 
the federal prison south of here, where Noriega has been held on drug charges 
since he was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama a year ago this month. 
Frank A. Rubino, Noriega's chief attorney, said that CNN got the tapes from an 
official of the Panamanian government. 
</P>
<P>
Held in a two-room cell, Noriega has full-time access to a telephone but knows 
his calls are monitored and recorded. The English-language transcripts, 
compiled by a Spanish-speaking court interpreter, reveal little of Noriega's 
moods or thoughts. But they are filled with apparently guarded references to 
those who might aid his defense against charges that he received millions of 
dollars in payments from smugglers shipping cocaine into the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a co-defendant of Noriega's, former Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid, 
formally agreed Thursday in U.S. District Court to testify against his former 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid, once the commander of the Panamanian Defense Force in western Panama, 
pleaded guilty to illegally transporting U.S. funds. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea-bargain agreement, other charges resulting from his alleged 
involvement in racketeering and money-laundering with Noriega were dropped. 
Prosecutors say that Del Cid, who surrendered to U.S. forces during last 
December's invasion of Panama, acted as Noriega's emissary to the drug cartel.

Leftist radical Laura Whitehorn received a 20-year sentence Thursday for her 
role in bombing the U.S. Capitol and conspiring to set off seven other 
explosions that a prosecutor called acts of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Whitehorn was sentenced along with co-defendant Linda Sue Evans, who was 
ordered to serve five years for her part in the bombing conspiracy after 
completing a 35-year term she is already serving for illegally buying firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The two women, who pleaded guilty in a plea bargain Sept. 7, were sentenced by 
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene at a proceeding punctuated by cheers and 
applause from supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 7, 1983, bomb blast that blew a hole in the wall outside the Senate 
chamber and the explosions at seven other locations in Washington and New York 
City "were not symbolic gestures; they were distinct acts of terrorism," 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Margaret Ellen said. "Only chance prevented serious harm" 
to people, she added.

MAN TRIED 2ND TIME IN RACIAL SLAYING ACQUITTED

<P>
A Bensonhurst defendant whose first murder trial ended with a hung jury was 
acquitted Thursday of murder and manslaughter in the racially motivated slaying 
of a black youth. 
</P>
<P>
John Vento, 22, was the third defendant acquitted this week of major charges in 
the slaying. However, he was found guilty of riot. 
</P>
<P>
As the verdict was read, the defendant banged his hands on the defense table 
and screamed, "Yes, yes, yes." Vento then grabbed and hugged his lawyer before 
he was restrained by court officers. 
</P>
<P>
The jury in state Supreme Court returned the verdict during the second full day 
of deliberations. The riot conviction carries a maximum term of four years in 
prison. He faced 25 years to life in prison if convicted on the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was the second for Vento, the former star prosecution witness turned 
defendant. Vento backed out of a deal to testify against his friends after he 
and his family received threats. 
</P>
<P>
In July, a jury convicted Vento of unlawful imprisonment and menacing, but 
acquitted him of intentional murder. The panel deadlocked on a second murder 
count and riot. A few weeks later he also was indicted on second-degree 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
He is serving a prison term of up to eight years for the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors described Vento as a major participant in the Aug. 23, 1989, 
slaying of Yusuf Hawkins in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. Hawkins, 16, 
was in the predominantly white neighborhood to look at a used car when he was 
cornered by a gang of whites and shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
A jury Tuesday acquitted James Patino and Joseph Serrano of murder charges in 
the case. Serrano was convicted of a misdemeanor weapons possession charge. 
</P>
<P>
Another defendant, Joseph Fama, was convicted of murder. Three other defendants 
are to stand trial early next year for their alleged roles in the slaying.

AQMD'S HEARING BOARD CHAIRMAN STEPPING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold V. Brown abruptly resigned Thursday as chairman of the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District hearing board, declaring that he wanted "to get rid 
of some of the hassles." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Abramowitz, a member of the five-member panel and a former leader of the 
Venice-based Coalition for Clean Air, was elected to succeed Brown effective 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Abramowitz will serve through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing board, whose members are appointed by the AQMD's governing board, 
is a quasi-judicial body that rules on polluters' appeals of district staff 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, there have been complaints that the board has fallen behind schedule in 
issuing decisions and has not been evenhanded in its rulings. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't move our (agenda) very well. I think a lot of people see me as 
someone who can move the agenda. People also need to be given swift justice and 
there has been some concern they haven't gotten that," Abramowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 72, a retired occupational health specialist who was first appointed to 
the hearing panel in 1985, said he was tired of dealing with "motions, counter 
motions, objections, the vagueness of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Abramowitz told fellow board members after his unanimous election that he 
intended to "sit down and look at concerns procedural about our operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to ensure that everybody who comes before the board is going to be 
assured of a very fair hearing -- as they always have. They will have the 
benefit of my full attention," Abramowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Abramowitz successfully sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
to require it to disapprove the AQMD's clean air plan. Abramowitz argued that 
the plan failed to guarantee that the region could comply with federal clean 
air standards.

LOTTO TICKET PURCHASED IN ONTARIO WORTH $44.4 MILLION

One winning ticket was purchased for the $44.4-million jackpot in Wednesday's 
California Lottery Lotto 6/53 game, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket with all six winning numbers was sold in Ontario, and the holder or 
holders can claim the ninth-largest prize in the history of the Lotto game. 
</P>
<P>
But the owner of a liquor store that sold the winning ticket said his 
excitement was dampened by a rule imposed only five days ago that keeps him 
from enjoying a share of the prize. 
</P>
<P>
The state Lottery Commission changed its policy on Dec. 1 to increase general 
sales commissions from a nickel to 6 cents on each ticket while discontinuing 
the practice of rewarding sellers of winning tickets with one-half of 1% of the 
top prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of getting $222,000, I got 6 cents for selling the ticket," said Ted 
Gable, owner of Corks &amp; Cans Liquor in Ontario. "Talk about mixed 
emotions." 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers were 7, 25, 26, 27, 36 and 39 with the bonus number 4.

ITALIAN AIR FORCE JET CRASHES INTO SCHOOL; 12 KILLED

A burning Italian air force jet plowed into a trade school on the outskirts of 
this city Thursday, killing 12 students and injuring as many as 100 others, 
officials said. Many of the survivors jumped from windows to escape the flames 
and were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The single-seat Macchi 326 trainer, on a flight from an air base near Verona, 
struck the rear of the Gaetano Salvemini Technical Institute, where 200 
students between the ages of 14 and 18 were attending class. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot had been trying to land in fields near the school after one of his 
engines caught fire, according to air force officials. He bailed out minutes 
before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in class when I saw from the window that this plane was coming straight 
for us near the ground," one student said. "I just had time to shout, 'What is 
that man doing? He must be mad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the 12 dead were all students in the classroom that was directly 
hit by the jet.

BUSH HAILS CHILE'S 'FAR-REACHING' DEMOCRATIC REFORMS;

SOUTH AMERICA: ON THE FOURTH LEG OF HIS TRIP, HE MEETS WITH PRESIDENT AYLWIN 
AND CHATS WITH FORMER DICTATOR AUGUSTO PINOCHET.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen years after a coup overthrew a democratically elected government 
strongly opposed by the United States, President Bush on Thursday saluted the 
re-establishment of Chilean democracy, which he said has been "every bit as 
far-reaching" as the revolutions that overthrew Communist governments in 
Eastern Europe last year. 
</P>
<P>
"In Chile, once more, the people shall govern," Bush said in a speech to the 
Chilean Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For the President, it was a day of symbolism -- one in which, as in Argentina a 
day earlier, the elements of newly inaugurated democracy barely covered up 
reminders of the time when military regimes tightly controlled political life 
and economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
He met at lunch with President Patricio Aylwin, elected last December and 
inaugurated in March -- and he shook hands and chatted briefly with Augusto 
Pinochet, the military dictator for 16 1/2 years. Pinochet has continued in a 
position of influence, as chief of the Chilean army. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, as Bush has traveled from Washington to Brazil, Uruguay, 
Argentina and over the Andes on Thursday to Chile, he has drawn attention to 
the renewal of democracy throughout the hemisphere and, in particular, the move 
toward less government control over debt-ridden economies. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who winds up the tour with an overnight stop tonight in 
Venezuela, told the legislators: "Every year under autocratic rule served only 
to deepen your devotion to freedom and tolerance and respect for human rights, 
to strengthen Chile's collective resolve to make this return to democracy 
permanent and to make it irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he saluted the economic progress Chile has made over the 
past five years, as a result of Pinochet's free-market policies and their 
acceptance by Aylwin. 
</P>
<P>
Those policies, along with the political stability that the repressive Pinochet 
government imposed upon Chile by tightly controlling dissent, figured in the 
creation of an economic climate that began attracting foreign investors back to 
Chile. In the early 1970s, nationalization of key industries under the 
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende resulted in economic and 
political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1985, about $2.5 billion in new investment has flowed into Chile," the 
President said. "Capital flight, which has sapped the economic strength of so 
many Latin nations, has now reversed itself, turned around with returning funds 
spurring new investment here." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke at the starkly modern legislative building, still under construction 
in the seaside city of Valparaiso, which he reached by a 40-minute ride aboard 
his Marine One helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
At a state dinner Thursday night in Santiago, Bush told Chileans: "You deserve 
your reputation as an economic model for other countries in the region and the 
world. Your economic growth is the pride of Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
The dinner was held at La Moneda, the presidential palace in downtown Santiago 
where Allende took his life as tanks and aircraft attacked in the September, 
1973, coup. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater described the reception Bush has 
been given here and at the three previous stops on his journey as "a love fest" 
compared with the unease with which South America has often regarded the United 
States -- and with the rocky reception some U.S. politicians have received. 
</P>
<P>
But the reception was not entirely friendly. 
</P>
<P>
A decoy limousine driven just ahead of the President's armored car in a 
motorcade was hit by an egg. And at least six bombs exploded in Santiago during 
the night Wednesday, before Bush arrived midday Thursday. Police reported that 
no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Before the visit, the Bush Administration worked to ease some of the sore 
points in U.S.-Chilean relations. Last Saturday, Bush lifted a ban on military 
aid and sales to Chile that was imposed in 1976 after former Chilean Foreign 
Minister Orlando Letelier, a prominent foe of Pinochet, and an American aide, 
Ronni Moffit, were killed in a car bombing in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In another move also intended to patch up differences, in late November Chile 
was allowed back into the Generalized System of Preferences, which grants 
tariff concessions. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley has said, Chile will be able to 
increase exports to the United States by approximately $100 million from the 
present $1.45 billion a year. The Reagan Administration had excluded Chile from 
the system in 1988 to protest Pinochet's repression of the Chilean labor 
movement.

</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein told Iraq's Parliament to free all foreign hostages "with our 
apologies" as a response to "positive changes" in the Persian Gulf crisis. The 
"guests" should be released because the need to deter an attack has diminished, 
and Iraqi troops have had time to prepare for battle, Hussein said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said it is urgently studying how to get Americans out with 
maximum speed and efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has moved an additional 30,000 troops into Kuwait and southern Iraq, and 
10,000 U.S. reinforcements have arrived in the gulf, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said the Iraqi buildup seemed to indicate that Iraq 
does not intend to leave Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pressed NATO allies to send more 
troops and arms in support of the buildup against Iraq. He welcomed air 
defense, artillery and other units, along with transport help, medical supplies 
and ammunition.

SOME EUROPEANS INSIDE IRAQ ARE NOT HOSTAGES, U.S. INVESTIGATORS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNICIANS: A NUMBER OF FOREIGN NATIONALS MAY ACTUALLY BE WORKING VOLUNTARILY 
TO KEEP KEY FACILITIES OPERATING.

<P>
In apparent defiance of international sanctions against Iraq, a number of 
Europeans portrayed as hostages in Baghdad actually are technicians working 
voluntarily to keep Iraq's weapons facilities and other key industries 
operating, American investigators now suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of foreign nationals involved is believed to be small, 
investigators said they are helping to maintain key facilities, including 
Iraq's main chemical-weapons plant. Some are Germans who appear to be moving in 
and out of Iraq freely through Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicions are based, in part, on accounts provided by freed hostages who 
have reported seeing Europeans at work, apparently voluntarily, at strategic 
sites where "human shields" have been held to deter a possible U.S.-led 
military strike. 
</P>
<P>
The critical assistance poses a threat to the effectiveness of the U.N. embargo 
against Iraq and is a source of particular frustration to U.S. officials eager 
to find a way to stop the workers. 
</P>
<P>
German federal prosecutors confirmed that they are investigating 20 to 30 cases 
involving companies and individuals believed to be providing illegal services 
and commodities to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We suspect there are Germans who indeed may be doing things they are not 
supposed to be doing," said a Bonn official who spoke on condition that he 
remain anonymous. "We can't do anything to stop them if they are over there 
already. We can't exactly shoot their families or confiscate their property 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Former hostages have reported that as recently as last month that some Germans 
were seen working at a cannon factory north of Baghdad, while others have been 
working at Iraq's main chemical-weapons plant in Samarra. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence indicates that other foreign nationals, including Brazilians and 
Japanese, may be assisting Saddam Hussein's regime under the guise of being 
held hostage, a congressional investigator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
When he appeared Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III was asked privately by Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) to contact the German and Brazilian governments about the status of 
their nationals in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In testifying before a House committee that day, CIA Director William H. 
Webster said the sanctions have curtailed Iraq's imports and exports 
substantially. But he acknowledged that most vital industries are still 
operating and that some goods are being smuggled into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"What little leakage has occurred is due largely to a relatively small number 
of private firms acting independently," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Western businesses provided technology and expertise to Iraq before the 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a congressional panel reported Thursday that the Commerce 
Department has approved sales of $700 million worth of sensitive equipment to 
Iraq in recent years, including more than 20 shipments of biological agents. 
Although the agents could be intended for medical purposes, they also could be 
used to develop biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
By far the largest suppliers of Iraq in recent years have been the Germans. A 
recent Senate report identified 68 German firms involved in the sale of 
military-related goods to Iraq. The Germans routinely provided workers to 
operate the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The German government source said the number of German workers who have stayed 
behind in Iraq is between 10 and 20, and that all "had a chance to get out but 
decided to stay." However, spokesmen for the chancellor's office and the 
Foreign Ministry in Bonn both said they had no knowledge that Germans still in 
Iraq are supporting the production of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
A chancellery spokesman said that there are 15 Germans still in Iraq, all 
married to Iraqis, and that none want to leave. The Foreign Ministry spokesman 
put the number at 10 and said they will be coming home in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One recently released German hostage, Manfred Ritschel, said in an interview 
that he heard secondhand of Germans working for the Iraqis at one "human 
shield" site, a steel plant north of Baghdad used to manufacture cannons. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was shifted from Samarra to the atomic research plant, I met some 
American and English hostages who told me, 'You should have been at this other 
prison where we were -- then you could have spoken with some of your countrymen 
who were working there,' " said Ritschel. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was aware of chemical production at the Samarra site when he was 
held there. 
</P>
<P>
"We could smell the stench every day when they took us outside to go to the 
dining area," said Ritschel. "I used to live near a chemical factory in Germany 
where there were emissions once or twice a day, and I know a chemical smell." 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not see any workers or hear anyone speaking German or English. 
Other reports have indicated, however, that foreign workers are being used at 
the Samarra facility. 
</P>
<P>
The German magazine Der Spiegel reported this week that a returned hostage saw 
German experts working at a military research center in Mosul, which is 
equipped with a large amount of German machinery. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional investigator said that Brazilians are believed to be working 
at the Mosul site and that Japanese employees of a nuclear-fuel reprocessing 
firm also are suspected of working in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
When Ritschel was released in mid-November and flew back to Germany, he said a 
group of two dozen or so Germans aboard the plane apparently had not been 
hostages. He said they were the only ones who did not join in the party during 
the flight home. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy was working up to the last day on a pipeline in the north," he said. 
"Nobody on the plane mentioned anything about anybody being forced to work." 
</P>
<P>
Frantz reported from Washington and Jones from Bonn.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When they first saw the yellow balloons everywhere in the hotel's fancy dining 
room, the relatives of American hostages were not amused. Numb with fatigue 
after a much-delayed journey of more than 8,000 miles, many thought this Iraqi 
touch was unseemly. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us thought it was a bit cruel," said the wife of one U.S. hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Little did they know that the international color of remembrance would prove, 
less than a day later, to be a tip-off to the very best news they could have 
hoped for: Their husbands and fathers will be released, along with other 
American hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The news that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein intends to release all foreign 
hostages swept the Monsour Melia Hotel on Thursday afternoon like a brush fire. 
And it brought rejoicing and tears of happiness to many of the American 
hostages and their relatives, reunited at the posh hotel only hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The relatives had arrived Wednesday night in Baghdad expecting to devote a week 
or more to the tedious round of meetings with Iraqi officials that has been a 
prerequisite for the release of hostages. That was the experience of all 
previous relatives who had journeyed here to seek freedom for their loved ones. 
Among them have been Japanese, British and a handful of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups of Western and Japanese hostages had been released to former 
officials and prominent figures, including former British Prime Minister Edward 
Heath, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and, most recently, 
former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammed Ali. 
</P>
<P>
And so this first delegation of American relatives was clearly taken by 
surprise when they heard the good news over the British Broadcasting Corp. Many 
of the relatives were closeted in their rooms composing -- in longhand -- 
personal appeals to Hussein when word reached the 7th floor of the hotel where 
most of them were staying. 
</P>
<P>
By then, nearly all their loved ones had been brought to the hotel from 
strategic sites throughout Baghdad, where they were being held as human 
shields. 
</P>
<P>
And within hours, the joyous American hostages and their relatives were 
celebrating in the hotel's dining room and bar, joined by about 40 newly 
released Japanese hostages and a dozen or so British hostages. The Iraqis had 
prepared a lavish buffet dinner for them, featuring grilled chicken, curried 
lamb, soup and rice pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lost 28 pounds in the gulag," Robert Vinton, a 58-year-old sales manager 
for the Johnson Control Corp., based in San Francisco, shouted over the din in 
the bar. "It's been a love-hate relationship with the people who keep you." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the American hostages recounted varying experiences in captivity. Some 
said they were well fed but lacked basic sanitary conditions and personal 
toiletries. But others spoke of eating little more than fish heads and handfuls 
of rice, with occasional cucumber slices. None said they were physically 
abused. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the hostages did not wish to speak in great detail or to be quoted by 
name, begging off until they are out of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
One hostage, saying that he lost 15 pounds, joked: "We're thinking of starting 
a Saddam Hussein Health Center." 
</P>
<P>
Rosalind Brown, an Atlanta, Ga., woman, also was in a jovial mood as she dined 
with her husband, Cecil. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got here," she said, "we were joking that they would let us go real 
soon -- because they would get sick of all us women really fast. But this, 
nobody expected." 
</P>
<P>
On a more somber note, Edward Smiley, a 42-year-old Los Angeles man, said he 
thought on several occasions that he would never see his wife, Barbara, again 
-- "especially when they moved me to a new site and I could see outside the 
window that this was a chemical production plant. There was a lot of activity."

The World Bank said Thursday it expects to channel an extra $4 billion over the 
next two years to countries hard hit by the economic fallout of the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Shakow, director of external affairs for the bank, said the extra cash 
would be meant to cushion social and economic disruption caused by the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Increased funds, generated either by speeding up payments or by increased 
allocation of resources, would be aimed primarily at the three "front-line 
states" -- Egypt, Jordan and Turkey -- and at nations in Eastern Europe and the 
Indian subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, together with the International Monetary Fund and major 
industrialized nations, has campaigned for increased funding for countries hit 
by spiraling oil prices or a sudden drop in remittances by expatriate workers.

RAIDERS: ASPIRING ACTOR ISN'T MERELY A SPEEDSTER. HE'S A MORE COMPLETE 
RECEIVER.

Good thing Willie Gault is fast, otherwise he'd never be able to outrun his 
schedule. Last summer, he pulled on his tights and conducted a summer camp for 
the Long Beach Ballet Company, during which he attempted to convince troubled 
inner-city youths they can dance their way to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them were borderline gang kids," Gault said. "They had a lot of 
questions, like 'What did my friends say when I first started to do ballet? Did 
they call me a sissy?' " 
</P>
<P>
Good question. Gault said no, then asked how many of them could twirl a girl 
over their head to the backdrop of "Swan Lake"? It wasn't exactly "Dance Fever" 
after that, but the troupe increased its male membership from one the previous 
year to 14. 
</P>
<P>
Gault is always late. Where did the time go? An actor's work is never done. 
Actor? Yes, Gault has been studying professionally seven years dating to his 
days in Chicago at the Goodman Theatre and Second City. Even during this Raider 
season, in which he plays a significant role at wide receiver, Gault takes 
lessons two or three nights a week and every Tuesday, the team's day off. Gault 
isn't looking for a post-career of dumb-jock roles and light-beer commercials. 
He's talking about pushing Billy Dee Williams out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Leading-man types," Gault said. "Serious actors. There aren't enough black 
people right now in the industry. I want to make quality movies that are 
important to life." 
</P>
<P>
Gault has read for most of the major studios in town, he said. He turned down 
significant roles in two projects last summer because they conflicted with the 
opening of football training camp. One film, "The Killing Street" was to be 
shot in Israel with Gault playing a detective. The other was an ABC-TV pilot 
called, "Moe's World," which we're assured had nothing to do with the Three 
Stooges. 
</P>
<P>
No worries. Gault made up for the disappointment by doing a cover shot for the 
October issue of the Cable Guide with actress Jamie Lee Curtis. In the 
revealing photo, Curtis covers Gault better than in the days of cornerback 
Lester Hayes and stickum. 
</P>
<P>
Then came letters that objected to the interracial pairing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of conservative people from the South, basically, didn't like 
the idea of a black man with a white woman on the cover," Gault said. "It's 
very amazing, in this day and time. I know it happens, but to be so blatant 
like that. It's very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
In his spare time since, Gault has also tried out for the U.S. bobsled team and 
lent his name and time to a dozen or so charities. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't think it leaves much time for football, Gault's real profession, 
but it doesn't reflect in his work. In fact, Gault is the Raiders' leading 
receiver this season with 42 catches for 713 yards. With four games remaining, 
Gault will probably break his career marks for receptions and yardage. He has 
already tied his best season for catches, set in 1986, and he's 124 yards short 
of surpassing his best season for yardage, set as a rookie with the Chicago 
Bears in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Gault, a sprint star at the University of Tennessee, is also dispelling some 
deep-rooted myths about his abilities. It's the stuff that follows most former 
track stars into the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
In his eight-year career, the first five spent in Chicago, Gault was considered 
a deep threat with bad hands, a speed ornament used to stretch opposing 
defenses. He wouldn't risk his body by running routes over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
But 1990 has changed some opinions. With Bo Jackson and Marcus Allen in the 
backfield and Jay Schroeder at quarterback, the Raiders aren't throwing deep as 
much as they once did. Gault has only two touchdown receptions this season but 
has become a more complete receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Last week against Denver, he had 99 yards in nine catches -- a career high for 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who makes up what a player should be," he said. "But I've always 
been known as a player who's not a possession-type receiver, who doesn't go 
over the middle a lot. But if you look at my stats, probably 85% or 90% of the 
passes I've caught have been over the middle, in one form or another. I feel 
that I'm somewhat of a complete receiver." 
</P>
<P>
Gault is convincing others. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a secret to being a great receiver in this league," he 
said. "You just have to get the opportunity. The great ones drop passes: (Fred) 
Biletnikoff, (Steve) Largent, (James) Lofton, (Henry) Ellard, Jerry Rice. 
You're going to drop passes. I haven't dropped my last pass. No one still 
playing this game has dropped his last pass." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his multiple interests, Gault, 30, said he has no problems 
concentrating on the task at hand. He played for the Super Bowl champion Bears 
in 1985 and has longed for another ring. He thinks the Raiders (8-4) are on the 
threshold of something special, so Hollywood can wait. In acting, everything is 
self-indulging. In football, Gault leaves personal goals in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"If I catch more passes than I've caught in my career and have the team win, 
that's great," he said. "But if I catch 100 passes and we don't do anything, 
then it really doesn't mean much. Because when I look back on my career, I 
can't tell how many passes I caught in a year but I can tell you what we did as 
a team. The Super Bowl in (the) '85 (season). Last year we were 8-8. The year 
before we were 7-9." 
</P>
<P>
Gault doesn't know how many more years of football he will play, but he wants 
to make a smooth transition into acting. 
</P>
<P>
His manager, Travis Clark, said Gault has turned down several roles that would 
have served only to exploit his football celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Gault said he recently turned down a role in "Angel of Death" because it wasn't 
right. Gault wants his first role to reflect his work ethic. He once studied 
under respected instructor Sal Dano, and presently is working with method 
instructor John Sarno. 
</P>
<P>
"Most athletes don't prepare themselves," Gault said. "They expect to go off 
the field, and just because they're a celebrity, to do well. It's not like 
that. You have to prepare yourself. It's not just saying lines. It's emotions. 
It's as hard as one of the actors trying to come out here and play football."

MIKE DOWNEY: BASEBALL, MONEY SOON PART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About all these baseball deals, I was just wondering: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why don't the San Francisco Giants take some of that money and put it into 
a park? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Were I a baseball fan in Toronto, the trading of Fred McGriff, Tony 
Fernandez and Junior Felix for Joe Carter, Roberto Alomar and Devon White would 
immediately convert me into a hockey fan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can't those New York teams keep anybody? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Any Dodger game pitched by Kevin (Sandpaper) Gross and Jay (Pine Tar) 
Howell probably will be played under protest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attention, parents: Bud Black makes $10 million and you want your child to 
do his homework? 
</P>
<P>
 -- If they have another exploding scoreboard at the new Comiskey Park, Cory 
Snyder is going to make that baby go bang-zoom about 20 or 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shouldn't the commissioner set a quota on how many Japanese players the 
Detroit Tigers can have? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attention, you parents again: Zane Smith will make $3 million a year and 
you're letting your child use his right hand? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I want to see if I have this straight: Dave Righetti left the New York 
Yankees after George Steinbrenner lost control of the club? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oh, never mind. The important thing is that Steve Farr is a Yankee now and 
it's like 1927 all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Well, here it is Friday and the San Diego Padres haven't traded any 
All-Stars for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To the New York Met executive who said he preferred having Vince Coleman to 
Darryl Strawberry anyway, I have only 10 words to say: Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, 
ho, ho! Good one! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hey, we'll take Kevin McReynolds off your hands, too, pal. Give you $100 
cash. You'd probably rather have $100 cash. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I have this recurring nightmare in which Bo Jackson and Kirk Gibson are 
heading toward one another at full speed, chasing the same fly ball. Owwwwwwww. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Well, Brett Butler reportedly has reduced his contract demands to what 
Strawberry makes instead of what Jose Canseco makes. Oh, and he's dropped his 
demand that Peter O'Malley buy him Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let's see, the Oakland Athletics can afford to lose Willie McGee, and they 
can afford to lose Bob Welch. Boy, they really do think they're better than the 
Cincinnati Reds, don't they? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I have seen the Boston Red Sox pitching and I don't care where that 
left-field fence is . . . these guys could still use Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chicago Cubs continue to offer Mitch Williams to any manager in 
baseball who doesn't suffer from nerve or heart trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You know who could really be good someday? Ken Griffey III. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I have been thinking a little more about that Boston Red Sox pitching, and 
come to think of it, they could use me. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attention, parents of girls: Do not let your daughter grow up to be a 
sportswriter. It isn't the locker room I'm thinking about; it's the money. Put 
a bat and glove in her hands, and I mean today! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Come on, you can tell me: Jack McKeon is secretly running the Toronto Blue 
Jays, isn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do you suppose the Giants are telling all these new players of theirs to 
check out homes and schools in Denver or New Orleans? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let's see, who appeared in more Padre games: Joe Carter or Roseanne Barr? 
</P>
<P>
 -- You have seen what the Reds, Dodgers, Padres and Giants have been doing, 
but hurry over to Vegas and put a bundle on those fast-improving Atlanta Braves 
to finish fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Now that Joe Torre is managing the St. Louis Cardinals, he's making plenty 
of changes: Third-base coach -- Joe Garagiola; First base -- Bob Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New incentive clause for Roger Clemens: $50,000 for every playoff game he 
isn't kicked out of. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New incentive clause for Eric Davis: Round-trip air fare for all postseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New incentive clause for Darryl Strawberry: Free pork chops if his barber 
carves "Farmer John" onto the sides of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attention, parents: Major league baseball is considering expansion! 
Pitchers are desperately needed! No experience necessary! Right-handed, 
left-handed, underhanded, backhanded! We don't care! If your kid can kick a 
ball 60 feet 6 inches with his or her feet, give us a call! Operators are 
standing by! We provide uniforms, shoes, supporters (if applicant is male), 
rosin bags, soap for shower, everything your child will need! Big $$$$$ 
possible! Your son or daughter could be a multimillionaire baseball pitcher! So 
call today! Our salaries are insane!

NHL GOES NORTH, SOUTH -- NOT WEST; 
</P>
<P>
EXPANSION: FRANCHISES ARE AWARDED TO TAMPA, OTTAWA. TWO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
BIDS ARE DENIED.

<P>
The Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators won approval Thursday to join the 
NHL in 1992-93, even though arenas for the teams are only in the planning 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plan to expand from 21 teams to 28 during the '90s, the league's 
board of governors decided to venture into Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Former NHL star Phil Esposito helped Tampa beat bids by groups from nearby St. 
Petersburg and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a part-owner of this thing is the ultimate," Esposito said. "I've done 
everything in this game now." 
</P>
<P>
The governors also decided to return an NHL team to Canada's capital for the 
first time since 1934. 
</P>
<P>
Among those applications rejected were two from Southern California -- one led 
by Laker owner Jerry Buss, to play either in Anaheim or San Diego; and the 
other by Harry Cooper, owner of the San Diego Sports Arena -- seeking teams 
later in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Losers in the bidding were told that more teams will be added later. 
</P>
<P>
A San Jose franchise will begin play next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa bid includes assurance that the owners would overcome objections to 
the proposed site of a 22,000-seat arena. Ottawa plans to play its first season 
at a 10,000-seat downtown civic center. 
</P>
<P>
Esposito's group struck a deal earlier this week with four Japanese companies 
who will help finance Tampa's 18,500-seat arena. 
</P>
<P>
"To those Japanese investors, I thank you," Esposito said. "You're going to 
love hockey. I know you like sumo wrestling; we've got it all in hockey."

The NBA has agreed to drop its lawsuit against the Oregon Lottery's basketball 
betting game in return for the lottery's promise not to resume the game for at 
least five years. Last week, the Lottery Commission voted to discontinue the 
NBA portion of its weekly Sports Action game because of poor ticket sales.

WOMEN'S COLLEGIATE VOLLEYBALL; 
</P>
<P>
MCPEAK SWITCHED, AND NOW SHE'S FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Holly McPeak, the nightmare is now just a memory. In fact, she looks back 
on what transpired between her and her volleyball coach at California after 
last season as a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
And why shouldn't she? The 5-foot-7 setter's collegiate volleyball career was 
in jeopardy of ending a season early but now she's guiding top-ranked UCLA into 
tonight's West Regional at Pauley Pavilion, and quite possibly toward a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
McPeak, a standout at Mira Costa High in Manhattan Beach and one of the most 
heavily recruited setters in the country, had everything going for her. She led 
her high school team to a pair of state championships and a 52-1 record over 
her last two seasons, and was labeled by Volleyball Monthly magazine as "the 
most coveted setter in the country." 
</P>
<P>
In her first year at Cal, she was named the Pacific 10 Conference freshman of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
But then came Dave DeGroot, replacing Marlene Piper as coach, and McPeak's life 
in volleyball subsequently changed from one filled with optimism to one of 
growing frustration. Ultimately, she was banned from the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just basically, 'Do what you want. Get what you want out of it,' " 
McPeak says of Cal volleyball under DeGroot. "I never felt it was disciplined 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
But she had accepted a scholarship and as a sophomore was intent on making the 
most of her commitment, and the team was faring well. The Golden Bears with 
McPeak had gone 18-15 under Piper in 1987, then had posted a 19-15 record in 
'88 and a 19-13 mark in '89 under DeGroot. 
</P>
<P>
But McPeak and DeGroot did not get along. By the end of her junior year, McPeak 
said she lost respect for DeGroot as a coach and DeGroot considered her an 
uncoachable player. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted me to do one thing and I thought I was doing it," McPeak said. "His 
anger built up and I didn't know I wasn't doing the right thing because he 
never told me. It was just a buildup, and he didn't deal with it correctly, and 
it just blew up." 
</P>
<P>
DeGroot told McPeak not to bother to return for her senior year, which was fine 
with her, since she had no desire to come back anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I was considering not playing toward the end of last season, but he did not 
allow me to come back," McPeak said. "He was not being fair. He wouldn't even 
talk to me or explain why he did not want me to come back." 
</P>
<P>
DeGroot was on a recruiting trip and couldn't be reached for comment, but said 
last month: "I just thought it was best for (McPeak) to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Being so far along academically, she had all but decided to finish her senior 
year at Cal and then focus her training on the professional beach circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"Then somebody suggested an intra-conference transfer," McPeak recalls. "It 
popped back into my head that I could play again. It would really hurt me not 
to play and watch everybody else play in my senior year. I wasn't even 
considering the Pac-10 because of the rule, but somebody mentioned that I could 
petition for transfer to a UC school and I just went, 'Wow, UCLA!' " 
</P>
<P>
McPeak listened to that somebody and challenged the conference rule that states 
that a transferring student must lose two years of eligibility. She called UCLA 
Coach Andy Banachowski and with his help succeeded in gaining the support of 
representatives of all 10 conference schools, who voted unanimously to waive 
the transfer rule. 
</P>
<P>
"There were very unusual circumstances," Banachowski said. "(DeGroot) basically 
cut her from the team, told her she wouldn't play there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
McPeak said: "I thought there would be a 5% chance that it would pass, but it 
did and I'm in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DeGroot is looking for players to help a team that finished this 
season at 8-21 overall and at the bottom of the Pac-10 at 3-15. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Arce, another former Mira Costa star who just completed her final season 
under DeGroot, offered this assessment of the program: 
</P>
<P>
"There's no love lost between us. We got along as coach and player, but there 
were times in practice where I just couldn't believe the things we were still 
doing. I was frustrated and it was hard for me as a player to keep motivating 
myself and that's really odd for me because I still love volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of people who don't want to play because they don't want to come 
back under (DeGroot's) coaching, but I've also heard people who totally like 
him and believe in him, so there are two sides to it. But I personally did not 
enjoy my last year playing there with him." 
</P>
<P>
But all is well in Westwood, where McPeak and the No. 1 Bruins are going into 
tonight's 6:30 match against 14th-ranked New Mexico -- a team the Bruins have 
not played since 1970-71 and one that features two setters in its attack -- 
with a 32-1 record and a 29-match winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The second match pits No. 3 Stanford (26-3) against No. 19 San Diego State 
(24-11). 
</P>
<P>
McPeak will walk onto the court as only the 13th player in NCAA history to 
record more than 5,000 assists, but Banachowski says that her abilities go well 
beyond statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"She's helped us with so much in addition to the setting," he said. "Our team 
quickness and team defense have drastically improved this year and she's helped 
tremendously along those lines."

CITY BASKETBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. POWERS CRENSHAW, MANUAL ARTS AGAIN HAVE STATE INTENTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since March, when Manual Arts, the City's top-ranked and last surviving 
postseason basketball team, was ousted from the state playoffs, anticipation 
started to build for this season. 
</P>
<P>
With several City programs on the rise, at least four teams are considered 
among the state's best. City teams have won five of the nine modern State 
Division I titles: Crenshaw four of them and Manual Arts one. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Manual Arts won its first City 4-A title since 1981 by defeating 
Crenshaw, 84-72. But in the state playoffs, City teams were slighted. Manual 
Arts was seeded only third and Crenshaw and Fremont, which was runner-up in the 
3-A Division with a 29-3 record, were passed over. 
</P>
<P>
This season, quality teams and players can be found throughout the City 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
A look at The Times' preseason top 10 City Section basketball teams: 
</P>
<P>
1. MANUAL ARTS 
</P>
<P>
Western League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 27-4 
</P>
<P>
Third-year Coach Randolph Simpson has a solid team that is expected to repeat 
as City 4-A champion. Marcell Capers and All-City center William Celestine are 
gone, but the Toilers are still loaded with high-flying Kevin Beal, a 6-foot-5 
forward, and Dwain Bradberry, a returning starter at guard. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts will start three forwards and two guards because it does not have a 
true center. The Toilers' strength will be balance: every Manual Arts starter 
is taller than 6-3. Roland Merriwether (6-3), Bryan Smith (6-4) and Wilbert 
Knight (6-3) are the other starters. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the real big man," Simpson said. "But, we have guys who all can 
handle the ball well, shoot well, and everyone plays above the rim." 
</P>
<P>
2. CRENSHAW 
</P>
<P>
Southern League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 22-5 
</P>
<P>
Last season was supposed to be an off year for the Cougars, but Coach Willie 
West simply led Crenshaw to the 4-A final and finished with a 22-5 record. The 
Cougars have the two players who led them last season -- guards Kevin Ollie and 
Alexious Scruggs. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie, a 6-2 senior, led Crenshaw in scoring last season and is joined in the 
backcourt by Scruggs, a 6-2 junior, who loves to shoot. Last season, Crenshaw 
did not have its usual depth but look for it this season as West goes for his 
12th City title. 
</P>
<P>
3. FREMONT 
</P>
<P>
Central League (3-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 28-3 
</P>
<P>
There are many who think that Coach Sam Sullivan has the best team in the City, 
despite being in the 3-A Division, and they may be right. Last season, the 
Pathfinders blasted into the 3-A final with a chance to win 30 games but were 
upset by North Hollywood. This season, Fremont may be even better. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Ford, a 6-2 scoring swingman, and Michael Tate, a 6-7 inside force, lead 
the way for the Pathfinders, who won the 3-A title two seasons ago. Point guard 
Robert Moore controls Fremont's offense but a full-court pressure defense will 
again be the key for the Pathfinders. 
</P>
<P>
4. FAIRFAX 
</P>
<P>
Western League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 22-6 
</P>
<P>
Coach Harvey Kitani may have the sleeper team of the season, led by 6-5 Ryan 
Hickman and scoring guard Burt Harris. Last season Hickman averaged 18.5 points 
and 12.5 rebounds a game, and Harris has been the leading scorer for the Lions 
so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
5. CARSON 
</P>
<P>
Pacific League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 19-9 
</P>
<P>
Carson is best known as a football power, but this season, Coach Richard Masson 
has a basketball team that could duplicate its counterpart's success. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for the Colts is Rudy Washington, a 6-4 junior forward. The key 
for the Colts, though, could be the return of Khary Stanley, a 6-9 junior 
center, who has been out with a back injury. Look for Carson to be a force late 
in the season when it can feature a deep lineup with Stanley and several 
football players , who will return to action. 
</P>
<P>
6. WESTCHESTER 
</P>
<P>
Western League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 16-11 
</P>
<P>
The Comets have only one starting senior, but he is LeRoi O'Brien, a 6-8 
center. O'Brien averaged double figures in both scoring and rebounding last 
season. Coach Ed Azzam will look for leadership from O'Brien, but juniors James 
Gray, Lorenzo Ball and Marty Cotwright will have to contribute as well. 
</P>
<P>
7. RESEDA CLEVELAND 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 21-5 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers had Crenshaw on the ropes in the 4-A semifinals last season 
before losing in overtime, 91-90. Kevin Crider, who previously coached at Los 
Angeles High, is now the coach at Cleveland and has an experienced starting 
five. Kayheed Murray, a 6-5 senior, and Brandon Martin, a 6-4 junior, give the 
Cavaliers a solid forward combination. Cleveland will need time to adjust to 
Cryder, who is the team's fourth coach in a little more than a year, but should 
be a contender for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
8. WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
Southern League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 12-10 
</P>
<P>
Before starting high school, Barnabas James was touted as one the area's top 
players. Now, the 6-7 James is a senior and has slowly begun to live up to his 
potential. James, who averaged 18 points a game last season, leads a Washington 
team that will also have the scoring of guard Kevin Griffis. 
</P>
<P>
9. DORSEY 
</P>
<P>
Southern League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 22-6 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Kevin Gibson has a team that may be a year away, but look for 
the Dons to get better as the season goes on. Lynell Wiggins, a 5-6 point 
guard, and Juan Harris, a 6-7 center, are key returners. Depth will be a key 
for the Dons with Marquette Davis, Davey Fortson and Eric Scott, who will be 
joined by Keyshawn Johnson and Lamont Warren when football season ends. 
</P>
<P>
10. GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League (4-A Division) 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 17-9 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders have two starting forwards returning, Adrian Sellers and Jerry 
Allen, who combined to average 19 points a game last season. Coach Bob Johnson 
will feature a running attack, with point guard Jevon Lee leading the way.

OIL PRICES CONTINUE TO FALL ON NEWS OF ACTION ON HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil prices continued to plunge Thursday, falling to their lowest levels since 
late August, in reaction to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's order to free all 
foreign hostages being held in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Traders read the news as a further sign that war and the consequent disruption 
of world oil supplies are not imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Light sweet crude oil for January delivery traded as low as $25.25 a barrel 
Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange before recovering to settle at 
$26.40, down 89 cents from Wednesday's close. Prices had not traded that low 
since Aug. 29, when they reached an intraday low of $25.32 a barrel, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of negotiations toward a possible peace agreement have pushed prices down 
21% in the last week -- well below the $41.15-a-barrel record reached Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the drop were reports out of the International Energy Agency that 
world oil supplies are at their highest levels in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
If the Gulf crisis were to be settled peacefully tomorrow, some analysts 
believe that oil prices would easily plunge below $20 a barrel, lower than the 
$21 a barrel level in effect on the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of refined products also continued to fall Thursday. Unleaded gasoline 
for January delivery fell 2.34 cents a gallon to close at 66.5 cents -- its 
lowest price since the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
Home heating oil for January delivery, also at its lowest level since late 
August, closed down 1.43 cents a gallon at 79.71 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the selloff of crude came amid heavy trading early in the day, when 
prices opened about $1.24 a barrel lower, continuing the plunge of the day 
before, when prices fell $3.37 a barrel on signs of peace. 
</P>
<P>
"The NYMEX floor was a frenzy this morning," said Thomas Blakeslee, an industry 
analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "We are down on the 
news of the release of the hostages," as well as reports showing a surplus of 
world crude oil supplies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traders reacted strongly to news that Saddam Hussein had told Iraq's National 
Assembly to release all foreign hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"It's yet another step toward a peaceful negotiated settlement," Blakeslee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing were reports quoting Iraq's ambassador to the United States saying 
that hostages could be released by Christmas, and other speculation that Iraqi 
officials had scheduled a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff bottomed out at $25.25 a barrel, an important psychological 
barrier, traders said. During the Exxon Valdez oil spill, oil prices peaked 
around that level, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Prices edged upward after President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III gave guarded responses to Hussein's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
During a press conference in Chile, Bush reiterated that Iraq must still abide 
by the U.N. resolution calling for Iraq to unconditionally pull out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush and Baker statements were not that conciliatory, and that helped the 
market to rally a little," said Andrew Lebow, a trader at E. D. &amp; F. Man 
International Futures Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were divided about how low prices could dive in the next few days. "It 
would seem that barring any new news, a test of the lows would be unlikely," 
said Sal Gilbertie, a trader at Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
But, said trader Ed Kevelson at Dean Witter: "Of two measurements I use, one 
shows oil going to $23.40 and one goes all the way down to $18. Take your 
pick." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NYMEX officials on Thursday announced a series of steps to keep 
markets under control in the event of a war or other crisis that threatens to 
drive prices through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
The NYMEX board of directors late Wednesday approved limits that would prevent 
oil prices from rising or falling more than $15 in any single day. 
</P>
<P>
It would take quite a cataclysm to do that: The record one-day fall was $5.41 a 
barrel, reached during the current crisis on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The new limits would be imposed in steps. If prices moved $7.50, trading would 
be halted for an hour and a new limit of $7.50 imposed. If prices reached the 
new limit, trading would be stopped again. 
</P>
<P>
Similar rules were imposed on refined products, whose movements would be 
limited in two steps of 20 cents a gallon each. 
</P>
<P>
NYMEX officials said they hoped that the new rules would be approved by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission by next Wednesday.

DAMAGES PORTION OF BUCHWALD SUIT ENDS; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE JUDGE HAD ALREADY RULED THAT PARAMOUNT BASED A HIT MOVIE ON 
THE COLUMNIST'S STORY. NOW HE MUST DECIDE THE AWARD.

Attorneys for Paramount Pictures and Art Buchwald sparred over the 
enforceability of profit participation provisions in film contracts during 
closing arguments on damages in Buchwald's long-running suit against the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider is expected to decide shortly 
what damages Paramount has to pay Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim in the 
suit. Schneider previously ruled that the studio based "Coming to America," a 
hit film that starred Eddie Murphy, on a story by Buchwald. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments in the case have turned heavily on whether Paramount's standard 
profit participation provisions -- which closely resemble those used by other 
major studios -- are "unconscionable" and should be overturned or modified by 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
The columnist, who attended Thursday's hearing, has argued that a clear victory 
in the case would bar studios from writing participation clauses that pay 
little or nothing to participants until after the company has reaped major 
profits from a film through distribution fees and other devices. "If the judge 
rules they can't write contracts like this, that affects everybody," Buchwald 
said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, attorney Charles Diamond of O'Melveny &amp; Meyers, which 
represents Paramount, repeated his argument that the Buchwald and Bernheim 
contractual provisions are fair and were negotiated with help from a 
sophisticated representative from the William Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce O'Donnell of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, which 
represents Buchwald and Bernheim, continued to argue that the contract terms 
are "oppressive." They should be modified by the court to pay the writer and 
producer more than they would receive if the deal were strictly enforced, 
O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
In questioning the attorneys, Judge Schneider appeared to leave open a wide 
range of possible decisions. He repeatedly grilled the lawyers, for instance, 
as to whether they believed that Buchwald might be entitled to damages even if 
Bernheim were to receive nothing, assuming that his rights as a producer had 
expired long ago. Such a course might sharply diminish damages in the case, 
since Bernheim was entitled to a 40% cut of net profits under his contract with 
Paramount, while Buchwald was to receive only 1.5% of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
A decision by the judge appeared unlikely before next week, since he asked the 
lawyers to submit further documents over the next several days.

PEOPLE: CHAIRMAN OF TROUBLED TOY CHAIN RESIGNS

<TEXT>
<P>
Child World Inc.'s chairman, Dennis H. Barron, has resigned "to pursue other 
interests," the majority stockholder of the troubled toy chain disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for CNC Holding Corp., which owns 82% of the toy chain, declined to 
say when or why Barron left the post, but a source at Child World said the 
former chairman had been forced out at a CNC board meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Barron also gave up the position of president and chief operating officer of 
Cole National Corp., a Cleveland-based retail subsidiary of CNC Holding, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 182-store chain also has launched an aggressive discounting policy that 
threatens to dampen profits for all major sellers of toys, including Kmart Inc. 
and Wal-Mart Inc., during the Christmas selling season when the overwhelming 
majority of toy sales are made. 
</P>
<P>
Child World said earlier this week that it would stop paying its bills for six 
weeks to be able to pay cash for shipments of new toys to replenish its 
inventory for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The company also acknowledged it may be forced to file for protection from its 
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.

STATE TO GET OUT OF GEOTHERMAL BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Water Resources said Thursday that it will get out of 
the geothermal energy business. 
</P>
<P>
The state will shut down its power plants at Bottle Rock and South Geysers, 
near Calistoga, in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Steam wells had powered the Bottle Rock facility since 1985; South Geysers was 
never considered productive. 
</P>
<P>
The Bottle Rock facility, before power production ended there in September, was 
feeding a relatively small 7 megawatts of electrical power into the 
distribution system of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
Private geothermal producers contacted Thursday saw this as no big setback to 
development of geothermal power. Both Unocal Corp. and the Northern California 
Power Agency, a 14-city consortium, have successful operations in the same 
geothermal field. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is that the state doesn't know how to run an energy 
company," said Bob Taggart, senior vice president for external affairs for San 
Francisco-based California Energy Co., the leading U.S. independent geothermal 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
California Energy Co. operates several power plants, including one at China 
Lake in the Southern California desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a facility there that is cranking out 240 megawatts," Taggart said. 
"That supplies all electrical needs for 250,000 households." 
</P>
<P>
One technician familiar with the state's wells said Thursday that they had 
always been "marginal" steam producers, on the edge of the well field. 
</P>
<P>
They had also been plagued by caustic hydrogen sulfide gas, which corrodes 
metal pipe casings. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just in a bad part of the field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 7% of all electricity used in California is currently produced by 
geothermal wells.

Roberts Returns to Broadcasting: Kenneth J. Roberts, the former concert 
promoter who built KROQ-FM in Los Angeles into a rock radio giant before 
selling it for a then-record $45 million in 1986, has jumped back into the 
local broadcast scene with the acquisition of two small FM stations. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he has agreed to purchase KOCM-FM in Newport Beach and its sister 
station, KSRF-FM in Santa Monica, for $17.7 million. The two stations, both 
broadcasting at the same frequency -- 103.1 megahertz -- are owned by companies 
controlled by businessman Steven Udvar-Hazy, broadcast executive Jack Siegal 
and attorney Leonard Weinberg, all of Los Angeles. Roberts said the transfer of 
ownership should be completed by March 1.

THOSE WITHOUT JOBS HELP COUNSELORS HANG ON TO THEIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Alch, an Irvine employment consultant, is getting more last-minute notices 
about layoffs at his client companies these days. One recent Wednesday, he 
received a fax informing him that an Orange County hospital planned to lay off 
10 workers the following Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly asked three of his outplacement job counselors to clear their 
calenders and prepare for the task of soothing angry workers and helping them 
find new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As the economy continues to weaken and layoffs rise, companies that provide 
employee counseling and job search services are benefiting from brisker 
business. Alch, a senior vice president at the Irvine office of Drake Beam 
Morin Inc., a New York-based outplacement consulting firm, said he has 25% more 
executives and at least 75% more lower-level people using his services than 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The increase is making for busier days. "We very rarely get a call saying, by 
the way, in three months we're going to do some downsizing," Alch said. 
</P>
<P>
His office is one of about 30 outplacement firms in the Southland feeling the 
effects of growing joblessness in the aerospace and defense, electronics, 
financial services and other industries. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ellermeyer, senior vice president of New York-based Lee Hecht Harrison 
Inc.'s office in Irvine, said his firm has seen an increasing number of layoffs 
in 1990 and more senior management job cuts. Although senior managers are 
finding jobs, it is taking longer: an average of 6.5 months compared to 5.8 
months a year ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Outplacement firms report that corporate cutbacks began to rise in the fall of 
1989 and have accelerated in 1990. Lee Hecht's New York office predicts that 
they will continue through next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all industries are downsizing," said Robert Hecht, the company's 
co-chairman. "Even blue chip companies and firms that are not in trouble are 
revamping operations and finances." 
</P>
<P>
Robert McCarthy, president of a Century City outplacement firm, said some 
senior managers laid off from large corporations are settling for jobs with 
smaller firms or starting new careers. One former manager of a solar products 
company, for example, decided to open a video store in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Some big corporations have hired outplacement firms to prepare their employees 
for job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Alch, of Drake Beam, was hired by General Dynamics, the giant defense 
contractor, to help plan for the consolidation of its Pomona and Rancho 
Cucamonga plants. General Dynamics has said it will lay off 1,500 to 2,000 
people in the Los Angeles area by the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The project presents some special problems because General Dynamics notified 
employees of its layoff plan so far in advance. "Your best performers are the 
people who will bolt first during a downsizing, and the people who remain will 
be jittery," he said. "It's up to us to be on site, talking to people, 
measuring their mentality, to keep up internal morale." 
</P>
<P>
But Alch warns against looking for jobs with competitors. "It's easy for 
competitors to squeeze that individual like an orange and throw away the rind," 
he said.

S&amp;L CLEANUP ESTIMATE RISES TO $500 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The economic slowdown is likely to increase the bill for cleaning up the 
savings and loan mess to about $500 billion, the head of the General Accounting 
Office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Charles A. Bowsher, comptroller general and head of the congressional watchdog 
agency, cited the growing threat of a recession and the collapse of the junk 
bond market in offering his sober assessment of the likely cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Bowsher had estimated that there was an outside chance that the 
costs would reach the half-trillion-dollar level. Thursday, for the first time, 
he said that figure is the likely final bill for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"The recession and the junk bond collapse are both contributing to the fact 
that the costs keep creeping up on you," Bowsher told reporters after appearing 
before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bowsher also joined a growing chorus of experts both in and out of government 
who have called on federal regulators to move more quickly to sell off the real 
estate and other properties held by the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency that 
has taken on the assets of hundreds of failed thrifts bailed out by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Bowsher warned that if the federal government tries to hold on to some real 
estate to avoid flooding the market at a time of depressed prices, the 
properties held by the RTC will deteriorate and rapidly lose even more of their 
value. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't move these assets, the costs will keep getting higher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The economic slump not only will make it more difficult for the government to 
sell off properties held by the RTC, but also could lead to more S&amp;L 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the collapse of the junk bond market will also increase the 
government's costs because many of the non-real estate assets held by the RTC 
are junk bonds bought by failed S&amp;Ls. Those assets will now be worth even 
less than federal regulators initially had expected.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: DOESN'T PAY TO IGNORE FOREIGN STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bargain hunters are jumping back into the U.S. stock market, believing that the 
persian Gulf crisis is all but over. But what's a bigger bargain at this point: 
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, now off just 6.9% year to date -- or 
stocks in France, Germany, Singapore and a host of other foreign markets, all 
off 15% or more on average? 
</P>
<P>
If you still haven't diversified into foreign stocks, now's a good time to 
start planning that move. Many overseas markets dramatically outperformed the 
U.S. stock market in the 1980s. In the 1990s, history may not repeat exactly, 
but there's little question that many foreign economies will grow much faster 
than ours. Keep your money only in the United States and you risk missing some 
exceptional opportunities in foreign stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest way to invest overseas is through mutual funds that target foreign 
stocks. That way, you leave the driving to professionals. Right now, those pros 
are scanning depressed overseas markets for some hint that the slide is mostly 
over. There's still plenty of caution. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been one of the worst years for international markets in the last 20 
years," laments Nancy Langwiser, who manages the $82-million Lifetime Global 
Equity fund, a Boston-based fund that's part of Massachusetts Financial 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
The problems overseas are no different from what U.S. markets have faced, 
Langwiser notes: Rising inflation, higher interest rates, deteriorating 
corporate earnings and worries about Iraq. Foreign stocks have suffered worse 
than U.S. stocks, partly because foreign markets are smaller, less liquid and 
thus more volatile, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Langwiser has been conservative all year -- which kept her fund to a net drop 
of just 5% this year through Nov. 29. The fund is 30% in cash, a huge safety 
cushion. But now, as she looks at battered foreign stocks, she says, "I think 
values are beginning to emerge, though there's still a lot of risk." Her 
heaviest positions outside the United States, by percentage of fund assets: 14% 
in British stocks, 10% in Dutch and 8% in German issues. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Coco, who runs the $84-million FT International Trust foreign stock fund 
in New York, also is beginning to feel more positive, particularly about 
Britain. Inflation has leaped to double digits there, but Coco sees the rate 
coming down in 1991. Once the turn is apparent, it will be enough to rejuvenate 
British stocks, she says. 
</P>
<P>
No market needs more rejuvenating than Japan's: The Nikkei index has plunged 
42% this year, and Tokyo stocks have come under renewed pressure in recent 
weeks. They look cheap, but John Hickling, who took over Fidelity Investments' 
$80-million Pacific Basin Fund in Boston last April, looks at Japan and 
remembers what retired Fidelity legend Peter Lynch used to warn: "Don't confuse 
price with value." 
</P>
<P>
Hickling inherited a 50% Japanese stock weighting in the Pacific Basin Fund, 
which is a major reason the fund was off 26% this year through Nov. 29. Even at 
today's prices, Japanese stocks don't yet look like a good bet for new money, 
Hickling says. Inflation continues to rise in Japan, pressured by wage 
increases stemming from that nation's labor shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Japan is down more than other markets doesn't make a difference 
to me. It was more overvalued than most," Hickling says. 
</P>
<P>
The same applies to Thailand's market, which was one of the best performers in 
1989 but took a hard hit earlier this year, Hickling says. Yet, he adds, Thai 
stocks "are getting closer" to value levels now, selling for 12 to 13 times 
earnings, on average. In Australia, too, "I think we're getting closer to the 
bottom," he says. "They're already in a recession . . . and speculation has 
been wrung out of their financial system." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, meanwhile, still looks great to Hickling. It's one of the few 
markets that is up for the year, and Hickling has a 15% weighting there. "When 
you talk about cheap stocks, it's at the top of the list for low 
price-to-earnings ratios and attractive yields," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even if foreign markets roar back to life in 1991, any investors legitimately 
wonder if those stocks can do as well in this decade as they did in the 1980s. 
The average global stock mutual fund gained 246% in the 10 years ended Sept. 
30, according to fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services. The average U.S. 
stock fund rose 207%. 
</P>
<P>
One kicker in the '80s was the decline of the dollar, which automatically 
boosted the value of foreign stock holdings of American investors. Many fund 
managers admit it's unlikely that the dollar will provide that kind of bonus in 
the '90s. And if the dollar reverses course and rises in value, American 
investors in foreign stocks could see their holdings erode in value. 
</P>
<P>
Should you just stay home with your dollars? John Templeton, the head of 
Templeton Mutual Funds and one of the deans of international stock investing, 
recently told a group of analysts in New York that American stocks "may be 
better bargains than usual" now versus foreign stocks precisely because 
American stocks lagged their foreign peers in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Still, American investors who don't keep some part of their portfolio overseas 
probably will regret it over the long term. Lifetime Global Equity's Langwiser 
notes that one key attraction for American stock pickers is that many young 
foreign markets "are much more inefficient than the U.S. market." In other 
words, the stock prices often don't accurately reflect their companies' 
prospects, because stock investing is a relatively new game in many countries. 
</P>
<P>
Hickling, for example, says he finds some great values in Japanese convertible 
bonds (which convert to stock at a preset price) because that market is 
"underdeveloped and misunderstood in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
But the best reason to invest overseas in the '90s is simply that, in a world 
where capitalism is blossoming, America has less of a monopoly than ever on 
good business ideas. Ignoring foreign stocks is like selling the world short. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
YOU THINK WE'VE GOT IT BAD? 
</P>
<P>
Foreign stocks have performed far worse, on average, than the U.S. market this 
year -- which could mean that if you're in the mood to bargain-hunt, overseas 
investments could be a better place to look.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: INVESTING IN WORKER SKILLS PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Valerie Shaw used her public relations skills to recruit 
students interested in learning the craft of shoe repair. Today, she is 
recruiting trainees for the Shoe Healer, her own high-tech shoe repair shop at 
Sunset and Vine in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 problem in my industry is finding good people who will stay," said 
Shaw, whose father is a veteran shine man in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In her quest to find energetic and loyal employees, she has hired former gang 
members and felons as well as skilled cobblers she affectionately calls "the 
cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw and her four master cobblers are gearing up to train future cobblers with 
state employment training funds available to business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"The short-term needs of businesses are so great that many can't pay attention 
to longer-term needs like training," said John Hurley, president of the 
Alexandria, Va.-based American Society for Training and Development. 
</P>
<P>
Hurley, who heads the corporate training department at Chase Manhattan Bank in 
New York City, said American businesses and corporations invest about $475 
billion a year in capital improvements but spend only $30 billion a year on 
training and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Although most executives agree that training workers is important, a recent 
survey by the society found that only 0.5% of the executives polled were 
willing to invest money to improve the problem-solving skills of their workers. 
</P>
<P>
"More executives are interested in dumbing-down the work rather than 
smartening-up the people," said Hurley, who recommends that business owners 
spend at least 1% of their payroll cost to train workers. 
</P>
<P>
Although big companies budget for in-house training programs, small-business 
owners have to be creative. Hurley suggests asking the bigger companies from 
which you buy or to which you sell for help with training your workers. Many 
large public companies, including Ford, Motorola, Xerox and IBM, spend millions 
of dollars training workers at all levels and attribute their growth and 
profits to investing in their employees. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 46 states offer some type of state-funded, industry-specific 
training programs. Last year, California's Employment Training Panel paid 
companies $62.8 million to help business owners train or retrain 35,000 workers 
who were previously on unemployment or needed new skills to maintain a 
competitive edge. Seventy-nine percent of the businesses that participated in 
the program have fewer than 250 employees, according to Ken Nather, an analyst 
for the panel's planning and information unit. Companies receive the money 
after they train and hire the workers. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Job Training Partnership Act also provides about $4 billion a year 
to train economically disadvantaged workers. About 11,000 business 
representatives serve on the private industry councils set up across the 
country to allocate the federal training funds. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Shaw, who established her business with help from her mother, wants to 
help her employees buy Shoe Healer franchises in the next few years. Shaw 
obtained her training funds with the help of Nanci Prince, executive director 
of community and women's business development for the Central Park Five 
Council, a nonprofit organization in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We are able to apply for city, state and federal monies that were at one time 
anti-poverty program funds," said Prince, who charges clients a $250 fee to 
prepare grant applications. If the grant is denied, she refunds the money to 
the business owner. If the grant is approved, clients pay her an additional 
$500 fee. 
</P>
<P>
"Small-business owners like Valerie Shaw really need support because small 
businesses create more jobs than large companies," said Prince, who conducts 
business planning workshops for clients every Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to writing grant applications, Prince collects money, equipment and 
supplies from corporations interested in helping small-business owners train 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for their financial support, Prince and a group of colleagues 
provide free meeting and party planning services for their corporate angels. In 
recent months, Shaw's team has obtained sewing machines from Singer and 
computers from IBM. 
</P>
<P>
She has recruited a maker of upscale baby bedding to train seamstresses, a 
heating and air-conditioning contractor to train workers and a commercial 
photographer to train assistants and photographers. To qualify for the training 
money, business owners must contribute to the state's unemployment insurance 
program and have the ability to train people at their place of business. They 
must also be willing to hire a third of the workers who complete the training 
program and help find jobs for the others, according to Prince. 
</P>
<P>
For workers who can earn at least $8 an hour, employers can qualify for about 
$3,000 in training funds. Businesses that provide training for jobs paying $10 
or more an hour can qualify for about $5,000 per trainee. 
</P>
<P>
"So many programs turn people out to make less than $10 an hour, and you can't 
live on that," said Prince. She said that to qualify, trainees must be 
unemployed, on welfare or considered under-skilled. Prince said many potential 
employees are referred by their social workers and others. 
</P>
<P>
Prince and her colleagues are available to set up similar job training programs 
anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The American Society for Training and Development is at 1630 Duke St., 
Alexandria, Va. 22313. Business owners who join can obtain a variety of 
brochures and information about training programs. The phone number is (703) 
683-8100. 
</P>
<P>
Nanci Prince can be contacted through the Central Park Five Council, 1043 West 
46th St., Los Angeles 90037. Her business planning workshops meet Saturday from 
10 a.m. to noon in front of the Old Fashion Cookie Co. in University Village at 
Jefferson and Hoover boulevards. 
</P>
<P>

L.A. PROTEST PART OF UNION EFFORT AGAINST NORDSTROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A union's prolonged war with the Nordstrom department store chain in Washington 
state spilled into Los Angeles and four other cities Thursday, with 
demonstrations intended to pressure Nordstrom into signing a new labor 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The negative publicity campaign, coordinated by the international office of the 
1.3-million-member United Food and Commercial Workers Union, was timed to make 
a dent in Nordstrom's holiday sales. 
</P>
<P>
The old contract between UFCW Local 1001 and six Nordstrom stores in the 
Seattle-Tacoma area expired in mid-1989. Since then, the two sides have been 
unable to come to terms on a new pact. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Local 1001 has accused Nordstrom of encouraging sales 
associates to perform many of the chain's famed customer-service activities on 
their own time. Since the workers are paid by the hour, such practices would be 
illegal. Washington state labor officials have sided with the union, and many 
workers have confirmed the allegations in interviews with newspaper reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-Tacoma area is the only part of the country in which the 63-store 
chain's sales associates are unionized. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's demonstrations were held at the Nordstrom store in Westwood, and at 
stores in San Diego, San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
A Nordstrom spokesman said persistent union criticism of the store is an unfair 
attack on Nordstrom's "entrepreneurial environment," in which successful sales 
associates can earn substantial commissions. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Nordstrom employees in Washington state who are opposed to union 
representation have mounted a campaign to decertify Local 1001. However, that 
effort was stalled earlier this year when the union complained to the National 
Labor Relations Board that Nordstrom was illegally assisting the employees. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom last month agreed in a settlement with the NLRB to refrain from 
showing preferential treatment to employees involved in the decertification 
campaign.

DOW FALLS 7.92 IN EXTREMELY HEAVY TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blue chips slipped in heavy trading Thursday after a brief, euphoric rally on 
new hints of a peaceful resolution to the Iraq crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index, which had been up nearly 36 points early in the 
session, ended with a loss of 7.92 points at 2,602.48. 
</P>
<P>
But in the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 
4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 869 up, 
710 down and 456 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
And Big Board volume soared to 256.38 million shares, the heaviest since a 
416-million-share day on Oct. 16, 1989. Volume was fattened by institutional 
traders and computer trading programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts suggested that the volume surge, along with the market's confused 
performance, are signs that something big is about to happen -- either a sharp 
selloff or a powerful new advance. 
</P>
<P>
The early rally was sparked by news that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said 
all Western hostages would be freed. The report hammered oil prices and sent 
investors scrambling to buy stocks. 
</P>
<P>
But investors later took profits after President Bush and Secretary of State 
James Baker reiterated that Iraq would have to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The market's been taking some of the rhetoric on the Mideast a little too 
seriously," said A. C. Moore, a market analyst at Argus Investment Management. 
"On a closer look, we saw that the period of (the hostage) release extends from 
Christmas to late spring." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's retreat was led by IBM and by bank stocks, which failed to sustain 
their Wednesday rally. Those weak spots in the market bolstered the position of 
the bears, who argue that investors soon will turn their sights from Iraq to 
the weakening U.S. economy, and that stocks once again will be dumped. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* IBM tumbled 3 1/8 to 111 1/2. An S. G. Warburg analyst cited concern that a 
worldwide slowdown in capital spending would hurt the company's first-quarter 
profit. The analyst, David Wu, said IBM had suggested that he stick with his 
full-year 1991 earnings forecast of $10.50 a share, even though the average 
analyst estimate is $11. That caught investors by surprise, and suggested IBM's 
outlook is weakening. 
</P>
<P>
* NCR jumped 6 1/8 to 92 3/4 on speculation that AT&amp;T may eventually 
sweeten its $90-a-share tender offer. AT&amp;T was flat at 30 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* In the financial sector, most bank stocks fell, after rallying sharply 
Wednesday on expectations of lower interest rates. BankAmerica dropped 7/8 to 
25 1/4, Wells Fargo lost 1 3/8 to 58 1/8, Citicorp fell 7/8 to 14 7/8 and 
Republic N.Y. Corp. fell 3 to 47 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Thousand Oaks-based Amgen dropped 2 1/4 to 53 3/4. A Kidder, Peabody &amp; 
Co. analyst downgraded the biotech stock to hold from buy, citing worries about 
upcoming FDA hearings concerning one of the company's new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
* Oceaneering International fell 2 1/2 to 11 5/8 after an analyst expressed 
concern about pricing pressures for the company's remotely operated oil-service 
vehicles in the North Sea. Oil and oil-service stocks in general plunged on 
growing belief that oil prices will drop significantly if the Mideast war 
threat dissipates. Arco fell 4 5/8 to 122 1/2, Chevron fell 1 1/4 to 69 3/4 and 
Amoco lost 1 to 50 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Despite blue chips' weakness, many smaller stocks in particular continued to 
rise. Among Southland issues hitting 52-week highs were House of Fabrics, up 
1/2 to 31 1/8; Pinkerton's, up 3/4 to 24, and AST Research, up 7/8 to 28 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, German shares, which rose sharply at the start of trade but 
drifted lower by mid-session, rocketed higher late in the session. The 30-share 
DAX index closed 33.71 points higher at 1,504.67. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices also finished sharply higher after active trading on London's 
Stock Exchange, boosted by the news that foreign hostages will be released from 
Iraq. The Financial Times 100-share index was up 24.9 points at 2,177.5. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rallied, spurred by Iraq's accepting a 
U.S. offer for high-level talks on the Persian Gulf crisis. The key Nikkei 
Average of 225 selected issues rose 359.38 points to 22,553.10. At midday 
today, the Nikkei was up another 562.10 points. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Slip in Mixed Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices slid in mixed trading, backing off earlier highs following the 
tough talk against Iraq by President Bush and Secretary of State Baker. 
</P>
<P>
The treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield rose to 8.33% from 8.31% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term bond prices rose about 1/2 point after Hussein said he was prepared 
to free all foreign hostages. But the gains later were more than wiped out by 
what traders viewed as a hard line by Bush and Baker against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.438%, up from 7.25% late Wednesday.

Hostage Release Plan Drives Dollar Down 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against most currencies, battered by Iraq's plans to free 
hostages, but later recouping some ground as traders decided the Persian Gulf 
crisis was far from over. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar ended at 1.488 German marks, down from 1.499 Wednesday. 
In particularly choppy trading, the U.S. currency closed at 132.14 Japanese 
yen, compared to Wednesday's close of 133.63 yen.

Metal, Energy Futures Decline 
</P>
<P>
The developments in the Persian Gulf crisis continued to control the direction 
of the precious metals and energy markets. They both lost ground as the 
rhetoric by world leaders waxed both conciliatory and bellicose. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures for February delivery plunged $4.10 an ounce in early trading 
before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, livestock and pork futures were mixed, and grains and 
soybeans were higher. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $2.30 to $2.60 lower, with the contract for delivery in February 
at $373.20 an ounce; silver was 2.7 to 3.5 cents lower, with January at $4.13 
an ounce.

SY DEVORE: AN OLD-TIMER GETS A FACE-LIFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
In the Hollywood of the '50s, Sy Devore was the clothier to the stars. John 
Wayne, Count Basie, Rock Hudson and Elvis were a few of the regulars. 
</P>
<P>
Devore's was so well known that Bob Hope made the store the brunt of a joke in 
the late '50s: "In a very good year I have my choice between a Rolls-Royce, a 
new house in Beverly Hills or a suit from Sy Devore." 
</P>
<P>
Sy and his brother Al opened the original store on the corner of Vine and 
Sunset in 1944. By the end of the next decade, Jerry Lewis had the dubious 
distinction of being the biggest Devore clotheshorse in town. 
</P>
<P>
Sy and Al were gone by the mid-'70s, and the four Devore stores passed to Al's 
daughter, Marty, and her partner, Leonard Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately Marty began to dismantle her legacy and seek out a younger 
customer. She closed the original location in 1979; the Las Vegas and Palm 
Springs stores went a few years later. She centered her revival efforts on the 
remaining shop in Sherman Oaks Fashion Center in the San Fernando Valley. The 
store straddles the '80s (gray carpet/black fixtures) and '90s (natural woods 
and rough-finished metal) retail molds. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion mix ranges from Ralph Lauren's bright blanket-print bathrobes to 
Charles Jourdan's slick European tuxedos to colorful Marienbad sweaters to 
Format ties with the popular '40s hand-painted look. 
</P>
<P>
Although pricey at $1,200, the custom-made suits cost considerably less than a 
home in Beverly Hills. The off-the-rack prices are $395 to $1,000 for suits, 
and sport jackets run $295 to $795. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment industry continues to be vital to the store's well-being. 
Devore estimates that 25% of her business comes by way of television. The 
handsome gents of "Twin Peaks," "L.A. Law" and "Doctor Doctor" are costumed 
from Devore racks. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the business is doing a multimillion-dollar annual gross, Devore is 
planning her next move. She says she may add women's clothing next fall, and 
she is casting an appreciative eye toward Santa Monica's Montana Avenue as a 
possible location for a second store.

CANVASSING ARTY-GOERS

<P>
Art by Henry Matisse, Robert Longo and Andy Warhol may have been on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
But guests attending the ART/LA '90 preview party Wednesday night opted for art 
of the wearable kind by such fashion designers as Jean Paul Gautier, Valentino, 
Betsy Johnson and Commes des Garcons. 
</P>
<P>
Although the event was billed around an Earth theme, few party-goers taking in 
the fifth international contemporary art fair got the message. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing green at the Los Angeles Convention Center was a 
smattering of velvet party dresses, an occasional man's suit and a few floppy 
hats. 
</P>
<P>
Some men accented otherwise uninspired navy or gray pin-striped suits with 
"rain forest" floral-printed neckwear. 
</P>
<P>
However, many of the artists and/or art lovers took a more, well, artistic 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Engineer-striped blazers, stirrup pants, leather jackets, baggy jeans and 
vintage sharkskin suits were among the most inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Michele Lamy, wearing a prison-striped leggings and fishing for "art 
that will fit in my pocket," set the costume tone for many of the women. 
</P>
<P>
Several guests appeared to have gotten lost in a sequin supply house. 
</P>
<P>
Others opted for leggy party dresses, fitted jackets, wraparound bustiers and, 
in one instance, a cocktail dress complete with hat and feather boa. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you an artist?" one guest inquired. "No," another replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Artistic?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes!" WILLIAM KISSEL

POLITIX: BASIC STYLES TAKE A COLORFUL TWIST FOR THE HOLIDAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black is L.A.'s unofficial fashion color, but no one has let Politix in on the 
secret. At a recent show of the chain's holiday and spring menswear, color was 
rampant: olive trousers, orange jackets, mustard suits, shirts striped with 
orange, green and violet. 
</P>
<P>
The eye-popping components are aimed at both the adventurous man shopping for 
himself and Hollywood stylists shopping for film wardrobes. In response to 
"what's new?" Zareh Khederlarian, executive vice president of operations, put 
the company's studio services department, which caters to stylists, at the top 
of his list. 
</P>
<P>
"In Living Color" is one television show already using Politix's concept of 
European chic, which is definitely not geared toward the button-down crowd. 
Although there was a button-down shirt in the show -- with a collar and buttons 
so oversized they looked like a child's rendition of what Daddy wears to 
corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Politix man would wear that shirt to his office along with a sack suit, 
another spring offering. The sack, of course, "is not for the customer who 
wants a perfect-fitting suit. It's not for the Brooks Brothers man," explains 
Viken Momdjian, who with his brother, Asbed, founded Knockalong Ltd., the 
London-based manufacturing company that spawned Politix. 
</P>
<P>
"The exaggerated button-down is exactly the thing we are trying to do. Classics 
with a twist," adds Khederlarian. "It's not something our customer would be 
offended to wear. You'd be surprised, but more than 50% of them are lawyers and 
businessmen." 
</P>
<P>
Which means you might find your lawyer wearing a hooded shirt with his sport 
coat. Or he might have on a purple double-breasted suit with some of the widest 
lapels you've ever seen. Underneath will be a striped shirt -- striped, that 
is, in shades of copper and mustard. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to distinctive colors and shapes in moderate-priced merchandise 
(shirts in the show ranged from $75 to $98; trousers $89 to $115; jackets $225 
to $275), Politix is big on details. The latest round includes those huge 
lapels, jackets with microscopic back vents, eye-catching buttons and unusual 
seaming. The belts are handsomely tooled and the suede shoes, both lace-up and 
slip-ons, come in catchy combinations, including rust and green.

MOVIES: DIRECTOR TIM BURTON IS BACK ON THE CUTTING EDGE WITH 'SCISSORHANDS,' 
POSSIBLY THE MOST ORIGINAL FILM FANTASY CREATION OF THE YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Edward Scissorhands" has a lot to do with growing up in Burbank.... Not 
literal translations, actual people. But there are memories. -- Tim Burton 
</P>
<P>
His face is pale, covered with cuts and scars, dominated by yearning eyes and a 
black, sticky tangle of hair. His manner is wary but sweetly considerate, 
belying the punkish black leather he wears under his everyday garb. He could be 
an ordinary boy -- except for one thing. Springing from his wrists are 10-inch 
razor-sharp metal blades that slice, zip and whoosh through the air with 
hedge-trimming deftness and Ninja ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
He's "Edward Scissorhands" (at the GCC Avco Cinema) and, as Tim Burton dreams 
him and actor Johnny Depp plays him, he's perhaps the most original movie 
fantasy creation of the year: an icon of tenderness and artistic alienation 
that clings, stickum-like, to your mind's eye and the softest, most woundable 
parts of your mass-culture heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Scissorhands" is not as frenetic and juicy as previous Burton movies, like 
"Beetlejuice" or "Pee-wee's Big Adventure." Occasionally, there is something a 
little distant and dry about it. But it's just as daffy and inventive: a modern 
fairy tale about a bewildered young manufactured boy, complete except for 
makeshift hands, pulled from a Gothic horror-house into the screamingly pastel 
candyland of modern suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
It's part Portrait of the Artist as a Young Frankenstein, part relentless 
satire of Burton's birthplace, Burbank. And it's also part Dr. Seuss-Edward 
Gorey allegory about how middle-class America has educated and programmed 
itself out of appreciating wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, digging into his psyche with a ruthlessness that mass-audience movie 
makers usually avoid, has fashioned Edward out of the adolescent fears and 
longings that usually only emerge, bent out of shape, in confessional novels 
and bits of youth-rebel movies. And Depp has done something marvelous with the 
part. Summoning up a silent-movie grace and abandon, he has converted himself 
almost wholly into a figure of the imagination, translated the script's 
emotions with such transparency that it is the freak who seems real and all the 
human denizens of the comical flatland suburbia below who seem false or 
grotesque. 
</P>
<P>
As Burton remembers and imagines them, these suburbanites are a gaggle of 
Bermuda-shorted, back-slapping dads and chattering moms, salted with bigots and 
religious fanatics. In this conformist subdivision (we never learn its name but 
the license plates all read "Midland"), the favorite sport is telephone gossip, 
the snap response to any disturbing new event is to hold a barbecue. There, 
newcomer Edward proves handy for chopping salads or working as a human shish 
kebab -- in between his other local gigs as topiary artist, dog barber and hair 
stylist. 
</P>
<P>
Burton's satire of middle-brow America, the milieu in which he grew up, is 
devastating but never nasty. The citizenry seems to have grooved into a sapped 
conformity: glaze-eyed, glib Bill Boggs (Alan Arkin), patriarch of the family 
that hosts Edward, burbles out platitudes as if he'd been programmed by a cult 
based on TV family sitcoms. The youngsters are mean-rebellious, impatient for 
more money, good times. 
</P>
<P>
The two dominant figures are marvelous, spine-tinglingly funny caricatures by 
Dianne Wiest and Kathy Baker. Seraphic Peg Boggs (Wiest) is a cosmetics lady 
whose face lights up like a Christmas tree when she finds someone to help and 
who brightly chirps "Avon calling!" as she enters Edward's dank and shadowy 
mansion. And hot-pants Louise (Baker) is an auburn-haired virago of bottomless 
innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
Against all this, Burton and novelist-screenwriter Caroline Thompson make 
Edward a tamed Prometheus, the artist in chains. His almost slavish, rapt 
adoration of Peg's cheerleader daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), girlfriend of the 
villainous Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), is an agonized manifestation of the 
adolescent outsider's desire to be accepted. His blade-fingers are the artist's 
symbol. He can carve up wonders with them, but they also cut him up, make him a 
freak. He can't make love without hurting, can't even touch or sleep on a 
water-bed without springing leaks in every direction. 
</P>
<P>
This is the most deeply personal thing Burton has done since his 1982 debut 
cartoon, "Vincent," and, after a mass-audience monster like "Batman," perhaps 
that made him hedge a little. I admired "Edward," but I didn't find any magic 
in what should have been its most magical moment: Winona Ryder whirling in a 
drizzle of shimmering flakes, as Edward vibrantly carves out an ice-angel. And 
the lack of chemistry between Ryder and Hall damages the sequences where Edward 
supposedly goes crazy with jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
But these are quibbles. The whole film has a tender underlining and a marvelous 
fun-house look and pace. There are lots of laughs, tears and the most hilarious 
hedges and hair styles in many a moon. There's Vincent Price, like some 
benignly demonic paterfamilias, and another witty, rich score by Danny Elfman, 
whose sensibility connects as perfectly with Burton as Bernard Herrmann's did 
with Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
There's the whir of Depp's fingers, trimming a poodle, picking a lock. There's 
Wiest, Arkin and Baker, good as they can possibly be. And there's a little, 
sweet-sad moment when Edward, outcast of outcasts, sits on a curb by a waiting 
sheep dog and gently snips hair out of the dog's eyes. Gentleness is a nice 
quality to have back in movies. Along with some fairy-tale pain, longing and 
hilarity, "Edward Scissorhands" (rated PG-13 for language and violence) has it.

PARKER TAPES COME OUT OF THE TRUNK; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: RECORD COMPANY ISSUES PRIMITIVE RECORDINGS MADE BY AN AVID FAN OF THE 
LEGENDARY SAXMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charlie Parker has been gone longer than he was with us, yet every few years 
his name resurfaces. In 1955 it was the "Bird Lives" graffiti. In the '60s and 
'70s it was memorial concerts and tributes. In the '80s, countless posthumously 
issued albums. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 35 years after his death at 34, it's the story of a dual legend: "The Dean 
Benedetti Recordings of Charlie Parker." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Benedetti's recordings, long the subject of rumors, have been called the 
jazz world's counterpart to the Dead Sea Scrolls or King Tut's tomb. It was 
known that Benedetti, a saxophonist obsessed by Bird's music, had recorded him 
many times at clubs in Hollywood and New York, using a cheap portable disc 
cutter and a primitive reel-to-reel tape machine. What nobody seemed sure about 
was whether these gems still existed after Benedetti's death in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
At last, the secret is out. Mosaic Records, a mail-order company specializing 
in boxed sets of rare items, disinterred the collection, which had been lying 
half-forgotten in a trunk acquired by Benedetti's brother Rick, and bought it 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick had put the stuff in a closet," says Charlie Lourie of Mosaic, "because 
his brother's death was too painful to relate to; also perhaps he felt it could 
be something of value he could leave to his son. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1980, Bob Porter, the jazz scholar, won a Grammy for his production of a 
Parker reissue album. Rick noticed this and called Porter, but Bob was so 
skeptical about the existence of the collection that he didn't get around to 
seeing Rick for a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually Porter contacted me and Michael Cuscuna at Mosaic, and we called in 
Phil Schaap, who's a great audio engineer. All this time nobody had even 
listened to the records, but when Clint Eastwood was preparing to do the 'Bird' 
movie he heard some of them. Clint decided the sound quality wasn't good enough 
for him, but in August of 1988, Schaap went to work on the gigantic job of 
converting all those shredding acid tapes and fragile, paper-based tapes into 
usable material." 
</P>
<P>
Schaap labored for nearly a year on eliminating the sonic waste of clicks and 
pops. The Benedetti gold mine was finally whittled down to some 278 snippets, 
from a few seconds to five minutes long. The album contains some seven hours of 
the alto sax legend's improvisational genius, spread over seven CDs or 10 LPs 
(Mosaic Records, 35 Melrose Place, Stamford, Conn. 06902). 
</P>
<P>
How does it stand up musically? Despite the endless editing, the sound quality 
inevitably is pre-digital, pre-stereo, prehistoric. The 1947 Hollywood 
recordings are weakest; those made a year later in two New York clubs are 
better recorded and tend toward longer cuts. 
</P>
<P>
There is more to it than Bird's horn; here and there are glimpses of him 
announcing or directing. Even Benedetti is heard briefly, playing sax or piano, 
and a few other solos crop up, but Benedetti basically was concerned with the 
whole Bird and nothing but the Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Many songs keep recurring, and although Parker never ad libbed on them the same 
way twice, it's less than a delight to hear the "52nd St. Theme" played 19 
times. Still, "The Benedetti Records" can be recommended unreservedly to 
Bird-lorists for selective, non-continuous listening. Moreover, the 48-page 
booklet is a masterpiece of historiography, with Parker's solos transcribed, 
rare photos, and microscopically detailed essays by Schaap, Porter and Jim 
Patrick.

'DAVIS RULES' BUMPS 'CLASS' FROM ABC ROSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
ABC put its struggling sitcom "Head of the Class" on indefinite hiatus Thursday 
to make room for another classroom comedy, "Davis Rules," starring Randy Quaid 
as an unconventional grammar school educator named Dwight Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Davis Rules" will premiere Jan. 8 at 8:30 p.m. "Head of the Class" will have 
its last 1990 broadcast Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"Davis Rules," the latest series from Carsey-Werner, also stars Jonathan 
Winters. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NBC said Thursday that Bridget and Jerome Dobson, creators of "Santa 
Barbara," will return to the soap opera as head writers and creative production 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
The Dobsons were fired in September, 1987, after disputes over creative control 
with NBC and New World Television -- particularly over whether the Dobsons had 
the right to fire one of the show's staff writers. Lawsuits and counter-suits 
were filed. An NBC spokesman confirmed that those suits have since been settled 
out of court. 
</P>
<P>
John Conboy, hired as executive producer after the Dobsons' departure, will 
continue in that capacity. DIANE HAITHMAN

Emergency medicine -- A Nov. 19 article about tensions between two specialties 
involved in the care of trauma patients at County-USC Medical Center 
erroneously reported that emergency medicine was recognized with its own 
specialty board examinations only a year ago. In fact, the American Board of 
Emergency Medicine has been empowered to certify doctors as emergency medicine 
specialists for 10 years. New powers granted a year ago governed examinations 
certifying expertise in subspecialties of emergency medicine.

A resident walking behind the Dana Point Community Center found the body of a 
44-year-old county worker on a basketball court in a public park, an Orange 
County Sheriff's Department spokesman said today. Authorities said he had been 
shot repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Jimmy Lee Oxford of Perris was discovered last night on the 
darkened basketball court in a pool of blood, Sheriff's Department Lt. Bob 
Rivas said. He had been shot several times in the upper body and head. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives have not determined how long the body had been there, 
whether the shooting took place there or what the motive may have been, Rivas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That all is still being investigated," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that an autopsy was scheduled this morning but that results will not 
be available until late this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Oxford, a county Environmental Management Agency employee, 
worked at a nearby road maintenance yard, Rivas said.

The worst two-month stretch of layoffs since the 1981-82 recession pushed 
civilian unemployment to a three-year high of 5.9% in November, the government 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the jobless rate rose to 6.7% from 6% in October. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, payrolls fell by 267,000 last month, the Labor Department said, 
after 180,000 jobs were lost in October. Since June, when the unemployment rate 
was 5.2%, nearly 1 million Americans have joined the ranks of the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Practically all of the nation's industries have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
"This report looks like a recession. It walks like a recession. . . . It is a 
recession," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. "And it's 
full-fledged, accelerating and widespread." 
</P>
<P>
Added Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.: 
</P>
<P>
"This recession looks about as bad as any recession can look. . . . It deepened 
in November; the pace has accelerated." 
</P>
<P>
November's 5.9% jobless rate was the highest since unemployment was 6% in 
October, 1987. Many analysts predict unemployment could hit 7% next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The negative momentum is not yet spent. . . . We are in the heart of the 
downturn now. There is no turning back. It cannot be reversed. The question is 
how deep and how long will it last?" Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a vicious cycle going here," Brusca said. "The more people you lay 
off, the less they're going to buy, the less businesses can produce, the more 
people they lay off." 
</P>
<P>
Today's unemployment report, the government's first data on economic activity 
for November, should add to pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to cut 
interest rates to stimulate the economy, Brusca said. 
</P>
<P>
With 7.3 million Americans looking for work but unable to find it, November's 
losses hit hardest in the manufacturing sector, which has been sliding downhill 
for months. Factory payrolls declined by 200,000, the biggest one-month drop 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry alone lost 55,000 jobs, reflecting temporary shutdowns 
to avoid excessive inventory buildups. 
</P>
<P>
Construction lost 62,000 jobs as the housing market continued to deteriorate. 
Over the last six months, that industry has seen jobs tumble by about 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The service-producing sector, which until a few months ago had been enjoying 
healthy job gains and keeping the economy steaming ahead, showed widespread 
weakness too. 
</P>
<P>
Retail trade lost 70,000 jobs because general merchandise stores are falling 
short on their normal seasonal hirings. 
</P>
<P>
Health services continued to boom, adding 80,000 jobs. Over the last year, that 
industry has added more than 600,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Labor costs, frequently blamed for intensifying the nation's inflation 
problems, rose only slightly in November. The average hourly worker made $10.13 
an hour last month, up one cent from October. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, total civilian employment was about 117.3 million in November, down 
about 450,000 from October.

MAN JAILED FOR SEX ASSAULT ON GIRL, 3, FREED

A man imprisoned since 1984 for kidnaping and sexually assaulting a 3-year-old 
girl and then leaving her for dead in an outhouse pit was released from prison 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Thiret, whose release Gov. Roy Romer tried in vain to block, did not 
speak as he and his attorney emerged from the facility and got into a van. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado law requires Thiret to be set free -- no parole, no probation, no 
restrictions -- even though authorities have said they still consider him a 
menace and psychologists say he's made "minimal" progress in therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Thiret, 28, was convicted of snatching a 3-year-old girl in Sheridan in 1983. 
She was found alive three days later in an outhouse pit at a campground 20 
miles west of Denver near Genesee. She had been sexually assaulted and left for 
dead. She later recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Thiret has been at the Jefferson County Sheriff's Complex, where he was serving 
a six-month sentence for telephone harassment after getting out of the state 
penitentiary, where he served six years of a 10-year sentence for attempted 
murder and sexual assault on a child. 
</P>
<P>
Thiret was up for parole in 1989, but public pressure pushed authorities to 
continue to hold him. In May, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that because of 
the delay, under the law in effect at the time of the attack Thiret had to be 
freed -- not paroled.

Scientists at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Connecticut, a major 
drug firm, have developed an experimental drug that prevents the AIDS virus 
from reproducing, it was disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
The firm plans to begin clinical trials on the product early next year. The 
compound drug, known as BI-RG-587, has fewer side effects than AIDS drugs now 
on the market, according to an article in Science magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very specific drug which seems to be a positive. It doesn't have the 
impact on other cells in the body. It doesn't deteriorate bone marrow or other 
cells," Pat Morrow, a public relations official at Boehringer, told Reuters.

The Brazilian Congress, after the most thorough probe yet of the country's 
nuclear programs, says it has established that the nation's former military 
rulers intended to build an atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"At a historic moment there was a decision, taken within the Planalto Palace -- 
the seat of government -- to build a nuclear (weapon)," a congressional 
committee of inquiry said in its conclusions made public today. 
</P>
<P>
The military ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985, and the legislators said it was 
under the last of the five military presidents, Gen. Joao Figueiredo, that the 
government decided to make a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
The current civilian administration of President Fernando Collor de Mello has 
pledged not to make nuclear weapons.

Lloyds Bank of London is the new owner of the shuttered, 498-room Landmark 
hotel-casino a block east of the famed Las Vegas Strip. The resort closed in 
August when no bids were tendered in a public auction. 
</P>
<P>
The bank paid a reported $20 million for the property to protect a $25-million 
loan made in 1988 to former owner William Morris. The sale places a $6-million 
debt owed by Morris to Imperial Palace hotel-casino owner Ralph Engelstad in 
limbo, along with another $1.7 million owed to taxicab company owner Charles 
Frias, a bank spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Landmark hotel-casino, a space-needle shaped resort once owned by the late 
billionaire Howard Hughes, is located across the street from the Las Vegas 
Convention Center.

JAPAN DENIES U.S. ALLEGATION THAT IT'S HOARDING OIL SUPPLIES

<P>
Japanese officials today denied accusations by a senior U.S. Energy Department 
official that Tokyo has been hoarding crude oil in defiance of an agreement 
among major consuming nations to draw down stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a complete misunderstanding," a senior government official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not stockpiling." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Stuntz, a U.S. Energy Department undersecretary for policy and planning, 
told reporters in Washington that in the months after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait, Japan increased imports to meet additional demand instead of drawing 
down stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Stuntz noted that Japan imported 33% more oil in October than it did in July, 
and she said such actions raised doubts about future cooperative activities 
among consuming nations in response to oil supply shocks. 
</P>
<P>
But officials in Japan's Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry said that instead of increasing stocks as planned, Japanese 
oil companies had actually drawn down stocks. Increased imports, however, were 
needed during cool winter months to compensate for higher demand for heating 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of oil imported by Japan fluctuates by 20% to 30% every month, 
depending on seasonal factors. Every year it's exactly the same pattern," said 
one government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

FALLING GASOLINE PRICES SLOW TO REACH THE PUMP

<P>
For professional petroleum traders, prices for unleaded gasoline have tumbled 
to the level they stood at just before Iraq invaded Kuwait, but for motorists, 
prices at the pump are near all-time highs. 
</P>
<P>
If past pricing trends hold true, ordinary consumers will find that the law of 
gravity doesn't necessarily apply in the energy business. One consumer activist 
group said Thursday that for the next few weeks at least, customers of the 
friendly neighborhood filling station likely will get gouged. 
</P>
<P>
"When prices go up, they raise prices immediately," said Edwin S. Rothschild of 
Citizen Action in Washington. "When prices in these futures and spot markets go 
down, it takes a long time for the savings to be passed on. That's the way the 
companies take advantage of changing market conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry, which maintains that prices are set by supply and demand, 
says pricing is not such a simple thing. 
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute has acknowledged there are times when savings 
have not been passed along promptly to consumers, but it has also pointed out 
trends in which crude oil prices were rising at the same time the pump price of 
gasoline was falling. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has asserted that all recent probes into petroleum pricing have 
given oil companies a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
But Rothschild said a comparison of recent prices shows that consumers are 
paying too much. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning of November to December, there's been a 20-cent-a-gallon 
drop in the spot price of gasoline, and yet there's been barely any decrease at 
all in the (pump) price of gasoline," Rothschild said. "My suspicion is, if 
anything, we should now be much more concerned about oil companies ripping 
consumers off." 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the leading market for petroleum 
contracts, wholesale gasoline prices fell below 65 cents Thursday, to the 
approximate level they were at right before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and 
caused a spike in the price of oil. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest nationwide survey by the American Automobile Assn. found the 
average price of a gallon of self-serve regular unleaded to be $1.387. That's 
31.2 cents higher than the price on Aug. 1, and just 0.1 cent less than AAA's 
highest recorded price of $1.388, just before the Easter holiday in 1981, the 
AAA said when the survey was released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline was up 2.1 cents for the week, and AAA pointed out that it probably 
would have fallen a few cents for the week had it not been for the imposition 
of an additional 5.1-cent federal tax, which took effect Saturday.

At its worst, the whistle can be heard 10 blocks away, although its intensity 
depends on wind conditions, said Jerome Ross, an environmental protection 
enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
The building's developer, Ian Bruce Eichner, has been issued a summons for 
allegedly violating noise regulations, Ross said. If found guilty, Eichner 
would have to mute the whistling and pay a fine of up to $880, Ross said.

Ray Perkins interviewed for Mississippi State's football coaching position, but 
the negotiations have apparently broken off.

A sticking point reportedly was Perkins' demand for extensive control of the 
football program, according to a published report in today's Clarion-Ledger, a 
Jackson, Miss., newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, fired Monday as coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, could not be

Meanwhile, Houston Coach John Jenkins said he had been offered a blank check by 
Mississippi State Athletic Director Larry Templeton. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no bargaining," Jenkins told Houston television station KRIV. "He 
said, 'Here's a blank check, fill in the blanks. What else do you need?' For me 
to leave Houston means I'm making a statement, like a marriage to Mississippi 
State. I'm looking at a lifetime deal." Jenkins said that despite the offer, he 
hopes to remain at Houston.

LETTER SHOWS KINDER SIDE OF COBB; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: A NOTE WRITTEN BY THE HALL OF FAMER IS AUCTIONED FOR $5,225. IN IT, 
HE ENCOURAGED ANOTHER PLAYER, CONTRADICTING HIS NASTY REPUTATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
A handwritten letter that could help change the nasty reputation of Ty Cobb 
sold for $5,225 at auction. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb wrote the letter Jan. 25, 1953, to Brooklyn Dodgers first baseman Gil 
Hodges, who was criticized for going hitless in 21 at-bats during the 1952 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was auctioned off Thursday in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can make all of them eat their words the coming season and this is 
not psychology," wrote Cobb, a member of the Hall of Fame and for many years 
baseball's all-time hit leader. "You have the power, nothing wrong with eyes, 
then it has to be wrong fundamentals, stance, body balance and position, stance 
as to plate position, grip on bat." 
</P>
<P>
Cobb also wrote that "when hazing young players was in vogue naturally I 
received my share." As a result, he said, "I developed a 'feeling' for every 
young player." 
</P>
<P>
Hodges' team lost the series to the New York Yankees in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The letter's kind tone clashes with Cobb's reputation. He was described in the 
"Total Baseball" encyclopedia as "mean, vindictive, selfish, vain, a bully, a 
racist, paranoid, cruel and hot tempered." 
</P>
<P>
In 24 years starting in 1905, Cobb hit .367, with 4,191 hits, 1,961 RBIs and 
892 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb indicated in the letter that he had helped other young players improve 
their games. He wrote he had "been rewarded much only by appreciation 
expressed, also in watching box scores for evidence of better results gained by 
the player and secretly to myself enjoyed thinking I might have had a part in 
the improvement." 
</P>
<P>
He invites Hodges to write to him for three or four simple tips on improving 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb added the "only stipulation there is no publicity crediting me." 
</P>
<P>
"I have been in deep water myself and no one to help me, I enjoy helping others 
on that score alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb died in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
The auction was staged by Harmon Darvick Autograph Auctions. 
</P>
<P>
At the same auction, a scrap of paper bearing the shaky signature of the 
disgraced, illiterate baseball player "Shoeless" Joe Jackson sold for $23,100. 
</P>
<P>
While other autographs have sold for more when they appear on letters and 
documents, the Jackson signature is on a shred of paper -- just 4 by 1 1/2 
inches -- cut from a legal document Jackson signed in April, 1936. 
</P>
<P>
The $23,100 price was the second-highest ever paid at auction for an unattached 
signature; the record of $56,000 was paid for the rare signature of Button 
Gwinnett, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson hit .356, third-highest in history, during a 13-year career that ended 
when the commissioner of baseball banned him and seven other Chicago White Sox 
players for accepting money to throw the 1919 Series with Cincinnati.

CHAVEZ FIGHTS FOR ATTENTION WITH TYSON; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: TOUGH JUNIOR WELTERWEIGHT HAS TWO TITLES ON THE LINE SATURDAY, BUT THE 
CARD'S BIG-NAME BOUT PITS ALEX STEWART AGAINST THE EX-HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico's Julio Cesar Chavez, widely regarded as pound-for-pound the best boxer 
in the world, will defend his two junior welterweight titles Saturday but 
former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is stealing most of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
Many boxing fans will be focusing on finding out just how far Tyson has come 
since James (Buster) Douglas knocked him out last February to win the 
heavyweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez will defend his International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council 
(WBC) titles against Kyungduk Ahn, 29-1, of South Korea. The 28-year-old is the 
top-ranked WBC contender. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who has won five world titles in three different weight classes, took 
the IBF crown last March after a furious battle with Meldrick Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, behind on all three judges' cards, caught Taylor with a right to the 
head with less than 30 seconds left in the final round. Taylor rose at the 
count of six but did not respond to the satisfaction of the referee and the 
fight was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 24, will fight Alex Stewart, 26, in a scheduled 10-round fight at the 
Atlantic City convention center on the boardwalk of this Atlantic resort and 
gambling city. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Tyson's second fight since losing the title. He easily knocked out 
lightly regarded Henry Tillman in the first round in Las Vegas last June in his 
first post-Douglas fight. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, although a 12-1 underdog against Tyson, gained considerable 
credibility by nearly stopping Evander Holyfield in the fifth round of their 
fight in November, 1989. But Holyfield, who knocked out Douglas in the third 
round two months ago to win the heavyweight title, weathered the onslaught and 
stopped Stewart on cuts. 
</P>
<P>
It was revealed later that Stewart's hand had been injured prior to the fight 
and that during the bout he tore tendons in his left hand. In Holyfield's 
defense, he had been suffering from a bad cold. 
</P>
<P>
One of the big questions surrounding Tyson is just how much he still 
intimidates his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's 38-0 record before his loss to Douglas was built on an often awesome 
display of power and aggression, which many ringsiders believe intimidated so 
many of his opponents that they were reduced to merely wanting to survive the 
fight, not win it.

Saudi Arabia has asked the organizers of celebrity visits to the American 
troops to withdraw a visa application for Brooke Shields, an informed source 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
But the planned appearance of Shields, known in the West as an actress and a 
model, may have offended Saudi authorities who have strict rules governing the 
appearance of women. 
</P>
<P>
Most women in the country appear in public completely veiled, and the sexes do 
not mingle outside private homes. 
</P>
<P>
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Saudi Embassy in 
Washington had conveyed the request to the U.S. government and that Shields 
would not visit U.S. troops in the kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Even 87-year-old comedian Bob Hope, expected here just before Christmas, is not 
scheduled to perform. Shields has been a staple on recent Hope shows.

A British license plate spelling ELVIS fetched $132,000 at auction today. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Anson Lane, 47, bought the plate ELV 1S for the price of a small 
London apartment even though he said he did not own a car to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a leased company car so now I will have to go out and buy a car of my 
own. A pink Cadillac would seem appropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The status-conscious rich in Britain can pay the price of an average saloon car 
for the privilege of a personalized license plate, and the government has been 
cashing in by selling unique numbers that were previously withheld. 
</P>

License plates are made up of officially issued letters and figures.

LIZ SMITH: CBS' HEWITT TELLS WHY HE WALKED OUT ON PRIVATE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COMES DON HEWITT to give me his feelings on the recent teapot tempest in which 
he departed from a private party after being lectured by fellow guests on his 
and "60 Minutes" lack of "objectivity" in the airings of material on the Temple 
Mount killings in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not thin-skinned," the veteran CBS producer says. "Any viewer can rake me 
over the coals and tell me anything. But why should I stand around at a party 
and let myself be lectured by my competitors -- Barbara Walters and Mort 
Zuckerman? How objective are they? Zuckerman was named last Monday in an ad in 
the New York Times as one of the '100 Defenders of Jerusalem.' How objective 
does that make him as the publisher of U.S. News &amp; World Report? Barbara 
Walters thinks it is OK to zero in on me in public and tell me what is proper 
in news coverage. Has she ever taken her own objections to the head of ABC, 
Roone Arledge, or addressed them to her own network's bureau chief in Tel 
Aviv?" 
</P>
<P>
Why, I asked Hewitt, didn't you simply tell these people to blow it out their 
ears? "It was a nice private party. I didn't want to make a scene with them and 
I didn't want to stay there and be lectured. These competitors of CBS are 
hardly paragons of objectivity themselves." 
</P>
<P>
THE DIVINE actress Margot Kidder has called me from Vancouver to say that the 
story in the New York Post had the basics about her accident down right but 
that "I am NOT paralyzed. This kind of thing is frightening enough without any 
wild excess." 
</P>
<P>
Margot was injured in a car accident while making a TV film for Nelvana Co. The 
movie was to appear on the USA Network. Margot says she tried to go on working 
but finally collapsed and temporarily lost the use of her legs. She is in 
therapy every day, using flotation tanks and acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
Margot says she didn't exactly get a fair shake from Nelvana. "I never heard a 
single encouraging or nice or concerned word from either Nelvana or the USA 
Network. They had the nerve to say I was drunk and on drugs, then that I was 
faking my illness. I wasn't using anything, and it would be impossible to fake 
my CAT scans and spinal taps. So there is a large lawsuit in the offing." 
</P>
<P>
We wish Margot all the best and a speedy continuing recovery.

<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the rap group The Fat Boys and two members of the group's entourage 
have been charged with sexually abusing a minor at a suburban Philadelphia 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Darren Robinson, 23; his brother and manager, Curtis Robinson, 27; and a 
bodyguard, Pell Wimeley, 31, all of New York City, face a Dec. 20 preliminary 
hearing on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The three were freed on bond after they surrendered to state police in 
Coatesville on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth man, Edward Kelso of Coatesville, a friend of the band members, was 
also charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
They were charged after state police received a videotape of an August party 
the men attended. 
</P>
<P>
Police documents indicate that the videotape showed Curtis Robinson and Wimeley 
exposing their genitals and dancing with a nude 18-year-old woman, and several 
of the men watching while Kelso had sex with a 14-year-old. Darren Robinson 
allegedly recorded the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
The men say the 14-year-old and a 16-year-old companion lied to them about 
their age. They told police the girls consented to both the sex and the taping. 
</P>
<P>
The Fat Boys are best known for their comic appearances in rap films, including 
1985's "Krush Groove," and their starring roles in 1988's "The Disorderlies."

<P>
In a surprise move, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced Thursday that he 
will release all foreign hostages in Iraq and Kuwait, citing "positive changes" 
in the United States and the additional security provided by recently deployed 
Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for which the foreigners were prevented from travel has diminished 
and has been replaced by something more powerful -- a change in the American 
public opinion . . . ," Hussein said in a message broadcast by his government's 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
A complete hostage release would include more than 700 Americans, 88 of whom 
are detained as human shields at strategic sites in Iraq and Kuwait. They are 
among more than 3,000 foreign nationals still in the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration welcomed the announcement but said it would not ease 
its demand for a complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. "We've got to continue 
to keep the pressure on," President Bush said in Santiago, Chile, during a tour 
of South American capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the announcement signaled the possibility of the first real 
movement in the four-month-old Persian Gulf crisis and raised hopes in some 
quarters that Hussein is actively seeking to avoid a military confrontation 
over his occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's statement followed several recent moves that appeared to increase the 
likelihood of war, including plans to nearly double the U.S. force in the 
region and the approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing 
military action if Iraq remains in Kuwait after Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent gesture of goodwill, the Pentagon reported that Iraq has 
deployed 30,000 more troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq in recent days, 
increasing the total to 480,000. They face a U.S. force of 250,000 that is 
expected to top 400,000 by mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's rubber-stamp National Assembly (Parliament) is expected to vote today 
to ratify the hostage release. Similar proposals in the recent past to free all 
French and German hostages were promptly endorsed by Parliament, and exit 
permits were granted within days. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohammed Mashat, said in a televised 
interview that the hostages will be allowed to leave as soon as their exit 
visas can be processed and flights can be arranged. He said all of them should 
be home by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working to do that," Mashat said. "We are doing every possible way to 
make them join their families during Christmas-time." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials interpreted Hussein's proposal to include all foreign hostages, 
although a high-ranking Iraqi official in Baghdad responded cryptically when 
asked about the the hundreds of Westerners still hiding in Kuwait and in safe 
locations in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"They will regret that they have been in hiding. . . . They are not guests. 
They are something else," Information Minister Latif Jasim said at a news 
conference. "Don't worry," he added, laughing, "they will be treated like 
guests." 
</P>
<P>
In a message to be broadcast on the Voice of America radio network, the State 
Department said it has not yet received information from the Iraqi government 
on when American citizens will be allowed to leave the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making preparations to evacuate all U.S. citizens as soon as they are 
permitted to leave," the advisory said. "Until that time, stay where you are, 
stay in touch with the U.S. Embassy and monitor the VOA closely. We will let 
you know as soon as we have more information." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Hussein's proposal came 24 hours after Iraq formally 
accepted Bush's proposal to meet with Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz in Washington 
and to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad for talks with 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors in Arab capitals over the last few days have suggested that Hussein is 
preparing to offer a partial withdrawal, allowing him to hold onto a strip of 
northern Kuwait that includes a disputed oil field and two islands that block 
Iraq's access to Persian Gulf waters. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three weeks ago, Hussein outlined a plan to release the hostages in 
groups over a three-month period beginning Christmas Day if "the atmosphere of 
peace" were not disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the National Assembly on Thursday, Hussein apologized for any 
harm done to any of the hostages and insisted that their detention had served a 
useful purpose in detering a military offensive against Iraq by the 
multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hussein's letter made no reference to the pending talks between 
Washington and Baghdad, he suggested that other events have made peace as 
likely as war. Among other things, he cited opposition to rapid military action 
by Democrats in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"The appeal by some (Arab) brothers, the decision of the Democratic majority in 
the U.S. Senate and the European Parliament invitation to our foreign minister 
for dialogue . . . will have a major impact in world public opinion in general 
and U.S. public opinion in particular in restraining the evil ones who are 
seeking . . . war," Hussein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He urged members of the Iraqi Parliament "to make your just decision and allow 
all foreigners on whom restrictions were placed to enjoy the freedom of travel 
and to lift these restrictions, with our apologies for any harm done to any one 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Hussein sought to justify the detention of hostages by asserting 
that the widely condemned action had "rendered a great service to the cause of 
peace" by deterring military action in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement prompted a joyous celebration at Baghdad's well-appointed 
Monsour Melia Hotel, a "halfway house" where some Western hostages have been 
held before being taken to strategic military and industrial sites as so-called 
human shields. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel crowd included 17 American hostages, whose wives and other relatives 
arrived here Wednesday night to plead for their release, and about 40 newly 
released Japanese men whose relatives also had traveled to Iraq to seek their 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
In the hotel's dining room, which the Iraqis had decorated with yellow balloons 
and a Christmas tree, the hostages and their relatives ate a sumptuous meal of 
grilled chicken, curried lamb, split-pea soup and rice pilaf. Liquor flowed 
freely, in a celebration that resembled a New Year Eve's party in America. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about it. It's done," said an exuberant Robert Vinton, a 
Santa Fe, N.M., man who was among the 17 American men reunited with loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
But some hostages were more guarded. Said one Texan, who did not want to be 
named: "I won't believe it until we clear Iraqi air space." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph C. Wilson IV, the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, was 
equally cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"I've put a bottle of California champagne in the icebox. I'll uncork it when I 
see these people with their exit visas and on the airplane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson acknowledged that the announcement appeared to be a key development in 
the crisis. The taking of hostages was "something that should not have been 
done in the first place, and now it's behind us," he said. "So, we've got at 
least one of the key issues off the board." 
</P>
<P>
Other Western diplomats agreed with Wilson's assessment. British Ambassador 
Harold Walker, whose compatriots compose the largest group of hostages, told 
reporters in Baghdad: "It must augur well for the diplomatic process." 
</P>
<P>
Jasim, the Iraqi information minister, said at his news conference here that 
the growing strength of his nation's military force prompted Hussein's decision 
to free the hostages, insisting that Baghdad remains prepared to wage war over 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States can attack any time," he said. "We are afraid of no one but 
the Almighty. . . . We have completed all our military preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Jasim said Baghdad also had been encouraged by a 177-37 vote among Democrats in 
the U.S. House of Representatives to adopt a non-binding resolution urging the 
President to seek a declaration of war from Congress before launching a 
military offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent goodwill generated by Hussein's announcement, Jasim 
characterized Bush in belligerent terms, calling the President "an enemy of the 
people" and "an enemy of God." 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration still thinks in a stupid way," Jasim said, adding that 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has continued to "beat the drums of war." 
</P>
<P>
Asked specifically about a timetable for the hostages' release, Jasim said, 
"It's too early to ask this question." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's announcement came after a two-day Arab summit in Baghdad in which 
King Hussein of Jordan, Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser 
Arafat and Yemeni Vice President Ali Salim Bidh agreed to press for resolution 
of all issues raised by the gulf crisis, including the Palestinian question. 
</P>
<P>
The three Arab leaders issued a statement saying that their aim should be "to 
achieve a permanent and comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy 
and principles of justice and fairness," according to a report by the Iraqi 
News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pentagon deputy spokesman Bob Hall said that in addition to 30,000 
new troops, Iraq has moved 400 more tanks into Kuwait and southern Iraq, 
boosting its armored units there to 4,000 tanks. 
</P>
<P>
He said that despite Hussein's proposal to release Western hostages, the Iraqi 
leader has given no signs that he plans to comply with demands that he withdraw 
his army from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another indication that he has no intention of leaving Kuwait," the 
official said. "Putting more people in is not something you normally do when 
you intend to withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the planned hostage release would have no effect on Operation 
Desert Shield, the huge U.S. military buildup based in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>

Times staff writers Nick B. Williams Jr. in Amman, Jordan, and John M. Broder 
in Washington contributed to this report.

FOREIGNERS IN IRAQ AND KUWAIT 
</P>
<P>
Listed here are estimated numbers of foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait by 
nationality as of Thursday. According to U.S. State Department figures, more 
than 900,000 of the estimated 3 million foreigners who were in Kuwait and Iraq 
on Aug. 2 have since left. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shaded countries have sent troops to Saudi Arabia, or warships to help enforce 
U.N. sanctions.

NIEGHBORHOOD PROFILE: SOUTH ROSSMOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALLAS M. JACKSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mailing address may read "Los Alamitos" or "Seal Beach," but this 
particular neighborhood is all Rossmoor. 
</P>
<P>
The unincorporated community of Rossmoor is precariously snuggled between Seal 
Beach and Los Alamitos and nestled between public and private interests. 
Through it all, though, Rossmoor has hung onto its identity with the Yankee 
Doodle intensity of a small entity that doesn't want to be fused with its 
larger neighbors. And several of the political tugs-of-war have been centered 
on this south-end neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
One could almost subtitle the place "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," but there 
are no trains. There are planes, though -- in this case helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers considered designating south 
Rossmoor an "APZ" -- that's military talk for "accident potential zone." The 
community sits squarely beneath the takeoff pattern for the Armed Forces 
Reserve Center airfield, making it an ideal candidate for a "crash zone." The 
engineers withdrew their recommendation, however, when the town officials came 
at them in a fury, vehemently contending that kind of designation would harm 
prospects for new development and negatively affect property values. 
</P>
<P>
As for automobiles, the community battled the county and the state for more 
than a decade to get sound walls constructed along the San Diego (405) and San 
Gabriel River (605) freeways. The decibel level from cars and trucks whizzing 
by, plus the irritation of stranded motorists hiking through back yards instead 
of to call boxes, again brought out the community activism in south Rossmoor 
residents. In January, they got good news: the Orange County Transportation 
Commission had voted to appropriate $2 million for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We fight for issues. We're true community activists," said Art Becker, vice 
president of the Rossmoor Homeowners Assn. But it's not all hard-fought 
battles. There's plenty of time for relaxing here. And the hub of activity is 
the Rossmoor Shopping Center. It is a major source of sales tax revenue and one 
of the largest entertainment venues for local residents. 
</P>
<P>
It is amusing to note that the same neighborhood whose average household income 
is well over $67,000 yearly also boasts some of the cheapest movies in the 
county -- the Super Saver 7 Cinemas where feature films are "$1.50 for any 
movie, any time." 
</P>
<P>
The movies are inexpensive, so people flock to the theater, and that increases 
foot traffic for the rest of the mall, which includes a butcher, a baker but no 
candlestick maker. There's also a shoe repair, dry cleaners, hardware store, 
various clothing stores, supermarket, drugstore, a golf shop and several banks 
and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds kind of quiet and middle-American, but life is rarely dull in the 
neighborhood. From time to time, something happens to upset the area's 
calmness. The bank, Marie Callender's, the liquor store, jewelry store, a 
clothing store, Thrifty's and even Baskin-Robbins have all been hit by robbers 
at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
There were also a couple of "scandals" at the Rossmoor Athletic Club a few 
years ago that had the neighborhood buzzing. In 1985, the club owner agreed to 
a seemingly harmless arrangement to furnish patient referrals to a diagnostic 
testing firm in exchange for money in the form of lease payments. Federal law, 
however, prohibits such arrangements in any case involving Medicare money. The 
owner was granted immunity and testified for federal prosecutors the following 
year. In 1987, a fugitive and convicted sex offender was inadvertently hired by 
the club to conduct a rape-prevention clinic. He was arrested without incident 
on a Texas warrant. 
</P>
<P>
But things are fine now at the club and business is still booming. Last month, 
new owner Chris Dewire, who was, coincidentally, also the original owner of the 
club (but not involved in the aforementioned incidents), installed the first 
indoor "rock," Mt. Rossmoor, in the county for enthusiasts to scale. The 
popular 20-foot climbing wall has already increased business. 
</P>
<P>
When all is said and done, though, the quality that is most appealing about the 
neighborhood isn't the shopping, the cheap seats or the walls. Neither is it 
the homes, with their meticulous landscaping and prices flirting with the 
half-million-dollar mark. Rather, it is the way in which residents who have 
acquired wealth and position give back to the community, especially the youth. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the people in our community are in leadership roles and serve on 
boards of charitable organizations," Becker said. "We can't escape the world 
around us. We can't remain unaffected." 
</P>
<P>
The Rossmoor Bowl, for instance, treats runaway teen-agers from the Casa Youth 
Shelter in Los Alamitos to a free night of bowling once a week. And in addition 
to fights to save trees, improve services, erect sound walls or avoid an APZ 
designation, the involvement extends to working with unwed mothers, to CASA 
(Court-Appointed Special Advocates), "all the way down to grad night at the 
local high school." 
</P>
<P>
"People are involved," Becker said. "Moving into Rossmoor is not like sticking 
your head in the sand like an ostrich."

Nothing like an environmental issue to bring out vigilantes. People want free 
choice but, having made their own, want everyone else to choose likewise. 
</P>
<P>
The choices aren't always easy. A recent column on disposable diapers, for 
example, reported on the downsides of both disposable and washable diapers. 
Disposables first use up raw material (trees) and finally, space in our 
landfills. Washable cotton diapers use up water and energy in manufacture and 
use and cause more water and air pollution. "Both generate costs and 
environmental impacts," says Allen Hershkowitz, senior scientist at the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
Neither choice is clearly superior, except to those who have chosen sides. The 
clear choice is theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction of those in business is understandable. They want their 
Cottontails and Bunnies and Tushies (I kid you not) out there with Huggies and 
Luvs and Pampers, entering the competition with compostable degradable insides, 
disposable insides and washable outsides, 40% less plastic, 60% cotton and no 
detectable dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
Many environmental activists and their consumer supporters have even stronger 
convictions. Most support washables, speaking for the trees and the landfill. 
They reject any possible problems of energy and fuel and water, because some 
diaper services use only 4 1/2 quarts of water "per child per day" and run 
trucks on propane. Disposable users, they say, can easily switch. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently not. For all the studies indicating that environmental concerns are 
a priority for most Americans -- including diaper buyers -- disposables 
continue to hold 85% to 90% of the market. Even ardent advocates of washables 
continue to buy disposables, justifying the seeming contradiction because their 
child has diaper rash or because they only use disposables "away from home." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they can be unusually self-righteous, even bellicose, toward 
anyone who chooses "plastic" over its "natural fiber" alternative. Of all the 
activists he meets, only washable diaper advocates get personal, says 
Hershkowitz, demanding that he reveal and defend what he puts on his own 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Like many products, diapers present further, less obvious environmental 
considerations as well. Those wanting only washables on the market must deal 
with the use of pesticides in growing cotton and with the fact that washables 
are a worse problem in areas of severe drought. Those pushing biodegradable 
plastics must consider that nothing degrades in a dense and airless landfill; 
those pushing compostable plastics must admit that very few areas of the 
country do any composting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to make appropriate and moral decisions," says Jeffrey 
Rayport, an environmental management specialist at Harvard Business School, 
"because there are few answers independent of your local infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult even for experts. When McDonald's, under pressure from the 
Environmental Defense Fund, announced that it would switch from polystyrene to 
paper boxes, everyone immediately applauded, assuming, says Rayport, that 
"paper is better because we know what a tree is, and that plastic is bad." 
</P>
<P>
But studies indicate that polystyrene packaging is better. Such plastics can 
lighten the weight of packaging, consume less energy in production and be 
incinerated and/or recycled better than paperboard -- a premise McDonald's was 
about to start testing with a new recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
To add a further perspective: The particular material is less the problem, says 
Rayport, than "the packaging intensity." Given all the fast food Americans 
consume, it should be possible to "buy so we don't use so much packaging." Why 
use any for the 40% of McDonald's orders that are eaten in the restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the environmental problem behind diapers is the total amount of 
solid waste we generate (agricultural, industrial, mining, etc.), not just the 
16 billion disposable diapers that constitute almost 2% of municipal waste -- 
itself only 2% of the total, says Hershkowitz. Why argue endlessly -- and 
people do -- whether that's relatively much or relatively little, while 
ignoring everything else? 
</P>
<P>
The overriding problem is consumption, an economy built on, now overwhelmed by 
goods, packaging, unnecessary things. Unfortunately, they've become necessary: 
A ban on disposable diapers could cut more jobs than the preservation of the 
spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental decisions must take into account all possible effects and 
trade-offs, but who is capable of such an unbiased, cosmic view? Government 
could play more of a role, says Rayport, "disseminating technical and 
scientific information. Government also has to figure out what we should do, 
not just now but years years hence." But government agencies work piecemeal, 
and legislators are primarily political. 
</P>
<P>
Industry is even more suspect, and environmental organizations as well, each 
business having a bias tied to its fortunes. Indeed, environmental advocates 
automatically reject industry-sponsored studies, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
As the diaper question demonstrates, significant change requires consensus on 
both problems and solutions. It also requires not just little changes in 
materials, but what Rayport calls "quantum leaps" into doing things 
differently.
